C. Wong Education FoundationAbstractOptimal methods for incorporating soil microbial mechanisms of carbon (C) cycling into Earth system models (ESMs) are still under debate. Specifically, whether soil mi -crobial physiology parameters and residual materials are important to soil organic C (SOC) content is still unclear. Here, we explored the effects of biotic and abiotic fac -tors on SOC content based on a survey of soils from 16 locations along a ~4000 km forest transect in eastern China, spanning a wide range of climate, soil conditions, and microbial communities. We found that SOC was highly correlated with soil mi -crobial biomass C (MBC) and amino sugar (AS) concentration, an index of microbial necromass. Microbial C use efficiency (CUE) was significantly related to the varia -tions in SOC along this national-  scale transect. Furthermore, the effect of climatic and edaphic factors on SOC was mainly via their regulation on microbial physiological properties (CUE and MBC). We also found that regression models on explanation of SOC variations with microbial physiological parameters and AS performed better than the models without them. Our results provide the empirical linkages among climate, microbial characteristics, and SOC content at large scale and confirm the necessity of incorporating microbial biomass and necromass pools in ESMs under global change scenarios.KEYWORDScarbon use efficiency, microbial necromass, microbial physiological parameters, microbial turnover rate, modeling, soil carbon storage2040  |   WANG et Al.1 | INTRODUCTIONSoil organic carbon (SOC) is one of most important components of terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, not only because the size of SOC is larger than that in plants and the atmosphere combined (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000), but also because SOC is very sensitive and vul -nerable to climate changes, such as global warming (Crowther et al., 2016). It has been proven that enhancement of C sequestration in soil could help keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C in 2100 (Huppmann et al., 2018). At present, the processes controlling the formation, transformation, and sequestration of C in soils are still not well understood and the simulation of SOC dynamics in Earth system models (ESMs) needs to be improved (Georgiou et al., 2017; Wieder et al., 2013).The primary origin of SOC is photosynthetic primary production by vegetation while soil microorganisms are the primary agents of C mineralization, responsible for the loss rate of organic C from soil on the one hand, and the gain of organic C on the other hand via their residues (Crowther et al., 2019; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). The pool size of microbial biomass might affect the size of SOC nega -tively due to its positive effect on C decomposition (Wieder et al., 2013). However, microbes are also considered as contributors to nonliving organic C, somewhat paradoxically, because of the depo -sition of microbially derived C through biomass turnover and nec -romass production (Bradford et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). In addition, SOC could be sub -strates for microbes and affects the size of microbial biomass posi -tively. Therefore, a positive relationship between microbial biomass C (MBC) and SOC has often been found (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), different from what Michaelis–  Menten kinetics sug -gest. In order to better simulate SOC accumulation processes, the paradoxical role of microbial biomass in regulating SOC should be better differentiated and more clearly represented in the models.The role of microorganisms in decomposing SOC has been ex -tensively explored, but how they contribute to the long-  term per -sistence of SOC is less studied. The emerging view suggests that SOC not only is the direct retention of plant debris in soil through selective preservation or humification process, but also includes the sequestration of microbial necromass (Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011). Results from models indicated that the contribution of microbially derived necromass C to the forma -tion of SOC could be from 10% to 80% (Fan et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2007). Moreover, this C has been found to have different structural components and different decomposition patterns from plant-  derived C (Simpson et al., 2007; Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Therefore, the high contribution of microbial necromass to SOC could be due to their relative slow decomposition rate or the higher chance of min -eral protection from decomposition by microorganisms or both (Hagerty et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Miltner et al., 2012; Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). In ad -dition, microbial physiology parameters, such as biomass turnover rate, defined as the rate of microbial growth per unit microbial biomass, and C use efficiency (CUE) could indirectly impact SOC via their impacts on microbial biomass and necromass. Firstly, high mi -crobial biomass turnover rate means fast necromass production and therefore potentially more microbially derived SOC (Hagerty et al., 2014; Spohn et al., 2016). If microbial necromass was readily recycled into microbial biomass and decomposed, it would not contribute sig -nificantly to the stable SOM pool. However, recent studies suggest that the decomposition rate of microbial necromass could be quite low once it is protected by soil minerals and oxides (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020), making it nec -essary to model microbial necromass as a separate pool from plant- derived SOC. Secondly, microbial CUE, defined as the proportion of substrate C that microorganisms assimilate for growth out of total uptake C, has been shown to be an important microbial physiology parameter to improve the performance of model prediction of SOC variations under global climate changes (Frey et al., 2013; Georgiou et al., 2017; Malik et al., 2018). Higher CUE generally means more production of microbial biomass and other microbial products when the total uptake of C remains constant, potentially beneficial for the storage of microbially derived C in soils (Cotrufo et al., 2013). Therefore, building the connections among microbial physiology pa -rameters (i.e., CUE and turnover rate), biomass, and necromass will be helpful for understanding the microbially driven soil C cycles.Abiotic factors, such as temperature and moisture, may influence microbial physiology parameters and then indirectly impact soil C cycling processes (Luo et al., 2017). However, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the relationship between climatic fac -tors and microbial CUE or microbial turnover rate (Manzoni et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2019) and studies at large spatial scales spanning a wide range of temperature and moisture are particularly scarce. The global spatial pattern in soil MBC is similar to that observed in SOC (Crowther et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2013), showing lower values in areas with higher temperature and moisture, with the reason still unclear. On the one hand, plant C inputs are generally higher in areas with higher temperature and moisture, beneficial for MBC; on the other hand, higher soil moisture and soil respiration due to higher temperature may cause lower level of oxygen, unfavorable to most microbes (Coskun et al., 2019). Understanding the response of mi -crobial physiological parameters to climatic factors could help better explain the global patterns of MBC and SOC. To date, empirical re -lationships among climate, plant, soil, microbial physiological traits, and SOC formation are still lacking.The objectives of this study were to establish qualitative rela -tionships between climatic factors and microbial physiological pa -rameters; and to test the correlations between SOC content and microbial physiological traits (i.e., microbial CUE and turnover) and microbial necromass. In addition, examination of these relationships at the large spatial scale should be deployed to generate more gen -eral results which could be helpful for building and evaluating the global Earth system modeling. To achieve these aims, we considered soil microbial processes and their controlling parameters simulta -neously across a forest transect (~4000 km; Figure S1) and used random forest model, general linear model (GLM), and structural  13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15550 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

We hypoth -esize that (1) MBC and necromass C had positive relationships with the SOC content across the large spatial scale; (2) soil microbial CUE decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) of sampling sites, while microbial biomass turnover rate in -creased with MAT and MAP; both were important to the spatial vari -ations of MBC and SOC; and (3) the regression model representing microbial physiological parameters could better explain the varia -tions of SOC across the large spatial scale than the one without the microbial physiological parameters.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  |  Experimental designSoil samples were collected from 16 forest sites along a north– south transect in eastern China (Figure S1). These sites cover three different forest types: temperate forests (NWH, Nanweng River; BKT, Boke Tu; LS, Liangshui; ME, Maoer Mountain; CB, Changbai Mountain; QY, Qingyuan; DL, Dongling Mountain; TS, Tai Mountain), subtropical forests (BZ, Bazhong; JG, Jigong Mountain; XS, Xian Mountain; NP, Nanping; HT, Huitong; DH, Dinghu Mountain), and tropical forests (JFL-  N, Jianfengling-  natural forest; JFL-  S, Jianfengling-  secondary forest). MAT at the sampling sites ranges from −2.4 ℃ a t  N W H  t o  2 0 . 9 ℃ at DH and MAP ranges from 474 at BKT to 2449 mm at JFL. More detailed information for sampling sites can be found in Table S1. At each site, three 20 × 20 m large plots were randomly established with a distance of >10 m between each other within a 100 × 100 m sampling plot and five 2 × 2 m subplots were selected within each large plot (each corner and the center of the plot). The spatial geographical coordinates and eleva -tion of each site were recorded by GPS (eTrex Venture, Garmin). In each 2 × 2 m subplot, five random soil samples (0–  10 cm) were col -lected using a soil corer (2.5-  cm diameter) and were homogenized by hand and pooled as one composite sample. The soil samples were collected by 16 groups at the same time from August 18 to 20, 2018 (finished within 2 days). All soil samples were then placed in a box with icebags (to keep the temperature inside between 2 ℃ and 6 ℃) and shipped to the laboratory in the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences at Shenyang, China within 4 days. Fresh soil samples were sieved (<2 mm), with all visible roots being removed, and then soils were stored in a refrigerator under 4 ℃. The subsamples (the composite samples) from five subplots were mixed into a new composite sample and thus the replicate numbers for all analyses were 3 at each site. In the laboratory, one subsample (~50 g) from each replicate was incubated under 60% water hold -ing capacity at the temperature equal to mean growing season tem -perature of the site where the sample was collected for microbial CUE and turnover analyses. And another subsample was air-  dried to determine SOC content, amino sugar (AS) content, soil pH, and soil clay content. Since we were able to finish all the soil sampling and transportation within 1 week, the soil analysis and incubation experiments were done at one time for all the samples from all sites to minimize errors caused by human operation.2.2  |  Microbial traits analysisAfter preincubation (24 h), soil microbial CUE and turnover time were determined using the 18O - H2O tracer method (Spohn et al., 2016). Briefly, duplicate aliquots of 600  mg of each preincubated soil were placed into 2 ml brown chromatographic vials. For one replicate, the 18O - H2O (97.0 at% 18O) was added in order to adjust the 18O content of soil water to 20.0 at% 18O and another replicate was added the same volume of non-  labeled water. Subsequently, the vials contain -ing samples were transferred to 20 ml headspace bottles, capped, and flushed with CO2- free air to obtain headspace concentrations of CO2 to ~0  ppm. Three blank bottles without soils were prepared and processed through all steps to serve as negative controls for CO2 concentration analysis. The samples were incubated for 24 h at the temperature equal to mean growing season temperature of the site where the sample was collected. After 24 h of incubation, 10 ml gas sample was collected from each bottle with a syringe and the CO2 concentration was determined immediately using a gas chromato-graph system (GC-  7890B; Agilent Technologies). Then the brown vials containing soil were retrieved and capped, immediately frozen in a lyophilizer, and were subsequently stored at −80 ℃ until DNA extraction. Total soil DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (MoBio, Powersoil) following the manufacturer's procedures. The DNA concentration was determined by the Picogreen fluorescence assay (Quant-  iTTM PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent, Thermo Fisher) using a Microplate spectrophotometer (Infinite® M200, Tecan). The re-maining DNA extract was dried in a silver capsule at 45 ℃ for 5 h to remove any water. Subsequently, the 18O abundance and the total O content were measured using an IRMS-  TC/EA (Thermo Scientific). MBC was determined by the CH3Cl fumigation extraction method and the extraction efficiency factor 0.45 was used for calculation.Microbial growth rate, turnover rate, and CUE were calculated as per the method described by Spohn et al. (2016). Total dsDNA produced (DNAproduced, μg) during the 24-  h incubation period was calculated according to the following equation:where Ototal is the total O content ( μg) of the dried DNA extract, at% -excess is the difference between at% 18O of the labeled sample and at% 18O of the non-  labeled sample, and 31.21 is the average percentage of O in DNA (C39H44O24N15P4). The at%final is the 18O at% of soil water at the beginning of incubation (20.0% in this study). In addition, an assumption that O in new DNA only derived from water was made (Qu et al., 2020). Because of the short incubation time, the mortal -ity of newly produced 18O- labeled microbial cells is negligible in the experiments.(1) DNAproduced =Ototal∗at%excess100∗100at%ﬁnal∗10031.21, 13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15550 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Microbial growth rate (Growth, ng C g−1 soil h−1) was calculated by multiplying the DNA production rate and fDNA:where DW (g) is the dry weight of soil and t i s  th e  i n c u b a ti o n  ti m e  (h). Additionally, microbial basal respiration rate (Respiration, ng C g−1 soil h−1) was calculated by the following equation:where p is the atmosphere pressure (kPa), n  is the molecular mass of the element C (12.01  g mol−1), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314  J mol−1 K−1), and T is the absolute temperature of the gas (295.15  K). V is the head -space volume (L) of the vials. Rs (ppm) is the amount of CO2 concentra -tion produced during the 24-  h incubation period.Microbial CUE and microbial biomass turnover rate ( τ, year−1) were calculated by the following equations (Spohn et al., 2016):  where DNAcontent (μg) is the DNA content in each soil, and t is incuba -tion time in hours.2.3  |  Measurement of ASWe used ASC in soil to indicate the soil microbial necromass C (MNC; Joergensen, 2018). ASs, including glucosamine (GluN), galac -tosamine (GalN), mannosamine (ManN), and muramic acid (MurA), were determined according to the protocol of Zhang and Amelung (1996). Briefly, soil samples (containing about 0.3 mg N) were hy -drolyzed with 6 M HCl (10 ml) for 8 h, and the solution was subse -quently filtered, centrifuged, and freeze-  dried. Methanol was then added to the freeze-  dried supernatants and centrifuged to extract ASs from the residues. The ASs were reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 4-  (dimethylamino) pyridine and acetic anhy -dride, and the AS derivatives were separated on a DB-  5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) with temperature program set by Zhang and Amelung (1996). Separation of AS derivatives was carried out on an Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Scientific Ultra-  2 column (25 m × 0.2 mm × 0.33 μm) and flame ionization de -tector. The individual AS derivatives were separated by referencing the retention times of authentic standards containing GluN, GalN, ManN, and MurA. We normalized AS-  C contents by their molecular mass and calculated total soil AS-  C as the sum of GluN-  C, GalN-  C, ManN, and MurA-  C (Joergensen, 2018).2.4  |  Soil propertiesSoil pH was measured at a ratio of fresh soil to water ratio of 1:2.5 (soil:water) by a pH electrode (Leici). SOC and total nitrogen con -tent of air-  dried soils were measured with an elemental analyzer after being ground by a ball mill (MAT-  253; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Contents of clay and silt of air-  dried bulk soil were determined by the hydrometer method.2.5  |  Climate and plant biomassThe MAP and MAT of each sampling site were extracted from maps of global temperature and precipitation provided by WorldClim database (www.world  clim.org). The plant aboveground standing biomass C (AGBC, Mg  C ha−1) and belowground standing biomass C (BGBC, Mg  C ha−1) for each site were extracted from maps that were developed by Spawn et al. (2020). These data are accessible through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) DAAC data repository (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLD  AAC/1763). Finally, all maps were imported into ArcGIS (version 10.2, ESRI) and then the values of cli -mate variables and plant biomass for each site were extracted using coordinates (latitude and longitude) of our sampling sites.2.6  |  Statistical analysesFirst, we explored the relationships between SOC and C pools (MBC, MNC, AGBC, and BGBC), climate variables (MAP and MAT), soil variables (soil pH and clay), and microbial physiological vari -ables (CUE and τ). Second, we conducted a random forest analysis to identify the relative importance of a given variable compared with other variables. This analysis was run using the randomForest  (https://www.stat.berke  ley.edu/~breim  an/Rando mForests) and rfPermute  (https://github.com/EricA  rcher/  rfPer  mute) packages in R 3.5.3 (R Core Team, 2019). Third, we used GLM to examine if includ -ing microbial physiological variables (CUE, τ, and MBC) and MNC could better explain the variations of SOC than the model without them. To do this, we built three models with different numbers of SOC response variables: model A included all predictors; model B included all except MNC; and model C included all except for micro -bial physiological variables (CUE, τ, and MBC) and MNC. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the best model and the lower AIC means a better-  fit model. This analysis was run using the MuMIn  package (version 1.43.15, https://cran.r-  proje  ct.org/web/packa  ges/MuMIn/  index.html). Finally, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of MAT, BGBC, soil clay, and microbial physiological variables (MBC, CUE, and τ) and necromass on SOC. We started the SEM procedure with (2)Growth =fDNA∗DNAproduced ∗1000DW∗t,(3) Respiration =RsDW∗t∗p∗nR∗T∗V∗1000,(4) CUE=CgrowthCgrowth+Respiration,(5) /u1D70F=DNAproduced ∗24DNAcontent ∗t∗365, 13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15550 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

In the SEM analysis, we compared the model-  implied variance–  covariance matrix against the observed variance–  covariance matrix. Data were fitted to the models using both the maximum-  likelihood estimation method and the Bayesian analysis. For simplicity, the least significant path was deleted and the model was re-  estimated; then the next least significant path was removed, and so on, until the paths that remained in the final SEM were all significant. Model fit statistics include the degree of freedom ( df), ratio of chi-  square and df (χ2/df), probability level ( p), R2 (proportion of variance explained), and com -parative fit index. The SEM analysis was conducted in the environ -ment of Amos 20.0 (Amos Development Company).3 | RESULTS3.1  |  SOC across large spatial scalesFor soils sampled from 16 spatially dispersed forest sites across east -ern China (Figure S1; Table S1), the SOC content generally  decreased from northern sites to southern sites, with a range of 18.3– 108.7 mg C g−1 soil and an average of 43.6 mg C g−1 soil (T able S2). Similarly, soil MBC and ASC showed a declining pattern from north to south with a range from 0.11 to 3.78 mg C g−1 soil and from 0.38 to 2.31 mg C g−1 soil, respectively (Table S2).Across all sites, MBC and AS were significantly positively cor -related with SOC (Figure 1a,b). After removing the two points with the highest SOC values, the correlation between AS and SOC got less strong ( R2 = 0.64 vs. R2 = 0.90 with the two samples), but still indicating the robust correlation between the two parameters. A marginal positive correlation between belowground biomass C (BGBC) and SOC was observed (Figure 1d; R2 = 0.19, p = 0.09), but aboveground biomass C (AGBC) was not correlated with SOC (Figure 1c). There were significant negative relationships between SOC and MAP (Figure 2a) and MAT (Figure 2b), while positive rela -tionships between SOC and soil clay content (Figure 2d) and micro -bial CUE (Figure 2e) were observed.3.2  |  Responses of microbial physiological variables to climatic and edaphic factorsRegression analyses showed that microbial CUE was negatively cor -related with MAP (Figure 3a; R2 = 0.38, p <  0.01) and MAT (Figure 3b; R2 = 0.52, p <  0.01), but was marginally positively correlated with soil pH (Figure 3c; R2 = 0.21, p = 0.07). In addition, microbial turnover rate ( τ) increased with soil pH (Figure 3g; R2 = 0.31, p < 0.05) and decreased with clay content (Figure 3h; R2 = 0.33, p < 0.01).3.3  |  SOC models representing MBC and MNC poolsThe results from random forest analysis suggested that AS and MBC were the two most important predictors of SOC variations (Figure S3). In addition, climate (MAT and MAP) and microbial CUE were selected as the significant drivers of SOC (Figure S3). Further, GLMs were adapted to assess the importance of microbial physiological variable (MBC, CUE, and τ) and AS as predictors of SOC (Table S3). Results indicated that the full model with all vari -ables had the highest explanations for SOC (the lowest AIC value) FIGURE 1 Relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC) and those of microbial and plant pools along a forest transect.

The SEM estimated by using both maximum-  likelihood estimation method and Bayesian analysis showed that ~93% of variations in SOC could be explained by the selected variables (Figure 4a; Table S4). Specifically, MBC and AS were directly associated with SOC, while the influences of climate, plant biomass, and soil variables on SOC were mediated through microbial CUE and MBC (Figure 4). Consistent with the results from random forest analysis and GLMs, MBC, microbial FIGURE 2 Relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC) and climatic factors, soil variables, and microbial variables.

In agreement with our first hypothesis that microbial necromass is one of the important precursors of soil or -ganic matter (Bradford et al., 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2011), our study provides empirical evidence of the positive relationship between microbial necromass index (con -tent of AS) and the content of SOC across sites spanning a large gra -dient of climatic and edaphic factors, although this correlation could be a little weaker when removing two samples with the highest SOC values (Figure 1). Besides, the effects of climatic and edaphic fac -tors on SOC were mainly via their regulation on the size of MBC and MNC pools, instead of direct effects (Figure 4), confirming the ne -cessity of considering these pools in SOC modeling (Fan et al., 2021). Microbes should be considered not only as a controlling factor of the consumption of SOC in ESMs (Todd-  Brown et al., 2013), but also as an influencing factor of the production of SOC. We believe the best way to represent this paradoxical role of microbes is to establish the MNC pool and link it to MBC and SOC via microbial turnover rate (τ) and CUE (Frey et al., 2013; Georgiou et al., 2017; Hagerty et al., 2014). GLM analyses suggested that the regression modeling includ -ing microbial physiological variables (MBC, CUE, and τ) had higher prediction power than other ones without these variables (Table S3). As researchers pay more attention to microbial necromass, data on soil AS content have increased dramatically in the past 5 years (Joergensen, 2018). We believe as we understand microbial necro -mass more and more, incorporation of the microbial necromass pool into the ESMs will become possible. Overall, our results indicate that incorporation of both the “microbial biomass” and the “microbial necromass” pools into ESMs and consideration of their relationships with SOC as the ones demonstrated in our SEM (Figure 4) should greatly improve the prediction of global variations of SOC under the context of changing climate.4.2  |  Variation of microbial CUE and turnover rate across the large spatial scaleIn order to represent MBC and MNC pools in ESMs, we should know the relationships between environmental factors and microbial turnover rate ( τ) and CUE. Our study provides empirical relationships among environmental factors and these microbial physiological pa -rameters, which can facilitate future model development. Empirical observations of microbial CUE across large environmental gradients in soils are scarce (Manzoni et al., 2012). We used the 18O incubation approach and found the averaged CUE along this forest transect was 0.27, which is at the lower end range of CUE values of a global syn -thesis (Qiao et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019). The 18O incubation ap -proach has been found to have lower estimation of CUE than other approaches due to its consideration of the whole microbial commu -nity and all substrates (Geyer et al., 2019).We found microbial CUE decreased with increasing MAP or MAT from northern sites to southern sites (Figure 2), consistent with our second hypothesis. This finding indicates that microbes allocate more C to the respiration process and less C to biomass formation, consequently a lower amount of microbial residual and SOC formation in regions with higher MAP or MAT. This was prob -ably because the maintenance energy cost of microbes increased with increasing temperature and precipitation (Dijkstra et al., 2011). FIGURE 4 Structural equation modeling (SEM) for the effects of the response variables on the variation of soil organic carbon. (a) Parameters between the designed path in SEM were estimated by the maximum-  likelihood estimation method. Microbial properties include microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and microbial turnover rate ( τ, year−1). Carbon pools in this SEM include microbial biomass carbon (MBC, mg C g−1 soil), microbial necromass C (MNC, it was indexed by amino sugar content in soil, mg C g−1 soil), and soil organic carbon (SOC, mg C g−1 soil). The plant carbon pool only includes belowground biomass carbon (BGBC, Mg C ha−1). Numbers adjacent to arrows are standardized path coefficients, analogous to relative regression weights, and indicative of effect size of the relationship. Information about a priori model is provided in Figure S2.

Our finding of lower CUE in subtropi -cal areas also explains why subtropical areas were found to have lower MBC despite the higher C inputs compared to temperate areas (Xu et al., 2013). Although soil pH was previously suggested as an important factor controlling microbial CUE (Malik et al., 2018; Manzoni et al., 2012), its relationship with CUE was weak in our studied soils ( p = 0.07; Figure 3), while clay content did not really influence the variation of microbial CUE (Figure 3). Soil pH and clay  content instead seemed to be better predictors of micro -bial turnover rate than MAT and MAP (Figure 3). With the increase in soil pH,  microbial turnover rate significantly increased, probably because of the improvement in the living environment as previous studies found soil pH was the most important controlling factor of  microbial community composition and activity (Fierer & Jackson, 2006; Malik et al., 2018). Similarly, as clay content increased, mi -crobial turnover rate significantly decreased, probably due to the limitation of movement and accessibility to resources (Dungait et al., 2012). It seemed that microbial turnover rate had optimum MAP and MAT above or below which this rate would decrease (Figure 3). Besides, it should be noted that the soil samples in this study were collected only in the growing season. The microbial CUE and turnover rate may be different in the nongrowing season and further work on temporal variations of these variables is worth pursuing.4.3  |  Implication for future model developmentPlants provide the primary C source of SOM via aboveground litter and belowground roots (Liang et al., 2017; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). Our results indicated that plant belowground C biomass was more strongly correlated with SOC than aboveground C biomass (Figures 1 and 4), which is consistent with previous findings (Chen et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019). In areas with high MAT and MAP, aboveground litter is quickly decomposed and the remaining biomass might not reflect the actual C input to SOC. However, we found net primary productivity was not correlated with SOC either (Figure S4) due to the impacts of decomposition. Previous studies also suggest that belowground rhizosphere dissolved organic C entry may be more efficient than aboveground entry, due to the direct entry of C into the soil (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018). However, it should be noted that the plant biomass data used in this study were derived from modeling with a ~300 m spatial resolution, which may be incompatible with the SOC data from field sampling. More studies on the linkage between plant biomass and SOC content are needed. Nevertheless, our study re-  emphasizes the necessity to separately model aboveground C inputs and belowground C inputs (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Sokol & Bradford, 2018).In order to represent MBC and MNC pools in SEM as proposed by us (Figure 4), another important parameter besides CUE and τ needs to be studied more, that is, the decomposition rate of micro -bial necromass. Because microbial necromass may be more tightly bound in the soil matrix than plant debris due to the nature of mi -crobes living on particle surfaces (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2011), necromass C may be highly protected by soil minerals. This might explain the positive relationship between clay content and soil AS content (Table S5). However, very few studies have quantified the decomposition rate of microbial necromass and its temperature sensitivity (Wang, Wang, Cotrufo, et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, Pei, et al., 2020). Future research is needed to study this parameter and its response to environmental factors in order to better incorporate the microbial necromass pool in ESMs. In addition, whether the use efficiency of MNC by microorganisms is equal to that of plant debris or SOM is unclear and should be studied further in the future.5 | CONCLUSIONOur results supported a more nuanced perspective on SOC produc -tion and storage underpinning the importance of microbial necro-mass pool to SOC storage across a broad spatial and climatic scale (Figure 4). We provided empirical relationships among major climatic factors, edaphic factors, and microbial CUE and turnover rate, which can facilitate future model development. The better performance of GLM with microbial physiological parameters than the models with -out microbial physiological parameters (Table S3) calls for our atten -tion to the properties of microbial necromass under the changing environment. Our study provides a platform for developing a new model representing microbial necromass and for enhancing our un -derstanding on microbial controls on soil C cycling.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Ang Wang, Ying Tu, Hui Wang, Shanlong Li, and Shouren Zhang for their help on the soil sampling and Qing Zheng and Shasha Zhang for data analysis.
