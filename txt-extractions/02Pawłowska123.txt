The sequestration of carbon di oxide in the biomass of plants, especially the ones  which can be cultivated as catch crops is described. It w as shown that the cultivation of catch crops may pl ay an important role in the mitigation of CO 2 emissions. Keywords:  mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions, climate ch ange, absorption of carbon dioxide by catch crops Introduction According to the reports by Intergovernmental Panel  for Climate Change [1-3], the emission of greenhouse gases causes a climate chang e with negative consequences for earth ecosystems.  One of the reasons is the growing emission of CO 2 produced during the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production, which has been on increase since the Industrial Revolution that started in 1769 with the modernizat ion of a steam engine by James Watt, originally built in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. The se cond ground-breaking invention was the replacement of charcoal used in metallurgy by c oke in 1735 [4]. Since than the intense consumption of fossil fuels has been observed, resu lting in  a growing emission of CO 2 from their combustion. Until 1760, the global emiss ion of CO 2 amounted to 11 Tg CO 2/yr  (0.011 Gt CO 2/yr). Since then, the emission of CO 2 from anthropogenic sources started to increase. An especially dramatic growth in the CO 2 emission occurred after 1956, reaching the value of 36.8 Pg CO 2/yr in 2017 (see Table 1). Simultaneously, changes in land use, mainly caused by deforestation, also contributed to the growth of CO 2 emission (Table 1).                                                             1 Faculty of Environmental Engineering, Lublin Unive rsity of Technology, ul.

According to IPCC reports [1-3], such hig h increase in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration leads to the warming of the climate, which causes serious disruption in the earth ecosystems.   Table 2 Concentration of CO 2 in atmosphere [6, 7] Year CO 2 [ppm] before 1780 < 280.0 1860 286.0 1890 292.0 1930 307.1 1950 312.0 1956 313.7 1966 320.6 1976 331.2 1986 345.7 1996 362.6  2006 381.9  2016 404.2  2017 406.6  2018 408.5   In order to prevent the adverse climate changes, ac tions are taken to mitigate the CO 2 emission to prevent a rise in temperature by more t han 1.5 °C [8]. One of the directions is reduction of the combustion of fossil fuels and red uction of CO 2 emission by technical solutions [9, 10] on the one hand, and sequestering  CO 2 on the other [11]. Two major fluxes should be distinguished in the glo bal CO 2 cycle within the Earth ecosystem: Possibility of carbon dioxide sequestration by catc h crops  643 - absorption of CO 2 by terrestrial ecosystems in the photosynthesis pr ocess, which equals 450 Pg CO 2/yr. Simultaneously, respiration of plant and soil organisms and fires emit 435 Pg CO 2/yr into the atmosphere [2];  - absorption of CO 2 by surface waters, mostly oceans, which amounts to  293 Pg CO 2/yr. Simultaneously, 284 Pg CO 2/yr is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of d egassing.  These systems are responsible for the removal of a certain amount of CO 2 from the atmosphere. The greatest possibilities of removing CO 2 from the atmosphere are connected with  an appropriate control of the CO 2 exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. For instance, it would be sufficient to  increase the absorption of CO 2 in the photosynthesis processes by 8.2 % to completely mit igate the emission from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production pr ocesses. Taking into account the current trends of developme nt, reduction the CO 2 emission is not easy. It is inextricably connected with the sup ply of energy, which drives the development of  our civilization [12]. Therefore, i t is necessary to seek more efficient CO 2 sinks. The natural ones include the absorption in o cean waters and terrestrial absorption in biomass and geological strata. It was observed that  the net amount of the CO 2 absorbed in oceans increased from 3.7 Pg  CO 2/yr in 1960-1969 to 9.5 Pg  CO 2/yr in 2016 [5]. However, it is predicted that the share of this sin k will decrease with time, as a result of ocean water acidification. The studies carried out by Le Quere et al. [5] shows that starting from the 1960s, the share of another important sink , i.e. net absorption of CO 2 by plants, is on the increase. It grows from 5.1 Pg CO 2/yr in 1960-69 to 11.0 Pg CO 2/yr in 2007-2016, reaching 8.9 Pg CO 2/yr in 1970-1979, 9.2 Pg CO 2/yr in 1990-1999 and 10.6 Pg CO 2/yr in 2000-2009. In 2016, its value reached at 9.9 Pg CO 2/yr, which was lower than the average from the previous decade. There are further possibilities of enhancing the CO 2 sequestration, both by terrestrial, as well as aquatic ecosystems. In the case of the t errestrial ecosystems, the greatest possibilities of enhancing sequestration lie in inc reasing the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants in the photosynthesis process and mitigat ing the emission of CO 2 from soil, by slowing down the oxidation of organic compounds in soils, e.g. by applying no tillage practice.   It is predicted that the increased CO 2 content in ocean water will lead to its acidification and result in a decreased CO 2 dissolution. Within the period from 1751 to 1994, the pH of ocean water dropped from 8.24 to 8. 14 [13]. A decrease in the pH of ocean water negatively influences the ocean ecosystem, am ong others negative impact on coral reefs. Attempts are made to mitigate this phenomeno n by enhancing the absorption of CO 2 by algae in the photosynthesis process, carried out  by fertilization of ocean waters with Fe ions. Intensification of algae growth enhances the absorption of CO 2 by ocean waters and has a  beneficial effect on fishing [14].  Mitigation of climate changes by enhanced CO 2 absorption in biomass  Despite the negative changes connected with the acc umulation of CO 2 in the atmosphere, positive effects of increased CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere, leading to increased biomass production, are observed as well.  Many years of research conducted on various species of photosynthesizing organisms indi cate that the increased CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere intensifies the pho tosynthesis process [15, 16]. A 10 % M. Pawłowska, A. Pawłowski, L. Pawłowski, W. Cel, K . Wójcik Oliveira, C. Kwiatkowski, et al.   644  increase of mean relative growth rate of seedlings of Betula pubescens  in the 35-day greenhouse experiment, followed up by the increase of CO 2 concentration in the atmospheric air from 350 to 560 μmol mol −1 , was observed by Mortensen [15]. Increased biomass production in the atmosphere containing 700  μmol mol −1  of CO 2 was also observed in the case of grasses ( Lolium perenne , Cynosurus cristatus , Holcus lanatus and Agrostis capillaris ) in an 8-month experiment with the open-top chambe r [15]. Moreover, the researchers stated that the particular grass specie s varied in their response to elevated CO 2, not only in terms of biomass growth but also in spe cies composition. Significant influence of elevated CO 2 concentration was observed by Wang et al. [17] als o in the case of rice. They stated that CO 2 concertation in the range of 600-699 ppm enhanced the rice yield by 20 % as compared to atmospheric conditions. Accordi ng to Leakey [18] direct enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere is evident for the  crops with C 3 photosynthetic pathway. In the case of the crops w ith C 4 pathway (mainly grasses and sedges), the direct stimulation of their growth  by high CO 2 concentration was not observed. However, such conditions positively influ ence the plant growth in the case of drought stress that was as a result of lower stomat al conductance and greater amount of intercellular CO 2. Thus, C 4 crops can only be benefited by elevated CO 2 in the periods or the places with drought stress. Intensification of biomass growth under the influen ce of increased CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere can be considered as a factor con tributing to the mitigation of climate changes. However, it should be remembered that not all plants react the same to an elevated concentration of CO 2, and the growth of plants is dependent not only on  the availability of CO 2, but also a range of other factors, such as the co ntent of N, P, K and other biogenic elements, as well as the access to water. If a sing le factor is at an inappropriate level, the increased CO 2 concentration will not contribute to a raise in the  biomass production.  On the other hand, at higher temperatures, dead org anic matter will undergo faster mineralization in soil, which in turn will lead to an increased emission of CO 2 from soils. Accelerated decomposition of organic compounds accu mulated in soils, as a result of warming was observed by Cheng et al. [19]. They fou nd that the microbial communities in warmed soils had higher relative abundance of key f unctional genes involved in the degradation of organic materials than those in the control soils. Thus, warming can enhance decomposition soil organic matter, which can signif icantly increase the CO 2 flux to the atmosphere [20]. Increasing the retention of carbon in the biomass i n soil will be possible through the intensification of the biomass production and slowi ng the rate of soil organic matter mineralization, for instance through the applicatio n of thick vegetation cover, mulching and no tillage practices. Enhancement of carbon sequestration constitutes one  of the main tasks of regenerative (and sustainable) agriculture, also known as agro e cological farming. The aim of regenerative farming systems is to increase the soi l quality and biodiversity in farmland while ensuring the profitable production [21]. It e ncompasses a range of techniques,  i.e. non-tillage, avoidance of leaving soil uncover ed, integrating livestock and cropping operations on the land [22]. These actions aim at r econstructing and maintaining soil fertility as well as sequestering of carbon. One of  the common practices is the application of catch crops, which enhance the CO 2 absorption themselves and additionally constitute  a layer covering soil [23]. The application of catc h crops enables to increase the biomass production per unit of agricultural field. The biom ass produced in such way may be left on Possibility of carbon dioxide sequestration by catc h crops  645 the field as a green manure, which constitutes a so urce of nutrients and humus. Transformation of the organic compounds forming bio mass into long-lasting humic compounds, characterized by high resistance to biod egradation, not only improves the physicochemical properties of soil, but also consti tutes a method of carbon sequestration.  Moreover, the biomass of catch crops can be utilize d for the production of biofuels, including the biogas produced in the methane fermen tation process or syngas, bio-oil and biochar produced in the gasification and pyrolysis processes. These products constitute renewable sources of energy, which enable to reduce  the consumption of fossil fuels [24]. This influences the mitigation of CO 2 emission, because the carbon contained in the biomass used for biofuels production is captured fr om the atmosphere [25], and not extracted from deep geological strata. Therefore, i t does not add new load of carbon to the global fluxes.  Residues from the biogas and syngas production, may  also have a beneficial influence on the carbon cycle, if introduced to soil. They ar e a valuable fertilizer which improve the quality of soil and greatly contribute to permanent  carbon sequestration in soil environment. The results of the studies carried out by Cayuela e t al. [26] show the importance of this phenomenon. They analysed the fate of ten by-produc ts from energy production from the biomass, such as digestate from anaerobic digestion  of manure, first generation biofuel  by-products (rapeseed meal, distilled dried grains) , second-generation biofuel by-products (nonfermentables from hydrolysis of different ligno cellulosic materials) and biochars.  Each of the residues was added to a sandy soil in the sa me dose calculated on the basis of N rate (150 kg N ha −1 ). The soils were incubated at 20 °C. The time-depe ndent loss of carbon  in soil was measured for 60 days. The lowest losses of  carbon, ranging between 0.5 % and  5.8 % of total added carbon were observed in the ca se of biochars, a 40 % loss was noted for digestates, and for remaining residues, the los ses ranged from 60 to 80 %. The loss of nitrogen from soils was also investigated. The nitr ous oxide released from soil as a result of denitrification is an important greenhouse gas, wit h the GWP (Global Warming Potential) amounting to 265 for 100-year time horizon [2].  Characterization of catch crops cultivation Catch cropping and intercropping is consider as an efficient strategy to deal with the climate changes [23]. Catch crops are the plants cu ltivated in pure or mixed sowing, in  a period between two main crops [27]. Intercrops an d catch crops mainly include the plants with a short vegetation period [28]. Many practical  benefits for farmers, such as stable yields, limitation of weeds, pest and plant disease s, increase of protein content in  cereals or decrease of nitrogen leaching can be achieved by ca tch crops and intercrops cultivation  [23, 29]. But the appropriate selection of crops sp ecies due to the climate and soil conditions is a basic element of an effective count eracting the climate changes and to obtain the benefits for agriculture.   Depending on the sowing time, three types of catch crops can be distinguished: - Stubble crops - seeds are sown in summer, while t he crops are harvested in autumn for green forage, mowed and filched or plowed without m owing. After mowing, plants may be also left for winter in the form of mulch. T he plants which are most commonly cultivated as this type of crops include brassicas (white mustard, black mustard, rapeseed, oilseed radish, stubble turnip, Brassica oleracea  var. medullosa), legumes (horse bean, yellow lupin, narrowleaf lupin, sugars nap peas, field peas, spring vetch, M. Pawłowska, A. Pawłowski, L. Pawłowski, W. Cel, K . Wójcik Oliveira, C. Kwiatkowski, et al.   646  serradella), and other species (blue tansy, sunflow er, oat). While composing mixes, one should not include more than 2-4 plant species. At least one of these species should be adapted to the local habitat conditions and constit ute 50-70 % of the sowing rate.  The mixture should comprise the species with simila r length of the vegetation period and application [28].  - Undersown crops - spring cereals sown in spring o r, rarely, sown with winter cereals. They are used similarly to stubble crops in autumn (fodder, green forage biomass, mulch). The most common undersown crops include: sm all seeded Fabaceae (red clover, white clover, black medick, serradella), th eir mixtures with grasses, as well as grasses alone ( Lolium westerwoldicum,  orchard grass, perennial ryegrass, annual ryegrass, tall oat-grass).  - Winter catch crops - sown at the break of August and September and harvested in spring of the next year. The plants cultivated afte r their harvest are called secondary crops (e.g. potato, corn). Winter catch crops are c ategorized in accordance to their harvest period: early (winter agrimony, winter rape seed), intermediate (winter rye, winter rye + hairy vetch, winter rye + hairy vetch + crimson clover), late ( Lolium westerwoldicum , crimson clover, perennial ryegrass + winter vetch  + crimson clover, annual ryegrass + winter vetch + crimson clover, pe rennial ryegrass + winter vetch, winter wheat + winter vetch) [27, 28]. The average yield of biomass (dry mass - d.m.) of t he plants cultivated as catch crops in central Lubelskie Voivodeship, which is situated  in temperate climate zone, with greater precipitation than evaporation, characterized by th e average annual ambient temperature of ca  7.6 °C, and mean precipitation of 540 mm [30] rang es from 2.64 to 4.26 Mg d.m./ha (Table 3). White mustard presented the highest biom ass yield per hectare. Carbon constitutes approximately 43 % of the dry biomass i n the above-ground parts of the plants presented in Table 3. This carbon can be contained for a longer time in a soil ecosystem, provided that biomass is used as green manure. The amount of carbon that remains in soil permanently and will not be released into the atmos phere in the form of CO 2 depends mainly on the soil and climate conditions, such as porosity, humidity, temperature, etc.; these factors are also decisive in terms of what pa rt of the root biomass remaining in soil will be transformed into humic compounds.

In the last years, the interest in growing these crops has been on the constant increase among  farmers. Assessment of catch crops role in terms of mitigation of carb on dioxide emissions in Poland Approximately 7.5 million hectares of cereals are c ultivated in Poland [35]. This area is suitable for catch crops cultivation. Therefore,  if catch crops were cultivated over the entire area, it would be possible to increase the a nnual absorption of CO 2 from  30.8 Tg CO 2/year to 49.8 Tg CO 2/yr, achieving the biomass production ranging from  19.8 Tg d.m./yr to 32.0 Tg d.m./yr (assuming the bi omass yield given in Table 3).  The biomass can be used as a substrate for green en ergy production. The studies on methane fermentation process indicated that the eff iciency of methane generation ranged from 222 to 450 m 3/Mg of volatile solids (VS), depending on the catch  crop species  [36, 37]. Assuming the average total solid and VS c ontents equal to 25 and 90 % respectively, the VS mass of the crops ranged from 17.8 to 28.8 Tg/yr. This amount of the biomass would be sufficient to produce from 4.0 · 1 0 9 to 13.0 · 10 9 m3 of the methane per year. The methane yield of raw biomass is estimated  at 50 to 101 m3/Mg and the methane yields per hectare at 685 to 1384 m3/ha.  The produced biomass can also be utilized for other  purposes, e.g. production of biochar and syngas in the pyrolysis or gasification  processes. Assuming the average biomass conversion during slow pyrolysis to biochar , bio-oil, and syngas at 30, 40 and  30 %, respectively [38] the catch crops produced in  Poland biomass could be converted to about 5.9-9.6 Tg of biochar, 7.9-12.8 Tg  of bio-oi l and 5.9-9.6 Tg of syngas. The syngas and bio-oil can be converted to energy and the bioc har can be applied to soils, which enables long-term carbon sequestration, estimated e ven at 200 years [39], what would help to mitigate climate changes. These changes make a s erious global problem, which can be alleviated only by  developing multidimensional sol utions [40, 41]. Conclusions Cultivation of catch crops enables to increase the sequestration of CO 2 in the agriculture sector. Assuming that all the surface a rea used for cereals cultivation in Poland, which equals 7.5 million hectares, will be allocate d for catch cropping, from 4.11 to  6.64 Mg CO 2/yr can be absorbed per one hectare of the cultivat ed crops, depending on the plant species. Simultaneously, catch crops cultivat ion allows producing from 4.46 to  7.20 Tg/yr of biomass, which may be used for green energy production, either by the generation of biogas in the anaerobic digestion pro cess or syngas in thermochemical processes. Additionally, the residues obtained in t hese processes, such as digestate and biochar can be applied as valuable fertilizers or s oil conditioners.
