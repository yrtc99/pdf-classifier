Excessive nitrogen (N) application is an important ﬁeld management measure in tea plan-tation systems. However, the mechanism underlying the impact of N fertilization on SOC, especially the microscopicmechanism remain unclear. The present study explored the effects of N fertilization on C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes and microbes expressing these enzymes by using a metagenomic approach in a tea plantationunder long-term fertilization with different N rates. Results showed that N application signi ﬁcantly changed the abun-dance of C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes, especially those associated with labile and recalcitrant C degrada-tion. In addition, the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities showed a signi ﬁcant differenceunder different N rates. At the phylum level, microbial taxa involved in C degradation were highly similar and abun-dant, while at the genus level, only speci ﬁc taxa performed labile and recalcitrant C degradation; these SOC-degradingmicrobes were signi ﬁcantly enriched under N application. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the soil andpruned litter properties greatly in ﬂuenced the SOC-degrading communities; pH and DOC of the soil and biomassand total polyphenol (TP) of the pruned litter exerted signi ﬁcant effects. Additionally, the random forest (RF) algo-rithm revealed that soil pH and dominant taxa ef ﬁciently predicted the beta-glucosidase abundance, while soil pHand DOC, pruned litter TP, and the highly abundant microbial taxa ef ﬁciently predicted chitinase abundance.

IntroductionSoil organic carbon (SOC) is an important indicator of soil fertility andplays a critical role in maintaining soil quality ( Lal, 2004 ;Yang et al.,2020 ). Even slight changes in SOC in ﬂuence carbon dioxide (CO 2) emis-sions, potentially exacerbating global climate change ( Lal, 2018 ). In addi-tion, anthropogenic activities, such as fertilization, considerably impactsoil C pools ( Álvaro-Fuentes et al., 2012 ). Therefore, understanding how ag-ricultural management practices in ﬂuence SOC dynamics is signi ﬁcant forimproving soil fertility and predicting climate change. Multiple factors,such as exogenous C input, affect soil C dynamic, probably due to the im-pact on SOC-degrading microbes ( Chowdhury et al., 2021 ). As the majorC source, exogenous C input not only provides food and energy for soil mi-crobes ( Preece and Peñuelas, 2020 ) but also potentially in ﬂuence (positiveand negative priming effect) native soil organic C ( Prommer et al., 2020 ),leading to disrupting the SOC balance. In addition, meteorological condi-tions, such as mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipita-tion (MAP), also affect soil C balance ( Jian et al., 2020 ) due to the effect onthe microbes involved in soil C cycling.Microorganisms are vital in mediating biogeochemical cycles, espe-cially the functional microorganisms, could perform some speci ﬁc pro-cesses, such as C-, N-, P- and S-cycling nutrient cycles ( Wang et al., 2018 ).In the process of terrestrial C cycling, beta-glucosidase and chitinase werethe key enzymes performing the labile and recalcitrant C degradation.These enzymes were generally produced by speci ﬁc microbes, and exerteda signi ﬁcant impact on SOC dynamics by the catabolic and anabolic pro-cesses, especially the SOC degradation. Evidence shows that agriculturalmanagement measures, such as N fertilization, in ﬂuence soil native C,exerting a positive, negative, or even null effect on total SOC accumulation(Fang et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2021 ). Previous studies mainly focused onAbbreviationsSoil propertiesDOC dissolved organic carbonMBC microbial biomass carbonSOC soil organic carbonPruned litter propertiesTC total carbonTCF total crude ﬁberTP total polyphenolsTSC total soluble carbohydratesBiomass the biomass of pruned tea litterC-cycling gene groupsGHs glycoside hydrolasesGTS glycosyl transferasesCEs carbohydrate esterasesAAs auxiliary activitiesPLs polysaccharide lyasesCBMs carbohydrate-binding modulessoil C composition and enzyme activities ( Jian et al., 2016 ;Chen et al.,2018 ;Wang et al., 2018 ). However, the responses of the microbial func-tional traits, such as C-cycling groups, at the genetic level to N additionhave attracted little attention; moreover, the results on the response of mi-crobial functional traits to N rates are inconsistent. For example, Jing et al.(2021) revealed that labile C-degrading genes were signi ﬁcantly stimulatedonly under low N addition. Wei et al. (2018) reported abundant C-cyclinggenes at a 450 kg ha−1N rate in agricultural ecosystems, whereasEisenlord et al. (2013) observed that 3 g N m−2y−1led to a signi ﬁcant de-crease in C-cycling genes at sites with low ambient N deposition in the hard-wood forests of North America. These differences between studies wererelated to the initial N status of the soil, which differs among the ecosys-tems, and different N rates ( Guo et al., 2017 ). In summary, the mechanismunderlying the effect of N fertilization on SOC, such as C-cycling genes,SOC-degrading enzymes and the microbes expressing these enzymes, re-mains unclear. Therefore, understanding the response of SOC-degradationenzymes and associated functional communities to ﬁeld management strat-egies, especially N fertilization, is crucial for predicting soil C loss in agricul-tural systems.Tea ( Camellia sinensis L.) plantation is widely distributed in the tropicaland subtropical acidic regions with soil pH <4.5 (Ruan et al., 2010 ). High Nfertilizer rates and periodic pruning for obtaining desirable yields and highleaf amino acid content are the major features of these tea plantations. Ac-cording to our previous investigation, nearly 500 kg of pure N per hectare isapplied to plantations across the main tea-producing areas of China eachyear ( Ni et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the harvested area of tea plantation in2020 of China has reached 3,365,697 ha (2020 FAO, https://www.fao.org/home/en ). All these factors have the potential relationship with soilC loss. Therefore, soil C sequestration is essential for maintaining soil fertil-ity and coping with global climate change, which demands understandinghow N fertilization impacts soil C cycling, especially SOC degradation, intea plantation systems.Previous studies on SOC dynamics in tea plantations primarily focusedon the changes in total organic C and its driving factors. For example, Sunet al. (2020) identi ﬁed soil N and oxalic acid extractable iron as the impor-tant environmental variables leading to SOC changes in the tea plantationsof Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. Besides, land use is an important factor affect-ing C storage. Ma et al. (2022) recently showed that the conversion of sec-ondary forests to tea plantations reduced the content of soil microbialnecromass C, which was not conducive to SOC accumulation. Moreover,N fertilization in a tea plantation system maintains and improves soil fertil-ity, including SOC accumulation. However, the mechanism underlying theimpact of N fertilization on SOC dynamics, the microscopic mechanism,such as the SOC degrading enzymes and microbes expressing these en-zymes in tea plantation soil remains unclear.Therefore, the present study explored the effects of N application on C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes and microbes expressing these en-zymes in a tea plantation under long-term fertilization with different Nrates. The study assessed the relationship between soil and pruned litterproperties, C-cycling gens, SOC-degrading enzymes, and microbes express-ing these enzymes. The objectives of this study were to (i) explore the re-sponse of soil C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes and associatedmicrobes to long-term N fertilization, (ii) identify the driving factors affect-ing beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities, and(iii) predict the factors driving the abundance of beta-glucosidase andchitinase associated with labile and recalcitrant C degradation. The study'sﬁndings will deepen our understanding of the in ﬂuence of long-term Nfertilization on C-cycling genes, SOC-degrading enzymes and microbes ex-pressing SOC-degrading enzymes in a tea plantation. The study will provideX. Yang et al. Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592312a new perspective for improving soil fertility and predicting C storage in aperennial teaplantation ecosystem.2. Materials and methods2.1. Site descriptionThe long-term experiment was initiated in 2005 at Hangzhou, Zhejiang,China (120°05 ′E, 30°10 ′N, elevation 60 m). The area is characterized by atypical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature (MAT) of17.0 °C and precipitation (MAP) of 1533 mm. The soil of this region hasbeen classi ﬁed as an Alisol based on the WRB soil classi ﬁcation system(IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015 ). The soil had an initial pH (H2O) of4.16, organic C of 7.83 g kg−1,t o t a lNo f1 . 3 9gk g−1, available phosphorusof 25 mg kg−1, and available potassium of 76 mg kg−1. The domestic teaclone Longjing-43 was cultivated in this region in single rows (150 cmbetween rows and 33 cm between plants) at a density of 60,000 plantsha−1.2.2. Experimental designThe experiment was implemented in a randomized design with four Nfertilizer rates (N0, N119, N285, and N569; 0, 119, 285, and 569 kg Nha−1yr−1, respectively); four replicates were maintained per treatment,with a plot area of 24 m2per replicate, creating 16 plots. The N fertilizerurea (46 % pure N) was applied four times a year in early February (30%), late May (20 %), early July (20 %), and late October (30 %) based onthe nutrient demand of tea plants. Phosphorus (superphosphate) and potas-sium (sulfate of potash) fertilizers were applied in late October as the basefertilizer for all treatment plots based on soil testing. All fertilizers weremanually incorporated into temporarily plowed furrows (15 cm widthand 15 depth) and covered with soil. Pruning practices were carried outin late April and July, and the pruned litter was returned entirely to thetea plantation.2.3. Sampling of soil and pruned tea litterIn May 2017, after the spring tea harvest, surface soils from a depth of0–20 cm were collected using a pre-cleaned stainless steel hand sampler(inner diameter 5 cm). Samples collected from 16 randomly selected loca-tions in a plot were pooled to obtain each replicate sample. Large stones,plant residues, and visible roots were removed manually, and the soil sam-ple was passed through a 2 mm sieve and subsampled into two parts. Onepart was stored at −80 °C for molecular analysis; the second part was im-mediately used to determine the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and mi-crobial biomass carbon (MBC) and then air-dried to determine theremaining soil properties, including pH. Meanwhile, pruned litter was col-lected immediately after pruning; pruner litter of length 1 m was selected toestimate biomass for each hectare. Meanwhile, for chemical analysis,pruned litter, including twigs and leaves, was collected from each plot,oven-dried, and ground. We analyzed the soil and pruned litter propertiesfollowing the methods described in our previous study ( Yang et al., 2019 ).2.4. DNA extraction, library construction, and metagenomic sequencingDNA was extracted from the soil sample using the MoBio PowerSoilDNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer'sprotocol. The concentration and quality of the extracted DNA were assessedwith a TBS-380 Fluorometer (TurnerBioSystems, USA) and NanoDrop 2000(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, USA). The quality of DNA was veri ﬁed on a 1 %agarose gel. High-quality DNA samples were then sent to the Majorbio Bio-medical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for shotgun metagenomicssequencing.The DNA was fragmented to approximately 300 bp with a Covaris M220ultrasonicator (Gene Company Limited, China), and the paired-end librarywas constructed with the TruSeq ™DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, SanDiego, CA, USA). The blunt-end DNA fragments were ligated with adapterscontaining the complete complementary sequencing primer hybridizationsites. Finally, paired-end sequencing was performed using HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit and HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS Kit on an IlluminaHiSeq4000 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) as per the manufacturer's in-structions ( www.illumina.com ). The metagenome sequences have been de-posited in the NCBI database under the accession number PRJNA559847.2.5. Data processingThe clean reads were generated from the raw reads in fastq format byremoving the adapter sequences and low-quality bases (length <50 bp orquality value <20 or having N bases). SOAPdenovo, a De Bruijn graph-based assembler, was used to assemble the short reads. Further, we checkedfor K-mers with ⅓–⅔the read length in each sample. Coverage scaffoldswith a length >500 bp were retained for subsequent statistical tests, andthe quantity and quality of scaffolds generated by each assembly were eval-uated. The best K-mer, which yielded the minimum scaffold number andthe maximum N50 and N90 values, was selected. Finally, the scaffoldswith a length >500 bp were extracted, broken into contigs without gaps,and used for further gene prediction and annotation.2.6. Gene prediction, taxonomy, and functional annotationThe contigs' open reading frames (ORFs) and annotations were pre-dicted with MetaGene Annotator ( http://metagene.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ ).The predicted ORFs with length >100 bp were retained and translated toamino acid sequences via NCBI ORF ﬁnder, followed by annotation usingBLASTP (BLAST Version 2.2.28+, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against the NCBI-NR database, including SwissProt. The optimized e-value threshold was set as 1e−5for BLAST alignment.All sequences from the gene sets with a 95 % sequence identity (90 %coverage) were clustered to obtain the non-redundant gene catalog usingthe CD-HIT program ( http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/ ). Readsafter quality control were mapped to the representative genes with 95 %identity using SOAPaligner, and gene abundance in each sample was eval-uated. Representative sequences of the non-redundant gene catalog wereannotated based on the NCBI-NR database using the BLASTP alternativein Diamond (Version 0.8.35, http://www.diamondsearch.org/index.php ),with an e-value cutoff of 1e−5. Alpha diversity of beta-glucosidase andchitinase-expressing microbial communities were calculated to determinethe community richness and diversity using the Mothur software. Thecarbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) annotation was conducted usinghmmscan ( http://hmmer.janelia.org/search/hmmscan ) against the data-base ( http://www.cazy.org/ ) with an e-value cutoff of 1e−5.T h eK y o t oE n -cyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Version 94.2, http://www.genome.jp/keeg/ ) annotation was conducted using Diamond against thedatabase with an e-value cutoff of 1e−5. This study analyzed sequencingdata using Majorbio Cloud ( www.majorbio.com ), a comprehensive bioin-formatics platform ( Ren et al., 2022 ).2.7. Statistical analysisOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with Duncan's posthoc test was used to compare the C-cycling genes, microbial diversity,and community composition under four N rates. Nonlinear regression de-scribed the relationship between the N rates and the C-cycling genes, func-tional gene diversity, and microbial diversity. Principal coordinate analysis(PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was performed to explore thesimilarities in the microbial communities carrying the C-cycling genesand the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities,and the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)to assess the effects of different N rates on C-cycling genes and beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities.X. Yang et al. Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592313Redundancy analysis (RDA) explored the correlation between the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities and the soiland pruned litter properties. Variance partition analysis (VPA) dissectedthe relative contributions of soil and pruned litter properties to the changesin soil beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities.PERMANOVA test identi ﬁed the individual variables affecting the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities. Finally, a ran-dom forest (RF) algorithm was used to determine the most important vari-ables associated with soil, pruned litter, and speci ﬁc microbial taxa topredict the abundance of beta-glucosidase and chitinase.All statistical analyses were conducted in R (Version 4.0.1). We appliedthe ‘stats ’package for one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation analysis, andsimple regression analysis, the ‘vegan ’package for PCoA, RDA, andPERMANOVA, and the ‘randomforest ’package for RF.3. Results3.1. Soil C-cycling functional genesBased on the CAZyme database, 196C-cycling genes were identi ﬁedwith a frequency >75 % and a signi ﬁcant response ( p<0.05) of thesegenes to N application. PCoA showed that the C-cycling genes were signif-icantly different under various N rates (R2=0 . 7 7 , p<0.001; Fig. S1). TheN application signi ﬁcantly changed the diversity of the C-cycling genes;however, the richness and diversity indices of these C-cycling genes showedopposite trends (Fig. S2). The Chao1 index of C-cycling genes decreasedwith increasing N rates, while the Shannon index decreased. In addition,the quadratic regression explained the relationship between the diversityindices of the C-cycling genes and the N rates (Fig. S2).The C-cycling genes were grouped into six categories, includingglycoside hydrolases (GHs), glycosyl transferases (GTs), carbohydrate es-terases (CEs), auxiliary activities (AAs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), andcarbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), based on their speci ﬁc functions;these six genes groups were detected in the following decreasing order ofrelative abundance in: GHs >GTs>CEs>AAs>CBMs >PLs ( Fig. 1 ). De-tailed analysis revealed that N application signi ﬁcantly changed the relativeabundance of the six functional gene categories; the abundance of mostgenes decreased signi ﬁcantly with increasing N rates, while only that ofGHs and AAs increased. Meanwhile, the quadratic regression describedthe relationship between N rates and the C-cycling genes (R2=0.63 –0.76, p<0.01), except for CBMs and PLs because of less correlationwith N rates.Subsequent correlation analysis to explore the association between soiland pruned litter properties and C-cycling gene abundance and diversity in-dices revealed strong correlations of these C-cycling genes, except for PLs,with soil pH and DOC (Fig. S3); these genes negatively correlated withsoil pH but positively with DOC. The GHs, GTs, CEs, AAs, and CBMs posi-tively correlated with the biomass of pruned litter; however, the PLsshowed no signi ﬁcant correlation with the pruned litter properties.Among the diversity indices, the Chao1 index of C-cycling genes positively3536373839Relative abundance (%) 3132333536373839Relative abundance (%) 31323318.018.519.019.520.0Relative abundance (%) 4.55.017.518.018.519.019.520.0Relative abundance (%) 4.04.55.05.56.05.75.96.16.36.5N0 N119 N285 N569N application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)Relative abundance (%) 1.01.11.21.31.4N0 N119 N285 N569N application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)5.65.86.06.26.40 100 200 300 400 500 600N application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)Relative abundance (%) 1.01.11.21.31.40 100 200 300 400 500 600N application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)glycoside hydrolases (GHs)carbohydrate-binding moduue (CBMs)glycosyl transferases (GTs)carbohydrate esterases (CEs) auxiliary activities (AAs)polysaccharide lyases (PLs)glycoside hydrolases (GHs) glycosyl transferases (GTs)carbohydrate esterases (CEs) auxiliary activities (AAs)carbohydrate-binding moduue (CBMs) polysaccharide lyases (PLs)aabcabbc cabcca abcaababbabbbadjusted R2=0.73p=1.7e-5adjusted R2=0.63p=1.5e-4adjusted R2=0.76p=5.8e-6adjusted R2=0.63p=1.5e-4adjusted R2=0.09p=0.14adjusted R2=0.20p=0.049(A) (B)Fig. 1.

Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592314correlated with soil pH and TP, while the Shannon index negatively corre-lated with soil pH but positively with DOC. The diversity indices showed nosigniﬁcant correlation with the other pruned litter properties (Fig. S3).3.2. Functional genes involved in SOC degradationAmong the six types of C-cycling genes, GHs demonstrated the highest rel-ative abundance (37.43 %; Fig. 1 A). We identi ﬁed 71 genes encoding GHs,which perform SOC degradation; howev er, only the top 20 genes were listedin our study. Detailed analysis revealed that N application signi ﬁcantly in-creased the abundance of GH genes ( Fig. 2 ). Additionally, the GH genes sig-niﬁcantly correlated with soil pH and DOC (Fig. S4); the GHs negativelycorrelated with soil pH but posit ively with DOC. However, no signi ﬁcant cor-relation was detected between the GHs and other soil properties. Among thepruned litter properties, biomass posit ively correlated with most genes of theGH family, while TP negatively correlated with a few genes. The GHs showedno signi ﬁcant correlation with any other pruned litter property.3.3. Diversity and composition of microbial communities involved in SOCdegradationCarbon degradation is the main proces s leading to soil C loss. The presentstudy focused on two key genes of the GH family, GH3 and GH18, encodingbeta-glucosidase and chitinase, respect ively, which degrade labile and recal-citrant C ( Fig. 2 ). The absolute abundance of both beta-glucosidase andchitinase signi ﬁcantly increased with increasing N rates ( Fig. 2 ). Meanwhile,the relative abundances of beta-glucos idase and chitinase correlated consid-e r a b l yw i t hp Ha n dD O Co fs o i la n db i o m a s sa n dT Po fp r u n e dl i t t e rb u tn o twith any other soil and pruned litter properties (Fig. S5).The PCoA results showed a signi ﬁcant different of the beta-glucosidaseand chitinase-expressing microbial communities with increasing N rates.The community structures of microbes (at the genus level) carrying thebeta-glucosidase and chitinase coding genes differed signi ﬁcantly amongthe N levels (PERMANOVA test: R2= 0.65, p<0.001 and R2=0 . 5 9 , p<0.001; Fig. 3 ). In the plot, the ﬁrst and second axes explained 72.55 % and64.43 % of the total variance in beta-glucosidase ( Fig. 3 A) and chitinase ex-pressing microbial communities ( Fig. 3 B). Soil samples under low N (N0and N119) and high N treatments (N285 and N569) were clearly separatedalong the ﬁrst axis. Further analysis showed no difference in the Chao1index of beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbes under differentN levels. Meanwhile, N application signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced the Shannonindex; the Shannon index of beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing mi-crobes decreased substantially with in creasing N rates (Fig. S6). Likewise, aquadratic regression ﬁtted only the Shannon index with the different N rates.Taxonomic annotation identi ﬁed that similar taxa at the phylum levelexpressed beta-glucosidase and chitinase ( Fig. 4 A, B). The dominant phylacarrying these genes were Acidobacteria (34.92 % vs. 36.09 %),Proteobacteria (27.71 % vs. 25.48 %), Actinobacteria (19.37 % vs.20.61 %), Chloro ﬂexi (5.68 % vs 4.26 %), and Bacteroidetes (4.78 % vs.3.13 %), which together accounted for 92.46 % –89.57 % of the microbes.Moreover, N application signi ﬁcantly affected the beta-glucosidase-expressing microbial taxa at the phylum level (Fig. S7A); the abundance ofGH92GH42GH18GH127GH35GH51GH57GH20GH38GH28GH39GH29GH78GH2GH31GH15GH23GH3GH109GH74N0 N119 N285 N569aaa ba ab bc caa b ccbaacbaaaa b b ccbaacb a ac b a ac b aaaa ab baa b bc caa b ca ab b ca bb caa b ca ab bc caa b caa a ba b bc cN application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) (A)1.52.02.53.0Absolute abundance (read numbers x104)1234N0 N119 N285 N569Absolute abundance (read numbers x103)N application rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1)Beta-glucosidaseChitinase(B)(C)aabcabbcFig. 2.

However, N application didnot in ﬂuence the abundance of Chloro ﬂexi, Armatimonadetes, andcandidate_division_NC10. Similar to the beta-glucosidase-expressing micro-bial communities, the abundance of the eight chitinase-expressing microbialtaxa increased signi ﬁcantly with increasing N rates; however, Chloro ﬂexi andNitrospirae did not respond to N application (Fig. S7B).Subsequent taxonomic annotation of microbes associated with beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities at the genuslevel identi ﬁed 25 beta-glucosidase-expressing genera with a relativeabundance >1 %. The top ﬁve taxa identi ﬁed in the decreasing order ofrelative abundance were Silvibacterium ,Acidobacterium ,Streptomyces ,Rhodanobacter ,a n d Thermogemmatispora (Fig. 4 C). Among the top tentaxa, Thermogemmatispora andKtedonobacter showed no signi ﬁcant differ-ence among the N application rates, while the other eight displayed an in-crease in abundance with increasing N rates (Fig. S7C). A total of 13genera with relative abundance >1 % were identi ﬁed as associated withchitinase. The top ﬁve taxa in the decreasing order were Rhodanobacter ,Streptacidiphilus ,Stenotrophomonas ,Acidobacterium ,a n d Ktedonobacter(Fig. 4 D). Except for Ktedonobacter , the other nine taxa increased with in-creasing N rates (Fig. S7D).3.4. Relationship between microbial communities involved in SOC degradationand soil and pruned litter propertiesThe present study used RDA to assess the effects of soil and pruned litterproperties on the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing communities.Theﬁrst two axes from RDA explained 55.30 % and 46.50 % of the totalvariation in the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbialcommunities, respectively ( Fig. 5 A, B). PERMANOVA test revealed thatsoil pH (R2=0 . 5 6 , p=0 . 0 0 1a n dR2=0 . 5 2 , p= 0.001) and DOC(R2= 0.34, p= 0.001 and R2= 0.31, p= 0.002) signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuencedbeta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities(Table 1 ).

Further, VPA was used to dis-sect the relative contributions of the soil and pruned litter properties to thesoil beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities.

Yang et al. Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592317functional microbial community structure; soil properties (pH and DOC)largely explained variations in the beta-glucosidase (28.46 %) and chitinase(22.64 %) expressing microbial communities while pruned litter properties(TP and biomass) accounted for a very low variation rate ( <1% )( Fig. 5 C,D). These observations suggest that the soil and pruned litter properties sig-niﬁcantly affected (20.73 % and 25.81 % variations, respectively) the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities.Finally, the Pearson correlation showed that only soil pH and DOC sig-niﬁcantly correlated with the beta-glucosidase and chitinase expressing mi-crobial taxa; however, these two properties displayed opposite correlations(Fig. S8). Soil pH was signi ﬁcantly associated with seven phyla and sevengenera of microbes expressing beta-glucosidase and eight phyla andseven genera of microbes expressing chitinase, while DOC correlatedconsiderably with ﬁve phyla and six genera of microbes expressing beta-glucosidase and four phyla and three genera of microbes expressingchitinase. Among the pruned litter properties, biomass was signi ﬁcantly as-sociated with three phyla and ﬁve genera beta-glucosidase expressing taxaand four phyla and three genera chitinase expressing taxa, while TP was sig-niﬁcantly associated with two phyla and ﬁve genera of beta-glucosidase ex-pressing taxa and four phyla and three genera of chitinase expressing taxa.Other soil and pruned litter properties showed weaker correlations withbeta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial taxa.3.5. Driving factors for predicting the abundance of beta-glucosidase andchitinaseThe present study used an RF model to screen the main soil and prunedlitter properties and the key microbial taxa affecting the abundance of beta-glucosidase and chitinase ( Fig. 6 ). Both beta-glucosidase and chitinasemodeling demonstrated good predictive ef ﬁciencies (R2=0 . 7 8 , p<0.01and R2= 0.65, p<0.01). In the beta-glucosidase model, only soil pHwas identi ﬁed as the key variable among the soil properties that signi ﬁ-cantly affected beta-glucosidase abundance. Meanwhile, six out of tentaxa at the genus level, namely Silvibacterium ,Acidobacterium ,Streptomyces ,Rhodanobacter ,Caulobacter ,a n d Streptacidiphilus , were identi ﬁed as key mi-crobial taxa. However, no pruned litter property in ﬂuenced the abundanceof beta-glucosidase. In the chitinase model, soil pH and DOC and pruned lit-ter TP content predicted the abundance of chitinase with high accuracy(Fig. 6 ); the model also identi ﬁedﬁve microbial taxa, which signi ﬁcantlyinﬂuenced chitinase abundance.4. Discussion4.1. Effect of long-term N fertilization on organic C-decomposing genesIn our study, long-term N fertilization signi ﬁcantly affected soil C-cycling genes in the tea plantation ( Figs. 1, 2 ; Fig. S1). The Chao1 indexof C-cycling functional genes was decreased with increasing N rates,while the Shannon index was increased (Fig. S2), indicating an increasein microbial diversity related to C degradation in soil under N application(Cheng et al., 2017 ). Previously, Trivedi et al. (2016) also reported that Naddition signi ﬁcantly changed the composition of functional genes; therichness and diversity of C-degrading genes, such as amyA ,glucoamylase ,ara,xylanase ,cellobiase ,a n d endochitinase , decreased with N addition. How-ever, the present study found an increase in the relative abundance of or-ganic C-degrading genes (GHs) with increasing N rates ( Fig. 1 ), consistentwith a previous meta-analysis that showed increased activities of C-cycling enzymes β-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and β-D-cellobiosidase (CBH)with N application ( Jian et al., 2016 ). These ﬁndings indicate that N appli-cation is not conducive to SOC accumulation. Similarly, Luo et al. (2019)also found that N application accelerated SOC loss in the grassland ecosys-tem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau due to a signi ﬁcant increase in the activi-ties of the C-degrading enzymes. Moreover, the present study found asubstantial decrease in the relative abundance of organic C-synthesizinggenes (e.g., GTs) under N application ( Fig. 1 ), consistent with our previousreport on decreased SOC content under high N application ( Yang et al.,2019 ), probably due to the positive priming effect of pruned litter also05 1 0pHDOCSOCMBCTCFTSCTPTCBiomassSilvibacteriumAcidobacteriumStreptacidiphilusRhodanobacterThermogemmatisporaCaulobacterKtedonobacterStreptomycesPyrinomonasRhodothermusIncrease in MSE (%)0 4 8 12BiomassRhodanobacterStreptacidiphilusStenotrophomonasAcidobacteriumActinospicaSilvibacteriumLysobacterStreptomycesTerracidiphilusKtedonobacterIncrease in MSE (%)pHDOCSOCMBCTCFTSCTPTCBeta-glucosidase abundance Chitinase abundance************ ***************R2=0.78, p<0.01 R2=0.65, p<0.01 (A) (B)Soil propertiesPruned litter propertiesMicrobial taxaSoil propertiesPruned litter propertiesMicrobial taxaFig. 6.

The star above the bars indicates that the factors had signi ﬁcant effects on the abundance of beta-glucosidase and chitinase; * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.X. Yang et al. Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592318(Yang et al., 2022 ). Thus, the ﬁnding suggested that exogenous C inputexerted a positive priming effect, resulting in less SOC accumulation.Detailed analysis showed that the relative abundance of the top 20 SOC-degrading genes increased signi ﬁcantly with increasing N rates ( Fig. 2 A),indicating a positive association between these genes and N input ( Jianet al., 2016 ). Among the SOC-degrading genes, beta-glucosidase andchitinase are the key enzymes that speci ﬁcally degrade the labile and recal-citrant C ( Dai et al., 2021 ). Analysis based on the KEGG database found thatthe activity of beta-glucosidase was ten times higher than that of chitinase(Fig. 2 B, C), suggesting labile C as the dominant C component in tea planta-tion soil ( Yang et al., 2019 ). This observation is consistent with our recentresults on relatively low C storage in tea plantation soil under long-term fer-tilization even after returning pruned litter ( Yang et al., 2022 ). Large quan-tities of pruned litter returned to tea plantation soil contain labile C, whichis degraded by soil microorganisms ( Yang et al., 2022 ). Moreover, theabundance of beta-glucosidase and chitinase increased signi ﬁcantly withincreasing N rates ( Fig. 2 B and C), indicating that N application promotedthe decomposition of labile and recalcitrant C and accelerated the SOCloss, consistent with the decrease in SOC under high N conditions ( Yanget al., 2019 ). These ﬁndings indicate that pruned tea litter incorporation re-sults in less SOC accumulation, especially under excessive N application, inthe tea plantation system.4.2. Effect of long-term N fertilization on organic C-decomposing microbial com-munitiesMicrobes are important drivers of biogeochemical cycles ( Rousk andBengtson, 2014 ). This study focused on beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities associated with labile and recalcitrantC degradation ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). In the tea plantation soils, long-term Napplication signi ﬁcantly changed the community compositions of beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbes, especially under low N(N0 and N119) and high N (N285 and N569) rates ( Fig. 3 ). Besides, the glu-cosidase and chitinase-expressing communities showed a signi ﬁcant differ-ent under different N rates ( Fig. 3 ). Under high N application, the diversityof beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbes signi ﬁcantly de-creased (Fig. S2). The microbial variation observed in this study is consis-tent with the response of the microbial community to N application inother ecosystems, such as grassland, forests, and farmlands ( Ramirezet al., 2010 ;Wu et al., 2013 ;Zeng et al., 2016 ), which occurred probablydue to the changes in soil N availability under different N rates. Accordingto the oligotrophic-copiotrophic theory ( Fierer et al., 2007 ), speci ﬁc mi-crobes respond differently to soil N availability. In the present study, theN-induced decrease in the functional microbial diversity was probablydue to oligotrophic communities ( Zeng et al., 2016 ).At the phylum level, most beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing mi-crobes were abundant and similar ( Fig. 4 A, B), indicating that these domi-nant microbial taxa may belong to habitat generalist taxa ( Crump et al.,2012 ) that perform most ecological functions ( Lladó et al., 2016 ). Accord-ingly, the dominant phyla Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,Chloro ﬂexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes may bethe generalist taxa. This ﬁnding is consistent with the previous studiesthat showed that the ﬁve most abundant phyla were all generalists and ac-counted for over three-quarters of the total microbial abundance ( Wu et al.,2018 ). Among the beta-glucosidase-expressing microbial communities,Armatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia were the speci ﬁc microbial taxa re-sponsible for decomposing labile C, while among the chitinase-expressingmicrobial communities, Planctomycetes, Ascomycota, and Nitrospirawere the speci ﬁc ones responsible for decomposing recalcitrant C. Thesespeciﬁc microbes could be habitat specialists, generally less abundant(Crump et al., 2012 ). These observations suggest that both habitat general-ists and specialist taxa perform ecological functions. In other words, bothabundant and rare microbial communities perform critical ecological func-tions ( Huber et al., 2007 ).Meanwhile, at the genus level, the microbial taxa degrading labile andrecalcitrant C differed largely, indicating that most ecological functionswere performed by speci ﬁc taxa at higher taxonomic levels ( Louca et al.,2018 ).Silvibacterium ,Acidobacterium ,Streptomyces ,a n d Ktedonobacterwere the speci ﬁc microbial genera associated with labile and recalcitrantC degradation ( Fig. 4 C, D). Moreover, the relative abundance of the mi-crobes expressing beta-glucosidase and chitinases differed signi ﬁcantly atthe genus level; microbial taxa with high abundance performed labile Cdegradation, while those with low abundance were responsible for recalci-trant C degradation ( Fig. 4 C, D). These results suggest that microorganismsperform speci ﬁc ecological functions highly depending on the differencesin the substrate ( Louca et al., 2018 ). However, it should be noted that func-tional microbial taxa, especially at higher taxonomic levels (i.e., specieslevels), should be further analyzed since a single strain can perform variousecological functions ( Vorholt et al., 2017 ). Additionally, we found a strongpositive relationship between the functional taxa and the N rates (Fig. S7);these functional taxa belonged to copiotrophic taxa. Thus, the results indi-cate that N application improved the growth and reproduction of functionaltaxa and promoted SOC degradation, decreasing SOC content in the teaplantation ( Yang et al., 2019 ).4.3. Factors driving organic C decomposition-associated functional genes and mi-crobial communities in tea soils under N applicationVarious biotic and abiotic factors are crucial in structuring functionalmicrobial communities. RDA results of the present study indicated thatsoil pH is an important factor affecting the beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities in tea plantation soil ( Fig. 5 ). This obser-vation is consistent with Dai et al. (2021) , who reported that soil pH is a cru-cial factor regulating soil C-cycling, including C-cycling genes andassociated functional communities. Besides, evidence shows that soil pHis a key factor regulating microbial growth; microbes grow in a neutral en-vironment; therefore, acidic and alkali conditions inhibit their growth andreproduction ( Beales, 2004 ). In the present study, organic C-degradinggenes and microbial communities negatively correlated with soil pH, con-sistent with Dai et al. (2021) ﬁndings, indicating that relatively low pHmay bene ﬁt SOC degradation.In addition, soil DOC signi ﬁcantly affected C-degrading genes and beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities ( Fig. 5 ). As anunstable form of C, DOC is easily broken down and utilized by microbes(Liu et al., 2019 ). During decomposition, DOC is a direct Source of energyfor bacterial growth and activity, and its availability affects the transforma-tion of nutrients, including N, P, and S cycling ( Roesch et al., 2007 ). DOC iswidely recognized as a source of energy and nutrients for soil microorgan-isms ( Kaiser and Kalbitz, 2012 ). Several studies have shown that DOC im-pacts soil biological properties more than other physicochemicalproperties ( Li et al., 2015 ). Moreover, consistent with Zhong et al. (2020) ,DOC and lignin accounted for a higher rate of microbial community varia-tion during straw degradation under different N application rates.In addition to soil properties, pruned litter properties also signi ﬁcantlyaffected SOC-degrading enzymes and beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbial communities ( Fig. 5 ). Plant biomass is the primarysource of energy for microbes, and it provides high-quality substrates,such as SOC, thereby increasing the population of soil microbial communi-ties ( Yang et al., 2021 ).Chen et al. (2020) found a positive relationship be-tween soil bacterial diversity and plant biomass. Besides, polyphenolssigniﬁcantly affect beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing microbialcommunities ( Fig. 5 ), similar to the effect on soil microbial communities(Yang et al., 2019 ). Studies have demonstrated that polyphenols, as a Csource, greatly in ﬂuence various soil processes, such as nitri ﬁcation ( Tanget al., 2021 ). There are multiple reports on the effects of polyphenols onsoil C-cycling. For example, polyphenols stimulate litter decompositionrate, in ﬂuence soil humus formation ( Stevenson, 1994 ) and nutrient releasepatterns ( Nannipieri and Badalucco, 2003 ), and directly or indirectly alterthe microbial community. Polyphenols also control other macronutrients,such as phosphorus and sulfur, and micronutrients, such as iron, copper,zinc, and manganese ( Cesco et al., 2012 ). Polyphenols positively or nega-tively affect soil N content, depending on the speci ﬁc phenolic compoundX. Yang et al. Science of the Total Environment 856 (2023) 1592319and the microbial activity ( Hättenschwiler and Vitousek, 2000 ). Thus,these earlier reports and the present ﬁndings indicate plant propertiesshould also be considered while exploring the drivers of microbial commu-nities.5. ConclusionsIn this study, long-term N application signi ﬁcantly changed beta-glucosidase and chitinase-expressing communities in tea plantations. N fer-tilization signi ﬁcantly improved the abundance of C-cycling genes, espe-cially expressing the beta-glucosidase and chitinase. Similar dominantmicrobial taxa at the phylum level and distinct taxa at the genus level de-graded the labile and recalcitrant C of the tea plantation soil. Further ran-dom forest models indicated that pH and DOC of the soil, polyphenolcontent of pruned litter, and the dominant taxa performing ecological func-tions were important variables for predicting the abundance of beta-glucosidase and chitinase in the soil. Thus, our results concluded that N ap-plication signi ﬁcantly enhanced the SOC degradation ability of the tea plan-tation soils, re ﬂected by the functional genes and microbial taxa, which wasnot conducive to SOC accumulation. These ﬁndings provide a basis for ex-ploring the effects of agricultural management measures on soil C transfor-mation from the perspective of genes-enzymes-microbes.CRediT authorship contribution statementXiangde Yang: Experimental design, Investigation, Data curation,Writing-original draft.
