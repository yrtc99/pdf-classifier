IntroductionAgriculture  sector  in  India  in  2007  contributed  green  house  gas(GHG)  emissions  to  the  tune  of  334.41  /C2  106Mg  of  CO2equivalentwith  net  emissions  of  1727.71  /C2  106Mg  of  CO2equivalent  andgross  emissions  of  1904.73  /C2  106Mg  of  CO2equivalent  in  thecountry  and  ranked  3rd  next  to  energy  (58%)  and  industry  (22%)sectors  (INCCA,  2010 ).  Agricultural  soil  has  dual  nature  as  it  alsoserves  as  a  potential  sink  for  atmospheric  carbon  as  soil  organiccarbon  (SOC),  which  contributes  to  improve  productivity  andquality  (Rudrappa  et  al.,  2006;  Kundu  et  al.,  2007 ).  Soil,  animportant  medium  of  global  C  cycle  has  twice  the  capacity  to  storeC  compared  to  the  atmosphere  (Davidson  et  al.,  2000 ).

The  carbonsequestration  is  affected  by  cropping  system  and  management  practices  adopted.  Rice–wheat  is  adominant  cropping  system  in  the  Indo-Gangetic  plains.  Previous  studies  done  by  different  researchworkers  revealed  both  its  positive  as  well  as  negative  impacts  on  carbon  sequestration.  The  objective  ofthis  study  was  to  determine  C  sequestration  after  nine  year’s  rice  (Oryza  sativa  L.)–wheat  (Triticumaestivum  L.)  cropping  under  an  ongoing  experiment  at  Punjab  Agricultural  University,  Ludhiana,  Punjab(India).  This  study  was  based  on  ﬁve  treatments  (100%N,  100%NP,  100%NPK,  100%NPK  +  FYM  and  thecontrol).  In  the  surface  soil  layer  (0–15  cm),  soil  organic  carbon  (SOC)  increased  from  the  initial  status  of2.42  to  3.26  g  kg/C01in  the  control,  which  signiﬁcantly  increased  with  the  application  of  100%NPK(4.11  g  kg/C01)  and  100%NPK  +  FYM  (4.55  g  kg/C01).  The  rice–wheat  cropping  even  without  any  fertilization(control)  contributed  toward  carbon  sequestration  (1.94  Mg  C  ha/C01)  with  soil  organic  carbon  pools  andcarbon  sequestration  rate  of  7.84  Mg  C  ha/C01and  0.22  Mg  C  ha/C01yr/C01,  respectively.  The  soil  organiccarbon  pools,  carbon  sequestration  and  rate  of  carbon  sequestration  as  observed  in  treatment  ofbalanced  fertilization  (100%NPK)  were  signiﬁcantly  increased  from  9.19  to  9.99  Mg  C  ha/C01,  3.30  to4.10  Mg  C  ha/C01and  0.37  to  0.46  Mg  C  ha/C01yr/C01,  respectively  when  farmyard  manure  was  applied  inconjunction  with  100%NPK.  The  application  of  100%NPK  and  100%NPK  +  FYM  signiﬁcantly  increased  thesoil  labile  carbon  (1378  and  1578  mg  kg/C01,  respectively),  water  soluble  carbon  (35.3  and  37.2  mg  kg/C01,respectively)  and  water  soluble  carbohydrates  (526  and  538  mg  kg/C01,  respectively)  as  compared  to  thecontrol,  where  the  corresponding  values  were  898,  16.8  and  464  mg  kg/C01.  The  content  of  water  stableaggregates  organic  carbon  also  increased  with  fertilization  especially  in  combination  with  farmyardmanure,  whereas  bulk  density  of  soil  was  signiﬁcantly  reduced  in  the  treatment  of  100%NPK(1.49  Mg  m/C03)  and  100%NPK  +  FYM  (1.46  Mg  m/C03)  over  the  control  (1.60  Mg  m/C03).  The  fertilizertreatments  (100%N,  100%NP  and  100%NPK)  made  a  positive  inﬂuence  on  soil  organic  carbon  content  insubsurface  layers  (15–60  cm)  also  and  it  was  more  so  in  the  treatment  of  100%NPK  +  FYM  as  compared  tothe  control,  although  contents  did  not  differ  signiﬁcantly.  Balanced  fertilization  (100%NPK)  with  andwithout  FYM  signiﬁcantly  improved  the  labile  C  content  of  soil  (up  to  depth  of  60  cm)  over  the  control.Balanced  fertilization  in  combination  with  FYM  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  water  soluble  carbon  contentof  soil  in  comparison  to  the  control  (up  to  depth  of  60  cm).  Bulk  density  of  sub  surface  soil  (15–60  cm)was  reduced  in  all  the  treatments  as  compared  to  the  control  although  the  treatment  effect  was  non-signiﬁcant.  The  rice–wheat  cropping  sequence  thus,  showed  the  potential  of  mitigating  atmosphericcarbon  load  through  its  sequestration  and  integrated  nutrient  management  may  further  enhance  thispotential./C223  2012  Elsevier  B.V.

Theawareness  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  concerns  about  theglobal  warming  have  led  to  an  increased  interest  in  sequestering  Cin  soils  (Banger  et  al.,  2009;  Follett,  2001 ).  It  has  been  estimatedthat  about  1100–1600  Pg  C  is  sequestered  in  soils  worldwide(Izaurralde  et  al.,  2000 ).  This  represents  more  than  twice  theamount  of  C  in  vegetation  (560  Pg)  and  in  the  troposphere  (750  Pg).It  is  estimated  that  about  40–80  Pg  of  C  can  be  sequestered  in  soilsover  the  next  50–100  yr  through  sustainable  management(Houghton  et  al.,  1996 ).  Carbon  sequestration  potential  isinﬂuenced  by  many  factors  such  as  climate  and  soil  conditions(Miller  et  al.,  2004;  Chabbi  et  al.,  2009 ),  cropping  systems(Jagadamma  and  Lal,  2010 ),  managements  including  tillage  (Ogleet  al.,  2005 )  and  fertilization  (Bhattacharyya  et  al.,  2007 ).  Arelatively  faster  rate  of  decomposition  is  induced  by  the  continu-ous  warmth  in  tropical  agro-ecosystems,  as  a  result  highequilibrium  levels  of  organic  matter  are  difﬁcult  to  achieve.  Inthese  conditions,  large  annual  rates  of  organic  inputs  are  needed  tomaintain  an  adequate  labile  SOC  pool  in  comparison  to  coolerclimates  where  soils  have  more  organic  carbon  because  of  slowermineralization  rates.  Moreover,  there  is  need  to  identify  and  adoptthe  best  management  practices  to  maintain  or  improve  SOC  levelsparticularly  in  the  tropical  regions  where  soils  are  low  in  organic  Cand  production  systems  are  inherently  low  in  soil  fertility  (Mandalet  al.,  2005 ).The  common  recommended  management  practices  leading  toimprove  soil  C  sequestration  under  integrated  nutrient  manage-ment  include  the  use  of  manures,  compost,  crop  residues  and  bio-solids,  mulch  farming,  conversation  tillage,  agro-forestry,  diversecropping  systems  and  cover  crops  (Lal,  2004 ).  All  these  practiceshave  the  potential  to  alter  C  storage  capacity  of  agricultural  soil(Halvorson  et  al.,  2002;  Russell  et  al.,  2005 ).  The  addition  offertilizer  on  a  regular  basis  leads  to  an  increase  in  SOC,  soilmicrobial  biomass  and  also  alters  soil  C  &  N  dynamics  (Smith  et  al.,1994 ).  Soil  organic  carbon  is  reported  to  increase  by  the  continuousapplication  of  different  combinations  of  N,  P  and  K,  whereas  itdecreased  in  unfertilized  soils  (Yadav  et  al.,  1998 ).  According  to  Suet  al.  (2006) ,  integrated  use  of  FYM  and  fertilizers  eithermaintained  or  improved  SOC.  The  beneﬁcial  effect  of  incorporationof  crops  residues  is  more  as  compared  to  its  burning  or  removal(Beri  et  al.,  1995 ).  The  use  of  FYM/GM  along  with  incorporationwith  crop  residues  has  been  found  to  be  even  more  beneﬁcial(Singh  et  al.,  2007 ).  The  incorporation  of  organic  manures  and  cropresidues  to  soil  on  long-term  basis  helps  in  C  sequestration,  but  therate  of  C  sequestration  can  vary  with  the  type  and  nature  of  organicmanure.  The  rate  of  change  in  SOM  in  agricultural  soils  is  very  slowand  can  take  decade  to  centuries  (Stevenson,  1994 ).  The  change  inSOC  fractions  like  labile  carbon,  water  soluble  carbon,  andmicrobial  biomass  C  can  be  promptly  inﬂuenced  by  changes  inC  inputs  (Bolinder  et  al.,  1999 ).  Labile  C  is  the  fraction  of  total  C  thatdeclines  faster  and  is  restored  faster  and  is  sensitive  to  bestmanagement  practices  (Tirol-Padre  and  Ladha,  2004 ).Rice–wheat  is  a  dominant  cropping  system  and  it  occupies  13.5million  hectare  in  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plains  (IGP)  of  Bangladesh,India,  Nepal,  Pakistan  and  10.3  million  hectare  in  China  (Ladhaet  al.,  2000 ).  It  covers  78%  of  the  gross  cropped  area  of  the  Punjab,  astate  of  Northern-India  (Benbi  and  Brar,  2009 ).  There  are  reports  inthe  literature  that  show  both  negative  and  positive  impacts  of  rice–wheat  cropping  system  on  carbon  sequestration.  A  25  years  soiltesting  report  of  Punjab  compiled  by  Benbi  and  Brar  (2009)emphasized  the  positive  role  of  intensive  agriculture  to  improveSOC  status  in  the  state  by  38%  (2.9  g  kg/C01during  1981–1982  to4.0  g  kg/C01during  2005–2006).  On  the  contrary,  Bhandari  et  al.(2002)  and  Regmi  et  al.  (2002)  reported  the  negative  effect  of  rice–wheat  cropping  system  on  SOC  and  soil  productivity.  Thus  a  furtherinvestigation  is  needed  to  understand  the  real  effect  of  rice–wheatcropping  system  on  SOC  fractions  and  C  sequestration.  Long-termfertilizer  experiments  are  vital  tools  to  assess  impacts  of  croppingsystem  on  sustainable  use  indicators  such  as  soil  quality.Therefore,  the  present  study  was  done  under  a  nine  years  oldexperiment  on  rice–wheat  cropping  system  to  assess  the  long-term  effect  of  fertilizers  and  FYM  on  SOC  pools  and  C  sequestrationin  semi  arid  region  of  northern  part  of  India.2.  Materials  and  methods2.1.  Site  descriptionThis  study  was  conducted  as  a  part  of  an  ongoing  long-termfertilizer  experiment  (established  since  1999)  under  rice–wheatcropping  system  at  Research  Farm,  Department  of  Soil  Science,Punjab  Agricultural  University,  Ludhiana  (30 8560N,  758520E  and274  msl),  Punjab  India.  This  region  belongs  to  C4climate  zonecharacterized  by  hot  air  conditions.  At  the  start  of  experiment,  theloamy  sand  soil  tested  alkaline  in  reaction  (pH  8.3,  EC  0.20  dS  m/C01),low  in  soil  organic  carbon  (2.1  g  kg/C01soil)  and  available  N(85.4  kg  ha/C01)  and  available  K  (95.0  kg  ha/C01),  whereas  it  wasmedium  in  available  P  (12.5  kg  ha/C01).2.2.  Experimental  designThis  experiment  comprises  of  12  fertilization  treatments  in  plotsize  of  108  m2(12  m  /C2  9  m)  replicated  thrice  in  a  randomizedblock  design.  These  treatments  are  100%NPK  (T1),  150%  NPK  (T2),100%NPK  (+S)  (T3),  100%NP  (T4),  100%N  (T5),  100%NK  (P  towheat  only)  (T6),  100%NPK  +  Straw  (T7),  50%NPK  +  FYM  (T8),100%NPK  +  FYM  (T9),  50%NPK  +  GM  (T10),  100%NPK  +  GM  (T11)and  control  (T12).  This  paper  reports  the  results  on  the  basis  ofselected  ﬁve  treatments  (T1=  100%NPK,  T4=  100%NP,  T5=  100%N,T9=  100%NPK  +  FYM  and  T12=  Control).  Urea,  di-ammoniumphosphate  (DAP)  and  Muriate  of  potash  (MOP)  were  used  tosupply  N,  P  and  K,  respectively.  The  farmyard  manure  at15  Mg  ha/C01was  applied  annually  before  rice  transplanting.  Onan  average,  15  Mg  of  FYM  contained  350  g  C  kg/C01,  5  g  N  kg/C01,2.5  g  P  kg/C01,  15  g  K  kg/C01and  its  annual  application  supplied5250  kg  C  ha/C01,  75  kg  N  ha/C01,  37.5  kg  P  ha/C01,  225  kg  K  ha/C01torice–wheat  system.  The  rice  and  wheat  crops  were  cultivated  asper  agronomic  practices  recommended  under  irrigated  conditionby  Punjab  Agricultural  University,  Ludhiana.  The  full  dose  of  P  andK  was  applied  at  the  time  of  transplanting  and  sowing  of  rice  andwheat  respectively.  In  rice,  N  was  applied  in  three  split  doses(1/3rd  dose  at  transplanting,  1/3rd  dose  after  3  weeks  oftransplanting  and  another  1/3rd  dose  after  6  weeks  of  transplant-ing).  In  wheat  ½  of  the  N  was  applied  at  the  time  of  sowing  andremaining  ½  of  N  was  broadcasted  at  the  time  of  1st  irrigation.2.3.  Soil  sampling  and  analysisSoil  samples  were  collected  by  boring  at  4  random  places  withthe  help  of  post  hole  auger  from  all  the  plots  at  four  soil  depths(0–15,  15–30,  30–45  and  45–60  cm)  after  the  harvesting  of  wheatin  2008.  Soil  core  sampler  (each  core  had  an  inner  diameter  of  7  cmand  length  of  4.5  cm)  was  used  to  take  the  sample  for  thedetermination  of  bulk  density  (Db).  Soil  samples  were  air  dried  inshade.  Less  than  2  mm  size  fraction  of  soil  samples  were  used  fordetermining  different  fractions  of  carbon,  while  5–8  mm  soilfraction  was  used  for  the  determining  water  stable  aggregates.The  rapid  titration  method  using  1  N  K2Cr2O7solution  asdescribed  by  Walkley  and  Black  (1934)  was  followed  for  thedetermination  of  SOC.Labile  carbon  (LC)  was  determined  by  KMnO 4oxidation  method(Blair  et  al.,  1995 ).  Three  gram  soil  sample  was  treated  with  25  mlB.S.  Brar  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  128  (2013)  30–36  31of  33  mM  KMnO 4and  was  shaken  for  24  h  on  a  reciprocal  shaker.After  centrifuging  at  2000  rpm  for  5  min,  the  samples  were  ﬁlteredthrough  a  Whatman  No.  1  ﬁlter  paper.  A  corresponding  blankwithout  soil  was  also  prepared  in  the  same  manner.  Theabsorbance  of  ﬁltrate  from  samples  and  blank  aliquot  wasmeasured  at  565  nm  on  a  double  beam  spectrophotometer.  Theconcentration  of  KMnO 4from  samples  and  blank  was  determinedusing  standard  calibration  curve,  obtained  by  plotting  KMnO 4concentration  against  absorbance  at  565  nm.Water  soluble  carbon  (WSC)  was  determined  using  the  methodas  described  by  McGill  et  al.  (1986) .  Ten  gram  soil  was  taken  incentrifuge  tube  and  20  ml  of  distilled  water  was  added.  The  tubeswere  centrifuged  for  1  h  at  5000  rpm  and  the  supernatant  aliquotwas  ﬁltered.  Ten  ml  of  the  ﬁltrate  was  treated  with  5  ml  of  0.07  NK2Cr2O7,  10  ml  of  98%  H2SO4and  5  ml  of  88%  H3PO4and  themixture  was  digested  at  150  8C  for  30  min.  Cooled  samples  weretitrated  with  a  solution  of  0.01  N  ferrous  ammonium  sulphate(FAS)  in  0.4  N  H2SO4using  diphenylamine  as  an  indicator.  The  WSCwas  calculated  by  the  following  relation:%WSC  ¼  ðB  /C0  SÞ  /C2  0:01  /C2  0:003  /C210010where  ‘B’  is  ml  of  0.01  N  FAS  used  in  the  blank  and  ‘S’  is  ml  of  0.01  NFAS  used  in  soil  sample.Water  soluble  carbohydrates  were  determined  using  themethod  developed  by  Chebhire  and  Mundie  (1966) .  Ten  gramsoil  was  treated  with  50  ml  of  24  N  H2SO4and  was  digested  on  ahot  plate  at  100  8C  for  10–16  h.  The  ﬁltrate  was  then  precipitatedwith  6  N  NaOH  (5  ml)  for  neutralization  and  centrifuged  for  10  minat  1500  rpm.  To  5  ml  of  aliquot,  10  ml  of  0.2%  anthrone  was  added.The  intensity  of  green  color  was  read  at  625  nm  on  thespectrophotometer.  The  unknown  values  were  calculated  on  basisof  standard  curve  and  compared  with  anthrone  and  expressed  asmg  kg/C01soil.Water  stable  aggregate  size  distribution  was  determined  by  wetsieving  method  as  described  by  Yoder  (1936) .  Air  dried  soil  clods  ofsize  5–8  mm  were  spread  uniformly  on  the  top  most  sieve  of  a  nestof  sieves  having  pore  diameter  2,  1,  0.5,  0.25  and  0.11  mm.  The  nestof  sieves  was  oscillated  up  and  down  by  a  pulley  arrangement  for30  min  at  a  frequency  of  30  cycles  per  minute  in  salt  free  water.  Thewater  stable  aggregates  of  different  sizes  were  collected  from  therespective  sieves  separately  after  oven  drying  the  sieves  at  50  8C.Oven  dried  soil  aggregates  of  different  size  fractions  were  groundwith  pestle  and  mortar  to  <0.25  mm  size  and  water  stableaggregates  associated  organic  carbon  (WSOC)  was  determined  byrapid  titration  method  (Walkley  and  Black,  1934 ).Soil  bulk  density  was  determined  by  collecting  undisturbed  soilsamples  of  known  weight  in  the  metallic  cores  of  known  volume(internal  diameter  of  7.0  cm  and  length  of  4.5  cm).  These  soilsamples  were  oven  dried  at  105  8C  for  24  h  to  take  the  dry  weight  ofsoil  samples  (Blake  and  Hartge,  1986 ).  The  bulk  density  ofundisturbed  soil  samples  was  calculated  using  the  equation:Db¼WsVtwhere  ‘Db’  is  bulk  density  of  soil  (Mg  m/C03),  ‘Ws’  is  weight  of  soil  (g)and  ‘Vt’  is  the  volume  of  soil  sample  (cm3).Soil  organic  pools  were  calculated  as  per  the  followingequation:SOC  pool  ðMg  ha/C01Þ  ¼  SOC  concentration  ð%Þ/C2  soil  depth  ðmÞ/C2  bulk  density  ðMg  m/C03Þ/C2  104  m2ha/C01/C2  10/C02The  carbon  sequestration  was  determined  by  subtracting  thevalue  of  C  pools  at  start  of  the  experiment  (1999)  from  the  value  ofC  pools  in  year  2008.  The  ratio  of  carbon  sequestration  over  C  initial(1999)  was  calculated.  The  annual  rate  of  C  sequestration  wascalculated  by  ratio  of  changes  in  C  pools  over  total  number  of  years.The  data  for  different  soil  carbon  fractions  and  sequestrationwere  analyzed  using  a  Randomized  Block  Design  (RBD)  withDuncan’s  Multiple  Range  Test  at  5%  level  of  signiﬁcance  forcomparing  the  means.  Statistical  analysis  was  performed  by  awindow-based  SPSS  program.3.  Results  and  discussion3.1.  Soil  organic  carbonSoil  organic  carbon  content  was  lowest  in  the  control  andmaximum  in  treatment  of  100%NPK  +  FYM  (Table  1).  At  a  soil  depthof  0–5  cm,  an  application  of  100%N,  100%NP  and  100%NPKsigniﬁcantly  increased  the  SOC  content  by  13.2,  17.1  and  30.0%over  the  control,  respectively.  Such  a  beneﬁcial  effect  of  long-termuse  of  chemical  fertilizers  has  also  been  reported  by  Campbell  andZentner  (1993) .  However,  the  SOC  content  in  0–5  cm  layer100%NPK  +  FYM  treatment  (5.07  g  kg/C01)  was  signiﬁcantly  higherover  the  100%NPK  dose  alone.  Similar  was  the  trend  in  5–10  cmlayer.  The  effect  of  balanced  nutrient  application  (100%NPK)  withand  without  organic  manure  (FYM)  on  SOC  content  was  signiﬁcantover  all  other  treatments  in  surface  soil  layer  (up  to  0–15  cm  layer).Similar  results  have  also  been  reported  in  literature  (Clark  et  al.,1998;  Padre  et  al.,  2007;  Kaur  et  al.,  2008 ).  The  build  up  of  SOCcontent  was  more  in  surface  layer  due  to  more  addition  of  rootbiomass,  root  exudates  and  plant  biomass  and  it  decreased  withincrease  in  depth  irrespective  of  fertilizer  treatments.  Similarresults  were  also  reported  by  Sharma  et  al.  (1992)  and  Kaur  et  al.(2008) .  The  variation  in  SOC  content  at  different  soil  depths  due  tofarmyard  manure  and  fertilizer’s  application  may  be  attributed  tothe  accumulation  of  varying  amounts  of  root  biomass,  rootexudates  and  plant  residues  left  in  respective  soil  layers  (Sharmaet  al.,  1992;  Brar  and  Pasricha,  1998;  Padre  et  al.,  2007 ).3.2.  Labile  carbonIn  surface  soil  layer  (0–15  cm),  the  labile  carbon  content  wasincreased  signiﬁcantly  by  24.1,  42.3,  53.5  and  75.7%  with  anapplication  of  100%N,  100%NP,  100%NPK  and  100%NPK  +  FYM,respectively  over  the  control  (Table  2).  The  addition  of  FYM  alongwith  100%NPK  signiﬁcantly  improved  labile  carbon  content(14.5%)  of  surface  layer  (0–15  cm)  over  the  100%NPK  treatment.Similar  trend  was  observed  at  different  depth  intervals  (0–60  cm)among  different  treatments.  The  maximum  labile  carbon  contentwas  observed  at  surface  layer  which  may  be  attributed  to  additionof  crop  residue  and  microbial  activity.  The  increase  in  labile  carboncontent  with  application  of  N  may  be  ascribed  to  the  priming  effectof  applied  inorganic  N  on  fresh  organic  material  in  the  soil,  whichTable  1Effect  of  long-term  use  of  organic  manure  and  inorganic  fertilizers  on  soil  organiccarbon  (g  kg/C01)  under  rice–wheat  cropping  system.Treatment  Depth  (cm)0–5  5–10  10–15  15–30  30–45  45–60Control  3.33a  3.27a  3.17a  2.70a  2.53ab  2.43a100%N  3.77b  3.70b  3.13a  2.87a  2.70ab  2.63a100%NP  3.90b  3.77b  3.13a  2.77a  2.73ab  2.57a100%NPK  4.33c  4.23c  3.77b  2.90a  2.87ab  2.60a100%NPK  +  FYM  5.07d  4.70d  3.87b  3.10a  2.80ab  2.73aValues  within  a  column,  followed  by  different  letters  are  signiﬁcantly  different  atp  <  0.05  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test.B.S.

The  depth-wise  distribution  of  labile  carboncontent  showed  a  decreasing  trend  with  increase  in  soil  depth  ineach  treatment.  Thus,  the  continuous  cropping  over  the  yearswithout  fertilizer  application  (i.e.  control)  resulted  in  a  slightincrease  in  labile  carbon  content  of  soil.  However,  the  buildup  wasconsiderable  in  fertilizers  treatments  and  maximum  in  FYMamended  plots.  Similar  results  were  reported  by  Tirol-Padre  andLadha  (2004)  and  Rudrappa  et  al.  (2005) .3.3.  Water  soluble  carbonApplication  of  balanced  (100%NPK)  fertilizers  with  and  withoutFYM  resulted  in  higher  content  of  water  soluble  carbon  (WSC)  insoil  (0–60  cm)  in  comparison  to  the  control  (Table  3).  In  the  surfacesoil  (0–15  cm),  the  treatment  of  100%N  increased  the  WSC  contentby  8.3%  as  compared  to  the  control.  The  application  of  100%NP  and100%NPK  signiﬁcantly  improved  WSC  content  by  58.9  and  110.1%respectively,  over  the  control.  The  maximum  value  of  WSC  contentwas  observed  with  integrated  use  of  inorganic  and  organicfertilizer  (100%NPK  +  FYM)  and  it  was  comparable  to  100%NPKtreatment.In  15–30  cm  soil  layer,  the  WSC  content  increased  signiﬁcantlyby  8.1  and  64.7%  with  100%N  and  100%NP  dose  respectively  incomparison  to  the  control.  The  balanced  fertilizer  dose  (100%NPK)either  alone  or  in  combination  with  FYM  resulted  in  signiﬁcantincrease  in  WSC  content  compared  to  the  control.  The  similar  trendwas  followed  at  a  depth  of  30–45  cm.  The  application  of  FYM  alongwith  100%NPK  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  WSC  even  at  45–60  cm,which  indicated  the  importance  of  integrated  use  of  organicmanure  and  inorganic  fertilizers.  The  depth-wise  distribution  ofWSC  showed  a  decreasing  trend  in  each  treatment.  The  higher  WSCcontent  in  surface  layer  might  be  due  to  addition  of  plant  residuesand  microbial  activity.  The  increase  in  WSC  content  withapplication  of  N  fertilizers  could  be  as  a  result  of  the  primingeffect  of  applied  inorganic  N  on  fresh  organic  material  in  the  soil,which  stimulates  the  microbial  activity  helping  in  the  decomposi-tion  of  SOM  with  rapid  release  of  the  WSC  fraction  (Yagi  et  al.,2005 ).  The  beneﬁcial  effects  of  FYM  application  under  rice–wheatcropping  system  on  WSC  content  were  also  reported  by  Mannaet  al.  (2006) .3.4.  Water  stable  aggregates  organic  carbonIn  soil  (0–15  cm),  water  stable  aggregates  organic  carbon(WSAC)  content  was  maximum  among  0.50–0.25  mm  sizefractions  followed  by  0.25–0.11  mm  size  fractions  >2.00  mmsize  fractions  >1.00–0.50  mm  size  fractions  >2.00–1.00  mm  sizefractions  (Fig.  1).  Among  0.50–0.25  and  1.00–0.50  mm  sizefractions,  balanced  fertilizers  (100%NPK)  with  and  without  FYMsigniﬁcantly  increased  water  stable  aggregates  organic  carboncontents  as  compared  to  the  other  treatments,  whereas  in  case  of0.25–0.11  and  2.00–1.00  size  fractions  water  stable  aggregatesorganic  carbon  contents  under  100%NPK  and  100%NPK  +  FYM  bothbeing  at  par  with  each  other,  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  over  othertreatments.  Thus,  long-term  use  of  FYM  along  with  100%NPKproved  to  be  most  beneﬁcial  treatment  as  microbial  action  on  FYMresulted  in  the  formation  of  organo-mineral  complexes  leading  toaggregation  of  soil  particles,  which  further  inﬂuenced  soil  C  storageand  dynamics  (Elliot  and  Coleman,  1988 ).  These  results  wereconsistent  with  the  ﬁndings  of  Gerzabek  et  al.  (2001) .Table  2Effect  of  long-term  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers  and  organic  manure  on  labile  C(mg  g/C01)  under  rice–wheat  cropping  system.Treatment  Depth  (cm)0–15  15–30  30–45  45–60Control  898a  824a  752a  644a100%N  1114b  1024b  934b  692b100%NP  1278c  1122c  996c  812c100%NPK  1378d  1176d  1022c  898d100%NPK  +  FYM  1578e  1390e  1222d  992eValues  within  a  column,  followed  by  different  letters  are  signiﬁcantly  different  atp  <  0.05  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test.Table  3Effect  of  long-term  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers  and  organic  manure  on  Water  solublecarbon  (mg  kg/C01)  under  rice–wheat  cropping  system.Treatment  Depth  (cm)0–15  15–30  30–45  45–60Control  16.8a  13.6a  12.8a  12.3a100%N  18.2a  14.7ab  13.8ab  13.2ab100%NP  26.7b  22.4abc  20.9abc  19.7ab100%NPK  35.3c  29.6bc  27.2bc  26.1ab100%NPK  +  FYM  37.2c  31.3c  28.4c  27.6bValues  within  a  column,  followed  by  different  letters  are  signiﬁcantly  different  atp  <  0.05  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test.Fig.  1.

Brar  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  128  (2013)  30–36  333.5.  Water  soluble  carbohydratesThe  water  soluble  carbohydrates  content  of  soil  (0–15  cm)in  100%N  and  100%NP  treatments  was  higher  by  3.2  and  6.9%over  the  control  (Table  4).  The  balanced  fertilizer  (100%NPK)dose  signiﬁcantly  improved  the  water  soluble  carbohydrates(526  mg  kg/C01)  over  the  control  indicating  that  balanced  use  offertilizers  resulted  in  better  establishment  of  root  system  of  plants(Banwasi  and  Bajpai,  2001 )  and  also  increased  microbial  activity  insoil.  The  FYM  along  with  100%NPK  increased  the  water  solublecarbohydrates  over  the  100%NPK  application  alone,  although  thecontents  did  not  differ  signiﬁcantly.In  sub  surface  soil  layer  (15–30  cm),  water  soluble  carbohy-drates  in  100%N,  100%NP  and  100%NPK  were  1.1,  9.7  and  17.7%higher  over  the  control,  respectively.  The  balanced  fertilizers(100%NPK)  dose  with  and  without  FYM  resulted  in  signiﬁcantlyhigher  water  soluble  carbohydrates  content  in  comparison  to  thecontrol.  The  different  combinations  of  fertilizers  resulted  in  higherwater  soluble  carbohydrates  content  at  soil  depth  of  30–60  cmover  the  control  however  this  increase  was  non-signiﬁcant  exceptFYM  treatment.  As  a  whole,  distribution  of  water  solublecarbohydrates  showed  a  decreasing  trend  in  its  contents  withincrease  in  depth.  Thus,  integrated  use  of  FYM  and  100%NPKproved  more  beneﬁcial  as  also  reported  by  other  workers(Izquierdo  et  al.,  2005;  Tejada  et  al.,  2006;  Kaur  et  al.,  2008 ).3.6.  Bulk  densityThe  bulk  density  of  soil  decreased  with  fertilization.  Thisdecreased  was  non-signiﬁcant  with  imbalanced  fertilizer  applica-tion.  However,  balance  fertilizer  application  (100%NPK)  integratedwith  organic  manure  (FYM)  proved  best  among  all  the  treatmentswhich  signiﬁcantly  decreased  the  bulk  density  of  surface  soil(0–15  cm)  over  the  imbalanced  fertilizer  treatments  (Table  5).  Atlower  soil  depths,  the  effect  of  fertilization  on  bulk  density  wasnon-signiﬁcant.  The  bulk  density  exhibited  an  increasing  trendwith  increase  in  soil  depth  (0–60  cm)  in  respective  treatments.  Thedecrease  in  bulk  density  over  the  years  could  be  attributed  to  theaddition  of  root  and  plant  biomass  and  to  the  conversion  of  somemicro-pores  into  macro-pores  due  to  cementing  action  of  organicTable  4Effect  of  long-term  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers  and  organic  manure  on  water  solublecarbohydrates  (mg  kg/C01)  under  rice–wheat  cropping  system.Treatment  Depth  (cm)0–15  15–30  30–45  45–60Control  464a  372a  338a  320a100%N  479ab  376ab  344a  326ab100%NP  496ab  408abc  372ab  348ab100%NPK  526b  438bc  396ab  368ab100%NPK  +  FYM  538b  446c  412b  386bValues  within  a  column,  followed  by  different  letters  are  signiﬁcantly  different  atp  <  0.05  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test.Table  5Effect  of  long-term  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers  and  organic  manure  on  bulk  density(Mg  m/C03)  under  rice–wheat  cropping  system.Treatment  Depth  (cm)0–5  5–10  10–15  15–30  30–45  45–60Control  1.58de  1.59d  1.64cd  1.70a  1.81a  1.84a100%N  1.48cd  1.50c  1.60bc  1.69a  1.77a  1.82a100%NP  1.46c  1.48bc  1.55bc  1.65a  1.70a  1.79a100%NPK  1.46b  1.47b  1.54ab  1.67a  1.73a  1.80a100%NPK  +  FYM  1.42a  1.44a  1.52a  1.65a  1.71a  1.76aValues  within  a  column,  followed  by  different  letters  are  signiﬁcantly  different  atp  <  0.05  by  Duncan’s  multiple  range  test.Fig.  2.

These  results  weresimilar  to  those  reported  by  several  other  researchers  (Sharmaet  al.,  1987;  Babhulkar  et  al.,  2000;  Prasad  and  Sinha,  2000;  Agbedeet  al.,  2008;  Rasool  et  al.,  2008;  Bhattacharyya  et  al.,  2004 ).3.7.  Carbon  balance  and  turnover  rateAfter  9  years  of  cultivation  (2008),  rice–wheat  cropping  systemeven  without  any  fertilization  (i.e.  control)  contributed  toward  Csequestration  (Fig.  2).  In  comparison  to  the  time  of  start  of  theexperiment  (1999),  SOC  content  of  the  soil  was  improved  by  34.7in  the  control,  whereas  it  increased  by  69.8  and  88.0%  intreatments  of  100%NPK  dose  and  100%NPK  +  FYM,  respectively.The  application  of  100%N  and  100%NP  signiﬁcantly  increased  SOCcontent  over  the  control  although  both  these  treatments  did  notdiffer  signiﬁcantly  in  SOC  content.  The  balanced  fertilizers(100%NPK)  dose  with  and  without  FYM  signiﬁcantly  improvedthe  SOC  content  of  soil  as  compared  to  other  treatments,  whichmay  be  attributed  to  the  increased  plant  biomass  addition.  During2008,  the  SOC  pools  increased  by  32.9%  in  the  control,  whereastreatments  of  100%NPK  dose  and  100%NPK  +  FYM  led  to  anincrease  in  SOC  pools  by  55.8  and  69.3%,  respectively.  In  similarityto  the  trend  as  observed  for  SOC  content,  the  SOC  pools  in  thetreatments  of  100%N  and  100%NP  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  overthe  control  although  both  these  treatments  did  not  differsigniﬁcantly.  An  application  of  balanced  fertilizers  (100%NPK)dose  with  and  without  FYM  signiﬁcantly  improved  the  SOC  poolsas  compared  to  other  treatments.The  rice–wheat  cropping  even  without  any  fertilization  (control)contributed  toward  carbon  sequestration  (1.94  Mg  C  ha/C01).  It  wasincreased  by  12.4%  in  the  treatment  of  100%N  when  compared  to  thecontrol.  Balanced  application  of  fertilizers  (100%NPK)  signiﬁcantlyincreased  the  carbon  sequestration  over  the  control,  100%N  and100%NP.  The  farmyard  manure  along  with  balanced  chemicalfertilizers  (100%NPK)  proved  most  useful  as  it  signiﬁcantly  increasedthe  carbon  sequestration  over  all  other  treatments  including100%NPK  dose  alone.The  application  of  100%N  alone  increased  the  ratio  of  carbonsequestration  over  carbon  initial  by  12.1%  over  the  control  (Fig.  2).The  addition  of  100%P  along  with  100%N  showed  no  effect.Balanced  fertilizers  (100%NPK)  dose  signiﬁcantly  improved  thisratio  in  comparison  to  the  control,  100%N  and  100%NP.  Thetreatment  of  FYM  +  100%NPK  proved  to  be  most  beneﬁcial  as  it  wassigniﬁcantly  superior  even  over  balanced  fertilizers  (100%NPK)alone.  Similar  trend  was  observed  in  the  case  of  carbonsequestration  rate,  which  increased  by  9.1%  with  application  of100%N.  Application  of  100%P  showed  no  effect.  The  treatment  of100%NPK  signiﬁcantly  improved  the  carbon  sequestration  rateover  the  control  and  100%N.  However,  FYM  in  addition  to  NPKresulted  in  signiﬁcantly  higher  carbon  sequestration  rate  over  allthe  other  treatments.  This  might  be  attributed  to  greater  amount  oforganic  input  with  higher  lignin  content  (FYM)  resulting  in  agreater  accumulation  per  unit  of  C  input  (Stevenson,  1965;Paustian  et  al.,  1992 ).  Benbi  and  Brar  (2009)  on  the  basis  of  soildata  for  25  years  also  reported  that  intensive  cultivation  of  anexhaustive  rice–wheat  system  unexpectedly  improved  C  seques-tration  and  organic  carbon  status  on  a  regional  scale.4.  ConclusionsThis  study  was  done  as  both  positive  and  negative  impacts  ofrice–wheat  system  have  been  reported  on  carbon  sequestration  bydifferent  research  workers.  In  this  study  the  positive  impact  oflong-term  rice–wheat  cropping  was  observed.  The  continuousadoption  of  this  cropping  system  even  without  any  fertilizerapplication  (control)  contributed  toward  C  sequestration(1.94  Mg  C  ha/C01),  which  further  increased  to  3.30  and4.10  Mg  C  ha/C01in  treatments  of  100%NPK  and  100%NPK  +  FYM,respectively.  The  SOC  pools  signiﬁcantly  increased  from7.84  Mg  C  ha/C01in  the  control  to  9.19  and  9.99  Mg  C  ha/C01with100%NPK  dose  and  100%NPK  +  FYM,  respectively.  The  applicationof  100%NPK  +  FYM  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  soil  organic  carbon,soil  labile  carbon  as  compared  to  other  treatments  (control,  100%N,100%NP  and  100%NPK).  The  balanced  use  of  chemical  fertilizers(100%NPK)  with  and  without  farmyard  manure  signiﬁcantlyincreased  water  soluble  carbohydrates  over  control.  The  beneﬁcialeffect  of  chemical  fertilizers  with  and  without  FYM  was  more  in  thesurface  (0–15  cm)  soil  layer.  The  integrated  use  of  farmyardmanure  and  inorganic  fertilizers  was  most  promising  forimprovement  of  soil  organic  carbon,  soil  carbon  pools  and  carbonsequestration.ReferencesAgbede,  T.M.,  Ojeniyi,  S.O.,  Adeyemo,  A.J.,  2008.
