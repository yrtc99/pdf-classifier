MinireviewMicrobial diversity and biogeography in Arctic soilsLucie A. Malard *and David A. PearceFaculty of Health and Life Sciences, NorthumbriaUniversity, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 8ST, UK.SummaryMicroorganisms dominate terrestrial environments inthe polar regions and Arctic soils are known to har-bour significant microbial diversity, far more diverseand numerous in the region than was once thought.Furthermore, the geographic distribution and struc-ture of Arctic microbial communities remains elusive,despite their important roles in both biogeochemicalcycling and in the generation and decomposition ofclimate active gases. Critically, Arctic soils are esti-mated to store over 1500 Pg of carbon and, thus, havethe potential to generate pos itive feedback within theclimate system. As the Arctic region is currently under-going rapid change, the like lihood of faster release ofgreenhouse gases such as CO2,C H 4and N 2Oi sincreasing. Understanding the microbial communities inthe region, in terms of their diversity, abundance andfunctional activity, is key to producing accurate modelsof greenhouse gas release. This review brings togetherexisting data to determin e what we know about micro-bial diversity and biogeography in Arctic soils.IntroductionThe polar cryosphere represents approximately 14% ofthe Earth ’s surface (Morita, 1975; Boetius et al., 2015).Yet, it has long been considered that life, where itexisted, was dormant in these regions as, in order to sur-vive, living organisms have to be well adapted or highlyresistant to extreme cold, variable temperature and melt/thaw cycles, low nutrient and liquid water availability andseasonally variable UV radiation levels (Larose et al .,2013; Boetius et al., 2015). Today, however, it is well rec-ognized that microorganisms can thrive in the Arcticregion and are present in abundance in all northern polarenvironments; from tundra (Lee et al., 2013) to taiga (Neufeldand Mohn, 2005), snow (Larose et al ., 2013), glaciers(Anesio et al., 2009), permafro st (Mackelprang et al., 2011),air (Harding et al., 2011; Cuthbertson et al., 2017), marine(Ghiglione et al., 2012) and freshwater (Crump et al., 2012)ecosystems. The Arctic tundra covers about 8% of Earth ’sland surface (Nemergut et al., 2005) and is characterized bya unique soil profile where the subsoil is perennially frozen,the permafrost which, in turn, covers up to 25% of Earth sur-face (Steven et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2013).In the Arctic, microorganisms play major roles in bio-geochemical cycling despite slow growth and low activityrates due to environmental conditions (Nemergut et al.,2005). The active layer of the permafrost is estimated tostore 500 Pg of carbon whilst the Arctic permafrost belowis estimated to store over 1000 Pg of carbon, amountingto an overall terrestrial Arctic carbon pool of over1500 Pg (Koven et al., 2011; Mackelprang et al., 2011).In summer, the active layer of the permafrost thaws, lead-ing to a sharp increase in microbial activity and toincreased nutrient cycling activity. Increased microbialactivity may lead to increased release of climate activegases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH 4)and nitrous oxide (N 2O) into the atmosphere (Fiereret al., 2007; Mackelprang et al., 2011), creating positivefeedback on the climate system. Understanding thediversity, structure and stability of microbial communitiesand how they may be altered with environmental changeis essential to understand potential changes in ecosys-tem function, especially in the context of Arctic warming.Currently, the main difficulty in assessing Arctic micro-bial communities resides in the remoteness of the region,which greatly limits the number of studies and samplesavailable. Here, we provide the first broad overview ofArctic microbial communities across the region.Diversity and biogeographyBiogeography is the description of biodiversity patternsacross space and time, and although biogeography hasbeen intensively studied for higher organisms, the ques-tion of microbial biogeography has only recently receivedsignificant attention (Fierer and Jackson, 2006; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018). Indeed, for a long time, microbialubiquity was assumed, influenced by the prevailing para-digm that ‘everything is everywhere, but, the environmentselects ’by Baas-Becking in 1934, which has persistedReceived 10 November, 2017; accepted 17 July, 2018. *For corre-spondence.

This adagesuggested that all species of microorganism are every-where and, thus, microbial biogeography does not strictlyexist as it does for higher organisms (O ’Malley, 2007). Anincreasing number of studies now focus on microbial bio-geography worldwide (Tedersoo et al ., 2014; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018), but the Arctic region has receivedcomparatively little attention.Regional comparisonThe current number of studies focusing on Arctic soilmicrobial diversity remains low, with a limited numberof sites being investigated (Fig. 1). However, we canobserve a steady increase in the number of microbialDNA sequences deposited in international nucleotidesequence databases (Fig. 2A), which reflects an increasein the number of studies of Arctic soil communities. Despitethe increasing number of sequences available, clear dis-parities remain, with some Arctic regions recording a largenumber of sequences (Fig. 2B) whilst Russia, Greenland,Iceland and Sweden, for instance, still have low to nosequence data available. We can also observe a clearfocus on bacterial communities and lack of information onArctic archaeal, fungal, eukaryotic and viral communities.The active layer of Arctic soils is directly exposed tothe climatic conditions, which are characterized by strongwinds, extremely low temperatures, low UV radiation inwinter and intense UV radiation in summer with generallylow rates of precipitations (Nemergut et al., 2005). Despitethese apparently extreme environmental conditions, stud-ies have shown that Arctic tundra soils may harbour simi-lar and even higher microbial diversity to other biomes(Neufeld and Mohn, 2005; Chu et al., 2010; Lee et al.,2013). Although polar microorganisms have lower activityrates due to climatic conditions, their role in nutrient cyclingis nevertheless essential (Jakosky et al., 2003).To compare microbial communities across Arctic soils,we documented all available studies investigating micro-bial diversity in the active layer of pristine Arctic tundrasoils, despite large methodological differences. We con-sidered DNA-based studies, from clone libraries to ampli-con sequencing and metagenomics (studies used listedin Table 1) and extracted taxonomic ranks and abun-dance data (Supporting Information). It should also benoted that various primers, PCR conditions and sequenc-ing platforms were used.Typically, Proteobacteria and, specifically, N-fixingRhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria), Burkholderiales (Beta-proteobacteria), Xanthomonadal es (Gammaproteobacteria)and Myxococcales (Deltaproteobacteria) dominated Arc-tic soil bacterial communities (Fig. 3A and B). The shiftin communities seemed largely directed by the varia-tions in abundance of Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes andActinobacteria whilst other phyla remained relativelystable across the region. Acidobacteria were widely dis-tributed across the Arctic region except in Svalbardand Siberia where they were present in much lower fre-quencies. The Acidobacteria and Solibacteres classesdominated the region despite high variability. Generally,Actinobacteria occurred at lower abundances in Greenlandand Finland (3% –6%), whilst Bacteroidetes had muchhigher abundances than in Alaskan, Canadian andSvalbard soils (up to 26%). Verrucomicrobia, Planctomy-cetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, AD3and Cyanobacteria were less abundant taxa, generallyrepresenting less than 15% of the population in total(Fig. 3A). These results would suggest that biogeo-graphic variation does occur in Arctic soils.At this stage, for most identified microorganisms, infer-ring function even from the order level remains extremelydifficult, considering each phylum harbours a wide diver-sity of organisms with a large number of ecological func-tions. However, some critical functional activity couldpotentially be assessed. For instance, in Arctic soils,besides plants and their associated root bacteria, Cyano-bacteria are largely responsible for CO2and N 2uptake(Zakhia et al., 2008) and as plants are unable to fix N 2,Arctic ecosystems are largely reliant on Cyanobacteria.Although they can be free living in tundra soil, mainlyfrom the Oscillatoriales and Nostocales orders (Stevenet al., 2013), they are often identified in biofilms or soilcrusts, likely due to the protection provided against envi-ronmental conditions (Zakhia et al., 2008). In Arctic soilcrusts, Synechococcales, Nostocales and Oscillatorialeshave been consistently identified as dominant orders ofCyanobacteria (Steven et al ., 2013; Pushkareva et al .,2015). Specialized N2fixation species form heterocysts,which are specialized cells with thicker cell walls to pro-tect nitrogenase from O 2inactivation (Kumar et al .,2010). Nostoc sp. are found in abundance in Arctic soilsacross the region and are the main N 2fixers identified,thus transforming N 2into organic N, which can be usedby plants and microorganisms (Dodds et al., 1995). Withthe essential role of Cyanobacteria in carbon and nitro-gen uptake, their biogeography can significantly impactthe carbon and nitrogen cycle dynamics, yet to date, theirdistribution and diversity has not been thoroughly investi-gated in Arctic soils.Another group of microorganisms with important rolesin the nitrogen cycle are the Planctomycetes. They aregenerally more abundant in marine and freshwater envi-ronments but have been identified at varying abundancesin terrestrial environments including in all Arctic soils(Fig. 3A). Planctomycetes participate in the anaerobicoxidation of ammonium (annamox), which leads to theproduction of N2(Humbert et al ., 2010). Whether theythrive in Arctic soils and are functionally active is yet to© 2018 The Authors.

Thus, rates of anammox in terrestrial Arc-tic environments are currently unknown.A critical functional role to be investigated is the pro-duction and release of nitrous oxide (N 2O) to the atmo-sphere. N 2O is 298 times more potent than CO 2as agreenhouse gas and is released upon permafrost thaw(Palmer et al., 2012). N 2O reacts with ozone (O 3), leadingto the destruction of the ozone layer whilst forming nitrite(NO2−), which returns to Earth as nitrous acid (HNO 2)rain (Madigan et al., 1997; Fierer et al., 2007). N 2Oi sproduced through aerobic nitrification and anaerobicdenitrification (Marushchak et al ., 2011; Palmer et al .,2012). Paracoccus denitrificans (Alphaproteobacteria),Thiobacillus denitrificans (Betaproteobacteria) and somePseudomonas sp. (Gammaproteobacteria) (Baumgärtneret al., 1996) are known to be denitrifiers but their presencein Arctic soils is still to be investigated fully, despite studiesshowing that denitrification occurs and N2O is beingreleased to the atmosphere (Fierer et al., 2007; Palmeret al., 2012). The Arctic region was not considered a largeN2O producer until studies showed a large increase inN2O production and subsequent release in the atmo-sphere following freeze –thaw cycles and rewetting of Arc-tic soils (Elberling et al., 2010). Surprisingly, these rates ofN2O release after rewetting, up to 34 mg N m−2day−1,a r eequivalent to the release of N 2O by tropical forests, whichare amongst the top N 2O producers (Elberling et al .,2010; Palmer et al., 2012). Studies suggest hotspots ofN2O production exist in the Arctic region, and furtherresearch is needed to provide estimations of N 2Orelease, especially in the context of climate changeand permafrost thawing (Elberling et al., 2010; Marush-chak et al., 2011).Archaeal and fungal communities are essential parts ofArctic microbial communities; however, their abundance,diversity and distribution remain largely understudied inthe region.

Euryarchaeota areknown methanogens and due to the adverse role ofCH4as a climate gas, understanding the distribution ofarchaea across the landscape is important. The releaseof methane to the atmosphere is balanced by the action ofmethanotrophs, which use CH4as their carbon source.Methanotrophic species belong mainly to the Gammaproteo-bacteria (type I) and Alphaproteobacteria (type II), althoughsome archaeal species such as members of the Metha-nosarcinales are known methanotrophs (Martineau et al.,2014). Understanding this balance between methano-gens and methanotrophs is important in the view ofthe significant change in these communities upon per-mafrost thaw (Coolen et al., 2011; Mackelprang et al.,2011). Arctic fungal communities appeared variablebut were generally dominated by the Ascomycota andBasidiomycota (Fig. 3D), which are the main terrestrialdecomposers (Wallenstein et al ., 2007; Zhang et al .,2016). Further studies in archaeal and fungal diversitywill provide a better understanding of microbial assem-blages and ecosystem structure.Identifying clear patterns of microbial biogeographyacross the Arctic region using data from studies withdifferent methodologies is difficult, especially consid-ering the challenge of demonstrating absence. Eachregion appears to have similarities, such as compara-ble abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in Finland,Alaska and Svalbard soils wh ilst, in these same soils,variation of Acidobacteria can range from 4% to 20%.Whilst these differences are clear across differentstudies between regions and indicate potential bio-geographic variation, only a Pan-Arctic study using astandardized method could be used to suggest bio-geographical patterns and potentially relate them toenvironmental variables.(A) (B)Fig. 2.

These environmental conditions appeared tobe reflected in the Alpine microbial assemblage (Fig. 4).Alpine soils harboured a higher abundance of Alphapro-teobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria_6, Plancto-mycetia and Spartobacteria, whilst Bacteroidia seemedabsent from these communities, against 10% in Arcticsoils (Fig. 4A and B). Archaeal communities appearedlargely dominated by Thaumarchaeota (up to 90%) whichcontrasts with the balanced Arctic archaeal communities(Supporting Information Fig. S1A). Alpine and Arctic fungalcommunities, on the other hand, seemed relatively simi-lar, both dominated by Asco mycota and Basidiomycota(Supporting Information Fig. S1B). However, archaealand fungal communities are based on a very low num-ber of studies and require further investigation.Antarctica could be viewed as a proxy of Arctic communi-ties as environmental pressures appear similar year-round.Antarctic soils harboured lowered abundances of all classesof Proteobacteria but higher proportions of Chloracidobac-teria, Saprospirae (Bacteroidetes), Actinobacteria and Cya-nobacteria (Fig. 4A and B). However, Antarctica is muchmore isolated than the Arctic region, with the closest landmass over 1000 km away and surrounded by the SouthernOcean ’s circumpolar current and the atmospheric circumpo-lar vortex. This is reflected in the literature by the differencesbetween Alpine, Arctic and Antarctic microbial communities(Fig. 4). These studies indicated apparent differences inmicrobial diversity despite similar environmental selectionpressures across the cryosphere.Global comparisonDespite polar environmental conditions, the microbial bio-mass and diversity of tundra e cosystems appears equivalentto the microbial biomass and diversity in temperate andtropical forests (Lauber et al ., 2009; Chu et al ., 2010).However, tundra microbial communities generally clusteraway from other biomes in global diversity studies (Fiereret al., 2012; Tedersoo et al., 2014). Worldwide bacterialsoil communities appear dominated by Proteobacteria,Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes(Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018), whilst Proteobacteriaand Acidobacteria dominate Arctic soil microbial com-munities. Crenarchaeota are most abundant in globalarchaeal communities (Auguet et al., 2010), whilst 90% ofArctic archaeal communities can be dominated by Euryarch-aeota (Fig. 3C). Finally Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota)largely dominate fungal communities, especially in tropicaland temperate soils (Tedersoo et al., 2014), whilst Ascomy-cota appear to dominate by up to 80% in Arctic soils(Fig. 3D). These variations in microbial communities arelikely driven by environmental conditions; however, otherfactors such as proximity to human activities or high plantand animal biomass are kno wn to have strong impacts.Whilst global and Arctic soil communities do appear differ-ent, only large-scales studies, such as the Earth Microbiomeproject (Thompson et al., 2017), can identify and highlightthese differences.Drivers of Arctic microbial communitiesEnvironmental influencepH.pH has been identified as the main factor drivingbacterial diversity in many soil studies (Fierer andJackson, 2006; Rousk et al ., 2010; Griffiths et al .,2011; Chong et al ., 2012; Docherty et al ., 2015),including in Arctic soils (Chu et al ., 2010; Sicilianoet al., 2014). Some taxon abundances are closely cor-related with soil pH, notably the Acidobacteria (Lauberet al ., 2009; Rousk et al ., 2010). However, not allAcidobacteria subdivisions behave the same way andwhilst some subdivisions increase in abundance in lowpH, such as SD1 and SD2, others increase in highpH, such as SD6 and SD16 (Lauber et al ., 2009;Table 1.

Whetherother taxa vary with soil pH is still largely undeter-mined. Lauber and colleagues (2009) showed thatActinobacteria and Bacteroidetes abundance decreasewith lower pH in a wide variety of soils whilst Rouskand colleagues (2010) demonstrated they remained unaf-fected in arable soils. These results suggest that pH has astrong impact on bacterial communities but may be spe-cies specific and vary geographically. The study by Sici-liano and colleagues (2014) suggests pH may also be amajor driver of microbial diversity in northern polar regions.pH, in turn, can be impacted by many processes bothmicrobial and nonmicrobial such as plant growth, microbialmetabolism or weathering (Kwon et al ., 2015), nutrientcycling such as nitrification, or acid rain and acid minedrainage (Baker and Banfield, 2003). Although studies cor-relate pH with microbial communities, the processes bywhich pH regulates these communities still remainunknown.Vegetation cover. Vegetation cover is known to have astrong impact on microbial communities, and in the Arc-tic, studies have shown variations in microbial diversityand abundance linked to vegetation. Wallenstein and col-leagues (2007) identified differences in bacterial diversitybetween shrub and tussock tundra soils. Acidobacteriarepresented up to 45% of the tussock tundra community,against less than 10% in shrub soils. This shift in(A) (C)(B) (D)Fig. 3.

These studies have demonstrated the impact ofvegetation on microbial communities in the Arctic; how-ever, the magnitude of impact appears to vary bylocation.Rhizosphere. The rhizosphere is defined by the plant rootsystem and its exudates (Berg and Smalla, 2009). As aresult, microbial abundance and activity are enhanced(Berendsen et al ., 2012), whilst microbial diversity isgenerally lower with the dominance of few taxa(Philippot et al ., 2013). In the Arctic region, studieshave shown that rhizosphere microbial diversity ishigher than in nonrhizosphere bulk soils (Tam et al .,2001; Kumar et al ., 2016). However, the number ofArctic studies differentiating bulk and rhizospheremicrobial communities is low.Other factors. pH and vegetation are the main knowndrivers of worldwide microbial communities, and Arcticmicrobial communities are no exception. However, otherfactors may be involved, as studies of worldwide soilshave demonstrated the impact of salinity (Lozupone andKnight, 2007), moisture content (Dimitriu and Grayston,2010) and C:N ratio (Docherty et al., 2015) on microbialcommunities. Other factors may include temperature,ice formation/duration, light, altitude, soil age and tex-ture, nutrient and elemental composition, water avail-ability or pollution. Whilst all these factors are likely tohave some impact of microbial assemblages, the magni-tude and influence have not yet been established forArctic soil communities.TimeTime, on different scales, is known to impact higher organ-isms, but the impact on microbial communities is not wellestablished, especially for the Arctic Region. Short-termvariation has been demonstrated by seasonal fluctuations,especially in Alpine environments, where the snowmeltand growing season impact microbial communities (Lipsonet al., 2002; Zinger et al., 2009) with an increase in bio-mass in summer (Lipson et al., 2002; Lipson and Schmidt,2004) corresponding to an increase of Verrucomicrobiaand an overall decrease of Acidobacteria and Alphaproteo-bacteria (Lipson and Schmidt, 2004). A similar seasonalpattern has been observed in Arctic tundra, likely linked tothe sudden availability of water and nutrient, promotingmicrobial growth (Buckeridge et al., 2013). However, onlyyear-long studies or monitoring studies could identifychanges in microbial communities with time.SpaceSpatial patterns of biodiversity give insights into ecologi-cal mechanisms such as speciation, extinction, dispersaland species interactions (Martiny et al., 2006). High habi-tat heterogeneity can lead to many niches harbouring dif-ferent microbial communities, which is a major challengein investigating microbial biodiversity and biogeography(Vos et al., 2013). The scale of investigation is importantas different scales may uncover alternative drivers ofmicrobial community diversity. For instance, Martiny andcolleagues (2011) identified sediment moisture as astrong driver of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria diversity onsmall and regional scales, but it was not significant oncontinental scales.Understanding large-scale patterns is increasinglyimportant to understand large-scale biogeochemicalcycling and how it may be impacted as a result of climatechange. One of the earliest large-scale biogeographicalstudies carried by Fierer and Jackson (2006) demon-strated that distinct types of forest and grassland eco-systems harboured similar microbial communities,regardless of geographic distances. Later on, Fiererand colleagues (2012) further supported these resultsby demonstrating that most environment types clustertogether, except cold and hot deserts, which clusterindependently of other ecosystems. These results sug-gest that microbial diversity of extreme ecosystemsmay be particularly different, whilst other nonextremeenvironments may harbour similar communities. Whilstthis is still unclear, few studies have shown latitudinaland altitudinal gradients (Yergeau et al ., 2007; Wanget al ., 2015; Siles and Margesin, 2016) in both Alpineregions and Antarctica, as well as distinct geographicregions harbouring variable diversity in Antarctica(Chong et al., 2015). Multiple studies have also shownthe decrease in diversity with soil depth in Arctic soils(Liebner et al ., 2008; Frank-Fahle et al ., 2014), sug-gesting stratification of Arctic microbial communities inthe active layer and the permafrost.Although terrestrial microbial biogeography is stilldebated, clear biogeographic patterns have been identi-fied in the oceans and the air (Womack et al., 2010), twoof the most connected environments. Studies have dem-onstrated that microorganisms exhibit biogeographicaldistribution, varying seasonally (Ghiglione et al ., 2012)and with temperature (Ngugi et al., 2012), depth (Qianet al ., 2011) and salinity gradients (Herlemann et al .,2011). Furthermore, Ghiglione and colleagues (2012)showed that marine microbial communities cluster apartfrom one another, suggesting that biomes with similarenvironmental pressure may still harbour different micro-bial communities.

The Arctic region presents such characteristics, andthus, hotspots of diversity could potentially occur. Forlarger organisms, hotspots of biodiversity can be foundworldwide, from the Amazon forest to the coral trianglein the Pacific, and Madagascar with 90% of endemicspecies. Despite the essential role of microorganisms inecosystem function, only f ew studies have identifiedsuch microbial diversity hotspots worldwide. Identifiedareas include Hawaii (Donachie et al ., 2004), Chile(Dorador et al ., 2013) and even Antarctica (Ji et al .,2016). Many studies in the Arctic region report highdiversity, similar to levels observed in worldwide soils(Torsvik et al ., 1996; Neufeld and Mohn, 2005; Leeet al., 2013), yet, no geographical region has been char-acterized as significantly harbouring higher diversity.Arctic soil diversity may increase due to inoculation fromother environments such as snow cover or meltwater(Larose et al ., 2010) or even through aerial dispersal(Pearce et al ., 2016). Areas of convergence could behotspots of diversity but may support many allochtho-nous organisms with little functional significance for theenvironment (Neufeld and Mohn, 2005). Identifying suchhotspots of biodiversity may indicate areas with highbioprospecting potential.Commercial and industrial bioprospectingCurrent research activity is skewed towards groups oforganisms presenting high potential for economic exploi-tation. In this light, identifying hotspots of microbial diver-sity will indicate areas with high bioprospecting potentialfor industrial, commercial or medical purposes. This iscertainly one area of activity, which is ongoing and which,in the future, will help to develop further knowledge ofmicrobial diversity in this area. Extremophiles are espe-cially relevant for bioprospecting as they exhibit com-mercially exploitable traits. True psychrophiles, althoughrare, are the most common t ype of extremophile in theArctic region. Cryptococcus species are psychrophilicyeasts identified in Arctic habitats, notably soils and gla-ciers (D ’Amico et al ., 2006; Buzzini et al ., 2012), butTable 2.

Although organisms may be in the same phylum,they may have distinct roles and functions11 As technology improves, studies adapt and, thus, differentmethods of identification are used through timeThe variations and biases involved lead to great difficulties inaccurate comparison between ecosystems across spaceand time© 2018 The Authors.

Extremophiles are often polyextremophilic orhighly tolerant to multiple stress factors such as low pHor high salinity. A few Psychrobacter species are bothpsychrophilic and halot olerant (Bakermans et al., 2006)whilst Nesterenkonia sp. AN1, isolated from Antarcticsoils, is psychrotolerant but haloalkaliphilic (Aliyu et al.,2016). When the environment becomes unfavourable,some organisms are capable of producing endosporesto ensure survival (Madigan et al., 1997). Species fromthe Bacillaceae family such as Virgibacillus arcticus ,isolated from the Canadian high Arctic permafrost areknown to form endospores (Niederberger et al., 2009).Yukimura and colleagues (2009) identified strains inGreenland genetically identical to previously identified spe-cies from the Gobi Desert, suggesting the role of endo-spores not only for survival but also for long distancedispersal. Despite polar environmental conditions, mostmicroorganisms living in Arctic soils are not extremophilic.Psychrotrophs dominate cold environments, and althoughmost of these organisms can survive at low to subzerotemperatures, they grow optimally at higher temperatures(Morita, 1975; Huston et al ., 2000). Pseudomonassp. stains B17 and B18 grow between 0 and 30/C14Cw i t hoptimum growth at 25/C14C. However, they are metaboli-cally active at 5/C14C and can degrade both, alkanesand naphthalene, from petroleum hydrocarbon (Whyteet al., 1997). Some cold-adapted organisms are able toproduce antifreeze proteins, which, in the food industry,are widely used to prevent microbial contamination,enhance cryopreservation of cell tissues and preservetexture and flavour of frozen foods (Robinson, 2001;Leary, 2008). These proteins have been identified inmicroorganisms such as fungi (reviewed by Robinson, 2001)and in few bacterial species, mainly Gammaproteobacteriaisolated from Antarctic lakes (Gilbert et al., 2004). Somemicroorganisms also produ ce cold-active or psychro-philic enzymes, which are more active and stable at lowtemperatures than mesophilic enzymes and thus, couldbe used for low temperature industrial processes (Fellerand Gerday, 2003).Medical bioprospectingIn the coming decades, bioprospecting for medical pur-poses will potentially become a priority due to theincreased abundance of antibiotic resistance and multidrug resistant strains. Diversity hotspots will be primetargets as microorganisms live in close proximity andcompete for resources and thus, develop ways to com-pete with each other. Soils, especially close to humanactivity, are reservoirs and incubators for antibioticresistance (Walsh, 2013), but recent studies suggestpristine environments, such as Arctic soils, may alsoact as reservoirs for resistance and thus, reservoirs forantimicrobial compounds (Mindlin et al., 2008; Segawaet al ., 2013). Fungi are a promising source of newmetabolites as they have been identified in manyextreme environments and have developed specializedways to survive and thrive in harsh conditions (reviewedby Gostin /C20caret al ., 2010). For instance, some fungalspecies associated with Antarctic sponges have beenshown to have antimicrobial and antitumoral activities(Henríquez et al., 2014). Actinomycetes are one of themajor sources of antibiotics worldwide and Arctic Acti-nomycetes have strong potential for bioprospecting(Bredholdt et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2016). For example,theStreptomyces sp. ART5 strain, isolated from East-ern Siberia sediments, shows inhibitory activity againstCandida albicans (Moon et al., 2014). A significant find-ing is that of Augustine and colleagues (2012) who iden-tified three species of Ar ctic Actinomycetes, twoStreptomyces species and one Nocardiopsis species,isolated from sediments in Svalbard, with the potentialto inhibit Vibrio cholerae biofilms.ChallengesThe number of Arctic studies specifically on microbialdiversity is sparse (Fig. 1), and older studies lack taxo-nomic depth due to sequencing limitations at the time.Even now, most studies report identification only to thephylum level as the depth of sequencing does not alwaysallow the accurate identification of microorganisms atother levels of classification making functional assess-ment challenging. For instance, classification at the classlevel could inform that Bacillus and Clostridium , bothknown cellulose degraders (Killham and Prosser, 2015),are present and potentially active. At the genus level,information on the potential for ammonia-oxidation couldbe obtained if the Nitrosomonas genus is identified.Either a change in taxonomic classification towards moreecologically meaningful categories (Fierer et al., 2007) orimproved sequencing tools (Sangal et al ., 2016) arerequired if we aim to understand the role of microorgan-isms in the environment from diversity data. Otherwise,whole genome sequencing should be prioritized. Further-more, microorganisms, which are not detected, are notnecessarily absent from the investigated environment. Itshould also be noted that Arctic sites are restricted bylogistical access and most sampled sites are coastal sites(Fig. 1), which may receive oceanic influences. The mag-nitude of oceanic influence on these sites has not beeninvestigated but should be considered. Technologicalimprovements combined with a larger variety of samplingsites and deeper taxonomic classification would lead to a© 2018 The Authors.

As they are the result of studies using dif-ferent methodologies, only a large pan-Arctic study couldprovide a deeper understanding of these patterns andthe drivers associated with them. As the Arctic region iscurrently undergoing rapid change and the InternationalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) is predicting anincrease in temperature of 2 –5/C14C by the end of the 21stcentury (IPCC, 2014), increased research efforts are nec-essary to understand the potential consequences of suchchange on microbial communities and their functionalpotential. Indeed, increase in temperature will lead to fas-ter and deeper thawing of the permafrost and thus, tohigher microbial activity and likely increased release ofgreenhouse gases. With Arctic warming, will Arctic micro-bial communities experience high rates of extinctions, willthey adapt to new environmental conditions or will theirrange change towards their preferred environmental con-ditions at the same rate of climatic modification and howwill this impact ecosystems? Understanding the currentdiversity of Arctic microbial communities and biogeo-graphical patterns is the basis to answer these questionsand to improve the understanding of ecosystem function,which will allow the production of more accurate climatemodels through a deeper understanding of microbialinteractions and the potential perturbation of their roles innutrient cycling. It will also provide a baseline to monitorchanges in these communities in the future.
