An application of the QARDL approach dis-closes that economic growth, technology innovation, and renewable energy signifi-cantly influence CO2emission in the transportation sector in China. Both renewableenergy consumption and innovation show a negative impact on emissions of CO 2related to transport. It depicts that due to the increase in renewable energy and inno-vation, the CO2emission in the transport sector is likely to decrease; however, anincrease in the GDP of a country will upsurge the emission of CO 2in the transporta-tion sector. However, China should make new policies to introduce innovation in thetransportation sector to minimize the emission of CO 2.KEYWORDSQARLD model, renewable energy, sustainable development, technology innovation1|INTRODUCTIONChanges in climate have turned out to be significantly extreme duringthe last several decades, a hot concern for argument worldwide and aglobal happening due to the hazard to sustainable advancement(Destek & Sarkodie, 2019; Nathaniel & Khan 2020). Due to a boost inthe destruction of environmental pollution that is affecting the wholeworld resulting in creating environmental issues which in turn con-straining the decision related to economic growth and development-associated decisions (Khan et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020), sustainablegrowth has now become a key concern for countries. Over a previouscouple of decades, environmental contaminants have turned out to beone of the biggest global concerns because of huge boosts in green-house gas (GHG) emissions (Khan et al., 2017b; Khan et al., 2017a;Dogan & Seker, 2016). The GHG continues to increase regardless ofthe projected implications of unabated variation in climate. Develop-ment of an economy cannot be attained without an influence on thesurroundings, as Deviren and Deviren (2016) and Esso andKeho (2016) put it. CO2emissions (CO 2_EMS) and economic growth(ECO_GRW) had substantial policy implications for the environment.CO 2_EMS has been a leading issue, and all efforts have been put toeliminate it. This boom is attributable to enhanced day-to-day humanpursuits (Kaplan, 2015). The world's populace is growing continuouslyand requires an increase in goods and services; therefore, the nexusReceived: 2 September 2020 Revised: 19 December 2020 Accepted: 3 January 2021DOI: 10.1002/sd.2167694 © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Moreover, activi-ties performed at the industrial level require higher consumption offossil fuel as well as energy consumption which results in higher emis-sion of CO2in the process of production and technological develop-ment as well (Szklo & Schaeffer, 2007), which consequentlycontribute to environmental degradation.With a swift increase in population which results in economicadvancement and technological progression, the requirement forenergy in developed and developing nations has enhanced. Accordingto Saidi and Ben Mbarek (2016), though energy consumption(EN_CON) can result in ECO_GRW, it is the primary cause of environ-mental degradation. With the advancement of the industry,CO2_EMS, in specific, has sharply boosted (Chen, 2016). Furthermore,according to the anticipation of IPCC (2007), CO 2_EMS, that is, specif-ically related to energy, will increase between 40 and 110% by 2030.Hence, it is vital to examine the EN_CON that is related to the aspectsthat affect variations in CO 2_EMS to comprehend energy conserva-tion and emission minimization to achieve an economy with lowcarbon.A larger number of studies have focused on EN_CON andECO_GRW considering them as the key variables responsible forCO 2-EMS. However, following the study of Zhang (2010), it wasfound that EN_CON and ECO_GRW alone may fail to clarify varia-tions in CO2_EMS. Indeed to achieve sustainable economic advance-ment, nations have switched their focus to the growth andapplication of renewable en ergy (REN_EN) consumption.Sadorsky (2009) found that we will be dependent on REN_EN con-sumption in the future. In 2014, REN_EN accounted for 19.2% ofthe global final EN_CON. The IEA forecasted that REN_EN con-sumption will be the speediest gr owing aspect of worldwide energyneeds (Chen & Lei, 2018 ). Quite some nations are interested in thereduction of CO2_EMS and EN_CON along with improving the pro-ductivity of the manufacturing industries (Zhang, Zhou, &Kung, 2015). According to Ramli, Muis, Ho, Idris, and Mohtar (2019),REN_EN plays a key role in environmental concerns as it is classi-fied as a fuel source with no-emi ssion, which can be utilized asalternative traditional fossil fuels. Policymakers have recognizedthe significance of minimizing CO2_EMS in making national policiesrelated to energy and economy, which demands insight into thebehaviors of CO 2_EMS and checking emission performance.Innovation has also been pronounced as an essential factor ineconomic advancement. Economic development dependent on tech-nology is most evident in various industries (Anser et al., 2020a). Asnations struggle to progress, there is a boost in their economic actionswhich cause an increase in EN_CON, as a result, spurring CO2_EMS.Ignoring the effect of the environment on progress is in no wayadvantageous. There are several channels by using which innovationscan impact emissions. Innovation stimulates improvements in produc-tivity and growth of an economy and triggers a shift in the directionof low-carbon energy. Besides, innovation speeds up technicaladvancement as it enables better economic output while utilizing theidentical amount of other inputs. According to Long, Chen, Du, Oh,and Han (2017), environmental innovation positively influenced theeconomic and environmental functionality of Korea-owned busi-nesses in China.The influence of information and communication technology (ICT)on the community has grown to be a hot concern of debate duringthe last couple of years. The growing significance of ICT would proba-bly reshape modern society, and it would also lead to the conse-quence of the upcoming civilization. ICT forms the basis for trackingclimate variation, mitigating and adjusting its consequences, andaiding in the changeover to a green economy. ICT is vital for industri-alization, eventually affecting environmental quality and ECO_GRW(Khan & Qianli 2017b; Danish, Baloch, Saud, & Fatima, 2018).Irrespective of the uplifting role of ICT in economic advancement(Toader, Firtescu, Roman, & Anton, 2018), little consideration hasbeen given to the potential environmental implications of ICT, such asmobile, satellites, phones, and the Internet. The role of all these isquite significant in dealing with the principle challenges concerning cli-mate transform and sustainable advancement. Moreover, Zhou, Zhou,Wang, and Su (2019), found that it is crucial to perceive the CO2_EMSeffects of ICT in the current digital age while dealing with climatechange problems.Kang, Zhao, and Yang (2016), found that technology is providingthe platform for the world to get closer and aiding to fix the predica-ments. It is noted that environmental degradation enhances thegrowth of the economy but decreases with technological advance-ment. Technical innovation (TEC_INV) is also vital in enhancing energyefficiency (Hang & Tu, 2007; Khan et al., 2021a; Nan, Levine, &Price, 2010); it is an aspect that is worthy of our consideration whenwe browse the main determinants of CO2_EMS. The latest technologyfacilitates the economy to generate a level of productivity that con-sumes low energy (Sohag, Begum, Abdullah, & Jaafar, 2015) andhence reduces CO2_EMS. Additionally, technological advancementcould result in quicker acceptance of REN_EN to encounter energydemands and alter the energy utilization structure.Additionally, ECO_GRW also leads the country to produce moreproducts and services, specifically with ICT usage (Anon Higón et al.,2017), and ECO_GRW is likely to enhance ICT products and services,due to which CO 2_EMS upsurges. However, the environmentalKuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis claims that, at first, pollution aggra-vates with per capita increase but subsequently more income reducespollution (Anser et al., 2020b; Khan et al., 2020a). Economic advance-ment has effects on the environment through three channels. Initially,the income through the scale effect damages the environment andcompromises technological change and economic structure (Khanet al., 2020b; Andrée, Chamorro, Spencer, Koomen, & Dogo, 2019).Secondly, the composition effect reduces the damaging impacts ofincome through structural modifications in the economy. Finally, theinfluence decreases pollution because of adopting the innovationsthat are environmentally friendly and further application of rigorousenvironment-related standards; this is acknowledged as the techniqueeffect. The technique and composition effect dominates the scaleeffect and leads to the inverted U-shape nexus between pollution andincome. The concept of EKC was extensively explored; someGODIL ET AL. 695 10991719, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.2167 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

It has a “veto ”power among the nations of the UN SecurityCouncil and belongs to communist believers. China is at the Stage-2level of development among 137 nations, as per the review of theGlobal Competitiveness Index 2017 –2018, issued by the World Eco-nomic Forum. The population of China was 1.437 million by March-2020 (China Population —Worldometer, 2020). In 2019, total energyconsumed (standard coal) was approximately 4.64 billion metric tons.In 2018, CO2_EMS in China was approximately 9,232.6 million tonesaccounted for 27.6% of the world total, while in 2017, the total pri-mary consumption of energy (oil) was 3,132.2 million tones equal to23.2% of the world total, making China the chief consumer of energyin the world (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2018; Interna-tional Energy Agency. World Energy Outlook, 2013).According to Nan et al. (2010), China is the source of more than1/4 of global CO2_EMS, further, according to Sohag et al. (2015), agreat deal of expansion in CO 2_EMS was due to the demand for heatand electricity. Transportation is an underlying requirement for asociety's advancement and growth of an individual's life. TheCO2_EMS in the field of transport has drawn the focus ofpolicymakers simultaneously in the field of climate change and trans-port, considering the portion in total emissions and consistent growth.As the Chinese economy evolved in recent decades, the significanceof transport (specifically the road one) has been noticed for both pro-longed ECO_GRW and the advancement of lifestyle. According toWang (2000), freight and passenger transportation has boosted by8 and 15 times, respectively, throughout the preceding two decades.In China, road transport has steadily become the leading portion ofthe transportation structure. As an outcome, road transportation uti-lizes oil and releases a huge quantity of CO2(He et al., 2005). If onecompares the utilization of oil by road transport system of China withthat of total oil utilization, it was found to be much lower than indeveloped countries. However, the availability of fuel might become achallenge for China because of the swift growth of road transport.The transportation sector emits about 1/4 of the world'sCO2_EMS (IEA, 2011). The CO 2_EMS of developed economies due tothe transport sector has turned out to be a significant reason for thedomestic CO 2_EMS. CO 2_EMS China's transport sector has also con-siderably elevated due to the swift boost in the number of vehicles.Since 1990, the transport segment which has already been liable foran eightfold rise in final oil utilization (PBL Netherlands EnvironmentalAssessment Agency, 2013) could be a significant contributor toCO2_EMS growth, due to sales of new passenger cars attaining about2.6 million by the end of 2019 (IEA, 2019). Thus Chinese roadTCO2_EMS, which happened to be less than 300 Mt in 2007 (Ou,Zhang, & Chang, 2010), could expand to become a significant contrib-utor to worldwide CO 2_EMS by 2050.According to the National Development and Reform Commission,(2004), in 1994, the CO 2_EMS of China's transport sector was166 MT, which was approximately 5.40% of the total CO 2_EMS. Theofficial figures of transport EN_CON of China only consist of theEN_CON of automobiles employed in commercial functions butexclude the consumption by noncommercial means (such ascompany-owned automobiles, private automobiles, and government-owned automobiles) (Wu, 2007; Geng et al., 2009), which is the prin-cipal source of transport CO2_EMS (TCO 2_EMS) of China. The lack ofdetail related to fuel consumption in road transportation is the mainhurdle for figuring out CO 2_EMS in the transport industry. China'sMinistry of Environmental Protection established the first China Pollu-tion Source Census, which was completed in 2010 and collected com-prehensive facts from 1.58 million establishments which include fuelconsumption particulars at the facility level.Although energy and CO2_EMS efficiency in many areas havebeen extensively reviewed in China, a couple of researches have cen-tered on the transportation business (Zhang, 2013). There were alsomuch fewer studies and discussions carried out at the local level (Caiet al., 2012). Analyzing the costs and strategies related to the reduc-tion in CO2_EMS and the possibilities of implementing a variety oflow-carbon innovations in this segment is subsequently of vitalsignificance.Zhou et al., (2013), have measured the performance of CO 2_EMSof the territorial transportation industry and revealed that the efficientareas have reduced since 2004, and in 2006, it has reached the lowestrecord while it was again improved afterward. Chang et al., (2013)measured the ways for CO2_EMS and prospective reductions for thelocal transport industry; the outcomes revealed that the majority ofthe regions in China do not own a transportation industry that is eco-efficient. Zhou, Chung, and Zhang (2014), researched the energy effi-ciency and possible energy savings for the industry related to thetransport of China by utilizing the DEA method. They found thatcumulative energy saving was nearly 2.75% of the energy utilized intransport. Zhang Liu, (2015) found that the reduction in performanceof CO2_EMS is due to technological downfall.Several studies have presented situations for EN_CON andCO 2_EMS in the transport industry of China. There are CO 2_EMS andEN_CON situations for transport and other industries from 2005 to2050 with different models presented by, for example, (Chen, 2005).These research studies divide the transport sector into 10 modalities(railway, air, bus, waterway, and car for the passengers, and railway,waterway, air, and pipeline for freight transport).In a study, Wang, Zhang, and Zhou (2011) calculated the demandfor freight transport services concerning passenger transport and eco-nomic activity on predicted mean kilometers covered by differentmodes such as train, bus, etc. The projections were till 2050. Differentenergy saving possibilities were analyzed by Fu (2011) concerning thesituations that are related to the betterment of energy efficiency.Other researchers such as Liu, Ma, Ren, and Zhao (2020), have alsoevaluated CO2_EMS and EN_CON from an international viewpoint.The existing research adds up to the existing literature as being afounding effort that examines the nexus between EC_GRO, TEC_INV,and REN_EN with TCO 2_EMS in China. Earlier studies could not beperceived as conclusive simply because these types of variables werenot researched in the nexus of TCO 2_EMS. Keeping this fact in mind,696 GODIL ET AL. 10991719, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.2167 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Even though it ischallenging to visualize the advancement of the TCO2_EMS and itsnexus with EC_GRO, TEC_INV, and REN_EN, still, it is to expressmore actionable and potential approaches to assist the businessnetwork and express the future a pproaches in line with the realscenario.Experts in earlier studies had concentrated on the implementa-tion of appropriate methodology to deal with the gaps but theusage of QARDL in this work has made it distinct from the earlierwork. The current empirical research studies have considered thetraditional research techniques such as exploring the causationamong the said variables while neglecting the quantiles. Therefore,final policy implications cannot be adopted based on inappropriateand inconsistent results. Howev er, the existing study utilizes amore refined and best-suited methodology to broaden the exami-nation by adding new comprehensions to the EC_GRO, TEC_INV,a n dR E N _ E Nw i t hT C O2_EMS nexus. Such insights authenticatethe choice of the QARDL approach to link up these hardships ofagreement hence bordering all th e specified gaps. The existingresearch is to institute this strategy to reassess the nexus amongEC_GRO, TEC_INV, and REN_EN with TCO2_EMS.The QARDL method substantially differs from the previousmethods because of its being more extensive and superior to linearmodels. This superiority is based on a couple of grounds. Initially,locational asymmetries are considered in this model, where out-comes and the factors may be contingent on the state of thedependent variable, that is, TCO2_EMS within its conditional distri-bution. Subsequently, the QARDL technique concurrently takesinto account the long-term nexus of EC_GRO, TEC_INV, andREN_EN with TCO 2_EMS, and its associated short-term character-istics over the quantiles ranges of the conditional dissemination ofTCO 2_EMS.Lastly, in contrast to the present research, a couple of specificinvestigations discover a sign of the absence of cointegration inbetween these time series, at the time of implementing conventionaleconometric techniques, such as the linear ARDL model. This short-coming could conveniently be elaborated by the accessibility of mea-surement related to quantile varying cointegration at the short-termlevel, irrespective of the point that, in long run, the factors remainmoving constantly (Xiao, 2009). In the QARDL model, because of theshocks, the cointegrating coefficient shifts over the quantile.The QARDL is also superior over the models formulated by Shin,Yu, and Greenwood-Nimmo (2011), that is, NARDL —Nonlinear Auto-regressive Distributed Lag model in which nonlinearly is determinedby setting up the intensity level at zero in contrast to the QARDLmodel where it is set up according to the data-driven procedure. Dueto these powerful proofs, the QARDL methodology turns out to bemost appropriate for asymmetric and nonlinear nexus of EC_GRO,TEC_INV, and REN_EN with TCO2_EMS in China.The outstanding sections of this paper are set in the followingmanner: Section 2 includes the review of the previous literature; Sec-tion 3 discusses data analysis; estimations, result from analysis,outcomes, and related discussion are revealed in Section 4, and at lastin Section 5, policy implications have been advised.2|LITERATURE REVIEWEnvironmental pollution has become a global concern that requires afocused effort to minimize the CO 2_EMS threat. Each associationadopts a different tactic to deal with the issues related to carbon, andthe stimuli behind the acts have been hypothesized and contended(Raybould, Cheung, Connor, & Butcher, 2020). Many pieces ofresearch have been carried out on the nexus between CO2_EMS andECO_GRW. Grossman & Krueger, (1991), formulated the EKC hypoth-esis which explains that ECO_GRW and environmental degradation(gauged by CO 2_EMS) have nonlinear nexus and are inverted-U-shaped. It reveals that ECO_GRW prospects to an on-going degrada-tion of the surroundings but after a certain point of ECO_GRW, itbegins to get better again. Similar consequences were discovered inthe research studies of (Kais & Sami, 2016; Khan et al., 2018; Khanet al., 2019b; Zhu, Xia, Guo, & Peng, 2018). A variety of proxies ofECO_GRW upsurges CO2_EMS have been validated in many types ofresearch like (Chang, 2010; Chebbi, 2010; Shiyi, 2009).A couple of the experts reported the negative or mixed influenceof ECO_GRW on CO 2_EMS (Chandran & Tang, 2013; Sharma, 2011).Liobikien ėet al (2019) revealed in their research on 147 nations thatGDP contributes toward the reduction of CO 2_EMS only throughenergy efficiency. For the same reason, nations should focus on tech-nological advancement and energy efficiency as they look for sustain-able ECO_GRW. According to Talbi (2017), energy efficiency has aprincipal role in lowering CO2_EMS, his conclusions contrast to thatof Liobikien ėand Butkus (2019) on ECO_GRW in CO 2_EMS reductionobservance.However, Egbetokun et al. (2020) discovered N-shaped nexusbetween ECO_GRW and CO 2_EMS. The fall of EKC after the levelfrom where income increases are not fixed and if environmental legis-lation and technical innovation are not urged, then community fallsinto a trap of obsolescence that is related to technology where societyreverts to growing environmental pollution ahead of the EKC(Balsalobre-Lorente, Shahbaz, Tiwari, & Jabbour, 2018). This even fur-ther stresses the inclusion of energy innovation and tight environmen-tal guidelines into the advancement process at all phases to abstainfrom the influence of technical obsolescence.Dogan & Turkekul, (2016), unveiled EN_CON into the nexusbetween CO2_EMS and ECO_GRW and discovered the nonexistenceof the EKC hypothesis. Expert, for example, Dogan et al, (2016),viewed the existence of causality (i.e., bidirectional) betweenCO 2_EMS and ECO_GRW. In fact, existing research studies were alsounsuccessful in finding the pieces of evidence related to the impact ofECO_GRW on CO2_EMS (Chen & Lei, 2018).The impact of EN_CON on CO 2_EMS is also questionable.Jayanthakumaran, Verma, and Liu (2012) highlighted that, in China,among others, income and EN_CON are some of the reasons forCO2_EMS. Accordingly, attainment of swift economic growth isGODIL ET AL. 697 10991719, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.2167 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensepossible through consumption of energy at a higher rate than eventu-ally causing CO 2emission that links to influence the environment(Khan, Ali, Kirikkaleli, Wahab, & Jiao, 2020; Khan et al., 2018). In linewith this, a higher rate of energy consumption causing an increase inthe allocation of energy resources in order to perform productionactivities which are viewed as a critical aspect for investment andgrowth (Edame & Okoi, 2015). Despite economic development, utili-zation of resources has a detrimental effect on environmental qualitydue to the consumption of energy and fossil fuel causing an increasein emission of CO2(Razzaq, Sharif, Ahmad, & Jermsittiparsert, 2020).Though economic growth is of importance for countries on one side,yet the sustainability of future generations on the other side emergesas one of the challenges for both developing as well as developedcountries. Few scholars determined that total EN_CON has a directinfluence on CO2_EMS (Dogan et al., 2016, Wang, Li, Fang, &Zhou, 2016). Whereas, as per Omri (2013), there was causality, that is,(unidirectional) from EN_CON to CO 2_EMS. Some, for example, (BenJebli, Ben Youssef, & Ozturk, 2016, Sulaiman et al., 2013) also discov-ered that REN_EN consumption lessened CO2_EMS. Farhani & BenRejeb, (2012), and López-Menéndez, Pérez, and Moreno (2014),endorsed that REN_EN consumption has a direct influence onCO2_EMS. Additionally, Chiu & Chang, (2009) believed that REN_ENconsumption and GDP added to CO 2_EMS for a lower threshold,while REN_EN usage lessened the CO 2_EMS for the upper threshold.The environmental influence of ICT has continued to be a hotpoint of discussion for the last couple of years. Lennerfors, Fors, andvan Rooijen (2015), found that the introduction of transport structure,smart metropolitan areas, manufacturing procedure, and energy-saving benefits on an international scale are supposed to minimize thelevel of CO2_EMS. ICT in numerous areas of the economy,(e.g., power, transport, energy, financial and agriculture, etc.) alsolowers CO2_EMS. Furthermore, the utilization of machines thatreduce labor work can be beneficial in the reduction of CO 2_EMSrather than utilizing labor at a big scale and mechanization in varioussectors (Salahuddin and Alam, 2015).China has attained excellence in technology especially because ofsteeper ICT insight and a boost in the Foreign Direct Investment(FDI). Due to FDI, China has introduced the latest technologies. Moreadvancement of this market would enhance the development ofincreasing digital businesses and create the essential condition to initi-ate new ones. The contribution of China in the advancement of thetechnology industry might generate favorable spillovers to the tradi-tional technology giants (World Economic Outlook, 2018).The research on the nexus between ICT and CO2_EMS is brokendown into two constituents. In the first one, the experts have deter-mined that ICT mitigates the degree of CO 2_EMS (Lu, 2018). Further-more, Ozcan & Apergis, (2017), determined the influence of Internetusage on CO2_EMS in growing nations. The outcomes of a specificstudy suggest that Internet utilization reduces the probability of airpollution. A study about the influence of online shopping onCO 2_EMS simultaneously in developing and developed nations wasundertaken by Al-Mulali et al. (2015). The scientific outcomes indicatethat due to Internet utilization, outdoor exercises are minimized,which results in the reduction of EN_CON and ultimately inTCO 2_EMS in developed nations.However, online shopping is not that beneficial in developingnations due to the slow speed of the Internet. Recent research byShahnazi and Shabani (2020), mentioned the inverted U-shaped nexusbetween ICT and CO2_EMS on an international scale in the case ofIran and revealed that in the initial stage of advancement of ICT, itdeteriorates the environmental standard, but, pollution decreases withmore advancement in the ICT field.Long, Luo, Wu, and Zhang (2018) determined that innovation failsto disturb CO2_EMS in BRICS nations. Similarly, Yu and Du (2018), andWang, Sun, and Wang (2018) noticed that advancement in energy tech-nology has a significant role in the reduction of CO2_EMS. The result ofBalsalobre-Lorente, Shahbaz, Roubaud, and Farhani (2018) research onEU-5 for the years covering 1985 –2016 revealed that energy innova-tion stimulates a quality environment. In support of this notion, Sam-argandi (2017) found that significant technology innovation inmanufacturing will eventually minimize the damaging impact of emis-sions. Furthermore, from the empirical viewpoint, Yii et al., (2017), eval-uated the causal nexus between CO2_EMS and technology innovationin Malaysia. The research covered the period from 1971 –2013, and theresearchers discovered that technology innovation has an indirect rela-tion, that is, (negative) with CO 2_EMS in the short run, recommendingthat policy initiators enhance innovation-related research to augmentenvironmental sustainability and ECO_GRW.Also, Mensah et al. (2018) along with other variables reviewedthe nexus between GDP, REN_E N consumption and R&D, andCO2_EMS. The findings on 28 OECD nations revealed that GDPincreases CO 2_EMS, whereas, R&D decreases emissions andimproves the quality of the environment. They determined thatinnovation is a crucial element in the minimization of CO 2_EMSthroughout these countries. The influence on pollution due toInternet retailing was analyzed by Al-Mulali, Sheau-Ting, andOzturk (2015). The study includes 77 nations for the period of2000 to 2013. CO2_EMS was taken as a proxy for pollution, andthe outcomes indicated that electricity consumption, GDP growthaugment CO 2_EMS simultaneously in developed and developingnations. But, CO 2_EMS reduces due to internet retailing in the caseof developed nations but does not have a considerable influence onCO 2_EMS in developing nations. At the same time, Lee, Lee, andNing (2016), found that the secon d idea of research is related tothe adverse influences on the environment due to ICT. The usageof ICT induces CO 2_EMS (Khan 2019; Khan, Baloch, Saud, &Fatima, 2018; Khan et al., 2019b; Salahuddin, Alam, &Ozturk, 2016). Further, Lee et al., (2014), proved in the case ofASEAN nations that ICT leads to both ECO_GRW and CO2_EMS.3|METHODOLOGYThe QARDL method explored by Cho et al.

GDP/capita, the number of regis-tered patents, energy in kg of oil/capita, and CO2_EMS metric tonsper capita were utilized to measure ECO_GRW, TEC_INV, REN_EN,and CO 2_EMS, respectively. Table 1 depicts the descriptive statisticsof the variables that are selected for this study, that is, EC_GRO,TEC_INV, and REN_EN and TCO2_EMS concerning China. All themeans have a positive sign. The mean for TCO 2_EMS is found to be7.291 with a range of 4.877 as a minimum and 9.256 as a maximumvalue. The mean of ECO_GRW is 3,256.010 with the minimum andmaximum values of 729.161 and 7,752.560, respectively. The meanof TEC_INV is 29,9,431.3 with 5,832 and 1,393,815 as minimum andmaximum values, respectively. The mean of REN is found to be21.793 with 11.696 as a minimum and 34.084 as maximum values.Furthermore, the result of the Jarque-Bera test describes that TCO2,INV, REN, and ECO_GRW are not normally distributed at a 1% signifi-cance level, which shows that, through the QARDL model, furtheranalysis can be done.Table 2 shows the outcomes of the unit root test. ZA and ADFtests were utilized for this. The outcomes of these tests indicate thestationary feature of the data. Additionally, the ZA unit root test alsoaccounts for the structural break. However, in this research, all thevariables are not stationary at level, that is, I (0) but are stationary at I(1), that is, at first difference.Table 3 depicts the outcome of the QARDL model estimation forChina. The ρparameter depicts a significant link with a negative signat all quantiles except for 0.70 (i.e., not significant). It shows theparameter dependency. Furthermore, the results indicate that thelong-term nexus between the dependent variable TCO2_EMS andindependent variables (EC_GRO, TEC_INV, and REN_EN) is represen-ted by β. The results of GDP show that it is highly significant andpositive at all quantiles ranges from 0.05 to 0.95. These outcomes arein harmony with earlier researches such as (Ben Jebli & Ben Youssef,2015; Chandran, et, al., 2013; Ozcan, 2013). Whereas, GDP2is highlysignificant and negative at all quantiles except for 0.05.TEC_INV is highly significant and negative at all quantiles, that is,0.05–0.95. According to these results, an increase in technology inno-vation will decrease TCO 2_EMS in China. These results are alignedwith the previous research studies such as (Long et al., 2018;Samargandi, 2017; Yii & Geetha, 2017). Considering the technologicalinnovation role in sustainability, Wang et al. (2020) explicated thattechnological innovation can play a domineering role intended for pro-moting a green economy which in turn helps in attaining sustainabilitythrough improving the utilization of resource efficiency effect in con-serving energy which fallouts in the reduction of CO2emission. Tech-nological innovation is primarily viewed as an important componentfor the formulation of policies link to environmental protection thatcan help in the reduction of CO2emission ensuing in improving thequality of the environment (Khan et al., 2020). Besides, the adoptionof energy-efficient technologies can help in creating a sustainableenvironment (Khan et al., 2020c; Cheng, Awan, Ahmad, & Tan, 2020).REN_EN is negative and significant at all the quantiles except for0.10. This result depicts that at low quantile, that is, at 0.10, REN_ENhas no impact on TCO2_EMS whereas, at all the other quantilesranges from 0.15 to 0.95, an increase in REN_EN will decrease theTCO2_EMS in China. This result is consistent with numerous studiessuch as (Al Mulali & Ozturk, 2016; Shafiei & Salim, 2014; Bolük &Mert, 2015). Additionally, efficient use of energy due to the imple-mentation of technological innovation results in mitigating the emis-sion of CO2(Khan & Zhang 2020; Razzaq et al., 2020).Likewise, the short-term dynamics indicate that the currentTCO 2_EMS changes are significantly and positively influenced fromlow to high quantiles, that is, from 0.05 to 0.95 by their previouslevels in China. The past and prevailing changes in GDP influence theprevailing and past variations positively and significantly inTCO2_EMS at all quantiles, whereas previous and recent changes inGDP2significantly and negatively influence the former and presentvariations in TCO 2_EMS at low quantiles ranges from 0.05 to 0.10. Therecent and prior variations in TEC_INV n egatively and significantly affectthe prior and present changes in TCO 2_EMS at low to moderate quantile,that is, from 0.05 to 0.50. Additionally, the previous and current changesin REN_EN significantly and negatively influence the variations inTCO2_EMS at low quantiles ranges from 0.05 to 0.30 and at high qua-ntiles range from 0.80 to 0.95. Hence, the overall results of the QARDLmodel propose that GDP, TEC_INV, and REN_EN are either positive ornegative factors determining TCO 2_EMS in the long run along with theshort run with respect to China.Table 4 depicts the Wald test findings of parameter dependencyfor the short- and long-run parameters. Additionally, in the long- andshort-run parameters, the Wald test also examines the nonlinearitiesfor the evaluation of locational asymmetries (Cho et al. 2015). Overallforρ, the null hypothesis is not accepted in this model. Furthermore,the results of this study depict that in the long-run parameters, theWald test rejects the null hypothesis for all variables such as GDP,TABLE 4 Results of the Wald Test for the constancyof parametersVariables Wald-statistics [ p-value]ρ* 17.535***[.000]βGDP 47.371***[.000]βGDP227.113***[.000]βINV 8.48***[.000]βREN 6.481***[.000]φ1 11.420***[.000]δGDPo4.082***[.000]ϑGDP2o0.194[.992]ωINVo8.402***[.000]λRENo15.433***[.000]Source: Authors Estimation.GODIL ET AL. 701 10991719, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.2167 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

However, in the short-run parameters, theWald test rejects the null hypothesis for all the variables exceptGDP2, which indicates that the variables like GDP, TEC_INV, andREN_EN depict the nonlinear and asymmetric nexus, whereas, GDP2is insignificant that is, Wald test failed to reject the null hypothesisand shows linear and symmetric nexus in the short-run dynamics ofthe Wald test.Table 5 shows the results of the Granger causality test. It indi-cates the causality between the two variables at different quantiles.The outcomes depict that a bidirectional causal association existsamong TEC_INV, REN_EN, and TCO 2_EMS, that is, which runs fromTEC_INV to TCO 2_EMS and REN_EN to TCO 2_EMS, though, a unidi-rectional nexus was found between GDP, GDP2, and TCO 2_EMSwhich shows that TCO 2_EMS occurs due to GDP but the vice versasituation, that is, which runs from TCO 2_EMS to GDP and TCO 2_EMSto GDP2is absent.5|CONCLUSION AND POLICYRECOMMENDATIONSIn the preceding studies, numerous scholars have analyzed the causal-ity relationship amid different variables and TCO 2_EMS in China, butthe link among the variables used in this study has not been exploredpreviously with the help of QARDL methodology. This investigationinvolves variables like GDP, TEC_INV, and REN_EN to gaugeTCO2_EMS in China. The annual time-series data from 1990 to 2018were investigated in this study. The QARDL approach was used toexplain the long- and short-run connection between the GDP,REN_EN, and TEC_INV (independent variables) and TCO2_EMS(dependent variable).The aftermaths of QARDL reveal that GDP, TEC_INV, andREN_EN significantly influence TCO 2_EMS in China. TEC_INVand REN_EN have a negative impact on TCO 2_EMS. In TEC_INV andREN_EN, this nexus is present at all the quantiles, that is, 0.05 –0.95,except for 0.10 in the case of REN_EN. It shows that due to theupsurge in TEC_INV and REN_EN in the country, the TCO 2_EMS islikely to decrease. However, GDP has a positive impact onTCO2_EMS. Whereas, in the case of GDP2, it is negatively significantat all the intensities except for 0.05. Moreover, all the null hypotheseswere rejected in the long-run parameter, while in the short-runparameter, all the null hypotheses were rejected except GDP2inwhich the Wald test failed to reject the null hypothesis.Furthermore, the outcomes of this research suggest that the vari-ables that are used in this research are the possible factors determin-ing TCO 2_EMS. Keeping the results in view, the policymakers ofChina are required to implement measures to lessen TCO 2_EMS atdifferent levels of ECO_GRW. Moreover, it is said that TCO 2_EMSand EN_CON will keep on increasing with time, as Yin et al. (2015)found that TCO 2_EMS can reach the peak in 2060, 2065, and 2080and then will gradually decrease by 73, 44, and 23%, in 2095 whenmatched with the reference set with the environment compelling tar-get as 2.6, 4.5, and 6.0 W/m2, respectively.Likewise, the government of China should improve its transporta-tion system and should bring innovation in its transportation systemby introducing nonpolluting and hybrid cars. China should encourageits people for innovations of electrified cars and railway system tominimize the emission of CO2in the transport sector. Moreover, onone hand, the government of China should hasten the use of biofuelin road transport, and on the other hand, waterway and railway railtransport should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative car-bon policies can also help in minimizing the sector's CO2_EMS.In high CO 2_EMS countries, the utilization of REN_EN couldpotentially reduce CO 2_EMS, thereby to satisfy energy needs; theymust increase the share of REN_EN. Besides, transforming theapproach of ECO_GRW is beneficial in moving from nonrenewable toREN_EN sources to satisfy energy needs and efficiently minimizeCO2_EMS. Therefore, it is crucial for the global society to adopt cli-mate change-related policies, mainly for key sectors of CO 2_EMSemissions, such as the transport industry to reduce energy consump-tion and, consequently, CO 2_EMS from fossil fuels (Khan et al.,2019a; Khan et al., 2021; Godil, Sharif, Afshan, Yousuf & Khan, 2020).Similarly, high CO 2_EMS nations can upsurge FDI to reduce envi-ronmental degradation, whereas low CO 2_EMS countries should firstdetermine the FDI's environmental effect before inviting foreignstakeholders into the state. The reduction in CO 2_EMS can also beachieved through investment in technology innovation i.e. by theimport of new technologies. Innovation at the technological levelhelps in the utilization of a lower amount of energy that might resultin producing the output at the same level (Santra, 2017), thus, if coun-tries pursue technological innovation in terms of green technology itcan help the firms to improve their efficiency in terms of energyusage. Therefore, technology innovation could lead to lower cost ofREN_EN consumption and enhanced energy efficiency. From theaforementioned empirical review, it can be deduced that innovationboosts the choices to manufacture and consume to mitigate the unfa-vorable influence of emissions from all means on the environment.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work is partially supported by the China Postdoctoral ScienceFoundation (No. 2019M660700); the Beijing Key Laboratory ofMegaregions Sustainable Development Modelling, Capital Universityof Economics and Business (No. MCR2019QN09).ORCIDDanish I.
