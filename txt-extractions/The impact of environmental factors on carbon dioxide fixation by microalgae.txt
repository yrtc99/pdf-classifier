The efficiency of carbon dioxide capture depends on the cultivationsystem configuration (photobioreactors or open systems) and can vary according to the state of the algal physiology, thechemical composition of the nutrient medium, and environmental factors such as irradiance, temperature and pH. Thismini-review is focused on some of the most important environmental factors determining photosynthetic activity, carbondioxide biofixation, cell growth rate and biomass productivity by microalgae. These include carbon dioxide and O 2concentrations, light intensity, cultivation temperature and nutrients. Finally, a review of the operation of microalgalcultivation systems outdoors is presented as an example of the impact of environmental conditions on biomassproductivity and carbon dioxide fixation.Keywords: carbon dioxide biofixation; microalgae; outdoor cultivations; pH; temperature; irradianceINTRODUCTIONTheaccumulationofgreenhousegasesintheatmosphere,fromhuman activities and industrialization, has been considered asthe main driver of climate change and is recognized as be-ing among the major global problems facing mankind (IPCC2014). While strong steps are being taken to reduce these emis-sions, carbon dioxide capture is a viable alternative (Mikkelsen,Jørgensen and Krebs 2010). A microalgal contribution to car-bon dioxide capture was suggested in the 1960s by Oswald andGolueke ( 1960) and much attention has been drawn due to thehigher solar energy yield and environmental tolerance of mi-croalgae compared with higher plants, and to the possibility ofyear-round cultivation (Chisti 2007; Johnet al.2011). Microalgaecanalsocontributetoreducingglobalwarmingemissionsbyre-cyclingcarbondioxideintobiofuels(Chisti 2007),orthroughpro-duction of value-added products from flue gases. Furthermore,microalgae can also reduce carbon dioxide emissions fromwastewater treatment by lowering the energy needed for aer-ation(Razzak etal.2013),orduringbiogasupgrading(Meier etal.2015). Nevertheless, worldwide carbon dioxide emissions ( ≈40Gt year−1, IPCC2014) are too high compared with 13 600 t (IEA2017) of commercialized microalgal biomass (around 27 200 t ofcarbon dioxide). This extremely low contribution of engineeredprocesses emphasizes the need to increase productivity, as wellas to optimize and scale up the existing technologies, in or-der to produce larger amounts of microalgal biomass.

It has been reportedthat carbon dioxide fixation by microalgae might become eco-nomically viable when production costs fall below $500 t−1ha−1year−1(Bilanovic and Holland 2012).Efficient microalgal carbon dioxide mitigation depends onmicroalgal species, light, carbon dioxide source and bioavail-ability, as well as photobioreactor design and operating con-ditions (Cheng et al.2006), and very exhaustive reviews havereported the carbon dioxide removal efficiencies, biomass pro-ductivities and carbon dioxide fixation ability of a broad spec-trum of microalgae growing at different operational conditions(Farrelly et al.2013; Singh and Singh 2014; Zhao and Su 2014;Cuellar-Bermudez et al.2015).Akeyparameterinfluencingbiomassproductivityisthepho-tosynthetic conversion efficiency, representing the luminousenergy transformed to chemical energy, which is at the baseof the anabolic reactions leading to biomass production. Themaximum theoretical efficiency of solar energy conversion intobiomass is around 12% (Weyer et al.2010; Williams and Laurens2010;Oomsetal.2016).Thisvalueiscalculatedonthebasisthatonly 47% of the total solar spectrum is available for photosyn-thesis and a maximum absorption of only 27% is achieved bythe photosynthetic system from the photosynthetic active radi-ation. Finally, an additional 10% reduction is considered due tophoto-transmissionlosses.However,photosyntheticconversionefficiencyvaluesbetween1.5%,foropenracewayponds,and3.8–5%fortubularorflatpanelphotobioreactorshavebeenreportedinoutdoorconditions(Norsker etal.2011;deVree etal.2015)andof 6% under laboratory conditions (Norsker et al.2011). Higherphotosynthetic conversion efficiency should allow higher pro-ductivities and lower costs (Wijffels, Barbosa and Eppink 2010;Wijffels and Barbosa 2010).The main problem associated with outdoor algal cultiva-tion is the limited productivity resulting from (i) light atten-uation along the path in the cultivation system; (ii) excessivelight impinging on the superficial layers causing photoinhi-bition (Janssen and Jack 2016); (iii) non-optimal temperaturesdue to climatic or seasonal conditions; (iv) respiratory lossesof biomass; (v) salinity variations driven by water evaporation;(vi) inhibitory high oxygen concentration (Cohen, Koren andArad1991); and (vii) cultivation failure by bio-contaminationwithfungalorbacterialspecies,competingalgae,predators,par-asites, viruses, etc. In the case of biofuel production, strainsshould be found with high lipids or carbohydrates for biodieselor biogas (hydrogen or methane) that are capable of maintain-ing fast growth rates under the nutrient limitation required totrigger the accumulation of those compounds. While some keyparameters, such as pH, may be maintained, others, includingtemperature and irradiance, cannot be controlled to the sameextent as under laboratory conditions (Wolf et al.2016). Some ofthemostimportantenvironmentalfactorsaffectinggrowthrate,biomass productivity and carbon fixation will be reviewed here.PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CARBON DIOXIDECONCENTRATING MECHANISMPhotosynthesis allows microalgal carbon dioxide fixation andthe production of life-sustaining organic molecules. In thelight-dependent cycle, photons from sunlight provide energyto split water into molecular oxygen, and chlorophylls andcarotenoids in the photosystems (I and II) are the key light-harvesting molecules that funnel the absorbed energy intothe electron transport chain to create the high-energy andreducing molecules, ATP and NADPH, respectively. These arefurther used in the Calvin–Benson cycle to capture carbondioxide through ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase(Rubisco) enzyme mediation. (Information about the time scaleof these processes can be found in Falkowski and Raven ( 1997)and Luo and Al-Dahhan ( 2011).) The low Rubisco specificity iscompensated through a carbon dioxide concentrating mecha-nism by enhancing the carbon dioxide concentration up to 1000times with respect to the carbon dioxide in the liquid medium(Priceet al.2008) and by decreasing photorespiration (Zhao andSu2014).When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it can be found ascarbon dioxide, HCO 3−,C O32−and H 2CO3. Among these, carbondioxide and HCO 3−are the major species used by microalgalcells. Carbonic anhydrases play a key role in the carbon dioxideconcentrating mechanism and are found in the periplasm, cy-tosolandchloroplasts,havingdifferentfunctions,suchasmain-taining the carbon dioxide and HCO 3−equilibrium or fosteringtransport through membranes. Once Rubisco acts, carbon diox-ideistransformedintothecarbohydrateprecursorsusedforcellmetabolism and growth (Zhao and Su 2014).MICROALGAL GROWTHThe simple structure of microalgae permits fast cell growthwith doubling times of 1 or 2 days or less (a few hours)and higher carbon dioxide fixation efficiencies than terres-trial plants (Richmond 2004). Microalgal growth is influencedby both biotic and abiotic factors that include, among others,temperature, pH, carbon dioxide, dissolved O 2, light intensityand nutrients present in the medium. Additionally, the chem-ical composition of microalgal biomass also depends on the mi-croalgal species, the growth phase and even on harvest time(S´anchez-Mir ´onet al.2003; Juneja, Ceballos and Murthy 2013).Therefore, it is important to know the single and combined ef-fectoftheabove-mentionedkeyparameterstoimprovethepro-ductivity of biomass and its products.NutrientsThemolecularformulaofmicroalgalbiomasshasbeenreportedasCO 0.48H1.83N0.11P0.01(Chisti2007),whichcanhelptodeterminethe nutritional requirements for cell growth. Table 1summa-rizes the main nutrients constituting microalgal cells. As can beobserved, nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), mag-nesium (Mg), sulfur (S) and trace element. The major cell com-ponent is carbon at around 50%, so to produce 1 ton of algalbiomass, 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide need to be fixed (Chisti2007;A l c´antara, Garc ´ıa-Encina and Mu ˜noz2013). carbon diox-idecanbesuppliedfromtheatmosphericair,industrialgaseousstreams (e.g. flue gas) (Pires et al.2012; Cuellar-Bermudez et al.2015; Duarte et al.2016; Fistarol, Farias and Salomon 2016;Thomas, Mechery and Paulose 2016) or even soluble carbon-ates (e.g. NaHCO 3and Na 2CO3) (Abinandan and Shanthakumar2016;M o k a s h i et al.2016;W a n get al.2008). Atmospheric car-bon dioxide concentration is low (around 400 ppm) and cannotsustain an intensive production of microalgal biomass; there-fore, streams with higher carbon dioxide content, such as thosefound in flue gases, are preferred. Nevertheless, certain aspectsof flue gases have to be considered, including their tempera-tureandthepresenceofothergaseouscomponents,suchasSO xDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/365/3/fnx262/4705896 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Morales et al. 3Table 1.

Nitrogen is thesecond major component in importance for microalgal growthand may interact with the carbon source. Bilanovic et al.(2009)used the response surface methodology to define carbon diox-ide and N concentrations to maximize both biomass produc-tion and carbon dioxide fixation capacity and found that nitro-gen concentration for freshwater algae should be between 285and 427 mg NL−1for carbon dioxide concentrations from atmo-spheric to 70%. Phosphorous is necessary to synthesize aminoacids, phospholipids and energy carriers and it is generally pro-vided as phosphates. Nutrient limitation (mainly N or P) shiftsthe cell metabolism from growth to storage of high energy con-tent molecules, such as lipids and carbohydrates (Takagi et al.2000; Khozin-Goldberg and Cohen 2006; Rodolfi et al.2009; Xinetal.2010;Juneja,CeballosandMurthy 2013),butthespecificcar-bon capture rate is generally lowered. Oligo- and trace elementsare also required in low amounts and sodium chloride (NaCl)affects carbon dioxide and O 2solubility and helps to regulatebiomass growth and product formation (Ben Amotz, Tornabeneand Thomas 1985; Takagi, Karseno, Yoshida 2006). In conclu-sion,mediumformulationisanecessarysteptoincreasegrowthrates and productivity and, therefore, carbon dioxide capture,consideringboththecellcompositionandprocessrequirements(Danquah et al.2010).EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ONcarbon dioxide BIOFIXATIONIn this section, the main environmental factors affecting photo-synthesis and, consequently, the growth rate, biomass produc-tivity and carbon fixation are analyzed and Table 2summarizesthe optimum values for some species.IrradianceLight intensity is essential for photosynthesis, microalgalgrowth and, therefore, carbon dioxide fixation (Fern ´andezet al.2012; Costache et al.2013). During photosynthesis, the productsof light reactions, ATP and NADPH, are used to fix carbon diox-ide by Rubisco in the Calvin–Benson cycle. Both molecules areprovidedfromlight-dependentreactions;therefore,agoodlightsupply is necessary. On the one hand, low light conditions leadto low biomass concentration and carbon dioxide fixation. Onthe other hand, excess light increases the production of reac-tive oxygen species that are responsible for abnormal physio-logical reactions due to oxidative stress (Seo et al.2017). Theydamage the essential proteins required for electron transferduring photosynthesis and, consequently, carbon dioxide fixa-tion is reduced.The empirical relationship between irradiance and photo-synthesis is graphically depicted by photosythesis-irradianceDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/365/3/fnx262/4705896 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 20234FEMS Microbiology Letters , 2018, Vol. 365, No. 3(P–I)curves(B ´echet,ShiltonandGuieysse 2013).Thesecurvesarespecies-dependent and need to be experimentally determinedunder uniform light intensity (B ´echet, Shilton and Guieysse2013). Generally, three regions are identified: (i) a region limitedby the rate of capture of photons where the photosynthetic rateis directly proportional to irradiance; (ii) the ‘light-saturation’region where photosynthesis is irradiance-independent—here,photosynthesis is limited by the reaction rates achieving maxi-mumvalue(B ´echet,ShiltonandGuieysse 2013);and(iii)thepho-toinhibition region at high irradiances where a decrease in pho-tosynthesis is observed (Camacho-Rubio et al.2003). However,an important issue relating to P–Icurves is that they are deter-mined under uniform light intensity, contrary to the situationfound during cultivation in photobioreactors, where dense cul-tures can be achieved. Consequently, P–Icurves cannot be useddirectlytopredictproductivityindensecultures,wherethelightregime must be known or some valid correlations must be usedto predict light attenuation based on depth, biomass concentra-tion and mixing patterns.Photo-acclimation allows microalgae to respond to lightchanges, balancing the light reactions, the energy demandfor carbon dioxide fixation and other metabolic reactions(VonshakandTorzillo 2004).Thephoto-acclimationperiodsvaryaccording to species (Falkowski and Chen 2003; Nikolaou et al.2016). In the short term (time scales of seconds to minutes),adaptation includes adjustments in the delivery of light en-ergy to photosystem II through reorganization of photosyn-theticcomplexes(Mooij etal.2017).Long-termacclimationcom-priseschangesinenzymeactivityandgeneexpressionaffectingboth the structure and the stoichiometry in the photosystems(Cabello,MoralesandRevah 2014).Photoinhibitionoccursinsys-tems exposed to high irradiances, just above the value wheremaximum photosynthetic activity occurs (Camacho-Rubio et al.2003;PulzandGross 2004),andinvolvesdeactivationofproteinsin photosynthetic units (Camacho-Rubio et al.2003;F a net al.2007). This process is time-dependent and a half of the photo-synthetic system might be irreversibly damaged after a periodof 10–20 min of exposure (Pulz and Gross 2004).Differentlightsourcesareusedformicroalgalcultivation,in-cluding natural sunlight and artificial light. Kommareddy andAnderson ( 2003) compared different light sources, including in-candescent, halogen, fluorescent, AllnGaP II (aluminum indiumgallium phosphide with a peak at a wavelength of 643 nm) andlight emitting diodes. They found that light emitting diodesand AllnGaP II were the most efficient and economical lightsources. Recent advances include illumination with selectedwavelengths, dye compounds to lower the energy photons, flu-orescent paints and nanoparticles to filter the light (Ramanna,Rawat and Bux 2017). Although many studies are performed in-doorswithartificiallightundercontrolledconditions,largescalecultivationsystemsoperateoutdoorswithsolarlightdependingon the circadian cycle, location, season of the year and climaticconditions. Furthermore, a successful cultivation system withhigh biomass productivity must have high cell concentrationsto minimize costs (Molina-Grima et al.2003); however, this highbiomass content produces light gradients in the medium andcells are exposed to different light intensities (B ´echet, Shiltonand Guieysse 2013).Light supply may be continuous or with intermittent pho-toperiods. Cycles of 12:12 or 18:6 dark–light cycles have beenreported as adequate to achieve good carbon dioxide fixation(Ramanna, Rawat and Bux 2017); however, Jacob-Lopes et al.(2009) found that during continuous illumination, carbon diox-ide fixation by Aphanothece microscopica N¨ageli microalgaereached 99.69% of elimination efficiency. Furthermore, algalgrowth and carbon dioxide fixation are affected not only bylight–dark cycle, but also by light intensity. Thawechai et al.(2016) found that the optimal conditions of 60 μmol photonsm−2s−1and continuous illumination allowed a carbon dioxidefixation rate of 0.729 mg L−1day−1. Contrary to those results,Sun and Duan ( 2007) found that for the microalga Tetraselmistetrathele , light cycles ranged from 6 to 18 h, whereas the celldensity, chlorophyll aand protein content reached high levelssuggesting the importance of an optimized light cycle to maxi-mize metabolism and algal growth.TemperatureTemperature influences both physicochemical carbon dioxideavailability to the cells and the metabolic processes within thecell (¨Ord¨oget al.2016; Paliwal et al.2017). carbon dioxide solu-bility depends on temperature; it is known that higher temper-atures ( >20◦C) lower the carbon dioxide solubility. On the otherhand, increases in temperature decrease Rubisco’s affinity forcarbon dioxide (Kumar et al.2011). However, the temperatureeffect on the reaction metabolic rate is strain dependent. Lightand temperature were the most important factors affecting thebiomassproductivityandcarbondioxidefixationinalong-termexperimentinwhich Scenedesmusobliquus wasgrowninoutdoorphotobioreactors with N and carbon dioxide maintained at aconstant level (Hindersin et al.2014).Ras, Steyer and Bernard ( 2013) performed a review of the ef-fect of temperature on different species, emphasizing the bio-chemical effect and the adaptation to high temperatures. Mi-croalgae usually grow in a temperature range between 15 and30◦C with optimal values at 20–25◦C. It has also been reportedthattemperaturesbelow16◦Caffectparticularlymechanismsofcarbonfixation(Ras,SteyerandBernard 2013)andmetabolicac-tivity in general. On the other hand, high temperatures lowercarbon dioxide solubility (Zhao and Su 2014) and temperaturesabove35◦Carenormallylethalformanyspecies(Briassoulis etal.2010), decreasing the growth rate and increasing both respira-tion and photorespiration. Temperature is especially importantfortreatmentoffluegases(temperaturesaround120◦C)orlarge-scale outdoor cultivation with circadian variations between 10and45◦C.Inthesecases,theuseoftemperature-tolerantorgan-ismscouldresultinsavingsrelatedtocoolingcosts.Someofthereported photosynthetic organisms include Chlorella pyrenoidosa(optimum around 39◦C and tolerance up to 45◦C),Chlorogleopsissp. (isolated from a hot spring in the Yellowstone National Park;growsat50◦C;OnoandCuello 2007)andSynechococcus sp.(MillerandCastenholz 2000;42–75◦C),whichexhibitsthethermalmax-imum for photosynthetic life (Brock 1967; Castenholz 1969).pHThe pH regulates, on the chemical level, the distribution ofdifferent dissolved inorganic species (carbon dioxide, HCO 3−and CO 32−;d eM o r a i sa n dC o s t a 2007). It is also one ofthe important factors for algal growth because it affectsthe activity of different enzymes (Zhang et al.2016). Itsvalue has a strong influence on cell growth and the opti-mum and tolerance are species-dependent. The optimum pHis normally in the neutral to slightly alkaline range (6–8.3;Moss1973; Azov1982; Olaizola 2003; Pandey, Pathak and Ti-wari2010; Ying, James Gilmour and Zimmerman 2014). How-ever, some organisms bloom in extreme conditions. Spirulinagrows in highly alkaline conditions (pH 9–11; Pandey, PathakDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/365/3/fnx262/4705896 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Morales et al. 5and Tiwari 2010; Koru 2012; Sharma et al.2014). Alkalineconditions, at pH above 11.0, could help to maintain microalgalcultures free of contaminants, such as protozoa and other com-peting microalgae (Touloupakis et al.2016), and also promoteneutrallipidaccumulationinmicroalgalcells(Zhang etal.2016).Other microalgae thriving in more acidic conditions include theautotrophic Chlorophyta ( Chlamydomonas acidophila ,Dunaliellaacidophila ), Chrysophyta ( Ochromonas sp.) and Euglenophyta(Euglena mutabilis ), filamentous algae identified as Zygnemacircumcarinatum andKlebsormidium acidophilum (Sunget al.1998;Novis and Harding 2007;R o w eet al.2007), andChlorella protothe-coidesvar.acidicola isolated from mine-impacted water bodies,whichgrowsoptimallyatpH2.5underheterotrophicconditions(Nancucheo and Johnson 2012).During carbon dioxide fixation and microalgal growth, pHvariations occur in relation to carbon dioxide dissolution, equi-libriumofthedissolvedinorganiccarbonspeciesandtheuptakeof carbon dioxide and nitrate. However, these changes also de-pend on the carbon dioxide input concentration. When HCO 3−isused,thecarbonicanhydraseconvertsittocarbondioxidere-sultinginthereleaseofthehydroxylion(OH−)andconsequentlyanincreaseinpH.Thissituationindicatescarbondioxidelimita-tion affecting the system performance and carbon dioxide sup-ply and allows the control of culture pH at its optimal value.Recently, Duarte-Santos et al.(2016) have used the strategy ofpH control with injection of carbon dioxide-rich gases on de-mand. This allowed them to meet the carbon requirements ofmicroalgal cultures and to optimize biomass productivity andcarbon dioxide fixation. That study was performed in a pilotscale- raceway pond, to produce high value-added compounds,such as phycocyanin (Chen et al.2016). The same strategy wasalso reported to control the protozoa (ciliates or amoebae) (Maetal.2017). High carbon dioxide concentrations, similar to thosefound in flue gases (10–25%), acidify the cultivation mediumwhen continuously fed (Zhao and Su 2014; Choiet al.2017). Fur-thermore, other chemicals, such as SO 2or NO xfrom flue gases,reduce the pH when they dissolve in water (Kao et al.2014;Cuellar-Bermudez et al.2015;Y e net al.2015; Fistarol, Farias andSalomon 2016).Consequently,pHcontrolbyadditionofneutral-izingagents,bydesigningbuffersorbydefiningstrategiesofcar-bon dioxide supply is critical to avoid growth inhibition.carbon dioxide concentrationcarbon dioxide fixation involves mass transfer and solubiliza-tion from the gaseous stream to the liquid phase, attain-ing the ionic equilibrium between carbon dioxide, HCO 3−andCO32−, and carbon assimilation by the microalgal cells. Tol-erance and optimal carbon dioxide concentration are strain-dependent (Solovchenko and Khozin-Goldberg 2013)a n dm o s tmicroalgae generally grow well at 2% carbon dioxide, but lev-els above 5% carbon dioxide (Cheng et al.2006) may inhibittheir growth (Yun et al.1997; Chiuet al.2008). This effect maybe related to the acidification of the stroma in the chloroplast(Solovchenko and Khozin-Goldberg 2013) causing the inactiva-tionofkeyenzymesoftheCalvin–Bensoncycle.SinghandSingh(2014) reviewed the influence of carbon dioxide levels on differ-ent microalgal species including Scenedesmusobliquus ,Botryococ-cusbraunii ,Chlorellavulgaris andNannochloropsisoculata. Theyre-ported that the highest carbon dioxide concentration was fixedbyS. aquatilis ,B. braunii ,C. vulgaris andSynechococcus species.However, according to Singh and Ahluwalia ( 2013), although themostcarbondioxide-tolerantstrainswere Chlorella sp.T-1(100%carbon dioxide), Scenedesmus sp. (80% carbon dioxide) and Eu-glena gracilis (45%), their maximum biomass productivity wasfound at carbon dioxide concentrations of 10%, 10–20% and 5%,respectively. Likewise, Chlorella sp. KR-1 showed the maximumgrowth at 10% carbon dioxide and tolerated up to 70% carbondioxide (Sung et al.1998). The above-mentioned range is im-portant because some microalgae can grow with 10–15% carbondioxide, the range normally found in flue gases, which are animportant greenhouse gas source of pollution, but may be anexcellent carbon dioxide source for microalgae.Dissolved O 2concentrationDissolved oxygen is an indicator of photosynthetic activity bymicroalgae, and registered values are higher than those foundin equilibrium with air. Low dissolved oxygen indicates prob-lems with the microalgal growth and possibly dissolved oxygenconsumptionbyheterotrophicmicroorganisms.Thebuild-upofO2in microalgal cultivation systems is one of the major prob-lems in obtaining high biomass productivity and carbon diox-ide fixation rate. Dissolved oxygen may exceed 250% of satu-ration during daytime (Fern ´andezet al.2012;R a s oet al.2012;Costache et al.2013; Bilanovic et al.2016). High oxygen concen-tration leads to the oxidative stress of reactive oxygen speciesand also competes with carbon dioxide for the Rubisco involvedin carbon dioxide fixation. The carbon dioxide and O 2concen-trations define carboxylation (photosynthesis) and oxygenation(photorespiration) prevalence. Low carbon dioxide/O 2ratios re-duce the photosynthetic rate and, therefore, carbon dioxide fix-ation and favor photorespiration and carbon dioxide release(Costache et al.2013). To avoid dissolved oxygen accumulation,both design and operational issues must be considered. Theyinclude the establishment of maximum tube length in photo-bioreactorsandpromotionofoxygenreleasetothegasphasebydegassing the liquid and promoting turbulence of the medium(Grobbelaar 1994; Camacho-Rubio et al.1999).METHODOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THEEFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES(carbon dioxide, TEMPERATURE, PH ANDIRRADIANCES)The experimental assessment of the effect of key factors re-viewed above is vital to determine the optimal operation condi-tionstomaximizegrowthratesandcarbondioxidecapture.Dataon the effects on photosynthetic activity are generally gatheredby cell growth or oxygen production rates. Microalgal growth isnormally measured in photobioreactors by biomass accumula-tion during the cultivation time and results from the combina-tionofbiological,environmentalandmasstransfereffects.Thisapproachdoesnotallowtheindependentevaluationofkeyvari-ables and depends on the changing operational conditions andphotobioreactor configuration. Furthermore, it requires a timescale of days to obtain significant results (Butterwick, Heaneyand Talling 2005; Breuer et al.2013). On the other hand, thephotosynthetic activity can be determined at different cultureconditions through dynamic oxygen measurements (Bitaub ´e,CaroandPer ´ez2008;Brindley,Aci ´enandFern ´andez-Sevilla 2010;Fern´andezet al.2012; Costache et al.2013). This approach yieldsresults on a time scale of minutes and is proportional to thegrowth rate according to the stoichiometry of the overall photo-synthetic reaction (Brindley, Aci ´en and Fern ´andez-Sevilla 2010).Oxygen response to changing conditions also provides infor-mation about the photo-acclimation phenomena generated inDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/365/3/fnx262/4705896 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 20236FEMS Microbiology Letters , 2018, Vol. 365, No. 3photosystem II as a response to fluctuations in light intensity(Satohet al.2002;A v e n d a ˜no and Shubert 2005). Furthermore,the time needed for determination of the photosynthetic irra-diance curves and the associated kinetic parameters is reducedandsomemodelshavebeendevelopedforpredictingO 2produc-tion(Camacho-Rubio etal.1999;Rebolloso etal.1999;ConcasandPisu2010;F e r n´andezet al.2012;H uet al.2012;B´echet, Shiltonand Guieysse 2013).Dynamic dissolved O 2measurements coupled to mass bal-ance and transfer models have been used to evaluate the effectof irradiance, temperature and pH on the photosynthetic activ-i t yf o rt h em i c r o a l g a Scenedesmusobtusiusculus (Cabello, Moralesand Revah 2015). Here, thermodynamic and intrinsic kinetic pa-rameter data were evaluated in a mini-photobioreactor, whereself-shading, mass transfer effects and carbon dioxide limita-tion were minimized. Results with the optimized conditionswere further tested successfully in controlled flat-panel photo-bioreactors to produce biomass and lipids (Morales, Cabello andRevah2015).Dynamic methods were also used to evaluate the photosyn-thetic activity of the same microalga to different light intensi-ties in an air-lift photobioreactor through step changes underN-repleteandN-starvedconditions(Cabello,MoralesandRevah2014), as well as the effect of variations of carbon dioxide con-centration(Cabello,MoralesandRevah 2017).Inthiscase,duringthe experiments on-line monitoring of pH, carbon dioxide andTable 3.

Thedynamicexperiments alloweda rapid analysis of the short-term carbon dioxide consumptionratesinresponsetochangesininletgascarbondioxideconcen-tration.OUTDOOR OPERATIONTheimpactofenvironmentalconditionsoncarbondioxidecap-ture and biomass growth is clearly observed in outdoor cul-tivation. The microalgal growth rate is drastically lower thanthat obtained under controlled conditions in the laboratory andmany microalgal strains do not grow reliably outdoors as a con-sequence of diurnal or seasonal fluctuations in irradiance andtemperature (Moheimani 2013; Eustance et al.2016).Excellentreviewsonalgalphysiologyandlarge-scaleoutdoorcultures of microalgae have been published, including those onevaluationoftheeffectofphotobioreactorconfiguration(seeTa-ble3) on microalgal productivity and photosynthetic efficiency(de Vree et al.2015). However, limited information exists aboutlarge-scaleproductionandlong-termoperationofoutdoorculti-vationsystemsformostmicroalgalspecies(VanBergeijk,Salas-Leiton and Ca ˜navate 2010; Chiu, Soong and Chen 2016), andperformance comparisons of a strain at optimum conditions inlaboratoryandoutdoorenvironmentsarescant.Therefore,herewewilltakethecaseof Scenedesmusobtusiusculus asanexample(S´anchezet al.2013; Cabello, Morales and Revah 2015).Scenedesmus obtusiusculus was grown in a 35 L airlift tubularphotobioreactor,basedonthedesignproposedbyMolina-Grimaet al.(2001). It was operated outdoors during a yearlong cultiva-tion in Mexico City on a building roof located at N 19◦21/prime32.466/prime/prime,W9 9◦4/prime25.192/prime/primein 2013. Table 4shows results of biomass pro-ductivityandcarbondioxidefixation,includingdataundercon-trolled optimal conditions in a flat panel photobioreactor. Ascan be seen, the highest biomass productivity, 0.29 g L−1day−1,andcarbondioxidefixationrate,0.55gL−1day−1,wereobtainedduring the spring when the highest temperatures and irradi-ances(photonexposition)wererecorded.However,thesevalueswere lower than those obtained in laboratory controlled condi-tions, where the biomass productivity was 0.97 g L−1day−1anda carbon dioxide fixation rate of 1.84 g L−1day−1was achieved(Toledo-Cervantes etal.2013).Thisdifferencecouldbeattributedto the fact that the above-mentioned conditions (temperature,irradiance)changedynamicallymakingitdifficulttoclearlyiso-late the impact of any single factor.Finally, few works have evaluated the effect of outdoor con-ditions on the carbon dioxide capture, biomass compositionand biofuel potential. Recently, Ho et al.(2017) have found thatScenedesmusobliquus CNW-N exhibited the optimal carbon diox-ide fixation rate and carbohydrate productivity during the sum-mer with an average irradiance around 200 μmol m−2s−1andtemperatures close to 31◦C. They recognize the importance ofunderstandingtheseasonalchangesandconcludethatitispos-sibletocombinecarbondioxidefixationandbioethanolproduc-tion using microalgae grown outdoors.CONCLUSIONThereisacommonconsensusinthescientificcommunityaboutthe need to address the significant difficulties involved in thelarge-scale production of microalgae and their products. Fur-thermore, to exceed the economic break-even point and makemicroalgal technologies a relevant contributor to carbon diox-ide sequestration, the range of products should be extended,production should be maximized under the constraints (the se-lected strain) and the environmental conditions set in accor-dance with the cultivation method and the location of the fa-cilities.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThe authors thank the Fondo Sectorial CONACYT-SENER-Sustentabilidad Energ ´etica, Cl ´uster Biocombustibles Gaseososproject 247006 and CONACYT projects PN2014-247402 and PD-CPN2015-241forfinancialsupport.L.S.acknowledgesCONACYTfor a scholarship.Conflict of interest .
