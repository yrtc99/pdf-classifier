Residue biochemistry and soil texture essentially determineSOC distribution (including CO 2mineralization and stock in soil) in farmland. However, less isknown about allocation of residue-C with contrasting biochemistry and the fate of residue-C in soilunder two different textures. This study was conducted in a 61-day aerobic incubation with two Blacksoils with distinct texture (clay loam vs. sandy loam) in Northeast China. Chemical composition ofseven residue parts (soybean roots, leaves, and stems and maize roots, leaves and top and bottomstem parts) was characterized using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Theresults showed that leaves of both two crops contained signiﬁcantly higher nitrogen (N), carbonyland aryl concentrations and lower carbon (C) and lignin concentrations than other parts, resultedin faster decomposition in soils, especially in the clay loam. Stems contained higher O-alkyl anddi-O-alkyl concentrations, C/N and lignin/N, while roots contained higher aromaticity. Maize topstem parts with larger slow C pool and longer half-life had higher contribution to SOC accumulationthan other parts. Soil textures also induced great impact on SOC turnover. The clay loam favoredSOC sequestration due to signiﬁcantly longer half-life of slow C pool than the sandy loam. Generally,the alkyl/O-alkyl ratio showed the most signiﬁcant correlation with SOC, CO 2emission and soilbiochemical factors in the clay loam; whereas in sandy loam, the lignin/N was the pivotal indicator forSOC accumulation. This study provides insights into the differences in chemical composition amongvarious residue parts, and highlights the signiﬁcant effects of both residue chemical composition andsoil texture on residue decomposition and SOC accumulation.Keywords: CO 2emission; crop residues chemistry; soil textures; soil organic carbonAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030747 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomyAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 2 of 181. IntroductionSoil organic carbon (SOC) is the key to soil fertility and health [ 1]. Promoting SOCaccumulation is crucial for achieving C neutrality and maintaining agricultural sustainabil-ity [2]. Straw return, as the most efﬁcient way to compensate SOC loss, has been alwaysadapted to increase SOC stocks in agrosystems [ 3]. However, it was reported that thedecomposition of plant residues and native soil organic matter is estimated to release anamount of CO 2ﬁve to six times as high as that released from fossil fuel combustion [ 4,5],which was the main reason to SOC loss. Consequently, any inﬂuence on residue decom-position would have crucial effects on atmospheric CO 2and global climate change. [ 6–8].In addition, some studies indicated that crop residue return does not necessarily lead toan increase in SOC stock [ 9,10]. Fontaine et al. (2004) demonstrated that fresh C supplycould accelerate SOC decomposition and, ﬁnally, induce a negative SOC balance [ 11]. Thisinconsistency could be explained by the difference in chemical fertilization inputs, residuequality, the amount of added C, as well as a difference in soil types [ 12,13]. Therefore,clarifying the rules inﬂuencing the transformation of residues-C to stable SOC is essentialto SOC pool improvement.Soil texture has been recognized as a key factor to inﬂuence SOC dynamics [ 14]. Clayeysoils were reported to contain more SOC stocks than sandy soils due to higher physicalprotection of SOC by macroaggregates [ 15,16]. Hence, the clayey fraction is also regarded auseful and widely available indicator for SOC storage capacity [ 17]. However, Fang et al.(2007) reported higher CO 2emission from a clayey soil than sandy soil amended with maizeresidue [ 18]. The clayey soils may be associated with larger microbial biomass and highermetabolic capacity due to higher C and N availability, compared to sandy soils [ 19–21].This could be the main reason for the higher priming effect in clayey soils with higher Clevels, but only few studies have revealed residue C mineralization in soils with differenttexture. The interaction between different crop residue parts and soil texture is also unclear.Additionally, incorporated residues can cause a positive or negative priming effectdepending on the chemical composition of residues [ 22,23]. Studies showed that organicmaterials differing in chemical composition have variable decomposition behaviors andcould exert different effects on SOC, even in the same soils [ 24,25]. Residues of various croptypes (i.e., soybean and maize) and plant parts (i.e., roots, stems and leaves) tend to havedifferent chemical compositions and recalcitrance [ 26,27]. For example, lignin concentrationand C concentration were found to be higher in roots than in other parts [ 28–31], whileleaves contained high amounts of labile C compounds and relatively low lignin concentra-tion, which may lead to fast decomposition rate [ 29,32]. Thus, the differences in biochemicalquality among plant parts should be taken into consideration when studying plant residuedecomposition process [ 33]. However, many studies using straw–soil incubation relied onthe assumption that chemical components of plant residues were consistent within variousparts. Consequently, the effects of different crop tipes and plant parts on SOC turnover hadbeen always ignored.Residue quality and decomposition processes have traditionally been assessed andpredicted by the C/N and lignin/N ratios of undecomposed materials. However, theseindicators frequently fail to predict litter decomposition rate properly [ 34]. The13C-crosspolarization magic angle spinning (13C CP-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectroscopy is useful for providing information on the organic chemical composition ofresidues and soils during residue decomposition [ 35]. Using13C CP-MAS NMR technique,researchers monitored changes in the relative abundance of different C types in residuesduring decomposition, and proposed useful indices for evaluation of organic matter sta-bility [ 36–38]. Bonanomi et al. (2013) proposed the13C NMR-based ratio of chemical shiftregions 70–75 ppm to 52–57 ppm as an alternative to C/N and lignin/N for predictingresidue decomposition rates [ 39]. Some other indices such as the ratios of hydrophobic tohydrophilic C (HB/HI) and alkyl to O-alkyl C (A/O-A) have also been suggested [40–42].Since residue decomposition process is greatly affected by soil properties and environmen-Agronomy 2022 ,12, 747 3 of 18tal factors, the indices that predict residue decomposition characteristics and soil CO 2efﬂuxare likely to differ with soils.Northeast China Plain is the major grain-producing area in China [ 43]. Maize(Zea mays ) and soybean ( Glycine max ) are the two important crops, and clay loams andsandy loams are the two dominant soil types in this region. Long-term conventionalagronomic practices and crop residue removal have induced a signiﬁcant reduction inSOC storage [ 44]. Crop residue incorporation in soil has been advocated based on recentscientiﬁc ﬁndings [ 45]. It is largely unknown to how various parts (roots, stems and leaves)of maize and soybean inﬂuence SOC mineralization and restoration in these two soil types.Thus, the objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the effects of adding variousresidue types (different crops and plant parts) on soil CO 2emission in two Black soils,(2) to evaluate the contributions of various residue types on SOC accumulation, and (3) toidentify the relationships between C mineralization and initial chemical composition of theresidue parts as revealed by13CP-MAS NMR in the two soils. We hypothesis that the SOCturnover would show distinct responses to different residues parts in two different soils.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Studied Soil and Crop ResiduesThe studied soils included a clay loam (Mollisols) and a sandy loam (Udi-AlluvicPrimosols) (Soil Survey Staff, 2010) collected from the 0–20 cm soil layer of a maize-soybean rotation after maize harvest. The clay loam was collected from the ExperimentalStation (44120N, 125330E) of Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, ChineseAcademy of Sciences, in Dehui County, Jilin Province, China. The sandy loam was collectedfrom Halahai Town (44420N, 125060E), Nongan County, Jilin Province, China. Basicproperties of the two soils are shown in Table 1. Fresh soil was passed through a 2 mmscreen and stored at 4C for further study. Four whole plants of maize (Zea mays L.)and soybean ( Glycine max Merr.) were sampled from the same ﬁeld where soil had beencollected immediately after harvest in October, 2020. The maize and soybean plants wereseparated into roots, leaves and stems; the maize stems were further separated into threeequal lengths of top, middle and bottom sections. All parts of each plant were put in paperbags separately, dried to constant weight at 60C, and ground with a grinder to pass a0.25-mm sieve for chemical analyses.Table 1.

Aerobic Soil Incubation and Measurement of C MineralizationFresh soil (equivalent to 150 g dry soil) of the two soil types was mixed with 1.5 g ofdifferent plant tissues of soybean (roots, leaves or stems) and maize (roots, leaves, top stemsor bottom stems). Given that variation in element concentrations in maize stems showeda gradient from top to bottom, the middle stem section was not used for incubation. Soilwithout crop residue addition was incubated as control. Samples were mixed thoroughlyand put in 500 mL conical ﬂasks. They were then moistened to 60% water holding capacitywith deionized water. Four replicates were carried out for each treatment for a total of64 ﬂasks . Flasks were covered with perforated paraﬁlm and incubated at 25C, which isthe soil temperature in the ﬁeld at harvest time when the majority of residues were returnedto soil. Deionized water was added every second day to maintain the moisture content.The CO 2emission was measured daily from day 3 to 9, every 2 days from day 11 to 17 andevery 4 days from day 17 to 61. The CO 2concentration was determined using an infraredgas analyzer (LI-820, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) with a calibration curve as the one describedAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 4 of 18in [46]. After each CO 2measurement, the incubation ﬂasks were ﬂushed with air andcovered with perforated paraﬁlm again to maintain an aerobic headspace and minimizewater loss.The CO 2emission rate was calculated using the following Equation (1) [47]:F=aVVmM(1)where Fis the CO 2emission rate (pmol g 1s 1),Vmis the molar volume of CO 2andMis the weight of incubated soil-residue mixture; while Vand aare the volume andthe increase rate (ppm (V) s 1) of CO 2concentration in the closed measurement system,respectively. The CO 2emission primed by residue was calculated according to the followingEquation (2) [48]:DCO 2= C R,SOC CSOC (2)where CR, SOC is the cumulative CO 2emission from soils with residue amendment, whileCSOCis the cumulative CO 2emission from soils without residue.A two-pool exponential rise to maximum model was adopted to C mineralizationkinetics. The model well ﬁtted the CO 2emission rate data, where the mineralizable C isgenerally divided into active and slow C pools with corresponding parameters. The modelis described as the following Equation (3) [46]:Ct=Ca1 e kat) +Cs1 e kst(3)where C t, Ca, Cs,and trepresent the percentage of C mineralized at time t, the potentialmineralizable C of the active C pool, the potential mineralizable C of the slow C pool, andthe time (d), respectively. The ksand kaare the constants of mineralization rates (d 1) ofthe slow and active C pools, respectively. The model was ﬁtted to CO 2emission data usingnonlinear regression, and model parameters were iteratively optimized [ 46,49]. The Cmineralization half-time T 1/2(d) was calculated as the following Equation (4) [50]:T1/2= ln2/k (4)2.3. Analyses of Soil and Crop Residue SamplesThe total C and N of plant parts before incubation and soils after incubation weredetermined using a FlashEA 1112 elemental analyzer (ThermoFinnigan, Milan, Italy). TheSOC was assumed to equal the total C since the studied soils were free of carbonates [ 43].Lignin concentrations in plant parts were determined using method of [ 51]. Brieﬂy, residueswere placed in a 100C water bath (1 h), centrifuged at 2500 rpm (3 min) and then ex-tracted with 2 M HCl and 67% H 2SO4. They were then rinsed with hot water followed byacetone, dried at 60C and weighed to acquire acid detergent ﬁber content. The residueswere further extracted with 72% sulfuric acid for 3 h. Lignin content was corrected forash content. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were determinedusing the fumigation extraction method [ 52]. Organic C and total N in the extracts offumigated and nonfumigated soils were determined using a TOC analyzer (Model TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). MBC and MBN were calculated as Ec/KEC, whereEc = (organic C or total N extracted from fumigated soil)  (organic C or total N ex-tracted from non-fumigated soil). The KEC is 0.38 for MBC [ 52] and 0.45 for MBN cal-culation [ 53]. Soil available N was determined in moist soil samples using the steamdistillation method [54]The chemical composition of C in different parts of maize and soybean residues wasinvestigated using solid-state13C-NMR spectroscopy, which was performed on a BrukerAvance II 300 (Bruker Instrumental Inc, Karlsruhe, German) equipped with a 7 mm CPMAS(cross-polarization magic-anglespinning) detector (Bruker Instrumental Inc, Karlsruhe,German). NMR spectra were acquired under the conditions of a spectrometer frequency ofAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 5 of 1875 MHz, a MAS spinning frequency of 5000 Hz, a recycle time of 2.5 s and a contact time of2 ms. The external standard used for chemical shift determination was hexam-ethylbenzene(methyl at 17.33 ppm). The spectral regions have been selected and C types identiﬁed asreported in [ 55]. The spectra were integrated into the following seven regions and C-types:carbonyl C (190–160 ppm), phenolic C (160–142 ppm), aromatic C (142–110 ppm), di-O-alkylC (110–90 ppm), O-alkyl (carbohydrate) C (90–60 ppm), N-alkyl/methoxyl C ( 60–45 ppm )and alkyl C (45–0 ppm). The concentration of each certain C type (CCT, in g kg 1) wascalculated as CCT = TCRA, where: TCis the concentration of total C in the whole maizeor soybean straw including roots (g kg 1) and RAis the relative abundance of certain Ctype (%), which was calculated according to the description of [ 56]. The residue aromatic-ity was calculated as (110–160 ppm)/(0–160 ppm) 100 [ 57]; HB/HI was calculated as(0–45 ppm + 110–160 ppm)/(60–110 ppm + 160–190 ppm) [ 41]; alkyl to O-alkyl C (A/O-A)was calculated as (0–45 ppm) /(60–90 ppm) [40].2.4. Statistical AnalysisModel ﬁt was conducted using the Global curve ﬁt wizard in SigmaPlot 12.5 softwarepackage (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Pearson correlation calculated with theCORR procedure was employed to evaluate the relationships among residue chemical pa-rameters, CO 2emission and soil biochemical characteristics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)was conducted to explore the differences between soils amended with different residuetypes using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A signiﬁcance level of p= 0.05 wasused unless otherwise indicated.3. Results3.1. Chemical Characteristics of Different Parts of Maize and Soybean ResiduesThere were considerable differences in chemical quality of different parts of maizeand soybean residues (Table 2). The total C (TC) and N (TN) concentrations ranged from307 to 450 g kg 1and from 4.0 to 10.2 g kg 1, respectively, and the TC concentrationin maize roots was signiﬁcantly lower than that in other parts while for soybean, it wassigniﬁcantly higher in roots than that in other parts. Meanwhile, both maize and soybeanleaves contained the highest TN, followed by roots and stems. These differences of TC andTN concentrations in the seven residues resulting the distinct C/N ratios, which varyingfrom 21 to 108 in the 7 residues ( p0.05). Generally, the functional C groups in the residuesof both crops were dominated by O-alkyl C (123.8 g kg 1~251.1 g kg 1), di-O-alkyl C(36.0 g kg 1~77.3 g kg 1) and aromatic C (27.5 g kg 1~54.2 g kg 1). The other functional Cgroups were all less than 35.0 g kg 1. Among all of the functional C groups, the labile Cgroup of carbonyl C and the alkyl C in leaves were signiﬁcantly higher than that in otherparts of residues of the two crops while the aromatic C in leaves were signiﬁcantly lowerthan that in other parts of the two crops residues ( p0.05). The relative labile C groups ofO-alkyl C and di-O-alkyl C concentrations were the highest in the stems and signiﬁcantlyhigher than that in root and leaves of both plants, especially in top stem parts of maize(p0.05). The concertation of lignin in both plant residues showed roots > stem > leaves,and the differences in different parts of maize and soybean were signiﬁcant ( p0.05).The change trend of HB/HI ratio of the seven parts from maize and soybean residuewas the same as that of A/OA ratio. Both HB/HI and A/OA ratios were signiﬁcantlyhigher in soybean leaves (followed by maize leaves) than other residues types, and was thelowest in maize top part of stem and soybean roots. For maize residues, total N was highestin the leaves (13.8 g kg 1) and showed signiﬁcant differences between bottom ( 6.7 g kg 1)and top (4.0 g kg 1) stem parts; maize top stem parts also contained signiﬁcantly higheralkyl C, with signiﬁcantly higher lignin/N and C/N ratios and signiﬁcantly higher A/OAratio compared with bottom stem parts. Total C, lignin and other C functional groupsshowed no difference between the two stem parts. Soybean residue showed a similarpattern, with the highest C/N and lignin/N ratios in stems and highest aromaticity in roots.The concentrations of O-alkyl C (36~77 g kg 1) and di-O-alkyl C (124~260 g kg 1) wereAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 6 of 18higher than other C groups, and were higher in the stems of both plants, especially in topstem parts of maize ( p0.05). The concentrations of phenolic C, aromatic C and methoxylC were the highest in the roots (Table 2).Table 2.

Soil CO 2Emission and Carbon Mineralization Model Fit in the Two SoilsThe CO 2emission rates in both soils were signiﬁcantly increased by residue addition(17~150 pmolg 1s 1) compared with control (10~16 pmol g 1s 1) (Figure 1) ( p0.05),and this rate in all treatments with residue addition experienced a sharp drop and thena relative slow increase following by a slow decrease to a plateau during the incubationperiod (Figure 1). Compared with other plant parts, leaves produced the highest CO 2emission rate at the beginning of incubation, followed by a sharp drop in the next fewdays (Figure 1). However, CO 2emission rates in treatments with leaves were lower thanthat with other residue parts in both soils at the ﬁnal period of incubation, especially withsoybean leaves. Between the two soil types, the CO 2emission induced by addition of agiven type of residue was higher from the clay loam than the sandy loam, although thedifferences were not always statistically signiﬁcant at p0.05 (Figure 1).Applying crop residues signiﬁcantly increased cumulative CO 2emissions ( p0.05)compared with the control in both type of soils during the early incubation period (initial21 days) and during the whole incubation period (61 days) (Figure 2). Cumulative CO 2emissions at the two time periods (21 days vs. 61 days) showed different responses toresidue addition. During the early period, maize top stem parts induced signiﬁcantlylower cumulative CO 2emission than the other maize parts and all soybean residue parts,whereas soybean roots produced lower CO 2emission compared with its stems and leaves.Leaves produced the highest cumulative CO 2compared with other parts in both soils, andthe differences were signiﬁcant in the sandy loam ( p0.05). Cumulative CO 2emissionsinduced by different residue types showed similar results between the two soils while theemissions from the clay loam were 4.1~21% higher than that from the sandy loam in theearly incubation period (21 days). In the whole incubation period of 61 days, cumulativeCO 2emissions showed large differences between the two soils (13%~39% higher from theclay loam than that from the sandy loam) (Figure 2). Across the seven residue types in theclay loam, soil with soybean stems produced the highest amount of CO 2(413molg 1)followed by soil with maize bottom stem parts (398 molg 1), whereas soil with soybeanleaves produced the lowest amount (323 molg 1). Across the four types of maize residues,the maize top stem parts produced the lowest CO 2in both soils, which were 19% and 12%lower than bottom stem parts and roots, respectively, in the clay loam, and 16% and 9.4%lower than bottom stem parts and leaves, respectively, in the sandy loam (Figure 2).The data of CO 2emission from soils amended with the seven residue types well ﬁttedthe two-pool ﬁrst-order decay model (C t= Ca(1 e kat) + C s(1 e kst)) (R2> 0.99)(Table 3). Except for the soils amended with maize top stem parts, the active C pools (C a)were higher than the slow C pools (C s) in soils with the other six residue types. The C aandthe mineralization rate constants ( ka) of active C of soils amended with all seven residuetypes were signiﬁcantly lower in the clay loam than the sandy loam ( p0.05). The C sAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 7 of 18was signiﬁcantly greater in the clay loam than the sandy loam with a mineralization rateconstant ( ks) of slow C showing no distinguishable pattern. The active C had a signiﬁcantlyshorter half-life (T (1/2) a) in the clay loam than the sandy loam while the half-life (T (1/2) s) ofslow C which was longer in the clay loam than the sandy loam ( p0.05).Agronomy 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 24   Agronomy 2022 , 12, x. https://doi.org/10.3390/xxxxx www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy 3.2. Soil CO 2 Emission and Carbon Mineralizat ion Model Fit in the Two Soils The CO 2 emission rates in both soils were sign ificantly increased by residue addition (17~150 pmol·g−1·s−1) compared with control (10~16 pmol·g−1·s−1) (Figure 1) ( p ≤ 0.05), and this rate in all treatments with residue addi tion experienced a sharp drop and then a rel-ative slow increase following by a slow decreas e to a plateau during the incubation period (Figure 1). Compared with other plant parts, leaves produced the highest CO 2 emission rate at the beginning of incubation, followed by  a sharp drop in the next few days (Figure 1). However, CO 2 emission rates in treatments with leaves were lower than that with other residue parts in both soils at the final period of incubation, especially with soybean leaves. Between the two soil types, the CO 2 emission induced by addition of a given type of resi-due was higher from the clay loam than the sandy loam, although the differences were not always statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05 (Figure 1).

Cumulative CO 2 emissions induced by different residue types showed similar results between the two soils while the emissions from the clay loam were 4.1~21% higher than that from the sandy loam in the early incubation period (21 days). In the whole incubation period of 61 days, cumulative CO2 emissions showed large differences between  the two soils (13%~39% higher from the clay loam than that from the sandy loam) (F igure 2). Across the seven residue types in the clay loam, soil with soybean stems produced the highest amount of CO 2 (413 μmol·g−1) followed by soil with maize bottom stem parts (398 μmol·g−1), whereas soil with soybean leaves produced the lowest amount (323 μmol·g−1). Across the four types of maize resi-dues, the maize top stem parts produced the lowest CO 2 in both soils, which were 19% and 12% lower than bottom stem parts and root s, respectively, in the clay loam, and 16% and 9.4% lower than bottom stem parts and le aves, respectively, in the sandy loam (Figure 2).  Figure 2. The cumulative CO 2 emission from soils amended with  different residue types after 21 and 61 days of incubation. Vertical bars are the standard errors ( n = 4). Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences among residu e types for a given incubation period at p ≤ 0.05. The data of CO 2 emission from soils amended with the seven residue types well fitted the two-pool first-order decay model (C t = Ca · (1 − etka⋅−) + C s · (1 − etks⋅−)) (R2 > 0.99) (Table 3). Except for the soils amended with maize top stem parts, the active C pools (C a) were higher than the slow C pools (C s) in soils with the other six residue types. The C a and the mineralization rate constants ( ka) of active C of soils amended with all seven residue types were significantly lower in the clay loam than the sandy loam ( p ≤ 0.05). The C s was significantly greater in the clay loam than the sandy loam with a mineralization rate con-stant ( ks) of slow C showing no distinguishable pattern. The active C had a significantly shorter half-life (T (1/2) a) in the clay loam than the sandy loam while the half-life (T (1/2) s) of slow C which was longer in the clay loam than the sandy loam ( p ≤ 0.05). For the clay loam, the C a in treatments with maize leaves (40 μmol g−1 soil) and soy-bean leaves (41 μmol g−1 soil) was notably higher than that with other residues, and the C a the treatment with maize top stem parts (16 μmol g−1 soil). The C a in various residue treat-ments showed a similar pattern in the two soils (Table 3). The variations in C a among the treatments were consistent with cumulative CO 2 emission in the early period (21 days) of incubation. Soils with maize top stem parts had the largest C s (40~57 μmol g−1 soil), fol-lowed by soils with soybean stems, whereas soils with leaves of maize and soybean had Figure 2.

The T (1/2) awas generally longer in soils with the rootand stem than leaf residues. Meanwhile, the T (1/2) swas the longest in the soils with maizetop stem parts, followed by maize bottom stem parts and roots of both crops, and it wasshortest in the soils amended with leaves (Table 3).3.3. Effects of Different Residue Types on C Sequestration and Biochemical Properties of theTwo SoilsAfter the incubation of 61 days, the SOC concentrations after incubation differedamong treatments (Table 4). In the clay loam soil, compared with the control soil, return ofmaize top stem parts and soybean roots induced a slight increase in SOC (by 2.9% and 1.8%,respectively), whereas the return of other residue types caused a minor decrease in SOC.Although no signiﬁcant variation was found compared with the control soil ( p> 0.05), theSOC in clay loam amended with maize top stem parts (18.1 g kg 1) was signiﬁcantly higherthan that with soybean leaves (17.0 g kg 1) (p0.05). Incubation of residues in the sandyloam produced higher SOC concentration compared with the clay loam (Table 4). Exceptfor the soybean leaves that caused a 3.6% decrease in SOC, return of other six residues ledto an increase in SOC and the increases in treatments with maize top stem parts (17%) andsoybean roots (18%) were signiﬁcant compared with the control ( p0.05).Compared with the control soil, the residue amendments signiﬁcantly increasedsoil MBC and MBN (by 91%~177% and 163%~349%, respectively, in the clay loam, andby 111%~295% and 202%~510%, respectively, in the sandy loam); in contrast, the ratioof MBC/MBN and available N were signiﬁcantly decreased ( p0.05; Table 4). Theconcentrations of MBC, MBN and available N were greater in the clay loam than thesandy loam, although the differences were not always signiﬁcant. In both soils amendedwith maize residues, the concentrations of MBC and MBN were signiﬁcantly higher intreatments with leaves than roots and stems (especially top stem parts); soils amended withsoybean residues showed a similar pattern with signiﬁcantly higher values in the treatmentwith leaves ( p0.05; Table 4). Soils amended with soybean and maize leaves producedthe highest concentrations of available N, followed by maize roots, in both clay loam andsandy loam.The cumulative increase of CO 2emission ( DCO 2) from the two soils showed distinctdifferences after in responses to the return of different crop residues (Figure 3).

Discussion4.1. Residue Biochemistry and C Mineralization in the Two SoilsResidue biochemistry is one of the important properties that inﬂuence residue decom-position dynamics and a native soil C loss through microbial metabolisms [ 23,27,33,58].Generally, the phenolic C, aromatic C and methoxyl C indicated the presence of lignin inresidues and/or oleﬁnic in lipids, the concentrations of which were the highest in the rootsand the methoxyl C and carbonyl C were partially associated with proteins or peptides [ 59].It is reported that C mineralization rates of plant materials strongly relate to their concen-trations of carbonyl, aryl and O-aryl C as well as initial N [ 60]. The higher concentrations ofN, carbonyl and aryl as well as lower concentration of lignin in the leaf residues comparedwith other parts of both crops underpinned fast early decomposition in soil compared withstems and roots. This was consistent with the results of other studies [26,32].However, Xu et al. (2018) found that mineralization of crop residue C and nativeSOC was not affected by residue types through a laboratory incubation experiment witha Cambisol of low fertility amended with three types of maize residues (root, stem andleaf) [ 21,61], which was limited by1 the soil fertility. This illustrated that mineralization ofcrop residue C and native SOC was also closely related to soil-speciﬁc [ 16,18,62] and/orcontrolled by the interaction between crop residue quality and soil characteristics [63].Results from the13C-NMR analysis in our study showed that generally, celluloseand hemicellulose are the main compounds in soybean and maize residues while ligninand protein present were at lower abundance. In terms of crop residue parts, differentparts (roots, stems and leaves) of maize and soybean residues had evidently differentconcentrations of total C and N, main C functional groups, as well as corresponding ratiosthat commonly serve as indicators of residue recalcitrance (Table 2). Both HB/HI andA/OA ratios of residues could reﬂect the bioavailability. The higher ratios indicate themore easy to be decomposed [ 40,41]. Thus, leaves of maize and soybean residue were themost available to be degraded by degraders in two soils, which resulted in the initiallyhighest, while the CO 2emission rate was the lowest in two soils with amendment ofsoybean roots and top stem parts with the lowest HB/HI and A/OA ratios (Table 2 andFigure 1). Different lignin contents and other chemical properties among maize parts havebeen shown in other studies [ 62,64], but the signiﬁcantly lower N and alkyl C contentsand signiﬁcantly lower alkyl/O-alkyl and higher lignin/N and C/N in maize top stemparts compared with bottom stem parts found in this study have been reported rarely.This non-homogeneous vertical distribution of N and alkyl and O-alkyl C in maize stemsinduced the differences in CO 2release patterns from soils amended with bottom and topstem parts. The signiﬁcantly higher alkyl/O-alkyl ratio in crop leaves followed by maizeroots and bottom stem parts, and then soybean roots and maize top stem parts coincidedwith the enhanced CO 2emission stage.The CO 2emission from the residue-amended treatments generally showed a four-stagepattern of “rapid decrease, relatively stable, increasing to relatively high level and then aﬁnal gradual decrease” during the 61-day incubation (Figure 1). This rapid decrease and thefollowing stable stage in the earlier days of incubation was due to the rapid decompositionand exhaustion of labile organic matter, whereas the increasing stage could be attributedto an increase in abundance of microorganisms capable of decomposing organic matterAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 12 of 18with long-chains or rings [ 65]. The CO 2emission in the initial 21 days showed a differentpattern compared with the whole 61-day incubation (Figures 1 and 2) due to relativelyearly decomposition of labile C groups. The decomposition pattern was correlated withmost residue chemistry parameters examined. The relationship of decomposition ratewith alkyl/O-alkyl or lignin/N was the most signiﬁcant in the clay loam or sandy loam,respectively (Table 6), indicating that the alkyl/O-alkyl and lignin/N could serve as therobust indicators of early residue decomposition rate in, respectively, the clay loam andsandy loam.The signiﬁcant difference in CO 2release patterns from the clay loam and the sandyloam amended with most residue parts in our study indicated the important role of soiltexture in C mineralization. The signiﬁcantly higher cumulative CO 2emission in theclay loam than the sandy loam suggested that the protection from clay was not the mainmechanism governing new C accumulation in this soil. After the amendment with residues,the presence of the sufﬁcient amount of mineral N in the clayey soil compared withsandy soil favored an increase in microbial populations and their activity that promotedfast decomposition of residues and release of CO 2in the clayey soil [ 20]. However, thedifference in CO 2emission between the two soils induced by crop leaves, especially soybeanleaves, was not as signiﬁcant as that by other residue types. On one hand, higher N andlower lignin in leaves compared with other residue parts could make decompositionof leaves less dependent on concentration of mineral N in soil [ 66]; on the other, theseresidues had a stronger combination capacity with clay minerals than residues with lowN and high lignin concentrations, and could to some extent decrease decomposition bymicroorganisms [ 67]. Thus, it could be concluded that the effects of soil texture would begreater on decomposition of residues with high lignin and low N concentrations. Moreover,higher SOC concentration in the clay loam than the sandy loam could also have played arole in higher CO 2emission in the former.Signiﬁcantly greater C aand smaller C sin the sandy loam than the clay loam (Table 3)indicated preservation of the labile organic matter in the sandy soil and more stable C inthe clayey soil. The signiﬁcantly longer half-life of slow C in the clay loam than sandy loamfurther implied that organic matter in the clayey soil was characterized by more humiﬁedand older C. This is consistent with Fan et al. (2018) who demonstrated that aromatic Ccontent was found to be greater in the clay fractions, whereas aliphatic C content was higherin the sand fractions [ 68]. The signiﬁcantly shorter half-life of active C in the clay loamthan the sandy loam showed that microbial attack on C was more prominent in the clayloam. The C awas greater in soils amended with maize and soybean leaves than roots andstems, whereas the C sshowed the opposite trend with the highest values in the treatmentwith maize top stem parts. This was consistent with chemistry of the residues revealedby the NMR analysis that crop leaves contained signiﬁcantly higher labile C groups thanother parts of residues. This suggested that leaves tend to decompose faster than other cropparts in soil, and maize top stem parts contributed the most to the accumulation of soilrecalcitrant C pool. Except for maize top stem parts, roots had larger C sand longer T (1/2) sthan leaves, maize bottom stem parts and soybean stems. In other studies, roots were alsofound more recalcitrant and with a longer mean residence time than leaves [ 69,70]. Usinga meta-analysis, Freschet et al. (2013) found that roots of herbaceous species decompose1.8 times slower than leaves. Therefore, increased return of aboveground soybean residuescan decrease the average mean residence time of residues in soil [10,71].4.2. Contribution of Various Residue Types to C Emission and SOC Accumulation in the Two SoilsGiven that there was a considerable difference in background CO 2emission betweenthe two studied soils, the PE could better explain the differences in C mineralization thanthe total CO 2emission [72]. Results from two-way ANOVA (Table 5) showed that the soiltype had a more signiﬁcant effect on PE than the residue type and the interactive effect ofthe two, emphasizing the contribution of soil type to CO 2emission. The stronger primingin the clay loam than the sandy loam was consistent with other studies that demonstratedAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 13 of 18stronger priming was expected in soils with high C content and microbial biomass [ 63].Among the residue characteristics, only alkyl/O-alkyl correlated signiﬁcantly with PEand SOC concentration in the clay loam. This explained why the leaves of both crops,having high labile C concentrations, induced fast CO 2emission but did not have greater PEcompared with other residues. This also conﬁrmed our conclusions about the alkyl/O-alkylbeing a more robust indicator of residue decomposition and CO 2emission than lignin/Nand C/N in the clay loam. In the sandy loam, the lignin/N showed the most signiﬁcantcorrelations with PE and SOC, which indicated that this ratio was the most robust indicatorfor SOC decomposition and sequestration in the sandy loam.High rates of organic matter inputs annually are reported to be essential to retainingan adequate level of organic carbon and mineral-N in croplands [ 73]. However, using seventypes of residues to amend the studied two Black soils did not result in SOC accumulationas expected. In the clay loam with high SOC and nutrient background (Table 1), nosigniﬁcant increase in SOC was found in any of the seven treatments, with a slight increasein treatments with maize top stem parts and soybean roots after 61-day incubation. It isclear from our study that the strong PE after addition of residues in the clay loam surpassedthe amount of added residue C. Negative effects of residues on SOC due to priming havebeen reported, with most studies using soils with high SOC levels [ 10,70]. Mitchell et al.(2018) suggested that an important role of organic inputs is to provide the immediate aswell as the long-term C sinks, but it could also lead to increased mineralization of SOCunder circumstance of high SOC levels [ 74]. In the sandy loam with low SOC and nutrientconcentrations (Table 1), all residue amendments except soybean leaves induced SOCaccumulation after incubation, and the increase was signiﬁcant in the treatments withmaize top stem parts and soybean roots. These results highlighted the important rolesof soil type, residue quality and their interactions on priming and SOC dynamics. Thecorrelations of SOC with residue chemical parameters, including total C and N, alkyl C,lignin/N and C/N, were more signiﬁcant in the sandy loam than the clay loam (Table 6),probably due to the fact that the low C and nutrients such as mineral N in the sandy loamwere the limiting factor for SOC-decomposing microorganisms [ 19]. The results showedthat the maize top stem parts, with the lowest alkyl/O-alkyl and highest lignin/N of allseven residue types, had a higher contribution to SOC accumulation than other residues,especially in the sandy loam with a low starting SOC content.4.3. Soil Biochemical Properties and N Availability as Inﬂuenced by Various Residue Types in theTwo SoilsCrop residue decomposition is an important component of C cycling, which providesnutrients and energy to the soil micro-food web [ 75]. Soils amended with residues in ourstudy were characterized by signiﬁcantly greater biomass and signiﬁcantly lower availableN compared with the un-amended soils. The residue amendment provided substances andenergy for growth and reproduction of microorganisms, thus could increase biomass andactivity of soil microorganisms [ 76–78], which in turn consumed N compounds from soiland decreased mineral N concentration [ 79]. In the present study, residue amendment sig-niﬁcantly increased MBC and MBN concentration while signiﬁcantly reduced MBC/MBNratio indicating that more N than C was sequestrated by microbes in the two soils and ashift of microbial community structure in soil [80].The diverse chemical characteristics of different parts of maize and soybean residueswas closely related with the decomposition of residues. In the early stage of residue de-composition, sufﬁcient and nutrients and easily-decomposable C substrates (saccharides,semi-cellulose, etc.) consisted by O-alkyl and carbonyl C from leaves with high A/OA ratiostimulated the reproduction of microorganisms with relatively low MBC/MBN and se-questrated C and N form residue into soils [ 65]. In the later stage of residue decomposition,microbes mainly decomposed the recalcitrant substance (such as lignin) consisted witharomatic C. In this stage, the growth of microbial biomass would slow due to N limited [ 81].Our results also showed a signiﬁcantly negative relationship between aromatic C and MBNAgronomy 2022 ,12, 747 14 of 18and a signiﬁcant positive relationship between A/OA and soil MBC, MBN and availableN (Table 6).Chemical compositions of residues not only regulated decomposition patterns, butalso affected available N content and biomass and community structure of microorganisms.Residues with low lignin concentration and low C/N were more readily decomposed andcould induce higher bacterial biomass and soil mineral N, whereas residues with highlignin concentration and high C/N need more time to break down and could stimulatereproduction of microorganisms such as fungi that are adaptable to oligotrophic envi-ronments [ 20,55]. Results from the present study conﬁrmed this conclusion. The ratiolignin/N was signiﬁcantly higher in stems (especially maize top stem parts) and roots thanthe leaves of both crops, and MBC and MBN were signiﬁcantly lower in soils amendedwith stems (especially maize top stem parts) and roots than leaves; the signiﬁcantly lowerMBC/MBN in the clay loam amended with leaves indicated small fungal community inthis treatment [ 59]. The higher concentrations of MBC, MBN and available N in the clayloam than in the sandy loam were consistent with higher CO 2emission in the clay loam,indicating that the lower microbial metabolic capacity resulting from limited N availabilityin the sandy soil could be the reason for the lower residue decomposition. The response ofMBC/MBN to addition of various residue types was largely different between the two soils.It could thus be inferred that the effects of residue chemistry on soil microbial communitystructure differed with soil types due to the diverse physic-chemical properties.5. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that the mineralization pattern of carbon after residue amend-ment was signiﬁcantly affected by soil type and different residue chemistry. Concentrationsof C, N and functional C groups as well as indices frequently used for evaluating residuerecalcitrance differed in roots, stems and leaves of maize and soybean residues. There wasalso non-homogeneous vertical distribution of N and alkyl and O-alkyl C in maize stems,associated with signiﬁcantly lower CO 2emission and higher SOC accumulation in soilsamended with maize top stem parts than bottom stem parts. The higher concentrations ofN and carbonyl and aryl groups and lower concentration of lignin in leaves of both cropsled to their fast and early decomposition compared with stems and roots. Maize top stemparts, followed by soybean roots, had a larger slow C pool and longer half-life than leaves,maize bottom stem parts and soybean stems. In addition to residue chemistry, soil texturealso had considerable effects on C mineralization and soil biochemical parameters. Theeffects of soil texture were greater on decomposition of residues with high lignin and low Nconcentrations. A signiﬁcantly greater active C pool and the smaller slow C pool as well aslower CO 2emission in the sandy loam than the clay loam indicated that the labile organicmatter was preserved mainly in the sandy soil, and more stable C was associated withclay. The signiﬁcantly longer half-life of slow C in the clay loam than the sandy loam alsoconﬁrmed that the clay loam favored long-term SOC sequestration compared with sandyloam. The alkyl/O-alkyl and lignin/N could serve as the robust indicators of early residuedecomposition and SOC sequestration in the clay loam and sandy loam, respectively.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.D. and H.C.; methodology, Y.D. and H.C.; formal analy-sis, Y.D. and H.C.; investigation, Y.D. and H.C.; resources, Z.Y.; data curation, Y.D.; writing—origina ldraft preparation, S.L. and J.L.; writing—review and editing, R.F. and A.L.; supervision, R.F. and J.L.;visualization, A.L. and J.L.; project administration, R.F. and J.L.; funding acquisition, R.F., A.L., H.P .,H.L. and J.L.
