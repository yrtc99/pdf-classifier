However, while CO 2fixation by phototrophic bacteria is relatively well studied, little isknown about microbial CO 2fixation without light by chemoautotrophic bacteria in grasslandsoils. Therefore, in this study, the isotope14C-CO 2was used to investigate the CO 2-fixing processin grassland soils. Soil samples were collected from both fenced and adjacent continuousgrazing grassland sites in Inner Mongolia and then incubated for 120 days under darkconditions. Meanwhile, the cbbL genes (red- and green-like) were analyzed to isolatechemoautotrophic bacteria, which are responsible for CO 2fixation. After incubation,14C wasfixed into soil organic carbon (14C-SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (14C-MBC) were found inboth the fenced and grazing soils, and the fixation rate of14C-SOC in the fenced soils (48.55 ‰)was significantly higher than in the grazing soils (22.11 ‰). The fixation rate of14C-MBC in thefenced soils (14.05 ‰) was higher than in the grazing soils (7.08 ‰), but the difference was notsignificant. The red-like cbbL genes could be detected in all the soil samples, but the green-likecbbL genes could not be amplified. A greater number of identified operational taxonomic unitswere observed in the fenced soils compared with the grazing soils. The chemoautotrophicbacteria were mainly affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. However,Chloroflexi was detected in only the fenced soils. The results suggested that CO2fixation bychemoautotrophic bacteria might be significant in carbon cycling in grassland.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 30 November 2016Accepted 7 January 2017KEYWORDSAtmospheric CO 2fixation;cbbL gene ;chemoautotrophic bacteria;grassland soil; RuBisCO geneIntroductionGrassland ecosystems constitute about 40% of the globalland area and play a significant role in the global terres-trial C cycle (Wang & Fang 2009 ). Due to the relativelyhigh C sequestration rates (mainly associated withbelow-ground C pools) and extensive area, grasslandsare recognized for their great potential as net sink foratmospheric CO2and climate change regulator (Follett& Reed 2010 ). Marginal changes in soil C sequestrationrates in grasslands can have significant impacts onatmospheric CO 2concentrations (Follett & Reed 2010 ).Globally, soils contain 1500 Pg C, which is twice theamount of atmospheric C pool (Schlesinger & Andrews2000 ), with grasslands containing ∼12% of the overallterrestrial soil C pool (Schlesinger 1977 ). However, grass-land management can alter the quantity and quality oflitter inputs and, subsequently, impact the amountsand stability of C stored in the soil (Dubeux et al. 2006 ).Conversely, adoption of improved grassland manage-ment practices such as proper grazing and soil nutrientmanagement can also have positive impacts on soil Csequestration (Dubeux et al. 2006 ).CO2is a greenhouse gas which is with the potentialthreat of global climate change. The concentration ofatmospheric CO2dramatically increase from about 280to more than 380 parts per million (ppm) over the last250 years because of the consumption of fossil fuels.And it will rise up to 570 ppm in the atmosphere bythe year 2100 predicted by the International Panel onClimate Change (Song 2006 ). Nowadays, it is an urgentneed to reduce atmospheric CO2concentration andslow down the effects of global warming. Now manytechniques (physical fixation, chemical fixation and bio-fixation of CO2) are developed to alleviate atmosphericCO2, of which the biofixation of CO 2by microorganismswas considered an economical, effective and sanitarymethod. Microbial biofixation of CO2employs thecapacity of autotrophic microorganisms, includingphotoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs, for CO 2fixation(Yousuf et al. 2012 ), which are known to contribute© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Yumei Kang kang@kochi-u.ac.jp Laboratory of Soil Environmental Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kochi University, 200 Otsu Monobe, NankokuCity, Kochi 783-8502, JapanACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA, SECTION B —SOIL & PLANT SCIENCE, 2017VOL. 67, NO. 4, 362 –371http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2017.1281433significantly to CO 2assimilation in aquatic environment.Photoautotrophs are capable of synthesizing their ownfood from inorganic substances by using light as anenergy source. And the chemoautotrophs can supportcarbon fixation in the absence of light by using theenergy from oxidizing H2,H2S, S 2O2−3,NH+4,N O 2and Fe2+(Santoro et al. 2013 ). Photoautotrophs (e.g. microalgaeand cyanobacteria) can grow much faster than terrestrialplants and live in harsh conditions due to their structure.Microalgal cells absorb CO 2to support their growth byconverting solar energy into biomass, which can be con-verted to secondary products with high commercialvalue (Beer et al. 2009 ). In addition, microalgae are pre-dominant carbon-fixing agents in water with efficiencybeing 10 times greater than that of terrestrial plants(Usui & Ikenouchi 1997 ). Like algae, cyanobacteria arealso efficient at the carbon fixation owing to theirsimpler structure (Oliver et al. 2014 ). They are consideredto play a key role among photosynthetic organisms,accounting for 20– 30% of Earth ’s primary photosyntheticactivity (Pisciotta et al. 2010 ).In general, CO 2can be fixed by five different pathways(Herter et al. 2002 ; Fan 2008 ), but the Calvin –Benson –Bassham (CBB) cycle is the major and most widely distrib-uted pathway using autotrophic microorganisms to fixCO2(Yuan, Ge, Chen et al. 2012 ). The key enzyme ofthe CBB cycle is the ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxy-lase/oxygenase (RubisCO) (Ellis 1979 ). It is a bifunctionalenzyme controlling the reduction of CO 2and the oxyge-nolysis of ribulose-1,5-bisphophate. RubisCO exists infour forms (I, II, III and IV), which differ in structure. Andthe most distributed type of RubisCO is the form I,which occurs in plants as well as in autotrophic (photoau-totrophic and chemoautotrophic) bacteria (Selesi et al.2005 ). The form I RubisCO is composed of eight largeand eight small subunits (L8S8) (Tabita 1999 ). Phyloge-netic studies based on these cbbL sequences haveshown that form I RubisCO had to be subdivided intotwo major groups: green-like and red-like (Watson &Tabita 1997 ). The green-like RubisCO is divided intotwo types, IA and IB, and found cbbL sequences fromplants, green algae, and Alpha-, Beta- and Gammapro-teobacteria as well as from Cyanobacteria. The red-likeRubisCO is also divided into two types, IC and ID,which is found in many non-green algea and Alpha-,and Betaproteobacteria (Videmš ek et al. 2009 ).Microbial assimilation of CO2is a ubiquitous processin soils. Global estimates of microbial CO 2fixation insoils range between 0.6 and 4.9 Pg C year−1(Yuan, Ge,Chen et al. 2012 ). Nowak et al. ( 2015 ) have estimatedthat in the wetland soils up to 27% of soil organicmatter (SOC) in the 0– 10 cm layer was derived fromautotrophic (photo- and chemoautotrophic) microbialfixation of CO2. The highest CO 2fixation by autotrophicmicroorganisms is found in the 0 –1 cm layer and14Clabeled SOC concentration in the paddy soils is higherin both 0– 1 and 1– 5 cm layers than those in theupland soils after incubated with continuous14CO2for110 days (Wu et al. 2014 ). In addition, chemoautotrophicacetogenes can assimilate CO 2with exogenous H 2in ricefield soil incubated at 50°C (Liu & Conrad 2011 ). Highabundance of autotrophic CO 2fixation bacteria isshown in arid soil in northwest China and in grasslandsoils near natural springs with high CO2concentration(Videm šek et al. 2009 ). However, only limited knowledgeis available on the CO 2fixation by chemoautotrophicbacteria in grassland soils under the dark condition.The aims of this study were (i) to test the ability of CO 2fixation by grassland soils; (ii) to compare the CO 2fix-ation rate between the fenced and grazing grasslandsoils and (iii) to determine the composition of thesecbbL types (green- and red-like) in soil bacteria isolatedfrom both the fenced and grazing grassland soils in asemi-arid region in Inner Mongolia, China.Materials and methodsStudy sites and soil samplingThe study area is located in Baarin Right Banner of Chifeng(43°12′55′′–44°27′52′′N, 118°12′09′′–120°01′42′′E) in thesoutheastern part of Inner Mongolia. This area has a tem-perate, semi-arid continental monsoon climate with dryand windy winters and springs, and hot, humidsummers followed by short and cool autumns. Themean annual precipitation is around 360 mm, with 60 –70% of the rainfall from June to September. The annualmean temperature is around 4.9°C, with a minimummonthly mean temperature of −13°C in January and amaximum of 22.2°C in July. The annual frost-free periodis approximately 125 days. From north to south it stretches1 3 9 k m ,w h i l ef r o me a s tt ow e s ti ts t r e t c h e s1 5 4 k m .Elevations decrease from a high of more than 1000 m inthe northwest to less than 400 m in the southeast.All field sampling was carried out in early August2014. A continuously grazed grassland site (GG) and anadjacent fenced grassland site (FG) with grazing exclu-sion of more than 20 years were selected. Five randomquadrats were established at each site for soil research.One soil sample was taken from five points in eachquadrat (four corners and the center of the quadrat) atdepths of 0– 5 cm and mixed into one sample. After care-fully removing the surface organic materials and fineroots, each mixed sample was divided into two parts.One part was air-dried for analysis of soil physicochem-ical properties and the other was sifted through aACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA, SECTION B –SOIL & PLANT SCIENCE 3632 mm sieve for microbial assays and stored at −20°C.Three aboveground plant sampling quadrats (1.0 ×1.0 m) were set up in both the grazed and fenced grass-land sites. After botanical composition, plant height andcanopy cover were measured, the remaining biomass ineach quadrat was clipped and weighed after being driedat 80°C for 48 h. The characteristics of the plant commu-nity in this study site are summarized in Table 1.Incubation experiments with labelled CO 2Two sets of 25 g fresh soil of each sample was added toglass bottles (5.5 cm diameter and 11 cm height) andplaced into containers (30 cm diameter and 17 cmdepth). In one set as a control, the soils were fumigatedunder a vacuum with CHCl3for 24 h. In another set, thesoil samples were just added to a bottle without anytreatment. In each container, one bottle was filled withsterile distilled water to maintain the moisture level inthe container, one bottle contained equal NaH14CO3(specific activity 310.8 MBq mmol−1, 2.31 MBq) and thelid was closed after HCl (1 M) was added to theNaH14CO3. All the containers were then incubated for120 days at 20°C in a plant growth chamber (LH-100RD; NKS, Tokyo, Japan) under dark conditions. Afterincubation, each soil sample was then mixed thoroughlyand divided into two portions. One portion was oven-dried at 70°C to a constant weight to determine the fix-ation rate of14C-SOC fixed from14C-CO 2in the air, andthe other was stored at 4°C to determine14C-MBC.Analytical methodsSoil pH was measured using a pH meter (F-21; Horiba,Japan) at a soil-to-water ratio of 1:5 after shaking for1 h. Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured after thepH measurement using an EC meter (CM-14P; TOA Elec-tronics Ltd., Japan). Soil moisture was measured afterbeing oven-dried at 105°C for 24 h. Particle size distri-bution was determined using the pipette method (Gee& Bauder 1986 ). Part of each sample was air-dried andfinely ground to pass through a 0.1 mm sieve and ana-lyzed for total N (TN) using the dry combustionmethod with an NC-Analyzer (Sumigraph Nc-80;Sumika Chemical Analysis Service Co., Tokyo, Japan).Soil organic carbon (Corg) was determined using theWalkley and Black method (Walkley 1947 ). The availablephosphorus (Avail. P) was determined using the Bray IImethod (Kuo 1996 ), where soil samples were extractedwith an extraction solution (1 M NH4F and 0.5 M HCl)and color-developing reagent was added. The Avail. Pwas then determined using the absorbance measure-ment with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of710 nm (UV-142-02; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Exchange-able cations (Ca2+,M g2+,K+and Na+) were extractedthree times with 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 7.0, andthe concentration was measured using an atomicabsorption spectrophotometer (AA-6800; Shimadzu,Kyoto, Japan). Microbial biomass C (Cmic) and N (N mic)was estimated using the fumigation extraction method(Tanaka et al. 1998 ).The14C-SOC was measured according to Ge et al.(2013 ). In brief, about 0.50 g of soil (dry soil) was addedto 10 mL 0.2 M potassium dichromate and 20 mL of amixture of concentrated H 2SO4and H 3PO4(5:1, v:v).14C-CO 2was trapped in 25 mL NaOH (0.5 M) after digest-ing at 165°C for 8 min with O 2continuously replenished.And then the mixture containing 1 mL NaOH and 5 mLUltima Gold XR (PerkinElmer, 940 Winter StreetWaltham, MA 02451, USA) was measured in an auto-mated liquid scintillation counter (LS-6500; Beckman)for 10 min. The14C-SOC fixation rate ( ‰) fixed by perkilogram soil was calculated as follows:14C−SOC=[F1(Rs−Ro)/RpW]×1000,where F1represents the factor to convert the countingvolume (1 mL from 25 mL); Rs,Roand Rpare14C-radioac-tivity (Bq) for a trapped solution,14C in the natural soil ofthe study sites and14C-CO 2generated from NaH14CO3inthe container, respectively; and W, the weight (kg) of soil.The14C-MBC was measured according to Ge et al.(2013 ). Moist soil samples (8 g) were fumigated for 24 hin the dark, followed by extraction with 32 mL K 2SO4(0.5 M). The14C-radioactivity in the extractant (1 mL) offumigated soil sample, together with that (1 mL)extracted from equivalent unfumigated portions, wasmeasured as above. The14C-MBC rate ( ‰) per kilogramsoil was calculated as follows:14C−MBC=[F2(Rf−Ruf)/RpW]×1000,where F2represents the factor to convert the countingvolume (from 1 mL to the volume of 32 mL plus soilwater volume in mL); Rfand Rufare14C trapped in fumi-gated and unfumigated soil extractant, respectively; Rp,Table 1.

The extracted pellet was dissolved in 100 μlT Eand the DNA concentration determined using a spectro-photometer (Nanodrop ND-1000; Thermo Fisher Scienti-fic Inc., USA). DNA was stored at −20°C until further use.Design of cbbL primersNew primer sets for amplification of cbbL (green- andred-like) sequences were designed manually. All cbbLnucleotide sequences, which were available from theNational Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)sequence database, were used to establish a cbbL data-base by using CLC Sequence Viewer 7. The sequenceswere first translated into amino acids using Genetyxver. 10, and the deduced amino acid sequences werethen aligned using CLC Sequence Viewer 7. Amino acidalignments were performed manually and nucleotidesequences were aligned accordingly. Based on thesedata, we designed two primer sets specific for theselected cbbL sequences of the red-like and green-likegroups. The primers cbbL RA and cbbL RB, used toamplify the red-like cbbL gene, were designed from mul-tiple sequence alignment data for the cbbL genes of Ral-stonia eutropha H16, Ralstonia eutropha megaplasmidpHG1, Sinorhizobium meliloti WSM419, Rhodobactersphaeroides HR and Rhodopseudomonas palustrisCGA009. The primers cbbL GA and cbbL GB, used toamplify the green-like cbbL genes, were designed frommultiple sequence alignment data for the cbbL genesofNitrobacter vulgaris T3,Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidansATCC 23270, Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava DSM1083,Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259 and Nitrospira sp.strain TCH716. The primers designed and used for thisstudy are listed in Table 2.PCR amplification, cloning and sequencingThe previously designed primers of the cbbL (green- andred-like) genes were used for amplification. In brief, eachindividual PCR mixture contained approximately 150 ngsoil DNA, 2 μl 10×Ex Taq buffer, 1 U Ex Taq polymerase(TaKaRa, Japan), 200 μM deoxynucleoside triphosphates,2.5μM of each cbbL primer and made up to 20 μl withsterilized H2O. The thermos-cycle conditions were asfollows: 4 min of initial denaturation at 95°C, followedby 40 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 95°C, 1 min ofannealing at 50°C for the red-like and 52°C for thegreen-like cbbL primers and 1 min of elongation at 72°C. The reaction was completed by a final extension for10 min at 72°C. PCR products were checked in 0.8%(wt/vol) agarose gels (PeqLab Biotechnology GmbH,Erlangen, Germany) using horizontal gel electrophoresisat 75 V for 45 min. DNA was observed using UV exci-tation after staining with ethidium bromide.PCR products were purified using a Wizard SV Gel andPCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega, USA) and ligated intop3 T Vector (MoBiTec, Germany), and the resulting ligationproducts were used to transform Escherichia coli DH12S(Invitrogen, Japan) competent cells. The inserted productswere amplified with primers ( M13-47 and RV-M ) and weresequenced directly from white colonies grown in LB sup-plemented with ampicillin and X-gal. The sequences werecompared with known cbbL gene sequences from theGenBank (NCBI) database using BLAST. Sequence datahave been submitted to the DDBJ database under acces-sion numbers LC195753 to LC195828.Statistical analysisData were processed using Excel 2013 for the means andthe standard errors. The Student ’st-test was used tocompare the difference in soil physicochemical charac-teristics between the fenced and grazing sites. Multiplecomparisons of significant differences were made usingone-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey test(P<.05). All analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0for Windows XP.ResultsSoil properties changesAccording to the results, grazing significantly decreasedsoil moisture and EC compared with the fenced grass-land soil ( P<.01) ( Table 3). The soil was slightly acidic(6.84–6.97), and the differences in soil pH between thefenced and grazing sites were not significant ( P>.05).There was a significant difference in soil Corgand TNTable 2.

Theresults revealed that the mean C organd TN significantlyincreased from 18.81 g kg−1in the grazing site to26.39 g kg−1in the fenced site and from 2.00 g kg−1inthe grazing site to 3.10 g kg−1in the fenced site, respect-ively ( P<.01). However, there was no difference in the C-to-N ratio between the fenced and grazing sites ( P>.05).The soil silt and clay content decreased from 16.68% and26.45% in the fenced site to 14.43% and 23.52% in thegrazing site, while the soil sand content increased from56.87% in the fenced site to 62.05% in the grazing site.There were no significant differences between themean value of exchangeable Mg2+and Na+for thefenced and adjacent grazing grassland ( P>.05), but themean value of exchangeable Ca2+and K+decreased sig-nificantly from 19.81 cmol ckg−1in the fenced site to11.03 cmol ckg−1in the grazing site and 1.04 cmol ckg−1in the fenced site to 0.77 cmol ckg−1in the grazing site,respectively ( P<.01). The results showed that the meanvalue of Avail.P decreased from 39.21 mg kg−1in thefenced site to 32.34 mg kg−1in the grazing site. Andthe mean value of C micand N micsignificantly decreasedfrom 1218.12 and 159.37 mg kg−1in the fenced site to704.99 and 96.63 mg kg−1in the grazing site, respect-ively ( P< .01).14C-CO 2fixation rate in the fenced and grazingsoilsAfter 120 days of incubation under dark conditions,14Cin the soils was detected in all the samples ( Figure 1).The highest14C-SOC fixation rate appeared in thefenced grassland soils (48.55 ‰), which was significantlyhigher than in the grazing grassland soils (22.11 ‰)( P<.05). After fumigation, the fixation rates in the soilsdecreased to 7.68 ‰and 4.18 ‰in the fenced andgrazing grassland soils, respectively, and the differencewas not significant. However, these rates were all signifi-cantly lower than in the unfumigated soils.As with the14C-SOC fixation ratio, the highest14C-MBC fixation rate also appeared in the fenced grasslandsoils (14.05 ‰), which was higher than in the grazinggrassland soils (7.08 ‰). The14C-MBC fixation ratios inthe fumigated grazing and fenced grassland soils were0.24‰and−1.66‰, respectively. The14C-MBC fixationrates in the unfumigated soils were significantly higherthan in the fumigated soils.Phylogenetic analysis of the cbbL gene clonesfrom soilsThe red-like types of RubisCO cbbL genes were detectedin both the grazing and fenced grassland soil samples,but the green-like cbbL genes were not detected withthe used primers. 30 and 46 red-like cbbL operationaltaxonomic units (OTUs) were retrieved from the grazingand fenced soil samples, respectively ( Figure 2). Theunique phylotypes were distributed into four phyla –Pro-teobacteria (46.1%), Actinobacteria (38.1%), Chloroflexi(7.9%) and Cyanobacteria (7.9%) –with two phyla domi-nating ( Figure 2).

Close resemblance (100% similarity)of one phylotype was observed with Bradyrhizobium sp.WSM3983. Subcluster III was grouped with Inquilinuslimosus (WP_034847255), Azorhizobium doebereinerae(WP_051356539) and Acidisphaera rubrifaciens HS-AP3(GAN77260). Subcluster IV was grouped with Citreicellasp. SE45 (WP_008884071). Clones in this cluster wereall from the fenced grassland soil samples. Subcluster Vwas grouped with Azospirillum lipoferum(WP_014188404) and Skermanella aerolata(WP_044434920). Both Betaproteobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria were grouped into one subcluster,which was affliated with Betaproteobacteria Paraburkhol-deria terrestris (SAL14411) with 99% resemblance andGammaproteobacteria Acidiferrobacter thiooxydans(WP_065968746) and Dokdonella koreensis DS-123(ANB18496), respectively. The clones of Proteobacteriain the fenced grassland soil samples accounted for68.6% of the total, whereas only 31.4% correspondedto the grazing grassland soil samples.The sequences in the Actinobacteria were tentativelygrouped into three subclusters. Subcluster VI wasgrouped with Actinomadura formosensis(WP_067800405), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CNE30029),Saccharomonospora marina (WP_009153612), Mycobacter-ium kansasii (WP_063467152), Mycobacterium xenopi 3993(EUA52020) and Mycobacterium sp. E2327(WP_068106460). Subcluster VII was grouped with Nocar-diasp. NRRL WC-3656 (WP_030514398) and Solirubrobac-ter soli (WP_028064187). The clones from the fencedgrassland soil samples accounted for 44.8% of the total,whereas 55.2% corresponded to the grazing grasslandsoil samples.There was one subcluster in Chloroflexi, which wasgrouped with Chloroflexi bacterium CSP1-4 (KRT63449).The clones were all from the fenced grassland soilsamples. There was one subcluster in Cyanobacteria,which was grouped with Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 73110(BAE80672), Phormidium irriguum f. minor ETS-02(CBL80832) and Lyngbya aestuarii PCC 7419 (BAE80673).DiscussionSoil physicochemical properties changesWe found significantly higher soil moisture, C org, EC, TN,Ca2+,K+,Cmicand N micin the fenced grassland soilsFigure 2.

In this study, fencesenhanced aboveground biomass and coverage ( Table1) that could decrease soil evaporation. Moreover, dueto continuous grazing and trampling by cattle, theground surface at the grazing site became bare andcould easily become hotter than the covered ground,which caused a decrease in soil moisture and an increasein soil erosion risk (Wang et al. 2015 ). There was no differ-ence in soil pH between the fenced and grazing areas(P>.05) and was constant at about 7.0 ( Table 3).Similar results were reported about grazing intensitythat did not affect soil pH in a Mediterranean rangeland(Akhzari et al. 2015 ) and in the Stipa grandis and Stipabungeana steppe in northern China (Xie & Wittig 2004 ).The mean value of EC in the fenced grassland soils wasremarkably higher than in the grazing grassland interms of its effect on soil texture ( Table 3). Soil claycontent decreased after long-term grazing ( Table 3 ).Soil leaching decreased while soil clay content increased,which can reduce natural soil drainage and conservewater. These lead to the accumulation of salts and min-erals in the surface soil, which cause EC to increase.Our results showed that soil Corgand TN significantlyincreased in the 0– 5 cm layer after long-term fencing(Table 3). A similar increase in soil C organd TN followingfencing was reported in other arid and semi-arid range-lands (Steffens et al. 2008 ). In grassland, soil C orgis deter-mined by carbon input from plant productivity, litterdecomposition, root turnover and animal excreta, andcarbon output through soil respiration, soil erosion andleaching (Cui et al. 2005 ; Wen et al. 2013 ; Zuo et al.2015 ). Aboveground litter accumulates on the soilsurface after fencing and vegetation grows better anddevelops a better root system compared with grazingplots and is conducive to SOC formation and accumu-lation (Su et al. 2004 ). However, there were no significantdifferences in soil C/N ratios between the grazing siteand fenced site, indicating the rate of change for C andN after grazing exclusion is the same.Particle size distribution showed more silt and clayand less sand in the soils of the fenced site comparedwith the soils of the grazing site ( Table 3), but the differ-ence was not significant. Grazing and trampling leads toa decrease in ground cover, enlarging patches of bareground (Ludwig & Tongway 1995 ) and leaving the landsurface directly exposed to strong wind erosion, whichcauses loss of fine soil particles and degradation of soilstructure (Gomes et al. 2003 ).Grazing exclusion increased the concentration ofAvail. P, but the difference was not significant ( Table 3 ).This result may be due to the runoff from soil erosion(Vadas et al. 2015 ), especially in the grazing site wherethe soils lacked protection from vegetation because ofgrazing. In addition, livestock grazing can cause energyand nutrient loss from the ecosystem (Miao et al.2015 ). The decrease in nutrient feedback from the littermight be related to the decrease in Avail. P in thegrazing site. The mean concentrations of Ca2+and K+were significantly higher in the fenced site than in thegrazing site, but the difference in mean concentrationsof Mg2+and Na+was not significant. All four of themajor cations are subject to loss by leaching (Phillips &Burton 2005 ), but among the exchangeable cations,Ca2+is usually dominant, often amounting to 60– 85%of the total in non-acid soil (Domaga ła-Świątkiewicz &Sady 2011 ), and when Ca2+is the dominant cation inthe soil, it may be the highest amount leached (White-head 2000 ), which was consistent with this study. Inaddition, potassium, magnesium and calcium appear tocompete with each other in the uptake by plants (Evan-gelou et al. 1994 ), and because sodium is not essential toplant biochemistry, plants exclude it when taking upwater and other cations, which can explain the constantNa+concentration in the fenced and grazing sites.In the present study, C micand N micwere found to sig-nificantly decrease in the grazing site compared withthe fenced site, which indicated that continuous grazingwas deleterious to microbial growth. This finding wassimilar to those of many other studies (Northup et al.1999 ;W a n ge ta l .2008 ). Soil organic carbon is the majorsource of energy for soil microorganism growth. In thefenced site, higher organic matter input from plant litterand root exudates may have enhanced the rate of Cmicproduction in the soil (Bird et al. 2002 ;G ee ta l .2011 ).The differences in14C-CO 2fixation rates betweenthe fenced and grazing sitesLabelled14C was detected in the SOC in both the fencedand grazing grassland soils after 120 days’ incubationunder dark conditions ( Figure 1 ). This result was in agree-ment with previous studies in which CO 2fixation wasfound in two artificial soils after incubation in the darkfor 14 days ( Šantr ůčková et al. 2005 ), in agricultural soilin northeast Georgia (Shimmel 1987 ) and in syntheticsoil after incubation up to 91 days in the dark (Miltneret al. 2005 ). However, this finding was inconsistent withthe study conducted by Ge et al. ( 2013 ), who used14Cto incubate subtropical upland and paddy soils for 110days, but no14C was fixed in the soils incubated in con-tinuous darkness.This result indicates that fixed14C was mainly derivedfrom chemoautotrophic processes and chemoautotrophic368 J. YANG ET AL.microorganisms that sequester atmospheric CO 2in thegrassland soils. Our results also showed that14C-SOC and14C-MBC fixation rates were significantly higher in thefenced soils than in the grazing soils ( Figure 1 ). In addition,the14C-SOC and14C-MBC fixation rates in the fumigatedsoil samples significantly decreased compared with thosein the unfumigated soil samples in both the fenced andgrazing sites. A previous study reported that the red-likecbbL genes were found only in small clay and silt fractionsand not in coarse particle fractions (Selesi et al. 2007). More-over, it was found that there is a close link between bac-terial cell numbers and smaller silt and clay fractions (VanGestel et al. 1996;K a n d e l e re ta l . 2000 ). In this study, clayand silt content in the fenced site was around 12.0%higher than in the grazing site ( Table 3 ). In addition, boththe amount of the red-like cbbL genes and RubisCO activityhad a significant positive relationship with SOC content(Yuan, Ge, Wu et al. 2012 ;Y u a ne ta l .2013 ). In our study,the mean amount of Corgin the fenced soils increased by28.7% compared with the grazing soils ( Table 3 ). Thesefindings can explain the high fixation rate in the fenced site.The effect of grazing on the red-like cbbL genesGrassland is widespread, accounting for 40% of the landarea in China and one-third of the world terrestrial area,and is one of the most important ecosystems for C and Ncycling (Kang 2012 ). Until now, most previous studies onthe distribution and quantification of cbbL gene-contain-ing bacteria have focused on aquatic systems (Yuan, Ge,Wu et al. 2012 ) or terrestrial agricultural bulk soil (Selesiet al. 2005 ,2007 ), with few studies on grassland soil.The most common pathway of CO2fixation used bymost photoautotrophic and chemoautotrophic bacteriais via the Calvin cycle with the key enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), thelarge subunit of which is encoded by the cbbL gene. Inthis study, no green-like bacteria was found in thefenced and grazing sites, which was consistent with pre-vious studies (Miltner et al. 2005 ; Videmš ek et al. 2009 ;Yousuf et al. 2012 ). Miltner et al. ( 2005 ) concluded thatthe growth of obligate lithotrophs carrying the green-likecbbL genes was suppressed by the input of readilyavailable carbon sources, and the absence of thegreen-like cbbL genes could be attributed to primerspecificity bias in the rhizospheric soil of groundnut(Yousuf et al. 2012 ).In contrast to the green-like cbbL genes, the red-likecbbL genes were detected in both the fenced andgrazing grassland sites. Our results indicate that the com-position of microbial communities carrying red-like cbbLgenes was affected by continuous grazing ( Figure 2 ).Compared with the 30 OTUs detected in the grazingsite, there were 46 OTUs detected in the fenced site. Inparticular, in the cluster Alphaproteobacteria, 22 OTUswere identified from the fenced site compared with 9OTUs identified from the grazing site. The cluster Alpha-proteobacteria contained five subclusters, mainly Bradyr-hizobium valentinum, Microvirga sp.and Azospirillumlipoferum bacteria, which are known to promote plantgrowth and fix nitrogen and CO2(Videm šek et al.2009 ). In addition, a high diversity of red-like cbbLsequences was found in grassland soils close to naturalcarbon dioxide springs, but there was no difference inthe number of OTUs between low and high CO 2concen-tration (Videm šek et al. 2009 ). The amount of the cbbLgenes was found to increase by applying straw andchemical fertilizers (Yuan, Ge, Wu et al. 2012 ), and Selesiet al. ( 2007 ) found a positive relationship between theamount of the red-like cbbL genes and SOC content.The study by Tang et al. ( 2015 ) revealed the amount ofcbbL and 16S rRNA genes were lowest in the soilsunder Cleistogenes chinensis where SOC and pH werelowest. The number of OTUs showed no differencebetween the fenced and grazing sites in the cluster Acti-nobacteria, mainly with Mycobacterium sp. and Solirubro-bacter soli (Figure 2). Also, phototrophic Cyanobacteriawas detected in both the fenced and grazing soils.However, phototrophic Chloroflexi was found in onlythe fenced soils. Previous studies showed that themicrobial autotrophic community is significantly affectedby edaphic factors (Selesi et al. 2005 ; Tolli & King 2005 ;Nigro & King 2007 ; Videmš ek et al. 2009 ; Yuan, Ge, Wuet al. 2012 ). The absence of Chloroflexi in the grazingsoils indicated continuous grazing shaping the fixationbacterial communities in the grassland soils.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.FundingThis work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion ofScience (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) [grantnumber 24405003].Notes on contributorsJun Yang obtained his master ’s degree from the School of For-estry, Northeast Forestry University of China in 2008.
