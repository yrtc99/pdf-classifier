ARTICLERhizosphere bacteriome structure and functionsNing Ling1,2✉, Tingting Wang2& Yakov Kuzyakov3,4✉Microbial composition and functions in the rhizosphere —an important microbial hotspot —are among the most fascinating yet elusive topics in microbial ecology. We used 557 pairs ofpublished 16S rDNA amplicon sequences from the bulk soils and rhizosphere in differentecosystems around the world to generalize bacterial characteristics with respect to com-munity diversity, composition, and functions. The rhizosphere selects microorganisms frombulk soil to function as a seed bank, reducing microbial diversity. The rhizosphere is enrichedin Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and other copiotrophs. Highly modular but unstable bac-terial networks in the rhizosphere (common for r-strategists) re ﬂect the interactions andadaptations of microorganisms to dynamic conditions. Dormancy strategies in the rhizo-sphere are dominated by toxin –antitoxin systems, while sporulation is common in bulk soils.Functional predictions showed that genes involved in organic compound conversion, nitrogenﬁxation, and denitri ﬁcation were strongly enriched in the rhizosphere (11 –182%), while genesinvolved in nitri ﬁcation were strongly depleted.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 OPEN1Centre for Grassland Microbiome, State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lan zhouUniversity, Lanzhou 730020 Gansu, China.2Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for SolidOrganic Waste Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.3Department of Soil Science of Temperate Ecosystems,Department of Agricultural Soil Science, University of Goettingen, 37077 Göttingen, Germany.4Peoples Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University),117198 Moscow, Russia.✉email: nling@njau.edu.cn ;kuzyakov@gwdg.deNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |          (2022) 13:836 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;The rhizosphere is home to a rich diversity of microorgan-isms, many of which bene ﬁt plants by suppressing patho-genic invasions and helping to acquire nutrients from thesoil1,2. Understanding the taxonomic and functional componentsof the rhizosphere microbiome and how they differ from those ofthe bulk soil microbiome (here: soil without direct root effects) iscrucial to manipulate them for sustainable ecosystem functioning.Recent advances in sequencing have enabled signi ﬁcant progressin the elucidation of the rhizosphere microbiomes of variousplants. The diversity and composition of the rhizosphere bacterialcommunity is a function of both plant species and soilproperties3–5. Although plant species or even species genotypestend to assemble relatively distinct rhizobacterial communities6–8,these communities can be largely similar even in differentenvironments across geographical regions9,10. Plants exert selec-tive effects on rhizobacterial assemblages in bulk soil pool toacquire speci ﬁc functional traits needed for plant ﬁtness8,11,12.A sa result, the rhizosphere microbiome greatly expands the func-tional repertoire of the plant13. Despite the speci ﬁc nutrientrequirements of plants, disease control mechanisms, and edaphichabitats, rhizosphere environments (with excess available carbon)provide broadly similar conditions for microbial life. All plantsare mineral resource-limited organisms and are often affected bypathogens. To overcome these limitations, plants form rhizo-assemblages independent of their host phylogeny. Thus, all plantscan exert general selective effects directed toward nutrientacquisition or pathogen suppression, regardless of their geo-graphic origin or recent location. These general patterns in therhizosphere and bulk soils with respect to the taxonomic andfunctional pro ﬁles of bacterial communities remain largelyunexplored. However, this information is critical to understandand manage microbial functions in ecosystems to support futureplant growth in rapidly changing environment.Recently, high-throughput sequencing of culture-independentmarker genes (typically, 16S rRNA in the case of bacteria), hasgreatly expanded the repertoire of microorganisms living insoils14, and many studies have characterized root-associatedmicrobial communities9. Since the raw data from most studiesmust be deposited in a public gene bank, this has resulted in ahuge and extensive rhizosphere sequencing data set. These high-resolution nucleic acid-based molecular techniques provideexcellent insights into speci ﬁc microbiome members in soilhabitats. Research priorities for harnessing the rhizospheremicrobiome for sustainable ecosystems development includeelucidating the functional mechanisms that mediate plant-microbiome interactions and de ﬁning the core of the plantmicrobiome15,16. The methodological advances made in thesepriority research areas have provided a vast amount of data forintegrative analysis and subsequent synthesis. This has paved theway for investigating the general principles of rhizospheremicrobiome selection from bulk soils. The rhizosphere containsnumerous niches for the growth and proliferation of a phylo-genetically diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria,archaea, fungi, protists, nematodes, and viruses, but bacteria and,to a lesser extent, fungi are the most dominant forms and arefairly well-studied compared to other members of the commu-nity. Thus, we are attempting to infer the composition of bacterialcommunities in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, determine therhizosphere bacteriome properties common to a wide range ofplants and environmental conditions, and bridge the gap betweengeneral rhizobacterial assemblages and functions associated withcommunity-wide dormancy capacity, heterotrophic strategies,and individual nutrient cycling processes.Here, we collected 16S rRNA amplicon-based sequencing datafrom all available gene banks to characterize the general bacter-iome and synthetically analyzed the data using state-of-the-artbioinformatics methods. Bulk soil serves as a microbial reservoirfor the rhizo-microbiome17and is home to considerable micro-bial diversity that is explicitly shaped by the environmental fac-tors of each microhabitat18,19. We, therefore, hypothesized that(i) rhizobacterial populations are recruited primarily from thecorresponding bulk soil, but are preselected by excess releasedroot carbon, so that bacterial diversity is generally lower in therhizosphere and bacterial networks are less stable. Compared tobulk soils, the rhizosphere can fuel its microbiota by providingabundant and readily available energy and carbon sources20,21,but microorganisms in root-free soil are always carbon limited22.We therefore further hypothesized that (ii) the rhizosphere ishome to more abundant copiotrophic bacteria than the bulk soil.To this end, we evaluated the community weighted mean 16SrRNA gene copies (rRNA operons) because copiotrophs areassumed to have more rRNA operons than oligotrophs23,24. Sinceall nutrients ﬂow from the bulk soil to the roots, we furtherhypothesized that (iii) the functional capacity involved in thecarbon and nitrogen transformation would be greater in therhizosphere. Plants deposit a signi ﬁcant proportion of theirphotosynthates in the rhizosphere as rhizodeposits and rootdebris. The rhizodeposits, including amino acids, carboxylic acids,sugars and polymeric carbohydrates such as cellulose andhemicellulose25, are not only critical carbon and energy sourcesfor rhizobacteria but also key attractants for plant pathogens. Weﬁnally hypothesized that (iv) functions related to lignocellulosedegradation and phytopathogens are overexpressed in the rhi-zosphere due to the accumulation of root litter and the attractionof pathogens to live plants. In this work, we analyzed and syn-thesized a very broad range of taxonomic and functional featuresof the bacteriome in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil, andgeneralized these compositional changes to other factors such asplant species, geographic environment, and soil properties. Thisprovided general principles for the selection of microorganismsaround living roots and laid the foundation for harnessing thepower of the microbiome for sustainable terrestrial ecosystemfunctioning.ResultsBacterial diversity and community composition in the rhizo-sphere and bulk soils . The dataset was collected from publicdatabases containing published papers across continents. Thesynthesis of bacterial sequences from terrestrial ecosystems —bulkversus rhizosphere soil pairs (Supplementary Fig. 1) —provided ageneralized pattern of alpha-diversity. Across all studies, bacterialalpha-diversity is depleted in the rhizosphere compared to thebulk soil in terms of observed species richness ( −5.3%), Shan-non’s diversity index ( −0.9%), and Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity(−3.7%) (Fig. 1). The funnel plot with the trim-and- ﬁll methodconﬁrmed that there was little bias on alpha-diversity (Supple-mentary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Studies of speci ﬁcecosystems showed a consistent decrease in alpha-diversity in therhizosphere ( −0.8% ~ −9.3%) in cultivated land, while no sig-niﬁcant differences in observed species richness and Faith ’sphylogenetic diversity were found between bulk soil and therhizosphere in grassland and forest ecosystems. In agriculturalbulk soils planted with Gramineae, Leguminosae, Solanaceae, andCucurbitaceae, almost all alpha-diversity indices were sig-niﬁcantly higher than in the rhizosphere. However, under mineralfertilization, the Pielou ’s evenness and Faith ’s phylogeneticdiversity indices lost their signi ﬁcance. This indicates thatmineral-only fertilization disrupts biodiversity in bulk soils.Contrary to our expectation, the alpha diversity in the rice rhi-zosphere was similar to that of the bulk soil (Fig. 1). Conse-quently, the increase in microbial diversity under high redoxARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-92 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |          (2022) 13:836 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsFig. 1 Diversity of bacterial communities: the rhizosphere versus bulk soil. a observed species richness; bShannon ’s diversity index; cPielou ’s evenness;anddFaith ’s phylogenetic diversity.

Despite thefact that the plant groups can shape bacterial alpha-diversity inthe rhizosphere, Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity was higher in bulksoil under grasses and shrubs in grassland ecosystems. In forestecosystems, bacterial diversity, including the observed speciesrichness, Shannon ’s diversity index, and Faith ’s phylogeneticdiversity, tended to be greater in trees ’rhizosphere than in thebulk soils, but the alpha-diversity in the rhizosphere of shrubs wassimilar to that in the bulk soils.We considered the potential effects of sequencing platform,target regions of primer pairs, and experimental management(ﬁeld or greenhouse) to further dissect how these factors alteredthe effect size (Supplementary Fig. 3). No signi ﬁcant differenceswere found between the ﬁeld and greenhouse experiments. Interms of sequencing platforms, the majority of the sequencingmethods used the Illumina platform, and although a smallnumber of sequencing methods used the Ion S5 platform, theoverall effect size remained the same. There was negligiblevariation in effect size by target region, con ﬁrming that the majorvariations mainly presented among the ecosystem types (Supple-mentary Fig. 3).The principal coordinates analysis with Bray-Curtis dissim-ilarity and the permutational multivariate analysis of variance(PERMANOVA) showed a signi ﬁcantly difference ( p=0.01;Supplementary Fig. 4) between the bacterial community compo-sitions in bulk and rhizosphere soils. The bacterial phyla —Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria —were enriched in the rhizo-sphere of overall samples, whereas Chloro ﬂexi, Acidobacteria,Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae were generally enriched inthe bulk soil (Fig. 2and Supplementary Fig. 5). Although therelative abundance of Proteobacteria was higher in the rhizo-sphere, the genera Haliangium, Pseudolabrys, Acidibacter, andNitrosospira, belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria, were muchricher in the bulk soil (Fig. 2and Supplementary Fig. 6). Therelative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria was also muchhigher in the rhizosphere of most plants, while some of its generasuch as Gaiella, Blastococcus, Nocardioides, and Conexibacterwere mainly localized in the bulk soil.When the dataset was divided by plant group, Firmicutes wereabundant in rhizosphere of Gramineae crops, while this phylumwas depleted in several plant groups such as Solanaceae andCucurbitaceae crops and grasses (Supplementary Fig. 5). Cyano-bacteria were enriched in the rhizosphere of the Cucurbitaceaecrops and grasses. Planctomycetes were similar in the bulk soiland the rhizosphere of grasses, forbs, and trees, but reduced in therhizosphere of crops. The Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium genushad higher relative abundance in the rhizosphere of most plants,especially Gramineae, Leguminosae, Cucurbitaceae, and grasses(Supplementary Fig. 7). However, some bacterial genera wereenriched only in speci ﬁc plant groups. For instance, Burkholderiaand Variovorax were higher only in the rhizosphere ofLeguminosae, and the genera Pedobacter and Aeromicrobiumwere enriched only in the rhizosphere of Gramineae. Bacterialenrichment under forbs and trees differed from that in the agro-ecosystems.Co-occurrence patterns in the rhizosphere and bulk soils .I norder to characterize the general co-occurrence pattern of bac-teriome networks in bulk soil and rhizosphere, all plants werepooled to construct networks which were called global networks(i.e., global bulk soil network and global rhizosphere network).Multiple network topological metrics consistently showed that theglobal networks of bacterial communities in the bulk soil (Fig. 3a)differed from those in the rhizosphere (Fig. 3b). The global net-work in the bulk soil has 559 nodes and 3608 edges, whereas theglobal network in the rhizosphere has 534 nodes and 2210 edges(Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2). The global rhizosphere networkfeatures more modules (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2), but it ismuch less robust and stable (Fig. 3c). This is evidenced by the factthat removing nodes at any level always results in a low degree ofnatural connectivity (Fig. 3c). In both global networks, Proteo-bacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant in keystone nodes(Fig. 3d, e). However, the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) thathighly connect the nodes among modules were different (Fig. 3e):in the global rhizosphere network, a few ASVs were found to actas connectors (i.e., nodes that highly connect modules), and theymainly belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteo-bacteria, Blastocatellia, Actinobacteria, and Bacilli classes. On theother hand, module hubs (highly connected nodes within mod-ules) were only detected in the global bulk soil network, where thegenera Piscinibacter sp.,Gaiella sp., and Rubrobacter sp. servedthat function. The keystone ASVs classi ﬁed as Mesorhizobium sp.andNocardioides sp. were found to act as connectors in bothglobal networks.To further characterize the in ﬂuence of plants on bacteriomenetworks, we assessed co-occurrence patterns based on plantgroups (Supplementary Fig. 8), and de ﬁned these networks aslocal networks. Various plant groups had similarly strong effectson network complexity. Bacterial network modularity trended toincrease from the bulk soil towards the rhizosphere (Supplemen-tary Fig. 8a, b). The connector species in the network dependedon the plant type (Supplementary Fig. 8d), and the topologicalrole of keystone microbial species depended on plant traits. Thenumber of species serving as inter-module connectors differedbetween the global network (i.e., a network of all plants) and thelocal network (i.e., a network of speci ﬁc groups of plants) (Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. 8). This result further indicates that thekeystone taxa in the organizing network topology retain theircontext dependence, and that some organisms may play the samefunctional role in maintaining network stability.Dormancy potential and heterotrophic strategies at the bac-terial community level . Bacterial community characteristicsrelated to dormancy potential and heterotrophic strategies haveimportant implications for the restoration and maintenance ofecosystem functioning underpinned by resource availability.These community-level characteristics reveal resource-based dif-ferences in bulk and rhizosphere soil patterns. The low bias of theresponse ratio data was con ﬁrmed by the funnel plot with Egger ’sregression test and the trim-and- ﬁll analysis (SupplementaryFig. 9 and Supplementary Table 1).Dormancy potential, characterized by genes involved intoxin –antitoxin and sporulation, was evaluated to clarify bacterialcommunity-aggregated dormancy strategies in the rhizosphereand bulk soil. We found that the toxin –antitoxin functionalpotential was 33% higher in the former (Fig. 4a) and sporulationfunctional potential was 7% higher in the latter (Fig. 4b), whilethe magnitude of the effect (bulk soil vs. rhizosphere soil) wasinﬂuenced by ecosystem type and plant group. In general,bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere have distinctly differentdominant strategies for entering dormancy compared to bacterialiving in bulk soils. Interestingly, in paddy soils, conditionseliminated the bacterial community with a well-developedtoxin –antitoxin system in the rhizosphere, indicating that landuse strongly in ﬂuences bacterial dormancy potential.ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-94 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |          (2022) 13:836 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsHeterotrophic strategies for community-level aggregated traitswere characterized by weighted mean rRNA operon copynumber. Bacteria with higher rRNA operon counts are able tomaintain higher maximal growth rates and respond faster toresources. The rhizosphere had 6.6% more rRNA operon counts(Fig. 4c), indicating that more fast-growing bacteria ( r-strategists)preferentially colonize the rhizosphere than the bulk soil.Heterotrophic strategies at the bacterial community level werealso in ﬂuenced by the land use regime: the effect of rhizosphereon heterotrophic strategies was weaker in paddy ﬁelds than indryland soils, with the greatest effect in the Leguminosaerhizosphere, which was 12% higher than in bulk soils.Functional signatures in the rhizosphere and bulk soils . Allbacterial metabolic and ecologically relevant functions were pre-dicted by the Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa(FAPROTAX). Low publication bias was also con ﬁrmed by thefunnel plot with Egger ’s regression test and the trim-and- ﬁllanalysis (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 1).Compared to bulk soil, rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria showedhigher functional potentials of denitri ﬁcation ( +11%), cellulolysis(+23%), xylanolysis ( +29%), chitinolysis ( +32%), nitrogen ﬁxa-tion (+42%), methylotrophy ( +47%), ureolysis ( +70%), metha-nol oxidation ( +78%), ligninolysis ( +182%), and plantpathogenesis ( +165%) (Fig. 5). In contrast, in the rhizosphere,the functional potential associated with nitri ﬁcation wasdecreased by 29% (Fig. 5). The effects of the rhizosphere onfunctions associated with denitri ﬁcation, methylotrophy, cellulo-lysis and ureolysis were absent in paddies. Remarkably, someplant groups in cropland and grassland ecosystems stronglyaltered the general effects on functions related to denitri ﬁcation,which, however, were always signi ﬁcantly richer in the rhizo-sphere of forest plants. In forest ecosystem, the signi ﬁcant rhi-zosphere effects on some functions related to C cycling, includingmethanol oxidation, ligninolysis, xylanolysis, methylotrophy, andcellulolysis, were disappeared. Consequently, forest ecosystemshowed a peculiar response where the rhizosphere had effect onFig. 2 Differences in relative abundance of bacterial taxa between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. a Difference at the amplicon sequence variants (ASV)level.

The rhizosphere effects on chitinolysis, methy-lotrophy, and methanol oxidation could also be reduced byorganic amendments. These results indicate that land use, plantgroups, and fertilization regimes shape the differences betweenthe rhizosphere and bulk soils.DiscussionBacterial diversity and composition in the rhizosphere andbulk soil . This meta-analysis is based on pairwise data (rhizo-sphere vs. bulk soils) from amplicon sequencing approaches tocharacterize taxonomic and functional features. The meta-analysis provided fundamental insights into the plant rhizo-sphere microbiome on an intercontinental scale, revealing plant-driven microbial taxa and their functional properties in thisunique but cohesive habitat. The design of the meta-analysisallowed us to examine the general effects of plants on the rhi-zosphere bacterial communities across broad range of soil prop-erties and geographic environments. This highlights the bene ﬁto fusing sequencing data to synthesize general microbiome patternsand to indicate specialized functions and life strategies ofmicrobial taxa based on niche differences between the rhizo-sphere and bulk soils.The fact that rhizosphere microbiota differs from bulk soilmicrobiota is well documented12,16,26–28, and this is attributed tosigniﬁcant differences in physico-chemical properties drivingniche differentiation4,21,29,30. In addition to environmentaldifferences between niches, the general contrast between bulksoil and the rhizosphere was a very important cause ofdifferences in microbiota composition12,31. Bacterial observedspecies richness, Shannon ’s diversity index, and Faith ’sp h y l o -genetic diversity in rhizosphere were generally lower than in bulksoil under all environments. Thus, bacterial diversity decreases assubstrate availability increases, a condition that is common in therhizosphere. The general view is that the rhizosphere microbiota,a subset of the community in bulk soil, has certain similar traitsin all plants. This underlines the selective effect of therhizosphere, which has some general consequences on plantrhizobacterial assemblages. This holds true even for bacteriabelonging to broad range of classes, orders and families.Although the magnitude of the effects differs between plantsgroups (Fig. 1), we emphasize that, even when genotypic andFig. 3 Global co-occurrence networks of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in the rhizosphere and in bulk soil. a a co-occurrence in theglobal bulk soil; b, a co-occurrence in the global rhizosphere.

Most of the effects commonto the rhizosphere of other plants were canceled out in paddysoils. Paddy soils are often anaerobic, and rice plants, therefore,have a well-developed aerenchyma. Due to the release of oxygenaround the roots, the Eh value and oxygen content of the ricerhizosphere are much higher than in the bulk soil33,34and varywidely. Thus, the rice rhizosphere is inhabited by a widerphylogeny of both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. These resultsindicate that environmental heterogeneities, such as rootexudates, Eh, and soil moisture changes, interact to give rise toselective effects in the rhizosphere.Speci ﬁc microbial taxa recruited to the rhizosphere from soilreservoirs can apparently form a distinct core microbiome12,14.The core microbiome around the roots contributes to plantgrowth, and ﬁtness17. To date, the core microbiome of plants,whether in the rhizosphere, endosphere, or phyllosphere, has beendeﬁned primarily on the basis of taxonomic markers. However, weemphasize that more attention should be directed to identifyingmicrobes with common functions that are selected for in thegeneral rhizosphere environment. Thus, de ﬁning the microbiomebased on function should make it easier to manipulate thecommunity for useful purposes. The present comprehensiveanalysis revealed several predominant taxa that are consistentlyenriched in the rhizosphere, including the phyla Bacteroidetes andProteobacteria (Fig. 2). This result underscores the fact that thesephyla are generally adapted to C-rich conditions (common in therhizosphere) for high metabolic activity, fast growth andpropagation30,35, and are consequently very similar across diverseplant species. They are generally considered to be copiotrophs, orweedy fast-growing microbiota whose populations ﬂuctuateopportunistically28. In contrast to the rhizosphere, bulk soils aregenerally enriched by other dominant phyla including Acidobac-teria (Fig. 2b), which are oligotrophs36,37. Interestingly, severalphylum-level taxa are similar between the rhizosphere and bulksoil, but differences are seen at ﬁner taxonomic resolution (Fig. 2).Consequently, the general patterns that emerge based on theselective effect of the rhizosphere depend on taxonomic resolutionand fundamental niches at the level of classes and families.Microbiome formation: from structure to functions .I nmicrobial networks, highly interconnected species are groupedinto modules, in which species interact more frequently andintensively than in the rest of the community. The modularity ofthe rhizosphere bacterial network is higher than that of the bulksoil (Fig. 3a, b). Since modules can be interpreted as microbialniches38,39, one possible explanation would be that niche differ-entiation is more pronounced in the rhizosphere25—both spa-tially and temporally. Modularity is one of the main organizingprinciples of biological networks40, and the higher modularity ofthe rhizosphere may indicate a more complex topological struc-ture. Despite the higher modularity, the bacterial co-occurrencenetwork in the rhizosphere is less stable (Fig. 3c), because therhizosphere is characterized by very high temporal dynamicscompared to the more static conditions in the bulk soil30,41. Plantspecies selectively enrich speci ﬁc microorganisms by investing inroot exudates to feed their rhizosphere microbiota1,42. Thestructure of the indigenous rhizosphere microbial communityoften varies considerably across host species43. In the soybeanrhizosphere, the microbial community was selected through nicheﬁltering, whereas the bulk soil community arose through neutral(stochastic) processes44. The rhizosphere network allocates moremodules for executive functions, but fewer species for networkFig. 4 Dormancy potentials and heterotrophic strategies of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils. a Differences in the abundances oftoxin –antitoxin systems genes between communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils; bdifferences in the sporulation factor abundances betweencommunities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils; cdifferences in the weighted mean ribosomal operon copy numbers between communities in therhizosphere and bulk soils.

Sporulation factors weremore abundant in the bulk soil, while toxin –antitoxin systemswere enriched in the rhizosphere (Fig. 4a, b). During plantgrowth, roots actively and passively release a wide range oforganic compounds into the rhizosphere. These compounds arethe driving force of microbial growth and activity29,47,48. Thesporulation factor was abundant in the bulk dryland soils but wasnot signi ﬁcant in paddies (Fig. 4b). Hence, bacterial sporulation ismore common in dryland soils because the environmentalconditions in paddies are more stable and homogeneous, andARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-98 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |          (2022) 13:836 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationspaddies are always moist. The lower importance of sporulation inthe rhizosphere (compared to bulk soil) indirectly con ﬁrmed thebuffered amplitude of moisture variation associated with theconditions of mucilage swelling49–51. Genes related to dormancy/sporulation increase strongly with aridity52. Toxin –antitoxinsystems consist of genes that encode a toxin protein that inhibitscell growth and an antitoxin that counteracts the toxin53.It is generally assumed that rRNA operons in prokaryoticorganisms are able to re ﬂect their heterotrophic strategies54.Copiotrophs ( r-strategists) have a high ribosome content, in part,by maintaining multiple ribosomal RNA operon copies in theirgenomes to achieve high growth rates55. The rhizosphere wasinhabited by a greater number of copiotrophs (e.g., Bacteroidetesand Proteobacteria), as con ﬁrmed by higher rRNA operoncounts associated with them (Fig. 4c). These results con ﬁrmthat the major groups in the rhizosphere are fast-growingbacteria, especially the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes56.Oligotrophs (K-strategists) have lower operon counts thancopiotrophs55. A lower rRNA operon copy number is commonin oligotrophic microbiota indicating slower growth rates andmore stable populations. A functional feature of bacteria is thatthe copy number of the rRNA operon increases in response to theavailability of resources24. Organisms with multiple operons arereferred to r-strategists and tend to dominate in resource-richenvironments and respond more rapidly to nutrient inputs57–59.Therefore, copiotrophs will predominate when resources areabundant, such as in rhizosphere habitats where plants secretephotosynthates to produce available C and energy.As the interface between roots and soil, the rhizosphere hostsan abundant and diverse bacteriome that drives the soil C and Ndynamics. Genes related to C and N transformation were allbroadly higher in the rhizosphere (Fig. 5), due to the largeramount of plant-derived organic compounds, leading to highermicrobial activity and abundance in the rhizosphere. This isdirectly con ﬁrmed by the fact that the rhizosphere is rich inalmost all N-cycling functions (except nitri ﬁcation), and themagnitude of their effects is greatly dependent on plant groups inagroecosystems (Fig. 5). Nitri ﬁcation is prone to take place inaerobic conditions, but the rhizosphere generally suffers fromoxygen de ﬁciency60because roots and microorganisms consumemore oxygen than the bulk soil. Likewise, activities related to thedecomposition and transformation of organic compounds, suchas cellulolysis, xylanolysis, ligninolysis, ureolysis, and chitinolysiswere generally more intense in the rhizosphere, re ﬂecting thehigher abundance and activity of bacteria degrading thesesubstances. Methanol oxidation and methylotrophy genes aremuch more abundant in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil(except in rice paddies). Methylotrophy is higher in the rhizo-sphere, but in paddy soils this difference is smoothed out becauseof the aerobic microenvironment around rice roots and the highdilution of available reduced C in water. Functional groups ofplants, such as grasses and forbs, have distinct characteristics andﬁll speci ﬁc niches56,61. Grasses have a much denser root systems,ﬁner roots, and higher root biomass than forbs62, and thusaccelerate nutrient cycling by intense litter and rhizodepositiondecomposition. Hence, plant functional groups are likely to becritical drivers of rhizosphere functions.Particularly in the rhizosphere, plants are continuouslychallenged by thousands of microbial populations, includingcommensals, pathogens, and symbionts. Plant pathogens andN-ﬁxers (e.g., Rhizobium sp., etc.) are enriched in the rhizosphere(Fig. 5) because their reproduction and functioning depend onthe supply of organic matter from the plant host. Although therhizosphere is a dynamic environment, and the microbiomeevolves rapidly in space and time, evidence is accumulating toconﬁrm that plants shape the rhizosphere microbiome to theirown bene ﬁt and skillfully utilize the microbial functionalrepertoire13. As expected, plant pathogens were more enrichedin the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil, which may be due to thefollowing reasons: (1) most plant pathogens grow saprophyticallyin the rhizosphere and derive their basal energy from the roots63;(2) bacterial pathogens, in particular, require a wound or naturalopening to penetrate into the plant before they establish aparasitic relationship; (3) only a few groups of pathogenic bacteriaare considered to be soilborne, probably because non-sporeforming bacteria cannot survive well in bulk soils for longperiods64; (4) certain pathogens, either candidate symbionts orstealthy pathogens, favor the colonization of the rhizosphere65,66.The rhizosphere is both the playground where soilbornepathogens infect plants and the battle ﬁeld where the complexrhizosphere community, including both micro ﬂora and micro-fauna, interacts with pathogens and in ﬂuences the outcome ofinfection64. The number and diversity of deleterious andbeneﬁcial microorganisms are related to the quantity and qualityof rhizodeposits and the outcome of microbial interactions in therhizosphere. Nevertheless, identifying the equilibrium conditionsfor plant ﬁtness remains a challenge, as does establishing abalance between passive attack by pathogens and activerecruitment of bene ﬁcial bacteria.By integrating sequencing data from multiple studies, we havegeneralized the main differences in the rhizosphere and bulk soilmicrobiomes with respect to bacterial diversity, composition,selection of speci ﬁc groups, co-occurrence network, and a verybroad range of functions (Fig. 6). The bacterial diversity in therhizosphere is reduced by 0.9 –5.3% and represents a subset of thebulk soil community. The bacterial community in the rhizosphereis highly enriched in copiotrophs such as Proteobacteria andBacteroidetes, while bacteria such as Chloro ﬂexi, Acidobacteria,and Nitrospirae are signi ﬁcantly reduced. Because of the surplusof organic C in the rhizosphere and rapid nutrient cycling, fast-growing bacteria have an excess of functions related to Ctransformation and plant pathogenesis, but the functionsresponsible for nitri ﬁcation are depleted. Indirect evidencesupporting the generalizations presented here is that land useregimes and plant functional groups in ﬂuence almost all rhizo-sphere effects on bacterial diversity and functions. Based on ourresults, we validly sketched the generalized rhizosphere effects onbacteriome across continents, even though the soil properties andFig. 5 Functional potentials of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils. The Faprotax annotated function differences related tonitriﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation, methanol oxidation, nitrogen ﬁxation, chitinolysis, ligninolysis, respiration of sulfur compounds, xylanolysis, methylotrophy,cellulolysis, ureolysis, and plant pathogens. Bar charts re ﬂect mean value and standard errors for each category. The error bars on the columns representthe standard errors (SE). All dots represent the percentage change of the effect size between bacterial community function potentials in the rhizosp hereand bulk soils with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs). Mean values <0 indicate a higher function in bulk soil (yellow dots: depletion in the rhizosphere), whilemean values >0 indicate a higher function in the rhizosphere (blue dots). The intersection of the error bar with the zero line indicates that there is nosigniﬁcant difference of the function between bacterial communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils (open dots). Sample size is showed by number ofdata pairs for each group. Mineral F and Organic A indicate the types of fertilization, which are mineral-only fertilization and organic amendments,respectively.

The selectiveinﬂuence of the rhizosphere on the formation of microbialcommunities overshadows to some extent the differences in soil,plant, or climate even at continent scale. This suggests that therhizosphere is the powerful factor shaping the composition,structure, and functions of the soil microbiome and, thus, a keyfactor in the cycling of biogenic elements. Therefore, the presentstudy expands our knowledge of the critical role of therhizosphere effects in recruiting bacterial populations.With the rapid development of instrumental and moleculartechniques, there have been many attempts to consider thefunctional traits of microorganisms at the community level basedon their ecological relevance. With further expansion of availablesoil metagenomic/metatranscriptomic datasets and the couplingof sequencing with isotopic probing approaches, more accurateand quantitative results are expected to be very promising in thefuture. Further efforts may still be needed to identify functions ofplants and microbial communities in ﬂuencing the rate of relevantsoil processes at the ecosystem level, with a focus on plantperformance and anthropogenic disturbances, to identify strate-gies to control or reshape the rhizosphere microbiome formicrobial bene ﬁts to ef ﬁcient nutrient cycling and soil health.MethodsData collection . An extensive literature survey was conducted through the Web ofScience database ( http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ ) until July 2021. The keywords of the literature search were “bulk”,“rhizosphere ”, and “bacteria ”. A total of122 publications were collected (see Supplementary information; SupplementaryFig. 12), comprising 557 pairs of bulk soils versus rhizosphere (see Source Data). Inthese studies, bacterial communities were investigated by high-throughputsequencing, including Illumina, Ion S5, and 454 platforms.The following criteria were used to select suitable studies: (1) ﬁeld orgreenhouse experiments and studies with natural or planted vegetation wereincluded; (2) studies for which sequencing metadata were not available from publicrepositories or upon request from individual study authors were excluded; (3)articles with a one-to-one correspondence of sequencing data between rhizosphereand bulk soil were included. Twenty-two primer pairs were identi ﬁed from thestudy metadata (see Source data), and most samples used primer sets 515F and806R28. In addition to sequencing data, we also collected the following parameters:plant species, ecosystem type (cropland, forest, and grassland), crop family(including Gramineae, Leguminosae, Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and others), cropmanagement (dryland, paddyland), fertilizer type in cropland (chemical fertilizeror organic fertilizer), group of herbaceous plants (grasses, forbs, and shrubs), grassphotosynthetic pathway (C3, C4), forest classi ﬁcation (trees, shrubs), forest leaftraits (broad leaved, coniferous), location (i.e., latitude and longitude), mean annualtemperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and soil properties (pH,available P, available K, SOC, total N, C:N, NH4+-N, and NO 3−-N).Bioinformatics analysis and taxonomical annotation . We downloaded rawsequencing data from NCBI according to accession number, followed by FASTQﬁles from each study. The raw sequences were processed using the DADA2pipeline67, which is designed to obtain sequences with a single-nucleotide differ-ence, known as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), rather than clustering similarsequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequence reads were ﬁrstﬁltered using DADA2 ’s recommended parameters. Potential primers were screenedand removed. Filtered reads were then de-replicated and de-noised using DADA2default parameters. Finally, paired-end sequences were merged and chimeras wereremoved. For each study, reads were truncated at the quality control score of 25. Tointegrate studies using different 16S rRNA gene regions, we adopted a closed-reference work ﬂow, a database-dependent approach that uses a prede ﬁned set ofreference sequences with a known taxonomy to obtain representative sequencesand assign the taxonomy. Brie ﬂy, the USEARCH closed_ref command (sequenceidentity ≥97%) was used to map the above-obtained fragments to non-redundantfull-length 16S rRNA sequences using the Silva 13.2 version database ( http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/sintax_downloads.html ). Fragments that couldnot be mapped were de ﬁned as unknown sequences. The ASV table was thengenerated according to the mapped full-length 16S sequences. The mapping ASVresult of each data set in USEARCH table format was imported directly into the Rsoftware (version 3.6.0, R Core Team, 2019) and merged into the integrated ASVtable for further analyses. Singleton ASVs and ASVs that were present only in onesample were removed. ASVs assigned to “Mitochondria ”,“Chloroplast ”,“Archaea ”,and“Eukaryota ”were removed from the bacterial community (proportion of everypart showed in Supplementary Table 3). Finally, for downstream analysis, allsamples were rare ﬁed to the same sequencing depth (10,000 reads per sample) andalpha diversity comparisons between the rhizosphere and bulk soils were madeusing the following diversity measures: observed species richness, Shannon ’sdiversity index, Pielou ’s evenness, and Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity68. Bray-Curtisdissimilarity matrix and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) were used to esti-mate and visualize beta diversity of samples. Statistical analysis of beta diversity wasperformed by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).Network construction and analysis . Microbial co-occurrence networks wereconstructed using Spearman ’s correlation method to identify pairwise associationsof ASVs69. ASVs with relative abundances < 0.02% were removed. Pvalues werecorrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini –Hochberg false discoveryrate (FDR) control procedure70. Spearman correlation thresholds were determinedusing the Random matrix theory (RMT) method71. Finally, only correlations withan adjusted pvalue below 0.05 and a score above the threshold were retained.Network properties were calculated using the igraph package of the R software.Network visualization was performed using Cytoscape 3.7.272. The datasets weredivided into different plant groups to established co-occurrence networks andvisualized in Gephi 0.9.273. To compare the stability of the networks, we usednatural connectivity, a new structural robustness metric that can sensitively andreliably assess the structural robustness of networks. It is an average eigenvaluederived from the network spectrum, which describes the redundancy of alternativepaths74. The stability of each bacterial network was assessed by removing nodesFig. 6 Conceptual ﬁgure showing the enrichment (red) and depletion (blue) of bacterial community taxa and functions in the rhizosphere relative tobulk soil. The vertical arrows correspond to the intensity of the changes. The light peach-colored area around the root re ﬂects the enrichment withavailable organics caused by exudates.ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-910 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |          (2022) 13:836 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28448-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsfrom the static network to evaluate how quickly the robustness degraded. Brie ﬂy,all nodes were sorted by betweenness from small to large, and then nodes wereremoved sequentially until 80% of the nodes were removed75. Network modularityfor each network was characterized. A module is a group of nodes (i.e., ASVs) thatare highly connected within the group and less connected outside the group76.Modules were detected using the greedy modularity optimization method77. Theconnectivity of each node was determined based on its within-module connectivity(Zi) and among-module connectivity (Pi)78, which were then used to classify itstopological role in the network. All nodes were categorized into four subcategories:module hubs (nodes that are highly connected within a module, Zi > 2.5 andPi < 0.62), network hubs (nodes that are highly connected within or amongmodules, Zi > 2.5 and Pi > 0.62), peripherals (nodes with few connections within oramong modules, Zi < 2.5 and Pi < 0.62) and connectors (nodes that are highlyconnected among modules, Zi < 2.5 and Pi > 0.62)79,80.Prediction of functions and analysis of dormancy potential and heterotrophicstrategy . The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa v.1.0 (FAPROTAX,http://mem.rcees.ac.cn:8080/ ) pipeline was used to extrapolate bacterial communityfunctions. FAPROTAX was constructed by integrating multiple culturable pro-karyotic bacteria with reported functions and contained more than 7600 functionalannotations for more than 4600 species. This makes it a powerful tool to performfunctional annotation based on published metabolic and ecological functions suchas nutrient (e.g., C, N, P, and S) cycling, plant pathogens, and symbionts81. Thedormancy potential and heterotrophic strategy were determined using thePICRUSt2 with the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database82. Approxi-mately 0.35% of the ASVs were above the Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index (NSTI)cut-off score of values >2, and these ASVs were removed. Dormancy potential wasmeasured as the abundances of genes (including genes involved in toxin –antitoxinsystems and sporulation factors) that confer dormancy strategies54. This re ﬂects theability of microorganisms to decrease metabolic activity and persist in adverseconditions83. The weighted mean ribosomal operon copy number (operon count)was calculated as a proxy for microbial heterotrophic strategy57, which re ﬂects therapid response of microbes to resources54. Copiotrophs are assumed to haverelatively higher operon counts than oligotrophs55.Calculation of the response ratio . The natural log-transformed response ratio(lnRR) was employed as a metric to estimate the rhizosphere effect sizes on bac-terial community characteristics (including observed species richness, Shannon ’sdiversity index, Pielou ’s evenness, Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity, dormancypotential, heterotrophic strategy, and Faprotax predicted functions).The lnRR was calculated as :lnRR ¼lnðXt=XcÞð 1Þwhere XtandXcstand for mean values of a given variable of the rhizosphere andbulk soil groups, respectively84. The variances ( v) of each lnRR were calculated as:v¼S2tntX2tþS2cncX2cð2ÞWhere ntandncare the sample sizes, and StandScare the standard deviations ofthe means in the rhizosphere and bulk soil groups, respectively. To determinewhether the rhizosphere and bulk soil compartments had a signi ﬁcant effect on thevariable, we employed a random-effects model using Metawin (Version 2.1.4)85.Our analysis included two sources of variance, including within-study variance ( ν)and between-study variance ( τ2), both of which were used as a weighting factor[w=1/ (v+τ2)] to calculate mean lnRR values. Bootstrapping with 999 iterationswas performed to estimate the 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CIs). If the 95% CI valuesfor the effect size of a variable did not overlap with zero, the effect size of thevariable was considered to be signi ﬁcantly different between the rhizosphere andbulk soil. For a better understanding, the weighted mean effect size was convertedback into a percentage change using the formula:elnRR0/C01/C16/C17´100% ð3ÞTo avoid unreliable results, some subgroups with an insuf ﬁcient sample size(n< 10) were excluded from the categorical analysis. In the categorical groupanalysis, the total heterogeneity among studies (Q T) was partitioned into within-group heterogeneity (Q W) and between-group heterogeneity (Q B). A signi ﬁcant Q Bmeans a signi ﬁcant difference in the mean effect size between different groups ineach category (Supplementary Tables 4 –7). The publication bias was tested withthe funnel plot using the “metafor ”package86. Possible publication bias wasstatistically tested using Egger ’s regression test87. If there were indications ofpublication bias, the trim-and- ﬁll method was applied to estimate the number ofpotentially missing studies, and then ﬁll the missing data in, to examine whetherany results changed substantially. Model selection was performed to identify themost important predictors for natural log-transformed response ratios of bacterialdiversity (i.e., observed species richness, Shannon ’s diversity index, Pielou ’sevenness and Faith ’s phylogenetic diversity) between bulk soil and rhizosphereusing the “glmulti ”package in R88. The importance value of each particularpredictor was expressed as the sum of the Akaike weights for models included thisfactor, which can be considered as the overall support for each predictor across allmodels. A cutoff of 0.8 was set to differentiate between important and unimportantpredictor. Six types of candidate predictors were considered in the model selectionanalysis, that are, location (longitude and latitude), ecosystems, soil properties (pH,SOC, and total N) (Supplementary Fig. 13). Since only a few studies simultaneouslymeasured available P, available K, NH 4+-N and NO 3−-N in both bulk andrhizosphere soils, these properties were not considered in the model selection.Taxa with signi ﬁcant differences between the rhizosphere and bulk soil . TheALDEx2 tool was used to determine differences at phylum and ASV levels in termsof relative abundance between certain pairwise comparisons (rhizosphere versusbulk soil)89. The counts for taxa that were retained after ﬁltration were tested usingthe default parameters of the aldex function (including mc.samples =128, test =“t”, denom =“all”). The aldex function takes the counts of reads as input andperforms a centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation to infer abundance prior toperforming statistical testing. Wilcoxon ’s rank-sum tests were used, followed by aBenjamini –Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction to identify taxa withsigniﬁcantly different relative abundances between bulk and rhizosphere soils,using the ALDEx2 “aldex.ttest ”function. Treemap (Version 4.1.1) software wasused to visualize the signi ﬁcantly different ASVs as bubble diagrams, where the sizeof the bubble indicates the size of the ALDEx2 effect. In addition, a phylogenetictree was generated using the MUSCLE software90and phylogenetic groups weredelimited in the resulting tree using iTOL91.Reporting summary .
