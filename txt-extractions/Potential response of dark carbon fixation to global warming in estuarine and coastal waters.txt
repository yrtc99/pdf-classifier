However, little is known about the response of DCF processes in estuarine and coastal waters to global warming. Using  radiocarbon labelling m eth od, the effects of temperature on the activity of chemoautotrophs  were investigated in benthic water of the Y angtze estuarine and coastal areas. A dome -shaped  thermal response pattern  was observed  for DCF rate s (i.e., reduced rates at lower or higher temperatures), with the optimum temperature (T opt) varying from about 21.9 °C to 32.0 °C. Offshore sites showed lower T opt values and were more vulnerable to  g l obal warming compared with nearshore sites. Based on temperature seasonality of the study area, it was estimated that warming would accelerate DCF rate in winter and spring but inhibit DCF activity in summer and fall. However, at an annual scale, warmin g showed an overall promoting effect on DCF rates. Metagenomic analysis  revealed that the dominant chemoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways in the nearshore area were  Calvin -Benson -Bassham (CBB) cycle, while the offshore sites were co -dominated by CBB and  3-hydroxypropionate/4 -hydroxybutyrate (3 -HP/4 -HB) cycles, which may explain the differential temperature response of DCF along the estuarine and coastal gradients.  Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating DCF thermal response into biogeochem ical models to accurately estimate the carbon sink potential of estuarine and coastal ecosystems in the context of global warming.

Introduction Dark carbon fixation (DCF), as an important carbon sink process, has long been ignored in estuarine and coastal carbon cycles compared with photoautotrophic carbon fixatio n  (Baltar et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017). DCF is mainly carried out by chemoautotrop hs, which typically thrive near the interfaces between reductive and oxidizing environments, such as the chemoclines in water bodies or the aerobic -anoxic transition zones in sediments (Jørgensen, 1982; Labrenz et al., 2005), obtaining metabolic energy by oxidizing various reductive inorganic substrates  [e.g., hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH 3), nitrite (NO 2–), hydrogen sulfide  (H2S), sulfur (S), thiosulfa te (S2O32-) and ferrous iron (Fe2+)]. Using these energy, organic molecules are synthesized from dissolved in organic carbon (DIC) by chemoautotrophs, which is now recognized to rival the  importance  of photosynthesis in the global carbon cycle (Bräuer et al., 2013; Guerrero -Feijoo et al., 2018) . Seven pathways of DCF , including Calvin -Benson -Bassham (CBB) cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate/4 -hydroxybutyrate (3- HP/4 -HB) cycle, reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, 3 -hydroxypropanoate (3- HP) bicycle,  reductive acetyl -CoA (WL)  pathway, dicarboxylate/4 -hydroxybutyrate (DC/4 -HB) cycle and reductive glycine pathway,  have c urrently been found in chemoautotrophs (Berg, 2011; Figueroa et al., 2018; Hügler & Sievert, 2010). Among them, CBB cycle, 3 -HP/4 -HB cycle, and rTCA cycle are the most important chemoautotrophic DCF pathways known in various  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

During CBB cycle, Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) catalyses the key reaction by which inorganic carbon may be assim ilated into organic carbon (OC). Among the four RuBisCO forms, form I and form II are known to participate in prokaryotic autotrophy (Berg, 2011), and cbbL  (encoding form I RuBisCO) and  cbbM  (encoding form II RuBisCO ) are the mos t representative  marker genes (Alfreider et al., 2017) . In addition, more energy -efficient pathways alternative to the CBB cycle are employed by microbes (Bar-Even et al., 2012; Hügler & Sievert, 2010). For the 3- HP/4 -HB cycle, the key enzyme acetyl -CoA carboxylase (ACCas e) is encoded by accA  gene (Y akimov et al., 2011) and the 4 -hydroxybutyryl -CoA dehydratase is encoded by hbd gene (Alfre ider et al., 2017). During the rTCA cycle, the large subunit of the A TP -dependent citrate lyase (ACL) is encoded by aclB gene (Takai et al., 2005). Temperature is recognized as a primary factor regulating microbial metabolic activities (Walker et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2020). However, knowledge about the potential effect of global warming on DCF remains poorly understood, especially for habitats having high DCF rates, such as estuaries and coasts (Signori et al., 2017). Estuarine and coastal ecosystems exhibit extremely active redox reactions due to the influence of periodic exposure and inundation under tidal action and a large amount of anthropogenic nutrient substrates input (Liu et al., 2022). Chemoautotrophic carbon  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  fixation in estuarine and coastal zones is estimated at approximately 328  Tg C y-1, which represents approximately 42.6% of oceanic DCF production (Middelburg, 2011). Howe ver, these complex environments appear to be the frontline of global warming due to the influence of various complex factors (Belkin, 2009; Zheng et al., 2020). Data from a twelve -year (2007- 2019) monitoring study of 166 estuaries along the Australian coastline showed that estuary temperature increased at a rate of 0.2 °C year−1, which was an order of magnitude faster than predicted by global ocean models (Scanes et al., 2020). Based on remote sensing data from 1982 to 2017, surface water temperature in the Y angtze Estuary was estimated to increase at a rate of about 0.05 °C year−1, which was signif ica ntly  greater than that of the open sea (Wang et al., 2021).  These higher warming rates in estuarine waters may be attribute d to their shallow depth which can provide a greater capacity to absorb radiative heat per volume of water (Scanes et al., 2020). Therefore, it is of great importance to predict how DCF  capacity responds to temperature increase in these carbon sequestration  hotspots. Previous  study showed that DCF rates were positively correlated with temperature through the water column in  the Atlantic off the Galician coast (Guerrero -Feijoo et al., 2018). However, limited field studies in marine environments have given inc onsistent results that DCF rates were negatively correlated with (Garcia -Cantizano et al., 2005; Reinthaler et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2017) or insensitive to temperature increases (Kyewalyanga et al., 2007; Scranton et al., 2020). Nevertheless , those temperature  response  patterns  of DCF rate were   13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Therefore, it is still urgent to reveal the potential effect of global warming on DCF in estuarine and coastal waters.  The objectives of this study are (i) to identify the temperature response pattern of DCF in the complex estuarine and coastal waters; (ii) to simulate the response of DCF capacity to di fferent warming scenarios; and (iii) to reveal the response mechanism of DCF to global warming in estuarine and coastal waters. This study provides an important scientific basis for more accurate quantitative assessment of estuarine and coastal net carbon sequestration capacity in the context of climate change.   2. Materials and Methods  2.1 Study area and fie ld sampling The Yangtze River, the largest river of China, annually transports a runoff of 885 billio n m3 with approximately 86 million tons of sediments to the estuary and adjacent areas in recent ten years (Sun et al., 2022). Intensive mixing of freshwater and seawater generally creates a steep environmental gradient in the Y angtze Estuary (Zheng et al., 2016) . In addition, the study area is largely impacted by complex hydrology , physical dynamics and anthropogenic processes, which represents an ideal estuary -coast continuum system across the globe. The annual temperature range of the study area  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Field surveys and sample collection were conducted along the environmental gradient of the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal areas during the October cruise of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( NSFC) in 2021 (Figure 1). Water samples were collected near the bottom of the euphotic zone with vibrant redox reaction activity  (Bräuer et al., 2013)  using a conductivity -temperature -depth (CTD) rosette fitted with 12 -L Niskin bottle s .  At each sampling site, 30 L of water was collected and stored in the dark under 4  °C for DCF rate measurement and temperature manipulation experiments , and 100 m l of water were filtered with 0.45 μm pore -size sterile filte rs (Waterman) for measureme nt of environmental parameters including DIC, chlorophyll a  (Chl-a), ammonium ( NH 4+), NO 2–, nitrate ( NO 3–), phosphate ( PO 43-), silicate ( SiO 43-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen ( TDN).  Meanwhile, known amounts of wa ter samples were also immed ia te ly filtered with 0.22 μm pore -size sterile filte r s  (Waterman), and the membranes were carefully preserved at -20 ℃ for later molec u la r  analyses.   2.2 Measurement of environmental parameters Water depth and salinity were measured with a CTD  profiler.  Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured in situ  by an oxygen sensor (OX500, Unisense, Denmark) and pH was measured with pH meter (Mettler -Toledo). Nutrients including NH 4+, NO 2–, NO 3–,  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Chl-a was measured on discrete water samples using the in vitro fluorometric method with 90% acetone extraction and determined on a Tur ner Designs TD -700 fluorometer (Giese, 1994). DIC, DOC and TDN were determined using a TOC/TN -Analyzer (TOC -5000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).  The environmental  characteristics in this study are shown in Table S2.   2.3 Measurement of dark carbon fixation rates Water DCF rates  were determined using 14C sodium bicarbonate  (specific activity,  50 μCi/mL ; Perkin -Elmer, USA ) (Alonso -Saez et al., 2010). For each sample (40 mL), 3 replicates and one killed control were analyzed. Killed controls were preserved with formaldehyde (4.4%, final conc.) prior to bicarbonate addition. Samples were added with 20 μl NaH14CO 3 solution ( 0.025 μCi/mL, final conc.) and incubated  in the dark for 24 h under different temperatures in thermostat -controlled incubators.  In the present study , we applied a temperature gradient ranging from 5 to 40 °C at 5 °C intervals, considering the seasonal fluctu ation of temperature in the study area. After incubatio n, each sample was added with 5 mL  formaldehyde and filtered with 0.22 μm polycarbonate membrane (Millipore). The membrane was put into a scintillation vial and exposed  to concentrated HCl fume overnight . Scintilla tio n cocktail (Fishe r  Scientific, Scintiverse BD cocktail SX18 -4) was added to each vial (5 mL) and placed  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The disintegrations per minute (DPM) of the formalin -fixed blank were subtracted from the samples, and the resulting DPM were converted into 14C incorporation rates. The calculation formula is as follows (Liu et al., 2022): 𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷=𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷× 1.05𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷0×𝑡𝑡 where DPM inc is the difference between the radioactivity in the water  samples and control blanks; DIC is the dissolved inorganic C concentration of the water sample; 1.05 is the isotope coefficient used for correcting the uptake of 14C, since th e uptake of 14C is 5% lower than that of 12C (Molari et al., 2013); DPM 0 is the activity of all the 14C added; t is the incubation time.   2.4 DNA extraction and quantitative PCR (Q -PCR)  Total environmental DNA was extracted by using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) in accordance with  the instruction of the manufacturer. The quality  and concentration  of the extracted DNA were measured with a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer ND -2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Q-PCR was then conducted based on the total environmental genomic DNA of  in situ  water to measure the abundance of cbbL  and cbbM  genes of CBB cycle, accA  and hbd genes of 3 -HP/4 -HB cycle, and aclB  gene of r TCA cycle  (Supplementary Methods) .

Q-PCR procedures were conducted  on the ABI7500 Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Canada). In this study, qPCR results with one melting -curve peak, amplification efficiencies higher than 90%, and correlation coefficients above 0.98 were employed.  Details about the primer  sequences  and amplifica tio n conditio ns are presented in Table S 3.  2.5 Metagenome sequencing and analysis  Total genomic DNA was paired -end sequenc ed with NovaSeq Reagent Kits on Illumina NovaSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) offered  by Majorbio (Shanghai, China).  Metagenomic data were analyzed on the online platform of Majorbio Cloud Platform (www.majorbio.com) (Ren et al., 2022). Raw reads were trimmed with fastp  (v0.19.7) to eliminate  low-quality reads  and adaptors  (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp ). The trimme d sequences were de novo assembled with MEGAHIT (https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) (Li et al., 2015). The obtained sequences were operated  to predict  open reading frame (ORF) with MetaGene (http://metagene.cb.k.u -tokyo.ac.jp/) (Noguchi et al., 2006) and construct a nonredundant gene catalog with CD-HIT (http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd -hit/) (Fu et al., 2012).

Finally, t he representative sequences were  categorized as  taxonomy by comparing with the National Center for Biotechnology Informat io n (NCBI ) Non-Redundant Protein Sequence ( NR) database and annotated biological functions by comparing with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database at 1e-5 e-value cutoff using DIAMOND (https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) (Buchfink et al. , 2015;  Buchfink et al., 2021).  2.6 S tatistical analysis  The change of DCF rate with warming was simulated  by polynomial fitting using Origin software (Origin 2022). Pearson ’s correlation analysis was performed using Origin 2022. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed to reveal  the similarity and otherness of the estuarine and coastal water communities through  R package. One -way analysis of variance (ANOV A) was conducted to investigate spatial variatio ns in the optimum  temperature (T opt) of DCF processes (SPSS, version 25.0).

Results  3.1 Chemoautotrophic microbes along the estuarine and coastal gradient  Community dynamics of chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters were explored via metagenomic analyses (Figure 2). Generally,  the relative abundance of DCF microbes in the low salinity estuarine waters was lower than that in the middle and high salinity coastal areas ( P<0.05) (Figure 2a). In addition, chemoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways varied significantly along the environmental gradient of the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters (Figures S1 and S2). CBB cycle was the dominant chemoautotrophic carbon fi xat io n pathway at the low and middle salinity sites (S1 -S4), while DCF at the high salinit y sites was co -dominated by CBB and 3- HP/4 -HB cycles (Figure 2a).  Microbes performing CBB cycle  were mainly affiliated to Gammaproteobacteria (22.1%) and Betaproteobacteria  (19.2%), which were the dominant phylum in the middle -salinity and low -salinity areas, respectively (Figure 2 b). The relative importance of 3 -HP/4 -HB cycle gradually increased from the upper estuary to the offshore areas, which was consistent with t he abundance of accA  gene (encoding the alpha subunit of acetyl -CoA carboxylase in 3-HP/4 -HB cycle) based on Q -PCR results ( P<0.05) ( Figure 2c ). Moreover, the abundance of hbd gene encoding 4 -hydroxybutyryl -CoA dehydratase of 3-HP/4 -HB cycle  also tended to  be higher at the high salinity sites (Figure 2c). Thaumarchaeota occupied 98.1% of all chemoautotrophs conducting 3-HP/4 -HB cycle  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  (Figure 2b), of which ammonia -oxidized archaea ( Nitrosomarinus and Nitrosopelagicus ) were the dominant chemoautotrophs for DC F in the middle and high salinity waters (S3 -S6) (Figure S3). However, in the low salinity estuarine waters (S1 -S2), Nitrospira , which performs rTCA cycle and is mainly involved in the oxidation of nitrite, was the most important DCF genus (Figure S3). Gen erally, the relative importance of rTCA carbon fixation pathway decreased from the upper estuary to saline seawaters ( Figure 2a ), which was consistent with the Q -PCR result that the abundance of gene encoding the beta subunit of the A TP citrate lyase ( aclB) in rTCA cycle was significantly higher at the low salinity sites ( P<0.01) ( Figure 2c ). Furthermore, WL pathway mainly existed at the middle salinity sites ( Figure 2a ) with the maxima l biodiversity of DCF microbes (Table S5). Nevertheless,  3-HP bicycle was even -distributed along the environmental gradient of the Yangtze Estuary, with most of the chemoautotrophs affiliat ing to  Alphaproteobacteria (35.9%), Actinobacteria (34.2%) and Gammaproteobacteria (24.0%) (Figure 2a and 2b).  3.2 Response  of DCF rates to temperature  Within the temperature range of 5 to 40 °C, DCF rate s varied from 0.05 to 0.72 μmol C  L-1 day-1 and showed a dome -shaped thermal response pattern (Figure 3) . On the basis of the constructed temperature -response curves (Figure 3 ), the T opt for DCF was estimated. DCF rates increased with temperature until the T opt was reached, and  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Along the Y angtze estuarine and coastal gradient, the Topt ranged from about 21.9 to 32.0 °C, which was significa nt ly lower at the offshore sites (S5 -S6) than at the nearshore sites (S1 -S4) (one -way ANOVA, P<0.05). It should be noted that the minima l  Topt value (21.9 °C ) was o bserved at the most offshore  site S6 , indicating that da rk carbon fixation might be more vulnerable in saline seawater under the stress of global warming . The Topt of nearshore sites (S1 -S4) was higher than the current temperature (6 -27.9 °C ), and thus DCF rates mainly presented an increased trend  with global w arming . Nevertheless, the T opt of offsho r e  stations (S5 -S6) was below the current temperature at part of the year, which leads to a decrease of DCF rates with the increase of temperature, especially in summer (Figure 3).  3.3 DCF capacity under different warming scenarios  The global sea surface temperature is estimated to increase by approximately 1.8 °C and 3.4 °C under the SSP2- 4.5 and SSP5- 8.5 scenarios, respectively, at the end of the 21st century relative to the recent reference period 1995 -2014 (IPCC , 2021). Compared with the open ocean, estuaries are generally subjected to greater warming trends (Scanes et al., 2020). Therefore, in this study , 2 °C and 4 °C warming scenarios were assumed to evaluate the influence of global warming on DCF capacity in estuarine and coastal waters  (Figures 4  and 5). The increase of temperature under the se warming   13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Especially at the high salinity offshore sites (S5 -S6), warming in August would i nhibit DCF rates by 2.1- 4.1% and 5.3- 9.4% under the 2 °C and 4 °C warming  scenario s, respectively. However, the inhibition of DCF rates by warming in summer was relative ly lower  at the lower salinity nearshore sites (S1 -S3), with the inhibition of 0.7 -1.2% and 2.2- 3.6% in August  under the 2 °C and 4 °C warming  scenario s, respectively. In addition, the duration of warming inhibition was longer at the offshore sites than at the nearshore sites. Particularly , the duration of DCF inhib itio n at site S6 lasted f rom June to October (Figure 5).  In contrast, warming in cooler seasons would promote DCF rates in estuarine and coastal waters, with a maximal stimulation occurring in February (24.0- 113.9% ) under  4 °C warming  scenario . In addition, the promotion level of DCF rate by warming was higher at the nearshore sites than at the offshore sites (Figures 4 and 5). U nder the 4 °C warming scenario, DCF rate might averagely increase by 19.3% in the nearshore area, while it would rise only by 8.8% in the offshore area (Fi gure 6). Generally, the annual DCF capacity of the whole Y angtze estuarine and coastal waters would increase by approximately 8.6% and 15.8%  by 2100 under the 2 °C and 4 °C warming scenarios, respectively  (Figure S4).   4. Discussion  As an important link converting  inorganic carbon to organic matter, DCF is  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Due to the widespread existence of chemoautotrophic microorganisms, DCF  process  is a significant  carbon sink in dark ocean (Pachiadaki et al., 2017), hydrothermal vents (Nakagawa & Takai, 2008), and cold springs (Camacho et al., 2005) . Estuaries and coasts are complex hydrodynamic ecosystems under the interactio n between riverine runoff and tidal oscillation, which generally harbor high primary productivity and are important sources of organic matter and energy for adjacent oceanic areas (Signori et al., 201 7). The importance of DCF in the biogeochemical cycle of carbon has been confirmed in estuarine and coastal eco systems (Signori et al., 2017). However, the potential response of chemoautotrophic activities to climate warming in estuarine and coastal waters remains under exploration. In this study, the thermal response patterns of DCF rates in the Y angtze Estuary we re investigated  along the estuarine gradient . In addition, based on metagenome analyses, this study further revealed the molecular mechanisms of how chemoautotrophic microbial communities and carbon sequestration pathways regulate the thermal response of D CF in estuarine and coastal waters.  DCF rates in the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters were comparable to those reported in the Columbia River ’s Estuary (0.9 -1.4 μ mol C L−1 day−1) (Bräuer et al., 2013) and a tropical estuarine system ( 0.4-1.3 μ mol C L−1 day−1) (Signori et al. ,  2017), but significantly higher than those detected in seawaters such as the North  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Compared with freshwater ecosystems, DCF rates measured in the Y angtze estuarine and coastal waters were significantly higher than those reported in deep groundwater of Sweden ( 3.9×10-3-1.9×10-2 μmol C L-1 day-1) (Overholt et al., 2022) and in the Maggiore Lake ( 1.3×10-2-2.1×10-2 μmol C L-1 day-1) (Callieri et al., 2014). Temperature is suggested to significantly affect the activity and abundance of microorganisms, thereby regulating DCF rate (Liu et al., 2022). In light of present and future  anthropogenic -driven changes in climate, there is a rising interest for exploring the response of chemoautotrop hic carbon fixation to temperature, as  temperature change may have the potential to severely impact microbial performance and consequently ecosy stem functio n in g (Alster et al., 2018). I n this study, the response of DCF rate to temperature showed that below the optimum temperature, DCF rate increased spontaneously with the temperature rising constantly, while  it dropped sharply when the temperature  exceeds the Topt. This response pattern may be explained by  the intrinsic temperature sensitivit y of enzymatic reactions (Brzostek & Finzi, 2012) , since temperature can alter the biochemica l kinetics and structura l stability of enzyme s (Somero, 2004). Gen erally, increasing temperature promotes catalytic rate, and DCF  is thus enhanced due to increasing kinetic energy of reactants and rates of collision, as well as higher structural flexibility of enzymes (Davidson et al., 2006). However, excessive  structural flexib i lit y  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  can also lead to reduced ligand recognition and binding ability at active sites, thereby reducing kinetic efficiency and thus decreasing DCF rates (Zheng et al., 2020).  In the estuarine and coastal waters, significantly lower T opt for DCF was observed at the offshore sites than at the nearshore sites (one -way ANOVA, P<0.05), which suggests that DCF at the offshore sites may be  more vulnerable  to temperature changes. Specifically, the DCF -promoting temperature rising limit was 6.3 °C higher at the nearshore sites than at the offshore sites (Figure 6), and the o ffshore  sites were mor e  significant ly inhib ited  than the nearshore  sites in warm seasons (Figure S5). Overall, the promotion level of annual DCF by warming was higher in the near shore area than that in the offshore area (Figure 6). The higher vulnerability  of DCF in high salinit y offshore seawaters  indicates that chemoautotrophic  carbon fixation in the open ocean s may also be  sensitive to global warming , which needs to be investigated in fu ture studies . The observed differences in thermal response w ere likely due to  the spatial heterogeneity of chemoautotrophic microbial communities (Alster et al., 2018). It was reported that the difference in microbial physiology and kinet ics among micro b ia l communities may be important drivers of different temperature sensitivities (Alster et al., 2016; Alster et al., 2018). In this study , significant variations of chemoautotrop hic microbial communities were detected along the Y angtze estu arine and coastal gradient (Figure 2), and the enzymes produced by different  chemoautotrophs can vary in their temperature sensitivity, thus resulting in different carbon  fixatio n kinetics amo ng  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  sampling sites.  In addition, it was observed that  chemoautotrophs showed higher dependence on other microbes in high salinity offshore areas (Figure S6) , which may lead to their vulnerability  to temperature rise. Furthermore, environme nta l parameters may also influence the thermal response pattern of chem oautotrophs, but Topt was only observed to be negatively correlated with DIC ( P<0.05)  across the Y angtze Estuary  (Table S10). It is worth noting that the potential seasonal variations of microbial communitie s were not considered in the present study , which  requires further refine me nt.  It was previously reported that, as temperature changes, the specific substrate affinity (α) of AOB -dominated  estuar ine waters varied in a narrower range relative to that of AOA -dominated  coastal  waters  (Zheng et al., 2020), w hich reflects that AOB cope better with variable temperature. In contrast, AOA are more sensitive to temperature change and so may not be favored in a warming habitat. These hypotheses were confirmed in the present study, which showed higher T opt at the AOB -dominated nearshore sites (26.8 -32 °C) than at the AOA -dominated offshore sites (21.9- 25.2 °C) (Figure 3). Especially, the T opt for DCF at the offshore site S5 was around 25.2 °C, consistent with a reported value for an AOA isolate from laborat ory culture (Qin et al., 2014) . Meanwhile, the average T opt of 28.3 °C at the nearshore sites was close to the range of 29 -35 °C reported for AOB pure cultures (Groeneweg et al., 1994) (Figure 3). These results suggest that ammonia oxidizers may play an im portant role in  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  chemoautotrophic carbon fixation in estuarine and coastal waters. Consistently, nitrifiers were reported to be the major contributors to DCF in the dark ocean (Guerrero -Feijoo et al., 2018). Middelburg (2011) also showed that globally about  52% of the chemoautotrophic carbon fixation occurs by nitrifiers in the ocean water column.  Moreover, Baltar et al. (2016) reported that chemoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms were the main group responsible for the increased DIC fixation rates , which  provided direct experimental evidence for ammonia as an important energy source for prokaryotic DIC fixation in the dark ocean. Furthermore , DCF rates were observed to be significantly promoted by NH 4+ addition ( P<0.05) in the present  study  (Supple mentary Methods) , further demonstrati ng that nitrifie rs may play an impor ta nt role in driving DCF  (Figure S7) . Among the ammonia oxidizers, AOA affiliated to Thaumarchaeota, immob ilize CO 2 through 3-HP/4 -HB cycle  and are considered to be the dominant microbial group for ammonia oxidation and DCF in marine environme nts  (Cao et al., 2012; Hansman et al., 2009; Herndl et al., 2005;  Tetu et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2010). In the present study, Thaumarchaeota were also the  dominant DCF micro b e s  in the offshore waters, among which Nitrosomarinus  and Nitrosopelagicus  were the dominant genera, indicating the prominent contribution of AOA to DCF in the high salinity coastal waters. However, in the lower salinity nearshore water s, Nitrospira  may play a more important role in DCF through rTCA cycle. Recent studies have also confirmed the role of NOB and comammox bacteria in DCF process  at freshwater lakes  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Therefore, nitrifiers pla y an important role in DCF and associated thermal response via occupying different ecological niches in estuarine and coastal waters.  It is interesting to find that the relative importance of WL pathway, the largest carbon fixation pathway in anaerobic conditions (Berg, 2011), was significantly higher in the middle -salinity zone than in the low -salinity and high -salinity waters ( P<0.01) (Figure 2a), which is presumably related to the anaerobic microzone formed by microorganisms attached to the surface of  suspended particles in the turbidity maximum zone ( TMZ ) (Zheng et al., 2021). Estuarine TMZ is characterized by a higher concentration of suspended particles than upstream or downstream zones, which is formed due to extensive interactions between land and  sea and is prevalent in most estuaries around the world (Mitchell, 2013; Shen et al., 2008). The low -oxygen microsites around suspended particles in the TMZ waters can provide circumstances for anaerobic microbes (Jia et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2021), as  well as those performing DCF through the WL pathway. In the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters, anaerobic microorganisms conducting DCF via WL, most of which were affiliated to the phylum  Chloroflexi , Deltaproteobacteria, Armatimonadetes , Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes , were found to be enriched in the TMZ waters (Figure 2b). In addition, higher DCF microbia l diversity was likely resulted from the extensive mate r ia l exchanges between land and sea in these middle -salinity TMZ waters (Table S 5) (Zheng  13652486, ja, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16702 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   / 40  et al., 2021). In summary, the thermal response pattern of DCF in estuarine and coastal waters was first investigated, and the potential DCF changes under different warming scenarios were predicted. DCF  rate in estuarine and coastal ecosystems wa s highly temperature -dependent, and DCF was more susceptible  to warming at the offshore sites than at the nearshore sites.  Future warming would possibly suppress DCF in summer and fall, while stimulating DCF in winter and spring. Under 2 °C warming scenari o, the annual DCF in the Y angtze Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters was estimate d to averagely increase by 8.6% by 2100 . Metagenome analyses further revealed that nitrifiers  play a significant role in mediating DCF process in estuarine and coastal waters. This study provides important insights about the chemoautotrophic carbon sink in estuarine and coastal waters under the context of global warming.
