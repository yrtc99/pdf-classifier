Crop management effects on soil carbon sequestration onselected farmers’ ﬁelds in northeastern OhioMarek K. Jareckia, Rattan Lala,*, Randy JamesbaCarbon Management and Sequestration Center, School of Natural Resources, The Ohio State University,2021 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USAbOhio State University Extension, Geauga County, 14269 Claridon-Troy Road, Burton, OH 44021, USAAbstractSoil organic carbon (SOC) pool is the largest among terrestrial pools. The restoration of SOC pool in arable lands represents apotential sink for atmospheric CO 2. Restorative management of SOC includes using organic manures, adopting legume-basedcrop rotations, and converting plow till to a conservation till system. A ﬁeld study was conducted to analyze soil properties ontwo farms located in Geauga and Stark Counties in northeastern Ohio, USA. Soil bulk density decreased with increase in SOCpool for a wide range of management systems. In comparison with wooded control, agricultural ﬁelds had a lower SOC pool inthe 0–30 cm depth. In Geauga County, the SOC pool decreased by 34% in alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) grown in a complexrotation with manuring and 51% in unmanured continuous corn ( Zea mays L.). In Stark County, the SOC pool decreased by 32%in a ﬁeld systematically amended with poultry manure and 40% in the ﬁeld receiving only chemical fertilizers. In comparisonwith continuous corn, the rate of SOC sequestration in Geauga County was 379 kg C ha/C01year/C01in no-till corn (2 years)previously in hay (12 years), 760 kg C ha/C01year/C01in a complex crop rotation receiving manure and chemical fertilizers, and355 kg C ha/C01year/C01without manuring. The rate of SOC sequestration was 392 kg C ha/C01year/C01on manured ﬁeld in StarkCounty.#2004 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionRestoration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in arablelands represents a potential sink for atmospheric CO 2(Lal and Kimble, 1997 ). Strategies for SOC restora-tion by adoption of recommended managementpractices (RMPs) include conversion from conven-tional tillage to no-till, increasing cropping intensityby eliminating summer fallows, using highly diverserotation, introducing forage legumes and grassmixtures in the rotation cycle, increasing cropproduction, and increasing carbon (C) input into thesoil ( Lal et al., 1998; Lal, 1999; Desjardins et al.,2001; Hao et al., 2002 ). In the US, cropland under no-till increased from 14.7% in 1995 to 19.6% in 2002(Fawcett and Towery, 2003 ).

Adopting no-till in combination with othermanagement practices can enhance SOC sequestra-tion. In combination with minimum or no-tillmanagement, crop rotations can reduce soil erosion,enhance SOC concentration and sequester soil C ( Lal,2001 ).West and Post (2002) observed that changingplow till to no-till increased SOC pool at the rate of57 g C m/C02year/C01(or 570 kg ha/C01year/C01). Rela-tively lower rates (14 g C m2year/C01) of increase inSOC pool were associated with adoption of complexcrop rotations. The ef ﬁciency of a no-till system forSOC sequestration is enhanced when used incombination with high intensity crop rotations andelimination of summer fallow ( Potter et al., 1997;Campbell et al., 1998 ). Converting a monoculture to acrop rotation also leads to SOC sequestration, whichincreases residue inputs to the soil ( Robinson et al.,1996; Drury et al., 1998; Halvorson et al., 2002 ).Increase in SOC may not occur in crop rotations,which include high frequency of low residue produ-cing crops, such as soybean ( Glycine max L.) (Omayet al., 1997; Dick et al., 1998; Studdert and Echeverria,2000 ). Buried residues and roots decay faster thanabove ground or surface applied residues as is the casein a no-till system ( Ghidey and Alberts, 1993 ). Astrong interaction between C, water and N cyclesimpacts the SOC pool and soil erosion risks ( Reicosky,1994 ).The data on SOC sequestration rate under on-farmconditions are scanty, but needed for assessing the Ccredits and evaluating the impact of managementsystem on soil quality. Therefore, the objectives of thisstudy were to compare SOC and N pools, and othersoil properties under different crop managementsystems under on-farm conditions on selected farmsin northeastern Ohio, USA.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sites and soil descriptionTwo farms, one each in Geauga and Stark Countiesin northeastern Ohio, were selected for the study. Thelong-term mean precipitation is 1112 mm per annumin Geauga County and 915 mm in Stark County. Theprecipitation distributed evenly throughout the year,and is adequate for crop production in most soils. Theaverage annual temperature is 9.0 8C in Geauga and10.28C in Stark County ( USDA, 1971, 1982 ). Thefarms are located near Burton in Geauga County(41.29N, 81.07W) hereafter called ‘‘Geauga Farm ’’,and near Louisville in Stark County (40.57N, 81.15W)hereafter called ‘‘Stark Farm ’’. In both Counties dairyfarming is the principal enterprise. However, the soilswhich are more suited for grasses than for row cropshave been used in agriculture since the beginning ofthe 19th century. Soils of the Geauga Farm areclassi ﬁed as a Can ﬁeld silt loam ( ﬁne-loamy, mixed,mesic Aquic Fragiudalfs) and those of the Stark Farmas a Ravenna Can ﬁeld silt loam ( ﬁne-loamy, mixed,mesic Aeric Fragiudalfs). These are deep, gentlysloping (2 –4%), moderately well drained soils formedon glacial till (Wisconsin age) on uplands. Theycontain fragipan that restricts rooting depth and themovement of water. Permeability is moderate abovethe fragipan and slow in the fragipan and substratum(USDA, 1971, 1982 ). The mean texture particle sizedistribution for the surface layer comprises 30% sand,38% clay and 32% silt in the Geauga Farm; and 29%sand, 33% clay and 38% silt in the Stark Farm.The land use and management system chosen for theGeauga Farm included: a wooded control (wooded),continuous corn (CC), continuous corn with no-tillmanagement (CCNT), alfalfa in crop rotation withcattle manure (ARM) and grass meadow in anunmanured crop rotation (GRUM) ( Table 1 ). All ﬁeldsand wooded area in the Geauga Farm were locatedwithin a 2.5 km radius and have the same loamy texture.Land use and management systems chosen for the StarkFarm included: a wooded control (wooded), corn inpoultry manured corn/soybean rotation (manured) andsoybean with chemical fertilizer (mineral) in corn/soybean rotation ( Table 1 ). Both ﬁelds in the Stark Farmare adjacent to each other and bordered with a woodedarea. In both farms, all ﬁelds were managed with aminimum till system with the exception of CCNT in theGeauga Farm where a no-till system was practiced.Minimum till system refers to minimum cultivationrequired to grow a crop successfully, and in the GeaugaFarm and Stark Farm, the soil cultivation was restrictedto chisel and disc. The no-till corn was planted directlyinto the seedbed, which was not tilled since the previouscorn crop.M.K. Jarecki et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 81 (2005) 265–276 266Both practices comprise the conservation tillage,which is de ﬁned as ‘‘any tillage and planting systemthat maintains at least 30% of the soil surface coveredby residue after planting to reduce water erosion; orwhere wind erosion is primary concern, maintain atleast 1000 kg ha/C01ofﬂat, small grain residueequivalent on the surface during the critical winderosion period ( CTIC, 2002 ).2.2. Soil sampling, preparation and bulk densitymeasurementsSoil samples were collected in June 2002 from eachﬁeld and wooded area. Samples were taken at each oftheﬁve points across the sites. Sampling points wereseparated from each other by a distance of 50 m. Acomposite sample from each point included two cores(4.3 cm diameter) for 0 –5, 5–10, 10 –20, 20 –30 and30–50 cm depths. Soil bulk density (b) was correctedfor gravel ( >2 mm), assuming the average gravelparticle density of 2.65 Mg m/C03(Blake and Hartge,1986 ). The remaining soil was combined to obtain acomposite sample for further analysis. Soil samplesfor chemical analyses were air-dried, ground andsieved through a 2 mm sieve. Soil samples for C and Nanalyses were additionally ground using a ball milland sieved through a 0.125 mm sieve.2.3. Soil chemical analysesThe C and N analyses were performed on an NC2100 soil analyzer (ThermoQuest CE Instruments,Milan, Italy). The HCl test to indicate the carbonatepresence was negative, thus total C concentration wasassumed to be SOC. Exchangeable bases (Ca2+,M g2+,K+and Na+) were determined in NH 4OAc extract,exchangeable acidity by BaCl 2-TEA extraction(Thomas, 1982 ), and pH in 1:1 soil –water suspension(Mc Lean, 1982 ).2.4. Calculations of soil organic carbon poolThe SOC and total N concentrations wereconverted to mass per unit area for a ﬁxed depthcorresponding to 0 –5, 5–10, 10 –20, 20 –30 and 30 –50 cm depth by multiplying with rband depth ( Lal etM.K.

The SOC and N pools for 0 –20, 0 –30 and 0 –50 cm depths were computed using the equivalent soildepth method described by Ellert and Bettany (1995)where additional thickness of subsurface layerrequired to attain the equivalent soil mass wascomputed as follow:Tadd¼ðMsoil;equiv/C0Msoil;surfÞ/C20:0001 ha m/C02rb subsurfacewhere Tadd= additional thickness of subsurface layer(m); Msoil, equiv = equivalent soil mass = mass of hea-viest layer (Mg ha/C01);Msoil, surf = sum of soil mass insurface layer(s) (Mg ha/C01);rb subsurface = bulk densityof subsurface layer (Mg m/C03).2.5.

Statistical analysesExperiments performed on the farms did not allowfor randomization, and replicated sampling pointsfrom the ﬁelds were used as ‘‘pseudoreplications ’’(Reganold, 1994; Bergstrom et al., 1998 ). The analysisof variance (ANOVA) was computed for each farmseparately and means were compared by the leastsigni ﬁcant differences (LSD) test at P<0.05 ( SASInstitute Inc., 1994 ).3. Results and discussion3.1. Soil bulk densityIn the Geauga Farm, the rbwas lower in woodedthan in the crop ﬁelds, and ranged from 1.25 to1.31 Mg m/C03in 0–5 cm layer and 1.48 to 1.59 Mg m/C03in 31 –50 cm layer ( Table 2 ). Signi ﬁcantly higher rbinCC was observed in 5 –10 cm depth compared to otherﬁelds, and 10 –20 cm depth compared to CCNT andGRUM ( Table 2 ). There were no consistent differencesinrbamong ﬁelds in deeper layers ( Table 2 ).In the Stark Farm, the lowest rbwas observed inwooded than in manured, and the highest in mineralﬁeld for 0 –5 cm depth. There were no signi ﬁcantdifferences in rbamong different ﬁelds for 10 –50 cmdepth ( Table 3 ).3.2. Soil organic carbon concentrationIn the Geauga Farm, the SOC concentration washigher in wooded than in the crop ﬁelds for all depths(Table 2 ). There were no differences in SOCconcentration among ﬁelds for 0 –5 cm depth. TheSOC was higher in ARM than in the other ﬁelds for 5 –10 cm depth, higher in ARM than CCNT and CC for5–20 cm depth, and no differences among the ﬁeldsfor 20 –50 cm depth ( Table 2 ). Soil bulk density wasinversely related to SOC concentration ( Fig. 1 ).A lack of signi ﬁcance in SOC concentration amongCC and CCNT ﬁelds may be due to similar tillagemanagement. The CC was under minimum tillage(disc and chisel) and received less soil disturbancethan regular tillage. Therefore, conversion to no-tilldid not induce signi ﬁcant changes in soil properties.Tillage-induced differences in SOC concentration aregenerally limited to the surface layer up to 7 cm depth(Havlin et al., 1990; Potter et al., 1997 ). Furtherconversion from conventional tillage to no-till may notalways increase total SOC sequestration ( Franzlueb-bers and Arshad, 1996; Salinas-Garcia et al., 1997 ).Rasmussen and Collins (1991) indicated the impor-tance of thermic factor limiting changes in SOC due totillage management i.e. lower annual temperatures arenot conducive to drastic changes in SOC concentra-tion. Dick (1983) reported similar results to those inthis study that no-till may delay decline in SOCcompared to plow till. No-till enhances SOCconcentration in the surface soil under most conditions(Potter and Chichester, 1993; Potter et al., 1997; Laland Kimble, 1997; West and Post, 2002 ).There were also differences in SOC concentrationamong management systems at the Stark Farm. HighSOC concentration was observed in wooded andmanured than in the mineral ﬁeld in the 0 –10 cm andin the 20 –30 cm depths ( Table 3 ). The comparison inSOC concentration between manured and mineraltreatment support the hypothesis that organic amend-M.K. Jarecki et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 81 (2005) 265 –276 269Fig. 1. Relationship between soil bulk density and soil organiccarbon concentration.ment applied to the soil increases SOC concentration,which in turn induces changes in rb(Haynes et al.,1991; Barzegar et al., 2002 ) and other soil properties.3.3. Soil nitrogen concentration and C:N ratioTotal N concentration followed a pattern similarto that of SOC, but the C:N ratio narrowed in subsoillayers ( Tables 2 and 3 ).Jenkinson (1988) alsoobserved a decrease in C:N ratio and attributed it tot h ep r e s e n c eo f ﬁxed NH4+by clays, which eitherremains constant or increases whereas SOCdecreases with depth. The wooded treatment in alllayers in Geauga Farm and <30 cm layer in StarkFarm showed wider C:N ratio than that in thecropped ﬁelds. The wider C:N ratio is indicative of ahigh concentration of partially decomposed plantmaterial due to slower decomposition rate instrongly acid soil conditions ( Tables 2, 3 and 6 )(Jenkinson, 1988 ). Wider C:N ratio in the subsoillayers in wooded than in cropland ﬁelds may be dueto high level of SOC attributed to deep root system ofnative perennials. Page et al. (2003) reported thatremoval of deep-rooted native vegetation ( Acaciaharpophylla Benth.) and introducing shallow-rootedcrops changed the soil environment, lowered SOC,and contributed to subsoil NH4concentration.3.4. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen poolsThere were signi ﬁcant differences in SOC and Npools among management systems. In the GeaugaFarm, SOC pool was the highest in wooded controlthan in the ARM ﬁeld ( Table 2 ). There were nostatistical differences in SOC pool among CC andCCNT ﬁeld for the same soil depth ( Table 2 ). In theStark Farm, the SOC pool was the highest in thewooded control in the top 30 cm depth (with exceptionof the 5 –20 cm layer), and it was higher in manuredthan in mineral treatment. In both farms, the N poolM.K.

Carbon and nitrogen pools on an equivalent soilmass basisIn the Geauga Farm, the mass of the soil in CC wasdesignated as an ‘‘equivalent mass ’’of the referencesite ( Table 4 ). The SOC pool computed for 0 –20 cmdepth was in the order: wooded >ARM >GRUM =CCNT = CC ( Table 4 ). A similar gradation of SOCpool was observed in 0 –30 cm layer, but there were nostatistical differences in SOC pool among ARM andGRUM treatments ( Table 4 ). Trends in soil N poolwere similar to those of the SOC pool. Signi ﬁcantincreases in SOC and N pools in ARM compared toCC indicate that increase in cropping intensity canincrease SOC pool ( Franzluebbers et al., 1994 ).In the Stark Farm, the mass of the soil in mineralﬁeld was designated as an ‘‘equivalent mass ’’of thereference site. The SOC and N pools computed for the0–20 cm and 0 –30 cm layers followed the order:wooded >manured >mineral ( Table 4 ). The signi ﬁ-cant increase in SOC pool in manured ﬁeld in the StarkFarm and in ARM ﬁeld in the Geauga Farm indicatethe importance of crop rotation, tillage and fertilitymanagement on SOC pool and its distribution(Rasmussen and Collins, 1991; Collins et al., 1992;Potter et al., 1997 ).3.6.

Thestrati ﬁcation ratio for SOC and N pools was similarfor wooded control and CCNT, but ARM and GRUMﬁeld had lower strati ﬁcation ratio for SOC pool thanthose in wooded control, and lower strati ﬁcation ratiofor N pool than those in wooded control and CCNTﬁelds ( Table 5 ). In Stark Farm, the strati ﬁcation ratioof SOC and N concentrations and pools was more inwooded control compared to manured and mineraltreatments ( Table 5 ).The concept of using strati ﬁcation ratio as a soilquality indicator is based on the in ﬂuence of surfaceSOC level on erosion control, water in ﬁltration andnutrient conservation ( Franzluebbers, 2002 ).

In arable lands, the strati ﬁcation ratio isa function of tillage intensity and the amount ofsurface residue as the most important variable ( Duikerand Lal, 1999 ). High strati ﬁcation of SOC and N underno-till has also been reported by several researchers(Dick, 1983; Unger, 1991; Franzluebbers, 2002; Kayand VandenBygaart, 2002 ). In the present studyhowever, corn grown on the ﬁeld with 14 years of no-till management (CCNT) did not show signi ﬁcantdifferences in strati ﬁcation ratio of several propertiesstudied ( Table 5 ). This support the ﬁndings ofBalesdent and Balabane (1996) in that corn rootderived C contributed 1.6 times more C to SOC thanstoves-derived C.3.7. Soil reaction, exchangeable bases, exchangeableacidity and cation exchange capacityIn the Geauga Farm, soil pH was neutral for CC andARM, slightly acid for CCNT and GRUM, and verystrongly acid for wooded control ( Table 6 ). In the 30 –50 cm layer, pH changed to slightly acid in ARM,moderately acid in GRUM, strongly acid in CC andCCNT, and remained very strongly acid in woodedcontrol ( Table 6 ). In the Stark Farm, soil pH wasneutral in manured, slightly acid in mineral, andextremely acid in wooded control ( Table 6 ). In the 30 –50 cm layer, pH was moderately acid in manured andvery strongly acid in mineral and wooded controltreatments ( Table 6 ). Similar trends of decline in pH inno-till were also reported by Dick (1983) . In manuredﬁelds in both farms the pH was higher in all depthsthan in the other ﬁelds, and con ﬁrms that cattle andpoultry manure can raise pH in the soils ( Zhang, 1998;Whalen et al., 2000 ). In the Stark Farm, lower pH inmineral ﬁeld may be due to use of N fertilization, andM.K.

Relationship between soil organic carbon and cationexchange capacity.acidi ﬁcation caused by the attendant nitri ﬁcation ofsurface applied N ( Blevins et al., 1977; Dick, 1983 ).In the Geauga Farm, sum of exchangeable bases inthe surface 0 –5 cm layer was higher for CC and ARMthan for GRUM and CCNT, and was the lowest forwooded control ( Table 7 ). The exchangeable acidity,was the highest in wooded control and the lowest inARM and GRUM which were limed 2 years prior tosampling ( Table 7 ). The highest CEC expressed as asum of exchangeable bases and exchangeable aciditywas in wooded control and CC and GRUM ﬁeld hadlower CEC than the other ﬁelds (CC, CCNT andARM). These results show a relationship betweenSOC and CEC in Geauga Farm ( Fig. 2 ). In the StarkFarm, there were no proved differences in the sum ofexchangeable bases, exchangeable acidity and CECamong manured and mineral ﬁelds, but there was moreMg2+in mineral than in manured ﬁeld ( Table 7 ).Similar to Geauga Farm, Stark Farm also hadconsiderably lower amount of exchangeable bases,the highest exchangeable acidity, CEC and SOCconcentration, and extremely acid pH in the woodedcontrol ( Table 7 ). Usually higher SOC concentration isassociated with a higher cation exchange capacity(CEC) ( Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Robert, 2001 ).Depending on soil pH, the SOC concentration maycontribute 25 –90% of total CEC ( Stevenson, 1994;Loveland and Webb, 2003 ). Increase in CEC and SOCconcentrations with application of organic manure andmineral fertilizer have also been observed in severallong-term experiments ( Schjønning et al., 1994 ). Thecomparison between manured and mineral treatmentsshows an increase in SOC but not in CEC, since theduration of manure management is 13 years and themanure is applied at low and irregular rates.3.8. The rate of sequestration of soil organic carbonThe loss of SOC pool in 0 –30 cm layer in cropland isestimated at 34% in ARM and 51% in CC in the GeaugaFarm compared with 32% in manured and 40% inmineral in the Stark Farm ( Table 4 ). The magnitude ofSOC loss observed in these farms is similar to thosereported by Davidson and Ackerman (1993) who foundthat conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystemsresulted in 20 –40% decline of SOC pool. The use oforganic manures and adoption of complex rotations(comprising forages mixtures of legumes and grasses)enhanced SOC pools ( Tables 4 and 8 ). In the GeaugaFarm, the rate of SOC sequestration for CCNT used inpreviously hay ﬁeld (no-till management for 14 years)vis-a-vis CC was 379 kg C ha/C01year/C01(Table 8 ). Thisvalue is comparable to SOC gains reported by Puget etal. (2002) in 0–20 cm layer of silt-loam soil in east-central Ohio where 32 years of no-till managementenhanced SOC pool at an average rate of281 kg C ha/C01year/C01, and to SOC gains obtained in0–30 cm layer of Wooster silt loam soil in central OhiobyDick et al. (1998) where 30 years of no-tillmanagement enhanced SOC pool at an average rate of566 kg C ha/C01year/C01. The highest rate of SOCsequestration was measured for complex diverse croprotation combined with manuring and chemicalfertilizer use. The rate of SOC sequestration inthe ARM ﬁeld was 760 kg C ha/C01year/C01vis-a-vis CCﬁeld. Enhancing crop rotation complexity in theunmanured ﬁeld with chemical fertilizer (GRUM)enhanced SOC pool at the rate of 355 kg C ha/C01year/C01(Table 8 ). In the Stark Farm, under the same croprotation but with different nutrient management, therate of SOC sequestration in manured ﬁeld wasM.K.

Poultry manure appeared to be very effective inincreasing SOC concentration ( Nyakatawa et al., 2001 ).4. ConclusionsThe on farm data reported herein support thefollowing conclusions:(1) Increase in C input to the soils through manuring,judicious use of fertilizers and adoption ofcomplex crop rotations is bene ﬁcial in enhancingagronomic productivity, which in turn enhancessoil organic carbon pool.(2) Manuring enhanced the soil organic carbon poolcompared to chemical fertilizers because ofadditional input of carbon, improvement in soilquality, and increase in aggregation and structure.(3) Adoption of no-till on-farm conditions in Ohioleads to similar rates of soil carbon sequestrationas that on research plots.AcknowledgmentsThis research is funded by the Consortium forAgricultural Soils Mitigation of Greenhouse Gases(CASMGS).
