IntroductionIn terrestrial ecosystems, soil stores the largest organic carbon (OC) poolcomprising over three times that of the atmosphere [1]. Small changes inthe decomposition rate of soil OC may signi ﬁcantly impact the atmosphericCO2concentration [2]. Grassland ecosystems play a particularly importantrole in the global carbon (C) cycle [3], with its C storage accounting for one-third of the global terrestrial ecosystem [4]. An improved understanding ofthe soil C cycle in grasslands is therefore essential for accurately assessingits contribution to the global C budget.Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in terrestrial ecosystems has in-creased three times over the past century and continues to increase [5].Ndeposition comprises both organic nitrogen (ON) and inorganic nitrogen(IN) deposition. Although IN is the main component of atmospheric N de-position, increasing evidence demonstrates the large proportion of atmo-spheric N deposition accounted for by ON [6,7] . For instance, on a globalscale, ON deposition accounted for about 30 % of total atmospheric N depo-sition [6]. Zhang et al. [7]monitored atmospheric N deposition at 32 studysites over ﬁve years in China and, found that ON accounts for between 28 %and 50 % of the total N content. However, few studies have focused on theeffects of ON versus IN deposition on soil OC in grassland ecosystems.Nitrogen deposition can affect plant div ersity, plant biomass, soil C miner-alization rate, and soil microbial activity, thus impacting C sequestration [8],which has been shown to increase the decomposition of easily mineralizableOC and promote the stability of refractory C [9,10] . In addition, increases in Ndeposition can signi ﬁcantly increase plant C assimilation and soil C sequestra-tion[1]. While many studies have suggested that N deposition could increase,have no effect on, or decrease the decomposition of soil OC [9–12].T h e s ei n -consistent ﬁndings have caused uncertainty surrounding the soil C cycle in re-sponse to N deposition. This discrepa ncy may be due to the different N formsstudied in the experiments. For instance, Riggs et al. [13] reported that ONaddition decreased microbial respiration of unoccluded OM by as much as29 % relative to control plots. Chen et al. [14]demonstrated that ON additionpromoted C sequestration in temperate grassland soil. Chen et al. [15] foundthat particulate organic carbon is more vulnerable to IN addition thanmineral-associated organic carbon in a soil of an alpine meadow. Therefore,the forms in which N is added to the soil should not be neglected in examiningthe effects of N deposition on OC.Soil organic matter is extremely complex; its formation involves a series ofphysical, chemical, and biological processes. Based on different turnovertimes and persistence mechanisms, soil organic matter can be divided intoparticulate organic matter (POM; being predominantly of plant origin) andmineral-associated organic matter (MAOM; derived from microbial residueswith chemical bonding to minerals and physical protection in small aggre-gates fractions [16,17] . Generally, OC in the POM has a high turnover rate,which is readily affected by environmental changes [18];h o w e v e r ,O Ci nthe MAOM is more stable and has a slow turnover. Numerous studies have ex-plored the effects of N addition on the change of relative OC content and thechange of absolute OC content, but the conclusions are inconsistent [15,19] .For example, Chen et al. [19] found that N addition signi ﬁcantly decreasedOC in the MAOM, while Chen et al. [15]found that OC in the MAOM showedno signi ﬁcant trend with increasing N addition. These inconsistent ﬁndingshighlight the need —in light of increasing global N deposition —for quantify-ing responses of the OC pool distributio n to N addition. In the past, most stud-ies on the effects of N addition to soil OC in grassland focused on one singletype of N addition, i.e., either IN or ON [20–22]. IN or ON additions mayshow different effects on soil carbon processes. For example, IN depositioninhibited soil organic C decomposition and enzymatic activities. By contrast,ON addition resulted in the accelerated transformation of recalcitrant com-pounds into labile compounds and increased CO 2emission in forest soil [9].However, the effects of different proportions of IN and ON on the soil OCpool distribution and stabilization in grassland remain largely unclear.Our objectives were to examine the effects of different types of N (IN/ON)addition on (i) the soil OC pool distribu tion, and (ii) mechanisms controllingits distribution in grassland. We teste d the following hypotheses: (1) the OCcontent in soil and two contrasting fractions is signi ﬁcantly changed underthe addition of different N forms [15,20] , and (2) IN deposition exerts ahigher suppression effect on OC decomposition than that of ON deposition[9]. We carried out N addition experiments in the Erguna meadow steppein Inner Mongolia over ﬁve years. We used ammonium nitrate as the INsource and an equal proportion of urea and glycine as the ON source.2. Materials and methods2.1. Site description and experiment designThe experiment was established in a temperate steppe (N 50°10 ′;E119°22 ′) at Erguna Forest-Steppe Ecotone Research Station of the Instituteof Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The site has a cold temper-ate continental climate, with a mean annual temperature of −2.4 °C andmean annual precipitation of 360 mm (1950 –2017), which falls mostlyfrom June to August. The soil type is chernozem, and the dominant plant spe-cies are Leymus chinensis andStipa baicalensis . We measured the basic chemicalproperties of the 0 –10 cm soil in the control treatment in 2019 as follows:total N 2.23 g·kg−1, available phosphorus 32.5 mg·kg−1, available potassium215.3 mg·kg−1, pH 5.66; for 10 –20 cm soil, total N 1.96 g·kg−1,a v a i l a b l ephosphorus 33.9 mg·kg−1, available potassium 127.5 mg·kg−1, pH 5.75.In May 2014, we established 18 ﬁeld plots (6 m × 6 m) with six treat-ments with different inorganic versus organic nitrogen ratios (IN:ON): thecontrol (hereafter “CK”), IN:ON =10:0 (hereafter “N1”), IN:ON = 7:3(hereafter “N2”), IN:ON =5:5 (hereafter “N3”), IN:ON = 3:7 (hereafter“N4”) and IN:ON = 0:10 (hereafter “N5”) at the experimental site, eachrandomly assigned in triplicate (randomized block design). Buffer zones 1m wide separated the plots. We used NH 4NO3as the IN source, and ureaand glycine mixed in equal proportions, based on their N concentrations,as the ON source. To the control plots (CK) we added only water. Duringtheﬁeld experiments, we fertilized each plot every May with mixed N solu-tions to a total amount of 10 g N m−2yr−1. For example, the N2 (IN: ON =7:3) treatment plots were sprayed with 20 L mixed N solution comprising720 g NH 4NO3(the equivalent of 7 g IN m−2yr−1), 116 g urea (the equiv-alent of 1.5 g ON m−2yr−1) and 289 g glycine (the equivalent of 1.5 g ONm−2yr−1). N was applied once per year. It should be noted that these totalN addition rates exceed the natural deposition rates. The N additions of theN2 treatment were largely in line with the average contribution of ON tototal natural atmospheric N deposition both in China (28 %) and globally(30 %) [6].T h e ﬁeld site inorganic N deposition rates ranged from4.53 kg N ha−1to 12.21 kg N ha−1with a mean value of 8.07 kg N ha−1during the entire growing season [23].2.2. Sample collectionsSoil samples were collected in mid-August 2019. In each of the 18 plots,three soil cores were taken randomly at the depths of 0 –10 cm and 10 –20cm (after removing surface litter) by a 5 cm diameter soil auger. Thesethree cores were mixed as a composite soil sample for the plot. The soil sam-ples were kept in sealed bags and immediately taken back to the laboratoryfor analysis. We carefully removed gravel and visible plant material fromthe composite soil samples by passing them through a 2.0 mm sieve inthe laboratory. We divided the fresh soil samples into two parts, storingone part at 4 °C and air-drying the other part. We determined soil pHusing a pH meter at a 1:5 (soil: water) ratio of soil and CaCl 2solution. Wedetermined soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN)using the chloroform –fumigation –extraction method [24]. We measuredboth total C and total N contents in soil and soil organic matter fractions(POM, MAOM, and MBC) using a C/N analyzer (Elementar VarioMACRO, Germany). The total soil carbon was close to soil organic carbonbecause the carbonate content exceeded the detection limit.2.3. Soil fractions separationWe fractionated soil organic matter according to the approach byLavallee et al. [25]. Brie ﬂy, we dispersed a 10 g air-dried sample byM. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 1599192submerging it into 30 mL of 5 g·L−1sodium hexametaphosphate solutionand shaking it on a shaking incubator for 15 h at 180 rpm min−1. After dis-persion, we sieved the samples and rinsed them several times with deion-ized water to pass through a 0.53 mm sieve. We then obtained two soilfractions: POM >53μm and MAOM <53μm. All fractions were dried inthe oven at 55 °C and recorded the weight of each. We determined theOC content in the two fractions with a C/N analyzer (Elementar VarioMACRO, Germany).2.4. Soil incubationsWe conducted a short-term incubation to determine the potential of OCmineralization. Brie ﬂy, we adjusted 25 g of dry soil to 60 % of the soil waterholding capacity with deionized water and placed it in a 125 mL bottle. Atthe same time, we set three bottles without soil as the control. Before incu-bation, we pre-incubated the soils at 25 °C in the dark for 7 days to establishoptimal conditions for microbial activity. We monitored respiration on days1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 of incubation and added water to the soil to a constantweight each time. We determined CO 2emissions by gas chromatography(Glarus 680 GC, PerkinElner).2.5. Soil analysis and statisticsWe calculated the percentage of POM and MAOM by the following for-mula:PercentagePOM¼MPOM=Msoil/C2100% (1)PercentageMAOM¼MMAOM =Msoil/C2100% (2)where MPOM(g) is the mass of POM fraction after fractionation, MMAOM(g) is the mass of MAOM fraction after fractionation, and Msoil(g) is thebulk soil mass before fractionation. The two fractions together constitutedtotal soil OC.According to the OC content in the bulk soil (g·kg−1soil) and the per-centage of POM and MAOM (%), we calculated the C in each fraction(g·kg−1soil).Ci nP O M ¼PercentagePOM/C2Soil OC content =100% (3)C in MAOM ¼PercentageMAOM/C2Soil OC content =100% (4)In this study, we used the ﬁrst-order kinetic equation to ﬁt the soil OCmineralization from the incubation experiment by SigmaPlot 14.0 [26]:∁t¼∁01/C0e/C0kt/C0/C1(5)where ∁tis the cumulative OC mineralization of soil at time t (g·kg−1);∁0represents the amount of total potentially mineralisable C (g·kg−1), and kisthe mineralization rate constant (day−1). To avoid correlation betweenmodel parameters, we used a ﬁxedk= 0.025 d−1for all treatments and es-timated C0for each treatment by curve ﬁtting.The sensitivity index (SI) related to N addition treatments for soil OCfractions was calculated as follows [27]:SI¼CN/C0CKCK/C2100 (6)where: CNis OC content in different fractions under ﬁve N addition treat-ments, and CKis OC content in different fractions in the control treatment.We de ﬁne microbial respiration per unit of microbial biomass as the mi-crobial metabolic quotient [28].One-way ANOVA and the Duncan post hoc test were used to analyze alldata. In all cases, we considered differences to be statistically signi ﬁcant atP<0.05. All results are expressed as the mean of three replicates. All dataand statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23 for Windows,SigmaPlot software, or Microsoft Of ﬁce.3. Results3.1. OC contents in the soil and isolated fractionsCompared with the control, neither ON nor IN addition signi ﬁcantly af-fected the soil OC content ( p>0.05) ( Fig. 1 a). Different ON/IN additionsdid not signi ﬁcantly affect the OC contents of the two fractions ( Fig. 1 c,d). Compared with the control, the OC content had an increasing tendencyin the 0 –20 cm of POM fraction and 10 –20 cm of MAOM fraction ( Fig. 1 c;Fig. 1 d), while the OC content had a decreasing tendency in the 0 –10 cm ofMAOM fraction with increasing ON/IN ratios ( Fig. 1 d).3.2. Soil microbial biomass carbonNitrogen addition signi ﬁcantly affected MBC in the 10 –20 cm ( p<0.05)(Fig. 1 b). The N3 treatment signi ﬁcantly increased the 10 –20 cm MBC com-pared with other N addition treatments ( p<0.05). Although N addition didnot signi ﬁcantly affect MBC in the 0 –10 cm, the MBC of the N1 treatmentwas 53 % higher than the control.3.3. C/N ratiosNitrogen addition did not signi ﬁcantly affect soil C/N ratios, POM,and MAOM ( p<0.05) ( Table 1 ). However, it signi ﬁcantly affected theC/N ratio of microbial biomass for both soil layers ( p<0.05). For the0–10 cm, the C/N ratio of microbial biomass in the N1, N2, N3, andN5 treatments was signi ﬁcantly lower than that of the control ( p<0.05). For the 10 –20 cm, except for the N3 treatment that had a signi ﬁ-cantly higher C/N ratio of microbial biomass ( p<0.05), the treatmentsdecreased the C/N ratio of microbial biomass compared to the control asN2>N5>N1>N4.3.4. OC percentage of fractionsFor the 0 –10 cm, N1 and N2 treatments signi ﬁcantly increased the per-centage of POM and decreased the percentage of MAOM compared with thecontrol ( p<0.05) ( Fig. 2 ). For the 10 –20 cm, ON/IN addition did not signif-icantly affect the POM and MAOM fractions.3.5. The C in two fractionsNitrogen addition signi ﬁcantly increased the C in both POM and MAOMfractions compared with the control ( p<0.05). For the 0 –10 cm, the C ofPOM fraction was signi ﬁcantly higher under treatments N1, N2, N3, andN5; and the N1, N3, and N5 treatments signi ﬁcantly increased the C ofthe MAOM fraction compared with the control ( p<0.05). For the 10 –20cm, the N1 treatment signi ﬁcantly increased the C of POM, and the N1,N2, N3, and N5 treatments signi ﬁcantly increased the C of MAOM com-pared with the control. Generally, the N1 treatment had the strongest effecton C of both the POM and the MAOM fractions, irrespective of soil depthand N addition.3.6. Sensitivity of OC fractionsThe POM fraction was more sensitive to changes in the proportion ofON/IN than the MAOM fraction in both soil layers ( Table 2 ). Comparedwith other N treatments, the N1 treatment had the highest impact forboth fractions in the 0 –10 cm. However, for the 10 –20 cm, the N5 treat-ment had the highest impact on the POM fraction and the N2 treatmenthad the highest impact on the MAOM fraction.3.7. Soil OC mineralizationNitrogen addition reduced soil OC mineralization by 26 % onaverage compared with the control in the 0 –10 cm layer ( Fig. 4 a), andthe N1 treatment showed the strongest decrease, with an averageM. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 1599193reduction of 40 % compared with the control. For the 10 –20 cm layer,soil OC mineralization was also r educed compared with that of thecontrol ( Fig. 4 b). Cumulative CO 2release decreased as N4 >N3>N5>N1>N2. Moreover, the soil OC mineralization rate decreased withdepth.3.8. Soil OC mineralization potentialIn this study, we used a ﬁrst-order kinetic equation to ﬁt the soil OCmineralization ( Table 3 ). In the case of all treatments, the model values ofR2were above 0.99 and very similar ( p<0.01).

For the 10 –20 cm soil, C0of all N addi-tion treatments was signi ﬁcantly lower than that of the control ( p<0.05).On average, the C0in the 0 –10 cm soil was higher than that in the 10 –20cm layer.3.9. Microbial metabolic quotientSoil microbial metabolic quotients under different N addition treat-ments were generally lower than that in the control ( Fig. 5 ), and this wassigniﬁcant for the 10 –20 cm. For the 0 –10 cm, the microbial metabolic quo-tient decreased as: CK >N2>N3>N5>N4>N1. For the 10 –20 cm, allON/IN addition treatments signi ﬁcantly decreased the soil microbial meta-bolic quotient ( p<0.05), which decreased as: CK >N3>N5>N4>N2>N1. Overall, the N1 treatment had the lowest microbial metabolic quotientat both soil depths.4. Discussion4.1. Effects of different ON/IN addition treatments on soil OC poolsIn this study, OC contents in soil and its fractions (POM and MAOM) didnot signi ﬁcantly differ among treatments despite yearly N addition with dif-ferent proportions of N ( Fig. 1 a, c, d). The addition of N with different pro-portions and forms in this study did not signi ﬁcantly alter annual netprimary productivity [29] and the mineralization of soil OC and this mayexplain the lacking effect on OC contents ( Fig. 4 ), which contradicted ourﬁrst hypothesis. Previous studies have reported inconsistent effects of N ad-dition on OC, with N addition increasing, decreasing, or having no effect onsoil OC contents [20,30,31] . These inconsistent results might be due to thedifference between ecosystems, the levels of N application, and the dura-tion of N application [32]. In terrestrial ecosystems, plant roots and litterare the main sources of soil OC [33], and N addition can potentially in-crease plant aboveground biomass and decrease root competition for avail-able nutrients, affecting soil C inputs [34].Am e t a - a n a l y s i ss h o w e dt h a tNstimulation of C storage occurred primarily in plant pools but little in soilpools [35], which may explain why soil OC content was not affected by Naddition in our study.4.2. Effects of different ON/IN addition treatments on mass distribution of soilfractionsOur results showed that N addition increased the percentage of POMand N1 and N2 treatments had the strongest impact on the POM percentageincrease ( Fig. 2 ). MAOM fraction tended to give way to the POM fraction inthe 0 –10 cm and N1 addition more strongly promoted the C of both frac-tions ( Figs. 2 and 3 ), which aligns with several other N addition studies[15,19,36] . Recently, Ye et al. [37] proposed a new conceptual frameworkthat integrates plant, microbial and geochemical mechanisms to reconcileFig. 2.

Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 1599195diverse and contrasting impacts of N on soil C, showing that the C in POM isprimarily controlled by plant input, while the C in MAOM is determined bymicrobial biomass/necromass and interactions between the organic C andsoil minerals. MAOM was the dominant fraction, accounting for 67 % and80 % in the 0 –10 cm and 10 –20 cm soil respectively ( Fig. 2 ), which agreeswith previous studies showing that a large portion of the OC in soil was as-sociated with soil minerals [36,38] . There are two possible reasons forthese results: Firstly, N addition stimulated the aboveground and litter bio-mass [29], and N1 has the strongest effect in all treatments and is signi ﬁ-cantly higher than CK. The increased POM fraction under IN addition islikely due to the stimulation of aboveground plant C input. Secondly, IN ad-dition can alter the relative changes in proportions of POM and MAOM [13,37].Our results showed that OC in POM was more sensitive to N additionthan that in MAOM ( Table 2 ), which was in line with results from previousstudies [16,19,39] showing that the POM fraction was more vulnerable toenvironmental changes, such as N deposition. In addition, the N1 treatmenthad the strongest impact on OC in both POM and MOAM fractionscompared with other N addition treatments, indicating that mineral N addi-tion increases C of both fractions ( Fig. 1 andFig. 4 ). For the 10 –20 cm, thesensitivity differed for the two fractions ( Table 2 ), which may result fromless impact of the deeper soil layer from plant responses to N addition.4.3. Soil OC mineralizationPrevious studies have shown that N addition can lead to soil acidi ﬁca-tion, reduce microbial growth, and reduce soil respiration [19,40] .I nt h i sstudy, the inhibitory effect of N addition on soil respiration was observed(Fig. 5 ). Two reasons may explain the results. Firstly, the relative availabil-ity of C and N affects the ratio of fungi to bacteria, which probably exhibitssystematic differences in growth rate, biomass turnover, and C utilizationefﬁciency [41,42] . Secondly, soil pH decreased signi ﬁcantly under N1treatment in our experiment [29]. Soil pH has an opposing effect on thegrowth of fungi and bacteria [43], which may lead to the inhibition of mi-crobial respiration. In addition, Chen et al. [44] found that soil acidi ﬁcationafter adding IN exerts a greater control on soil respiration than soil NFig. 3. Effects of different ON/IN addition treatments on organic carbon fractions.

Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 1599196availability when subjected to long-term N enrichment. The close relation-ship between soil pH and soil respiration can also explain why the topsoil C0under N1 treatment was the lowest in our study ( Table 3 ), and the inhibi-tory effect of IN on soil respiration was higher than that of ON ( Fig. 4 ).The microbial metabolic quotient is the ratio of basal respiration to mi-crobial biomass, which is an indicator of the activity level of the microbialcommunity [45]. With a higher microbial metabolic quotient, the carbondioxide emission per unit of biomass will be higher and the carbon use ef-ﬁciency will be lower [46]. Our results indirectly indicated that N additiondecreased the microbial utilization ef ﬁciency of soil OC ( Fig. 5 ). Comparedwith other treatments, the N1 treatment had the lowest microbial meta-bolic quotient in both soil depths ( Fig. 5 ), indicating that IN additionwould be bene ﬁcial to soil OC sequestration. These results support our ﬁnd-ings that the cumulative soil respiration was reduced with IN addition(Fig. 4 ), because IN may inhibit soil microbial activities.In general, our mineralization-related results showed that IN additioninhibited soil OC mineralization and was conducive to grassland soil carbonsequestration. This may be attributed to promoted soil acidi ﬁcation, whichcould directly or indirectly affect soil carbon use ef ﬁciency and communitycomposition under continuous N addition [37,47] . Other reports concludethat IN addition may inhibit the activity of enzymes related to organic de-composition [9,48,49] , which may also explain the inhibition of soil OCmineralization by the addition of IN.The results imply that although the added different types of N did notsigniﬁcantly alter soil OC contents, long-term nitrogen (N) addition can af-fect soil organic carbon pool within different soil fractions with differentturnover rates and reduce OC decomposition, which further affects OC sta-bilization in grassland soil. For understanding the microbial mechanisms ofthe in ﬂuence of added N on the soil OC pool distribution and stabilization,future research should include an in-depth study of the effects of N additionon soil enzyme activity and microbial community.5. ConclusionsSoil OC contents were not signi ﬁcantly affected by different forms of Naddition in our experiment. For different soil C fractions, IN addition signif-icantly increased the C in both POM and MAOM fractions compared withthe control and the IN addition alone had a stronger effect. Moreover, N ad-dition reduced the microbial metabolic quotient and soil OC mineraliza-tion. Overall, although the short-term (5-years) N addition had nosigniﬁcant effect on soil OC, the C distribution of soil fractions and OC min-eralization was strongly affected by IN addition. Our results suggest that in-stead of considering a single source of N (organic or inorganic), both Ntypes should be considered when assessing the responses of grassland soilC cycling to globally increasing N deposition in a long-term perspective.CRediT authorship contribution statementMenghan Wang: Experiment implement, Data curation, Writing originaldraft.Fucui Li: Methodology, Reviewing and Editing.Lili Dong: Conceptualization, Experiment design.Xiang Wang: Methodology, Reviewing and Editing.Liebao Han: Methodology and Reviewing.Jørgen E.
