Here weanalyzed factors that may affect CO 2production from SIC after Nfertilization: (1) buffering capacity of soil organic matter (SOM) andof clays, (2) increasing crop growth and C input belowground by Nfertilization, (3) acidity localization at the fertilization point, (4) SIClocalization in the sub ‐soil, (5) application of CaO and basic slaginstead of lime, (6) inability of farmers in low income countries toapply lime. We conclude that our previous estimation of CO2fluxesfrom carbonates by N fertilization (7.5 ×1012g C year‐1) and fromliming of acidic soils (273 ×1012g C year‐1) is possibly an underesti-mation and consequently, the contribution of SIC to atmosphericCO 2is more important than previously thought.CO 2production from soil inorganic carbon (SIC) by neutralizationof nitrogen (N) fertilization ‐induced acidity is globally relevant, butup to now was not considered as a CO 2source. We analyzed indetail the seven factors mentioned by Datta and Mandal (2018) tohone our estimation of CO 2efflux from SIC (Zamanian, Zarebanadk-ouki, & Kuzyakov, 2018).SOM and clays buffer the acidity only in soils with pH below 6.5—the soils without carbonates. The increased belowground C inputby N fertilization can only be of very minor importance because theportion of belowground allocated C decreases with N availability(Figure 1) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) in most soils is understeady state. Consequently, the increase of root biomass by N fertil-ization is less than that of the shoots, because of decreasing root /shoot ratio. So, despite root C contributes 2.5 –3.0 times more to theSOM formation (Rasse, Rumpel, & Dignac, 2005), the relativeincrease of root biomass is of minor importance. Further, the root /shoot ratio will decrease in future because the breeding is mainlyaimed on the grain yield.FIGURE 1 Belowground C allocation by Lolium perennedepending on N fertilization. The contribution of CO 2assimilated byplants to SOM formation mentioned by Datta and Mandal (2018) —about 1/3 of plant ‐assimilated C —is strongly overestimated. Weagree that about 20% –33% of assimilated C will be allocatedbelowground by grasses or agricultural cereals (Pausch & Kuzyakov,2018), but: (1) the C input into the soil is much larger than itscontribution to SOM formation, because most of the root ‐derived Cwill be decomposed to CO2, and (2) the portion of assimilated Cstrongly decreases with N fertilization. Therefore, only a small partof the belowground allocated C contributes to SOM formation:According to the review of (Kuzyakov & Domanski, 2000), only 3.5%(wheat), 2.3% (barley), and 3.7% –4.9% (various grasses) of the plant ‐assimilated C is incorporated into SOM. From this C incorporatedinto SOM, only a delta —the increase ( Δ) of total C input by plantsinto the soil by N fertilization —should be considered. This Δis somarginal that its potential importance disappears against thebackdrop of other factors.

Furthermore, erosion (common in croplands even insemi‐arid climates) places the sub ‐soil in contact to the atmo-sphere and thus to the applied fertilizers. When SIC is present, itsamount is endlessly large compared to the applied N fertilizers(Figure 2).CaO and Ca2+‐containing slag are produced by heating CaCO 3and metal ores, respectively, at temperatures exceeding 800°C.The production of CaO and basic slag leads to CO 2emission fromCaCO 3, but in a sector other than agriculture. The area amendedwith CaO and basic slag is minimal compared to the liming area.N fertilization in low ‐income countries is very low (see the Nfertilization map: Figure 1 in Zamanian et al., 2018) and, accord-ingly, less acidification is expected. The annual release of 3.2 –7.91012g C from SIC as estimated by Perrin, Probst and Probst(2008) is based on a field trial and direct measurement of NO 3−and HCO 3−concentrations in surface water. They clearly showedthe correspondence of alkalinity neutralization in surface water(not soil) with increasing nitrate concentrations. So far, our estima-tion based on the CaCO 3distribution in soils and N fertilization isthe first approach for a global estimation of CO 2from SIC. Usingmore accurate and detailed maps accompanying local measure-ments will no doubt improve the estimation. Nonetheless, higherCO 2fluxes are expected because over ‐fertilization always takesplace and N use efficiencies at local scales are much lower thanthe assumed averages. The wetting /drying of paddy soils, fertilizersother than urea (e.g., (NH 4)2SO4, Ca(H 2PO4)2), and mineralizationof animal dung in pastures should also be included. Furthermore,not only N fertilization, but also global N pollution leads to acidifi-cation (Averill, Dietze, & Bhatnagar, 2018) and unaccounted CO 2efflux from CaCO 3. We conclude that, considering the factorsmentioned by Datta and Mandal (2018), our estimation (Zamanianet al., 2018) of CO 2fluxes from carbonates by N fertilization(7.5×1012g C year−1) and from liming of acidic soils(273 ×1012g C year−1) as accurate as it can be done to date ispossibly an underestimation.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe acknowledge German Research Foundation (DFG) for their sup-port (KU 1184 /34‐1).ORCIDKazem Zamanian http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-9251REFERENCESAverill, C., Dietze, M.

Note that pedogeniccarbonates are formed via dissolution of geogenic carbonates, that iscarbonates in parent material, and further reprecipitation ofdissolved ions (i.e., Ca2+and HCO 3−). The dissolved ions might alsobe translocated down the soil profile, whereby reprecipitation wouldtake place at horizons deeper than the original calcareous parentmaterial. About 39% and 46% of the analyzed profiles containpedogenic carbonates starting at depths of ca. 25 and 30 cm,respectively. The double line at the top shows the minimal depthand the dashed line in the middle show the average depth of theupper level of calcic horizon; both decrease with precipitation. Notethat only the upper depth of the calcic horizon is presented; allthese soils contain CaCO3at least to the parent material.
