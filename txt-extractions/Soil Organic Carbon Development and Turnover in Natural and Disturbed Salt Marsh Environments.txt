1. IntroductionSalt marshes maintain elevation in the tidal frame through rapid vertical accretion supported by efficient burial of minerals and organic matter. Soil accumulation and preservation support valuable ecosystem ser -vices (Barbier et al.,  2011) and are critical to salt marsh survival as sea-level rise (SLR; Morris et al.,  2002, 2016). Declining mineral inputs to certain marshes (Weston,  2014) place additional importance on soil organic carbon (SOC) preservation. Global climate change-induced disturbances are expected to increase SOC vulnerability to decomposition, potentially leading to marsh subsidence (Pendleton et al.,  2012; Spivak et al.,  2019). Characterizing SOC composition and reactivity and how those properties are changed by de -composition is key to predicting future marsh sustainability and carbon storage.Efficient SOC burial and preservation largely reflect high rates of primary production and slow decom-position. Under anoxic conditions of marsh soils, decomposition is often conceptualized as modified de -cay functions with labile and refractory compounds turning over on time scales of months-to-years and centuries-to-millennia, respectively (Kirwan & Mudd,  2012). Slow-cycling SOC is the critical component supporting carbon storage and elevation maintenance. It is often estimated at 10%–20% of annual organ-ic matter production and composed of macromolecules such as lignin (Kirwan & Mudd,  2012; Morris & Bowden,  1986; Schile et al.,  2014). Recent evidence that environmental constraints on microbial communi-ties limit decomposition rather than intrinsic molecular recalcitrance (Lehmann et al.,  2020; Marín-Spiotta Abstract  Salt marsh survival with sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly relies on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and preservation. Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (≤1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (δ13C), and age (F14C) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented ∼9%–17% of shallow SOC (≤26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640–9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.Plain Language Summary  Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%–17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.LUK ET AL.© 2020.

Soil organic carbon development and turnover in natural and disturbed salt marsh environments. Geophysical Research Letters, 48, e2020GL090287. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090287Received 11 AUG 2020Accepted 7 DEC 202010.1029/2020GL090287RESEARCH LETTER1 of 11Geophysical Research Letterset al.,  2014) suggests that marsh soils likely preserve a broad mixture of compounds with differing reactivi-ties. Assessing how decomposition changes the composition and reactivity of slow-cycling SOC can provide insight into controls on preservation as well as potential for loss following disturbances.Rapid SLR and certain hydrological management practices have contributed to the expansion of shallow ponds in many salt marshes (Adamowicz & Roman,  2005; Watson et  al.,  2017). While permanently in-undated ponds are natural features that can exist for decades before draining and recovering (Mariotti et al.,  2020), runaway expansion has been described as a transitional state between healthy and drowning marshes (Kirwan & Murray,  2007; Ortiz et al.,  2017). Ponds typically form following disturbances that cause marsh vegetation dieback (e.g., waterlogging) and deepen through decomposition of underlying peat (John-ston et al.,  2003; Spivak et al.,  2018). Ponds therefore offer a natural, decadal-scale experiment for evaluating how disturbances that accelerate decomposition alter slow-cycling SOC.We assessed how slow-cycling SOC composition and reactivity changes over decades-to-millennia and in response to the disturbance of ponding in a temperate salt marsh. We hypothesized that marshes bury a range of compounds with differing reactivities that derive from local production but long-term decomposi-tion results in a progressive homogenization and decrease in SOC reactivity. Further, we predicted that the disturbance of ponding accelerates decomposition-driven changes in SOC composition and reactivity. SOC reactivity, sources, and age were characterized by overlaying thermal properties and isotopic composition (δ13C, F14C). We estimated the turnover times of slow-cycling SOC by modeling changes in composition against geochronologies developed from radioisotope-based age models and SLR reconstructions.2. Methods2.1. Study SitesWe collected soil cores from three sites within the Plum Island Ecosystems – Long Term Ecological Research (PIE-LTER) domain (MA, USA; 42.74°N, −70.85°W; Figure  S1). The sites are within marshes that formed prior to European settlement (Kirwan et al., 2011) and had similar elevations (1.41–1.51 m North American Vertical Datum of 1988 [NAVD88]) and high marsh plant communities, dominated by Spartina alterniflora, S. patens, and Distichlis spicata, that are typical of New England marshes (Redfield,  1972). Permanently inundated ponds within each site had comparable depths (0.24–0.30 m) but varied in size (643–7,149 m2) and age (40–53 years; Spivak et al.,  2017, 2018). Paired soil cores were collected from the marsh platform (100 cm) and a pond (50 cm) within each site; differences in core length reflected lower surface elevations in the ponds relative to the marsh.2.2. Bulk Soil PropertiesSoil cores were sectioned at 1, 2, or 5 cm intervals, with higher resolution in the top 30 cm (supporting in-formation 2.1). Soil water content (%) and bulk density (g cm−3) were determined gravimetrically. Samples were sieved (1 mm) to remove large roots. We focused on particles (≤1 mm) passed through the sieve that are consistent with functional definitions of slow-cycling fine SOC (Bruun et al.,  2010; Hemminga et al.,  1988; Williams & Rosenheim,  2015). Samples were ball milled and ∼90% were fumed with hydrochloric acid and analyzed for bulk elemental (total organic carbon [TOC (%, kg m−3)]) and isotopic (δ13C, ‰) composition. Carbon content of the remaining 10% was estimated from a diffuse reflectance Fourier Transform Mid-in-frared spectroscopy partial least squares regression model (supporting information 2.2; Janik et al., 2007).2.3. Bulk Soil Data AnalysisWe compared bulk soil and elemental properties across three depths: (i) shallow marsh rooting zone (0–30 cm), (ii) intermediate marsh horizons (30–54 cm) that overlapped with pond surface horizons (0–24 cm), and (iii) deep marsh (54–77 cm) and pond (24–50 cm) horizons. Means and standard errors (SE) of soil properties were calculated in 6 cm increments (supporting information 2.3). Marsh and pond cores across the three sites were used as independent replicates to conduct one-way analysis of variance tests, which LUK ET AL.10.1029/2020GL0902872 of 11 19448007, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL090287 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Thermal Reactivity and Carbon Isotope MeasurementsSOC thermal properties and reactivity indices were characterized through ramped pyrolysis oxidation (RPO) for horizons representing key parts of the soil profiles, including the marsh and pond surface, base of the marsh rooting zone, and deeper horizons representing carbon buried for more than 100 years. Homog -enized samples (∼6 mg) were heated to 1,000°C at a rate of 20°C min−1 (Rosenheim et al.,  2008) and the evolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) was measured by a flow-through infrared gas analyzer. Thermograms were constructed by plotting CO 2 concentrations versus temperature (supporting information 2.5). Samples were not acidified as inorganic carbon content was <0.04% of TOC. Analyses were conducted at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (MA, USA).We further analyzed CO 2 evolved via RPO for δ13C and F14C composition (McNichol et al.,  1994; Reim-er et al.,  2004) from one representative marsh and pond site (supporting information 2.4). The CO 2 frac-tions were collected over five temperature intervals; there were three low (200°C–465°C) and two high (465°C–650°C) temperature CO 2 fractions. The isotopic composition of evolved CO 2 was analyzed for at least three of the five fractions, capturing ∼70% of TOC within a soil horizon.2.5. Thermal Reactivity and Isotope Data AnalysisWe evaluated SOC thermal reactivity within and between marsh and pond environments by calculating ratios of CO 2 evolved at low versus high temperatures (hereafter, peak ratio) and thermal activation en-ergies (supporting information 2.5). Peak ratios were determined by normalizing the area under the low (200°C–465°C) versus high (465°C–650°C) temperature peaks of the thermograms. The theoretical activa-tion energy (Ea kJ mol−1) and blank contamination correction were calculated using the Python package rampedpyrox (Hemingway et al.,  2017a, 2017b). The mean and SE of peak ratios and Ea were calculated across 25 cm increments based on elevation.2.6. Age ModelsSoil horizon ages across all sites were constrained with several inputs in order to conservatively model turnover times. Post-1900 accretion rates were calculated using 210Pb constant initial concentration (CIC) and continuous rate of supply (CRS) models with radioisotope activities measured on planar-type gam-ma counters (Canberra Inc., USA). Contemporary rates of SLR, from a local tide gauge (Boston 8443870, 2.83 ± 0.15 mm year−1), provided an age constraint for the past century based on the assumption that the marsh kept pace with SLR (Appleby & Oldfield,  1978; Pennington et al.,  1976). For pre-1900 horizons, we extended CIC-210Pb-based accretion rates deeper in the soil profile, while upper age limits were constrained with late-Holocene SLR (0.6 ± 0.1 mm year−1 and 0.9 ± 0.2 mm year−1; Engelhart et al.,  2009; Gonneea et al.,  2019), and glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm year−1; Peltier et al.,  2015). Age models were not de -veloped for the ponds due to the violation of steady-state assumptions as 210Pb inventories suggested erosion (supporting information 2.6).2.7. Soil Turnover ModelsWe estimated turnover times of fine SOC in the marsh platform using a depth-for-time substitution where downcore changes in carbon concentration were modeled against geochronology. First, across all marsh sites, a one-pool model captured changes in total fine SOC concentrations and a two-pool model was devel-oped from persistent low-temperature and high-temperature thermogram peaks. We expanded to a five-pool model based on thermal and isotopic data at one site suggesting at least five compositionally distinct SOC LUK ET AL.10.1029/2020GL0902873 of 11 19448007, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL090287 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

For the two-pool and five-pool models, carbon concentrations within each consecutive pool were de -fined as the amount of CO 2 evolved over discrete increasing temperature intervals within the thermogram.initial,iinitial,i rootrootifiUUt U t t tt   (1) d 1for 1:diiiixti Ut xtt    (2)     111d 11for 1:diii i iiixti Ut r x t xtt       (3)Turnover in the first pool (i = 1) is described as first-order kinetics dictated by the carbon concentration of the pool (x) at a given time obtained from the age models (t), linear input (U) during the time within the rooting zone (t root), and turnover time (τ; Equations  1 and 2; Manzoni et al.,  2009). Subsequent pools (i > 1) are a linear series, where a fraction (r i−1) of decomposed material from the previous pool is transferred to the next pool (Equation  3). For further details on SOC turnover model parameterization, see supporting information 2.7.3. Results3.1. Bulk Soil PropertiesBulk soil properties changed with depth and differed between the marsh and ponds. In the marsh, water and TOC content (% and kg m−3) decreased while bulk density increased with depth (Figure  1). Pond soil properties were less variable across depths, with the exception of TOC (%) which decreased slightly. Marsh soils were generally drier and had higher bulk densities than the ponds (Figures  1a and 1b , Table  S1). Marsh and pond soils had similar TOC densities (kg m−3), except in pond surface horizons where lower concentra-tions reflected lower bulk densities (Figure  1d, Table  S1). Bulk TOC content informed the one-pool turnover model.3.2. SOC ReactivityThere was a bimodal distribution of CO 2 evolved during RPO with low (371°C ± 4°C) and high (530°C ± 4°C) temperature peaks separated by a minimum at 465.5°C ± 2.4°C (Figures  2a–2g). Peak ratios decreased while Ea increased with depth in marsh soils (Figures  2h and 2i), indicating a shift toward lower thermal reactivi-ty. Pond surface horizons had lower peak ratios and higher Ea values than the marsh (∼1.2 m NAVD88), but the reactivity indices converged toward similar values in both environments at ∼1 m elevation (Figures  2h and 2i, Table  S2). The bimodal thermogram distribution across soil depths suggests the presence of at least two distinct fine SOC pools and was the basis of the two-pool turnover model.3.3. SOC Sources and AgesThe δ13C-CO 2 values associated with different temperature intervals spanned a wider range than bulk SOC (Figure  3). The δ13C-CO 2 of the low-temperature peak (−15.5  ±  0.2‰) was similar to bulk soils (−15.0 ± 0.3‰), while the high-temperature peak was more enriched (−13.8 ± 0.2‰). These data are con-sistent with emergent grasses as the main carbon source to marsh and pond soils (Spivak & Ossolinski,  2016) with variation between peaks suggesting differences in molecular composition (Benner et al., 1987).Radiocarbon (F14C) values were highest in CO 2 fractions evolved at lower temperatures, reflecting more modern inputs, and decreased with higher temperatures (Figure  3, Table  S5). This trend was clearest within the marsh (0–26 cm) and pond surface horizons (0–2 cm), where modern values were expected. These data indicate that old, marsh derived, and thermally stable carbon represent substantial components (9%–17%) LUK ET AL.10.1029/2020GL0902874 of 11 19448007, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL090287 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Overlaid thermal reactivity, source, and age data point to at least five compositionally distinct fine SOC pools and were the basis of the five-pool turnover model.3.4. Soil Age ModelsMean soil accretion rates from the CRS and CIC models for contemporary (post-1900s) deposition were 4.64 ± 0.38 mm year−1 and 2.47 ± 0.39 mm year−1, respectively (Luk et al.,  2020; Table  S3). Horizons deeper than 28 cm reached the limitation of 210Pb dating (pre-1900s). Conservative age estimates for the deepest horizon (80 cm) ranged from 219 years to 1,194 years (Table S4).3.5. Marsh SOC Turnover ModelsThe one-pool model, based on TOC content, yielded a best fit turnover time of 750 years (Figure  4a). This was similar to rates calculated from the two-pool model, which was based on the low-temperature and high-temperature peaks in the RPO thermograms (640 and 1,251, respectively; Figure  4b, Table  S6). The five-pool model, based on geochemical composition (Figure  3), captured a broader distribution of turnover times, ranging from 1,011 years to 9,951 years, with generally faster rates for the first and second pools (Figure  4c, Table  S6). Fitting one-pool and two-pool models across the three marsh sites resulted in similar goodness-of-fit statistics, which were higher than the five-pool model at the one marsh site; this was due, in part, to lower data densities (Table S6). These results highlight the continuum of fine SOC turnover times.LUK ET AL.10.1029/2020GL0902875 of 11Figure 1.

Discussion4.1. SOC CompositionSoils in this New England salt marsh buried compounds with a range of thermal properties and δ13C values indicating that they derived from marsh grasses (Figures  2 and 3; Spivak & Ossolinski,  2016). The wider range of δ13C-CO 2 measured across the thermograms, compared to bulk soils, likely reflects differences in the isotopic composition of compounds synthesized by marsh grasses (Figure  3). For instance, S. alterniflora is rich in cellulose and hemicellulose (∼70%, −11.5‰) with lower levels of lignin (4%–9%, −17.4‰) and other compounds, such as lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids (∼22%, −16.2‰; Figures  2 and 3; Benner et al.,  1987). Compounds in this latter group are likely decomposed rapidly, with contributions attenuating with depth. The δ13C-CO 2 values suggest that there was not a clear separation between compound classes across temperature intervals, potentially reflecting overlapping thermal properties as well as microbial re -working and aggregate formation (Figure  3; Bruun et al.,  2010). Work in terrestrial soils consistently shows an enrichment in δ13C of 2‰–4‰ along gradients of increasing decomposition (Sollins et al., 2006) and thermal stability (Sanderman & Grandy,  2020). It is unlikely that measured δ13C-CO 2 values are methodo -logical artifacts, as they spanned a greater range than predicted by kinetic fractionation and enrichment did not increase monotonically with temperature (Figure  3; Hemingway et al.,  2017b). This result highlights that thermal properties provide an index of reactivity that may not reflect bioavailability, which depends on environmental conditions, among other factors (Bulseco et al., 2019, 2020; Lehmann et al., 2020).Although salt marshes are efficient carbon sinks, SOC stocks are spatially heterogeneous (Ouyang & Lee,  2014). Compared to this New England marsh, thermogram complexity, TOC%, and Ea were lower in a Gulf of Mexico marsh with similar grass communities (Williams & Rosenheim,  2015).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseGeophysical Research Lettersto these differences are unclear but applying thermal and isotopic characterization approaches more broad-ly may provide insight into controls on marsh SOC preservation (Lehmann et al., 2020).The F14C values within and across depth horizons reveal multiple processes contributing to marsh soil de -velopment (Figures  3a–3e). In shallow horizons (0–26 cm), new production was an important component of lower temperature CO 2 fractions while F14C values of <1 at higher temperatures suggest either redeposition of eroded creekbank carbon or microbial recycling (Figures  3a and 3b). The effects of microbial reworking on F14C are likely minor in surface horizons, due to rapid vertical accretion (Table  S3). This relatively old, thermally stable fraction represents ∼9% of surface (0–2 cm) and 17% of deeper (24–26 cm) SOC, which is consistent with previous estimates based on creekbank erosion in this system (Figures  3a and 3b; Hopkin-son et al.,  2018). Since redistribution of previously buried soils contributes to accretion, current SOC storage estimates are likely upwardly biased. Redeposition of eroded soils may become increasingly important in maintaining marsh elevation with SLR (Hughes et al., 2009) and accounting for spatial recycling of carbon will be key for refining carbon budgets.4.2. SOC Turnover Under Natural ConditionsMarsh soil profiles are consistent with long-term alteration due to decomposition, rather than changes in autochthonous versus allochthonous inputs. Increasing bulk densities and decreasing water and TOC content below the rooting zone (0–28  cm) suggest loss of organic matter, compaction, and dewatering (Figure  1). Decreasing thermal reactivity with depth (Figures  2h and 2i) coincided with a small δ13C-CO 2 enrichment across CO 2 fractions (Figures  3a–3e). It is difficult to ascertain whether the preferential loss of specific compounds (i.e., Benner et  al.,  1987) or microbial reworking and development of microbial derived residues contributes to δ13C-CO 2 enrichment and homogenization of F14C values with increasing soil depth (Figure  3, Gleixner et al.,  2002; Trumbore,  1997, 2009). Transitions in dominant vegetation as -sociated with ecosystem evolution (Kirwan et al.,  2011) would have a small effect on our results since S. alterniflora, S. patens, and D. spicata have similar biochemical compositions (Cristina et al.,  2018; Haddad & Martens,  1987; Wilson et al.,  1986). Thus, the anoxic environment of marsh soils enhances preservation but does not completely inhibit microbial alteration of SOC.Quantifying SOC loss alongside geochronometers can constrain turnover times that are difficult to measure experimentally. The best fit rates from the one-pool, two-pool, and five-pool models span a broader range (640–9,951 years; Figure  4, Table  S6) than applied by some marsh evolution models (200–1,000 years; Day et al.,  1999; Kirwan & Mudd,  2012). Our one-pool model describes continuous loss of SOC, while the five-pool model predicts accumulation of the more thermally stable SOC, due to slower turnover and increased transfer (r i−1) over time (Figure  4, Table  S6). The five-pool model therefore describes important mechanisms contributing to SOC preservation and marsh elevation gain that are not captured by the one-pool model. The two-pool model offers a compromise between the simple and more complex model, as it captures a thermal-ly stable pool, which turns over 49% slower than the more reactive pool and 40% slower than the one-pool model (Table  S6). Expanding ecosystem evolution models to include different turnover rates of fine SOC pools has the potential to improve predictions of marsh persistence, in the absence of disturbances.4.3. Disturbances Alter SOC ReactivityDecades following emergent grass dieback and submergence led to pond surface soils with different charac-teristics than the adjacent marsh. Collapse of marsh grass roots and water infilling of pore spaces contrib -uted to higher water content, lower bulk densities, and initial subsidence (Figure  1, Chambers et al.,  2019). Pond surface soils characterized with F14C < 1 and δ13C values similar to marsh soils at the same eleva-tion (1.17 m; Figures  3b and 3f ) are consistent with limited accumulation of recent production from sub -merged plant and algal communities and imply that ponds do not trap exported detritus (Figure  3; Spivak et al.,  2017). Moreover, the convergence in marsh and pond SOC reactivity at depth (<1 m NAVD88) (Fig -ure 2) supports our comparative approach.LUK ET AL.10.1029/2020GL0902878 of 11 19448007, 2021, 2, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL090287 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Conditions favoring decomposition are con-fined to surface horizons due to limited gas diffusion and inhibition of bioturbating fauna by nighttime hy -poxia (Spivak et al.,  2017). Accordingly, Ea was greater in pond surface horizons than in deeper layers, and compared to the marsh at similar elevations (Figure  2i), but converged at depth (<1 m NAVD88) with the surrounding marsh. Progressive δ13C-CO 2 enrichment with depth suggests that microbial reworking still oc-curs under less favorable, waterlogged conditions, but with limited effects on thermal reactivity (Figures  1a, 2h, 2i, and 3f–3i). Disturbances leading to pond formation therefore facilitated loss and shifts toward lower thermal reactivity of surface SOC, which could potentially slow progressive deepening.5. ConclusionsWe identified at least five geochemically distinct fine SOC pools (Figure  3), suggesting that slow-cycling marsh organic matter is more complex than typically conceptualized. By modeling downcore changes in fine SOC against soil geochronometers, we generated some of the first empirical estimates of turnover times (Figure  4). Carbon reactivity, source, and age described multiple processes contributing to soil develop -ment: new production, erosion and redeposition, and microbial reworking. Long-term decomposition and disturbances that accelerate decomposition (e.g., ponding) result in an accumulation of SOC with lower thermal reactivity. Further characterization of molecular composition within abiotic (e.g., redox) and biotic (e.g., microbial communities and carbon use efficiency) contexts may improve understanding of controls on decomposition and spatial variability in marsh SOC storage (Spivak et al.,  2019). Broader application of these geochemical approaches has potential to enhance understanding of preservation under different environmental settings and inform marsh ecosystem evolution models and service valuation.Data Availability StatementData are archived at BCO-DMO.org (Spivak,  2020a, 2020b , 2020c, 2020d) and sciencebase.gov (Luk et al., 2020).ReferencesAdamowicz, S.
