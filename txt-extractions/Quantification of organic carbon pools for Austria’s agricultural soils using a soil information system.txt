H., Strebl, F., Tulipan, M. and Schwarz, S. 2005. Quantification of organic carbon pools for Austria’s agricul-tural soils using a soil information system. Can. J. Soil Sci. 85: 491–498. Within the framework of the project “Austrian CarbonBalance Model”, we estimated soil organic carbon (OC) content for the agricultural land of Austria. The basic chemical and phys -ical data were obtained from the national electronic soil information system BORIS (Boden Rechnergestütztes InformtionsSystem). The latter data were obtained through soil surveys performed over the past 10 yr. The BORIS data were corrected for so ilgravel content, bulk densities and differences in chemical analytical methods used for soil OC. Our estimation also showed the fol-lowing ranking for soil OC content (0–50 cm) under different land use systems: vineyards (57.6 t C ha–1) ~ cropland (59.5 t Cha–1) < orchards/gardenland (78 t C ha–1) ~ intensive grassland (81 t C ha–1) < extensive grassland (119 t C ha–1). Although themain portion of soil carbon is stored in topsoils (0–20 cm) in all land-use classes, deeper soil layers (20–50 cm) contribute s ignif-icantly to the overall inventory (between 18. 2 and 27.2 t C ha–1), but appear to be less influenced by land use. A total OC storagein Austria’s agricultural soils of 284 Mt was estimated. A west–east gradient of OC storage in agricultural soils of different FederalProvinces was observed. Under Austrian conditions, extensively used grassland plays an important role for OC-storage. Wide C:Nratios in these soils suggest accumulation of poorly humified organic material and slow OC turnover.Key words : Carbon sequestration, soil organic matter, soil humus, soil nitrogen content, C:N ratioGerzabek, M.

Dans le cadre du projet « modèle d’équili-bre autrichien du carbone », les auteurs ont estimé la concentration de carbone organique (CO) dans les sols agricoles d’Autrich e.Les données chimiques et physiques nécessaires à l’exercice ont été extraites du système électronique national d’information su rles sols BORIS (Boden Rechnergestütztes Informtions System). Les données physiques émanent de levés effectués au cours desdix dernières années. Les données de BORIS ont été corrigées d’après la teneur en gravier, la masse volumique apparente et lesdiverses méthodes d’analyse chimique employées pour doser le CO. Les estimations révèlent le classement suivant selon la con-centration de CO (de 0 à 50 cm de profondeur) dans les sols agricoles à vocation variable : vignobles (57,6 t de C par hectare) ~terres cultivées (59,5 t de C par hectare) < vergers/jardins (78 t de C par hectare) ~ pâturages intensifs (81 t de C par hectare)  <pâturages extensifs (119 t de C par hectare). Bien que la majeure partie du carbone du sol se retrouve en surface (0 à 20 cm), pe uimporte la vocation des terres, les couches plus profondes (de 20 à 50 cm) en renferment aussi une quantité significative (de 18 ,2à 27,2 t de C par hectare), mais paraissent moins affectées par le mode d’exploitation des terres. Les auteurs situent la quanti tétotale de CO stockée dans les sols agricoles autrichiens à 284 Mt. On observe un gradient ouest-est des réserves de CO dans lessols agricoles des provinces de la fédération. En Autriche, les pâturages extensifs jouent un rôle important dans le stockage d u CO.Les hauts ratios C:N du sol laissent supposer l’accumulation de matière organique mal humifiée et un lent renouvellement du C.Mots clés : Séquestration du carbone, matière organique du sol, humus, teneur en azote du sol, ratio C:NSoil has a large number of essential functions, for example, forthe environment (protection function) and human nutrition(production function). Most of the soil’s functions are signifi-cantly influenced by the quantity and quality of soil organicmatter (SOM). For example, SOM is essential for soil organ-isms and their diversity, plant nutrition, water-holding capaci-ty, aggregate stability and erosion control. Soil managementand land-use significantly influence SOM content and quality,which has been demonstrated in numerous publications (e.g.,Machado and Gerzabek 1993; Novotny et al. 1999; Gerzabeket al. 2002). This implies the need for detailed investigationswhen evaluating the present SOM status of soils under differ-Abbrevations : AAD , average absolute deviation; ACBM ,Austrian carbon balance model; OC, organic carbon; SOM ,soil organic matter491ent land use, and especially their potential to sustainably storeadditional carbon. It is widely recognised that soil texturethrough physical protection of SOM against decomposition isa key factor governing SOM turnover (e.g., Körschens andWaldschmidt 1995; Aita et al. 1997). Additionally, the chem-ical nature of SOM, e.g., hydrophobicity, linked to the amountof aliphatic compounds, contributes significantly to its stabili-ty against decomposition (Augris et al. 1998; Spaccini et al.Can. J. Soil. Sci. Downloaded from cdnsciencepub.com by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIV on 03/21/23 For personal use only. 492 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE2002). However, in most cases this information is not avail-able on a broad scale, or is incomplete. First assessments of theSOM status of a large region, therefore, need to be restrictedto quantitative measures based on carbon stocks and theirregional distribution.In the framework of the project “Austrian CarbonBalance Model, (ACBM)” (Orthofer et al. 2000) estimatesof pool sizes of organic carbon stored within agriculturalcropland and grassland soils of Austria, as a baseline for1990, were needed. The main goal of this project was toestablish a dynamic model simulating the fluxes and poolsof carbon within Austrian agricultural systems. The overallmodel covers the energy sector, the production and con-sumption sector, and waste management. Within the project,a full national carbon balance was calculated and subse-quently net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere. Using theACBM it was shown that the net emission, expressed inCO2equivalents, calculated using a full carbon account areapproximately 13% lower than the emission values derivedfrom calculation according to the IPCC emission guidelines.The major contributions to this difference were the effect ofC-sequestration in agricultural products and forest soils andbalances of C input and C output from the system.The soil organic carbon model implemented in the AGROmodule of ACBM was adopted from Jenkinson and Rayner(1977). It has to deal with different organic inputs (harvestresidues, sewage sludge, compost, farm yard manure, etc.).A large proportion of these inputs is very labile, decomposi-tion is fast and their C is released into the atmosphere with-in a period of less than a year. The remaining fraction oforganic inputs is directly distributed into three different soilpools with specific residence times. The rather small num-ber of compartments and simple structure of the ACBM soilmodel are seen as a minimum to facilitate estimation of soilcarbon dynamics and to represent modifications of theseprocesses by changing agricultural practice and addition oforganic amendments. On the other hand, a restriction ofparameters and high aggregation of results were needed,because ACBM is a model for the whole carbon systemwithin Austria, containing all sectors like industry, waste,traffic/energy, forest, and agriculture. Calculated carbonstocks for different land use classes were assumed to be inan equilibrium condition. They were used as initial valuesfor the ACBM soil model.In the present paper, we describe and present a method toestimate soil organic carbon stocks in soils under differentland use across the federal provinces of Austria.MATERIALS AND METHODSInput Data The calculations of carbon stocks in Austrian soils werebased on soil survey data from most federal provinces ofAustria, which are made available in the nation-wide soilinformation system BORIS by the Austrian EnvironmentAgency. This information system contains more than 1.5 ×106soil data from more than 40 different surveys and from15 different sources (Schwarz et al. 2001). The data setscover more than 10 000 sites in Austria.Organic carbon contents available in BORIS were used.They originate from soil surveys of federal provinces and aremeasured by different methods. The sampling grid was dif-ferent in the federal provinces. In Lower Austria, UpperAustria and Carinthia, the basic grid is 2.75 times 2.75 km, inBurgenland and Styria 3.9 times 3.9 km and in Salzburg andTyrol it is 4 times 4 km. The sampling itself was performedaccording to the methods provided by Blum et al. (1989).Sampling sites are exactly marked in 1:10 000 maps. In mostcases the following sampling procedure was followed: foursoil profiles were dug within a 20-m diameter circle. From thedepth layers of 0–20, 20–40, 40–50 cm (arable land) or 0–5,5–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–50 cm (grassland) composite sam-ples were obtained and analyzed according to standard proce-dures (Blum et al. 1989). Data for federal provinces not yetcovered by BORIS were extracted from printed reports(Lower Austria, Salzburg, Carinthia) or estimated fromneighbouring Provinces (as was the case in Vienna andVorarlberg). Survey data originate from 1988 to 1993, thusthey are assumed to be representative for the baseline year1990, which we used for our Austrian Carbon BalanceModel. The results for the Provinces covered by the Borisdatabase are summarized in Table 1. The nitrogen inventorieswere calculated from the data collected by Njegic (2001)from Austrian soil inventories. Additional Information Needed for Pool SizeDerivationThe soil bulk density and the gravel content vary considerablyin Austrian agricultural soils. For example, in Carinthia, analpine province (Amt der Kärntner Landesregierung 1999),12.9% of cropland soils (0–20 cm) show gravel contentsabove 20%; for the 50–70 cm soil depth, 43.8% of soils hadgravel contents above 20%; in grassland, 9.9% of topsoil (0–5cm) had greater than 20% gravel contents, whereas 61.7% ofdeeper grassland soil layers (50–70 cm) contained more than20% gravel. In alpine pasture soils (0–5 cm), 23.1% of sam-ples had values > 20% gravel content, and for deeper layers(50–70 cm) 90% of soils had values > 20% gravel content.These figures are considerably higher than values reported forthe province of Upper Austria with less alpine influence:median value of gravel content in cropland soils amounted to0% (for 0–20, 20–40, 40–60 cm depth layers). For grasslandsoils the corresponding value is 5% (for all depth layers) (Amtder Oberösterreichischen Landesregierung 1993). In the sameinvestigation for the bulk densities of cropland soils (0–20cm) an average of 1.35 ± 0.13 g cm–3is reported (range 0.53–1.65); for grassland soils (0–10 cm) the average amounted to1.01 ± 0.22 g cm–3(range 0.23–1.49).Correction procedures were applied to decrease theuncertainties related to different analytical methods fordetermination of soil organic carbon. The soil inventorieswere performed by different federal provinces. Thus, insome data sets not all necessary information was available;data had to be derived from literature or empirical estima-tions.(i)Soil bulk density : We used data from soil surveys wherethis parameter had been included (e.g., Upper Austria):Can.

GERZABEK ET AL. — ORGANIC CARBON POOLS IN AUSTRIA’S SOILS 493For those Provinces where data about texture were miss-ing, we have chosen the approach of Körschens andWaldschmidt (1995) for estimation. They made regressionanalyses with an extended data set and found a correlationof 0.95 between OC content and soil bulk density.(ii)Gravel content : As carbon determination is carried out infine soil (< 2 mm) the gravel content is not taken intoaccount in the OC values (%). The soil bulk density refersto bulk soil, i.e., including gravel. Therefore, density valueswere corrected for the gravel content (which was assumedto be OC free). Gravel data were taken from available soilsurvey data and/or estimated from relevant literature.Selection of Data SetsWe applied the following criteria to select data sets fromBORIS: (i) Method of OC analysis (only data derived by wet oxida-tion or elemental analyzer were used).(ii) Soil depth (sampled depth increments). Unusual depthincrements, analysed in the framework of special pro-jects and not in the course of the soil surveys wereexcluded from this study.(iii)Land use (categories included were cropland, exten-sively and intensively managed grassland, vineyards,orchards, gardenland). This information is included inthe BORIS data bank for the date of soil sampling. Correcting Methodological Differences forMeasuring Soil OCDifferences in OC determination methods were observedbetween the data sets of different soil surveys of Austrianfederal provinces based on OC determination by wet oxida-tion without additional heating and dry oxidation in an ele-mental analyzer. The first method is known to yield lowerOC values for higher SOM levels when compared with thecombustion method (Mutsch 1994, Fig. 1). Correction fac-Table 1.

The following factors were used:up to 3% C: 1.13; 3–7% C: 1.20; 7–9% C: 1.24; 9–12% C:1.3; 12–14% C: 1.35; > 15% C: 1.40. Correction values beyond 7% OC were extrapolated fromthe linear regression line of Fig. 1. The latter approachaffected only a small number of values (228 out of 3726,i.e., 6.1%). Statistics and Calculation Procedures Analysis of the data sets showed that the distribution of OCcontent (%) within selected groups is mostly non-normaland biased towards lower OC contents (Fig. 2). Thus, toobtain unbiased estimates, median values (˜ x) and the aver-age absolute deviation (AAD, Sachs 1993) from medianwere calculated (see Table 1).(1)For calculations of OC stored in a given soil layer, weight-ed averages of depth layers were calculated to receive val-ues for the depth increments 0–20 cm and 20–50 cm fromeach federal province. The content of soil OC in tonnes perhectare was calculated as follows:OC (%; t t–1) ×soil density (t m–3) ×soil depth (m) = OC (t ha–1)Calculation of average values (t ha–1) of different land useclasses was performed by weighting according to the area ofthe federal provinces within a respective land use class in1990 in relation to the total agricultural land within Austria(BMLF 1999). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRegional differences in OC concentrations within a givenland-use class are less pronounced (Table 1), than differ-ences between land-use classes. Examples from Styria, andUpper Austria are given in Fig. 3, illustrating that soilsunder alpine grassland exhibit higher OC values than soilsunder intensively used grassland or cropland. At least in thecase of Styria, confidence intervals (whisker lines) of crop-land and alpine meadow soils do not overlap, which provesthe statistical significance of differences. These differencesalso exist for OC stocks (Table 2). A further statisticalanalysis for OC stocks of land-use classes is not possible,because for the derivation of stocks a number of weighingprocedures (sampling depth, aerial extension of federalprovinces within Austria) and assumptions (see Materialsand Methods Section) had to be made. Land-use classes canbe ranked according to their average OC contents (0–50 cm)as follows: vineyards (57.6 t C ha–1) ~ cropland (59.5 t Cha–1) < orchards/gardenland (78 t C ha–1) ~ intensive grass-land (81 t C ha–1) < extensive grassland (119 t C ha–1). The ranking obtained clearly reflects the balance betweenorganic matter input by plant residues and possibly organicmanures, mineralization, erosion and soil deposition.Generally, the major portion of OC is stored in topsoils(0–20 cm) in all land-use classes. Variability of median val-ues increase from cropland/vineyards to grassland andorchards/extensive grassland. Deeper soil layers (20–50 cm)show significantly lower carbon contents. When comparingthe subsoil C-inventories under different land use, smallerdifferences were obtained than for the topsoil layers. Thisindicates that subsoil C is influenced by the present land use,but less so when compared with the topsoil. Recently, Cstratification has been suggested as an indicator of soilecosystem function and especially for the detection of man-agement-induced changes (Franzlübbers 2002). Theobserved ratio between OC contents of topsoil and subsoilcould provide information about the status of a given sitewith respect to OC increase or decrease after changing theland use. Calculating the stratification ratio (quotient of OCinventories in the 0–20 cm and 20–50 cm layers) providedthe following ranking: vineyards (2.15) < cropland (2.27) <orchards/gardenland (2.71) < intensive grassland (2.95) <extensive grassland (3.75). Those land-use classes exhibit-ing the lowest ratios seem to have the largest potential forSOC sequestration. Of course, the site-specific potential ofa soil to store organic carbon, governed for example by claycontent, which influences the size of the physically protect-ed organic matter pool, also has to be taken into account(Körschens et al. 1998). The stratification ratio seems tohave potential as an indicator for the potential to increasetotal SOC stocks, but its general applicability needs to beevaluated on a broader scale.wet oxidation (% Corg)012345 67combusted (% C org)01234567Corg < 3% (  )y = 1.14x (r2=0.66)all dat a:95% confidence         interval1 : 1y = 1.20x (r2=0.89 )Fig. 1.

Figure 4 shows that in the federalprovinces, OC contents in topsoils increase from the easternto the western part of Austria. The overall C stocks alsoincrease according to this pattern (not shown). This is due tothe decrease of cropland areas from east to west, which fol-lows the climatic gradient from a dry, pannonian climate tohumid conditions. It is interesting to note that even withincroplands we observed an east–west gradient (Fig. 4). Thiscan be explained by the use of ley farming in the westernfederal provinces, where cropland and grassland are rotatedevery few years.

Agriculture in the easternprovinces (Lower Austria, Burgenland) is dominated bycropland, ley farming is not usual there.The estimated total amount of OC stored in the 0–50 cmlayer in the agricultural soils of Austria is 284 Mt (Table 2).Of this amount, 42% is located in soils of extensively usedgrasslands. As well as the relatively large area covered bythis land-use type, the high carbon storage capacity of exten-sive grassland soils should be stressed. Sustainable manage-ment practices and the maintenance of this land-use type isof crucial importance if C stocks are to be maintained. Thepossible impact of climate change on the OC storage capac-ity of such montane soils should be investigated in compar-ative studies, to reduce uncertainty of future carboninventory estimations. It should be stressed at this point thatOC storage capacity of forest soils in Austria is, on average,the same (121 t C ha–1, 0–50 cm; Weiss et al. 2000) asextensively used grasslands. Conversion of extensively usedgrassland to forest would thus seem to have no long-termimpact on the overall C storage in Austrian soils.Conversion of cropland to forest, on the other hand, couldpotentially have a large impact, but is likely to have adverseeconomical effects for the farmer.According to the calculation guidance for the KyotoArticle 3.4 “Cropland and Grassland Management” aban-donment of grassland leads to a loss of soil carbon. UnderAustrian conditions, it is doubtful whether abandonment ofgrassland, which often takes place in alpine regions due toadverse economics, will lead to a decrease in organic mattercontent of extensively managed soils. Alternatively, it is notrealistic to assume that increased fertilization or ameliora-tion measures would positively affect the current high levelof carbon storage in alpine grassland soils. The limitedpotential for increased C sequestration in alpine meadowsmay relate to extreme climatic conditions, which in turncontrol the turnover of organic matter. This illustrates thatthe generic recommendation in the IPCC Guidelines forNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Houghton et al.1996), which suggests the use of appropriate country-spe-cific values, should be followed whenever possible. The useof regional information about soil OC content and the envi-ronmental factors governing the C turnover processes willenhance the reliability of OC stocks and OC stock changes. When comparing C and N stocks in Austrian soils, otherdifferences between alpine soils and all other agriculturalland-use classes are observed (Table 3). Whilst OC poolsare largest in alpine meadow soils (Table 2), the N pools onaverage are ranked third and fourth in the 0–20 cm and20–50 cm layers, respectively. This results in an averageC:N ratio of alpine meadow soils of 16.5 in the upper layer.In contrast, all other land-use classes exhibit a nearly con-stant mean C:N ratio of around 9. In the deeper layer, themean C:N ratios are distinctly lower than in the upper layer,but the alpine meadow soils again show the highest ratio.Recent results from long-term 15N tracer studies in theAustrian Grossglockner massif showed that nitrogen iseffectively recycled in these nutrient-deficient systems andhas a long-term behaviour deviating from lowland sites(Gerzabek et al. 2004). It is generally accepted that C:Nratios become lower with an increasing degree of humifica-tion (e.g., Beyer and Blume 1990). The wide mean C:Nratios in alpine meadow soils, therefore, suggest accumula-tion of less-humified organic material and, thus, a slowerturnover of the labile soil organic matter pools.The system of deriving OC stocks as presented in this paperhas some potential to follow changes in OC stocks in Austrianagricultural soils in the long-term (decades). Limitations, how-ever, are: (i) the need for further standardization of methodsregarding sampling and analyses for future soil inventories and(ii) that the soil inventories of the Austrian provinces are notStyria1.744.49BurgenlandTyrol4.575.64Upper Austria1.571.513.624.23Fig. 4.

A major prob-lem with point (i) will remain the estimation of the gravel con-tent of soils, which is not easy to determine with the necessaryprecision. Another option would be to use the presentapproach as a baseline for modelling trends of OC stockchanges in Austrian soils due to land-use changes from 1990onwards. For that purpose a soil C model such as that con-tained in the Austrian Carbon Balance Model could be suit-able. For changes in land use, we suggest using the median OCstock values of the federal provinces, which are bolstered by asignificant number of sites and reflect the regional climatic dif-ferences in Austria to some extent. A further — from thestandpoint of soil science — desireable regionalisation relyingon different soil types within land-use classes would yield toofew sites. The model calculations, of course, should be vali-dated by the results of the future replications of soil invento-ries of the federal provinces and the few long-termexperiments focussing on soil organic matter still being main-tained in Austria.CONCLUSIONS(i) In the present paper it was shown that the Austriannational electronic soil information system BORIS canbe used as a basis to derive OC stocks of agriculturallyused soils. The total OC stock in agriculturally usedsoils in Austria was estimated (284 Mt).(ii) Land-use had a significant impact on OC stocks, espe-cially in the topsoil layers. Alpine meadows exhibitedthe largest OC storage capacity, cropland and vineyardsthe least. Alpine sites also deviate with respect to theirnitrogen dynamics as the highest C:N ratios wereobserved in this land-use class.(iii) The regional differences in agricultural managementwere reflected by a west–east gradient of decreasingOC stocks in cropland, which could be explained by thepredominance of ley farming in the western FederalProvinces.(iv) The described system to derive OC stocks on a region-al (federal province) and national level could be usedeither to follow future changes, given a better standard-ization of sampling and analytical methods, or as abaseline for modelling OC changes using a soil Cmodel. In the latter case, validation by replication ofsoil inventories and long-term experiments is needed.Aita, C., Recous, S. and Angers, D. A. 1997 .
