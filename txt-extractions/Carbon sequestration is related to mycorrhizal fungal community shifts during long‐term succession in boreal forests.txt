In late suc-cessional-stage forests, cord formers declined, while ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetescontinued to dominate, potentially facilitating long-term humus build-up through productionof melanized hyphae that resist decomposition./C15Our results suggest that cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungiplay opposing roles in below-ground C storage. We postulate that, by affecting turnover anddecomposition of fungal tissues, mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth form are criticaldeterminants of C and N sequestration in boreal forests.IntroductionHumus layers of northern ecosystems have accumulated carbon(C) since the last glaciation, and boreal and arctic soils presentlyaccount for almost half of the global C stored in soil and litter(Pan et al., 2011). Low temperatures and low litter quality, bothof which impair plant litter decomposition rates, have beeninvoked as principal drivers of organic matter accumulation innorthern ecosystems (Brovkin et al., 2012; Makkonen et al.,2012). However, the dominant plant species in boreal forestsallocate a substantial proportion of their C below ground tomycorrhizal fungal symbionts, and the dominant type of mycor-rhizal association has been identiﬁed as an important global pre-dictor of soil C storage (Averill et al., 2014). Fungal tissuespotentially represent a large C input into soil organic matterpools (Langley & Hungate, 2003; Cairney, 2012; Wallanderet al., 2013). Using a bomb-14C model, we recently showed thatat least half of the accumulated C in humus layers of boreal for-ested islands originated from root-derived inputs rather thanfrom above-ground plant litter inputs (Clemmensen et al., 2013).Analyses of biochemical markers and stable isotopes indicatedthat this accumulated C largely originated from fungal mycelium.These islands collectively represent a large post-ﬁre successionalgradient (ranging from 50 to 5000 yr since the last ﬁre), and weconcluded that impaired decomposition of organic matterderived from mycorrhizal fungi was a main driver of C accumula-tion in the rooting zone with increasing duration of absence ofﬁre. Shifts in C dynamics within the root-associated fungal com-munity thus have the potential to play a central, regulatory rolein the long-term accumulation of soil C.Differences in both fungal biomass production and turnoverand necromass degradation are likely to be important determi-nants of long-term C accumulation and may vary considerablyamong both fungal species and different tissues (Fernandez &Koide, 2012; Ekblad et al., 2013; Wallander et al., 2013). Agerer(2006) categorized ectomycorrhizal fungal species into short- andlong-distance exploration types, based on the amount and differ-entiation of their extramatrical mycelium. Mycelium of short-dis-tance types is composed of simple hyphae that explore soil closerto the roots, whereas the mycelium of long-distance types differ-entiates into hydrophobic hyphal cords that connect mycorrhizalroot tips with a more distant exploratory mycelium. This growthform framework can potentially link mycorrhizal fungal commu-nity composition to C cycling processes (Koide et al., 2013)./C2112014 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112014 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2015) 205: 1525–1536 1525www.newphytologist.comResearchCord-forming types have been proposed to be the mostC-demanding as a result of their extensive growth (Hobbie, 2006)and could potentially contribute large amounts of mycelial necro-mass to the soil organic matter pool. However, many cord formersare also equipped with a suite of extracellular enzymes that con-tribute to both efﬁcient internal biomass recycling (Boddy, 1999;Falconer et al., 2007) and degradation of organic complexes in thesoil (Hobbie & Agerer, 2010; Hobbie et al., 2013; B €odeker et al.,2014), potentially leading to short residence times of C in myce-lial biomass and necromass. The resistance of mycelial necromassto decomposition similarly varies among fungal species as a conse-quence of differences in tissue qualities, with implications for Cand nitrogen (N) residence time in soil. Whereas mycelium withhigh chitin and N concentrations generally decomposes withinweeks (Drigo et al., 2012; Fernandez & Koide, 2012), myceliumwith melanized cell walls, such as in many root-associated ascomy-cetes (Robinson, 2001; Smith & Read, 2008), may be resistant todecomposition, leading to a higher proportion of the necromassbeing preserved in long-term humus stores (Coelho et al., 1997;Koide et al., 2013; Fernandez & Koide, 2014).Our earlier study (Clemmensen et al., 2013) evaluated the roleof above-ground vs below-ground inputs for long-term soil Csequestration across a natural boreal forested island chronose-quence, and considered fungal communities only at the level ofdominant life forms (i.e. saprotrophs and root associates). Here,we present in-depth, species-level analyses of phylogenetic andfunctional shifts in fungal communities across this chronose-quence and characterize the spatial organization of the fungalcommunities in ﬁne-scaled organic soil proﬁles. We test thehypothesis that shifts in species composition and growth formswithin the mycorrhizal fungal community correlate with differ-ences in C sequestration from root-associated mycelium duringsuccessional development of boreal forest. Further, we propose aconceptual framework for how to mechanistically understandobserved relationships.Materials and MethodsSampling and DNA preparationThe study was conducted in a boreal forest chronosequence situ-ated on 30 forested islands in two adjacent lakes, Lake Hornavanand Lake Uddjaure (65 °550Nt o6 6 °090N; 17 °430Et o1 7 °550E)in northern Sweden (Wardle et al., 2003, 2012a). The islandswere all formed from the same parent material following the lastglaciation c. 10 000 yr ago and represented three size classes: 10large islands ( >1.0 ha), 10 medium islands (0.1 –1.0 ha) and 10small islands ( <0.1 ha; Supporting Information Table S1). Themain disturbance regime on these islands is wildﬁre throughlightning strike, and lightning strikes larger islands more fre-quently than smaller ones, meaning that larger islands burn morefrequently (Wardle et al., 2003). The average times since ﬁre are585, 2180 and 3250 yr on large, medium and small islands,respectively (Wardle et al., 2003). Each island serves as an inde-pendent replicate ecosystem, with whole islands serving as theunits of replication. On average, 6.2, 11.2 and 22.5 kg C m/C02have accumulated below ground on large, medium and smallislands, respectively (Clemmensen et al., 2013). Detailedaccounts of soil sampling and DNA preparation are available inClemmensen et al. (2013). In short, 10 soil cores (3 cm diameter)were sampled from each island down to the complete humusdepth of 0.2 –1.2 m. Eight cores (excluding the longest and short-est) were split into 20 cm horizons, and the uppermost 20 cmwere further split into two litter (L) horizons (intact litter on thesurface and more degraded intact litter in the upper c.0–2c mo fthe core), two fragmented litter (F) horizons ( c.2–7 and 7 –10 cmdepth) and two humus (H) horizons ( c.1 0–16 and 16 –20 cmdepth). Living roots and rhizomes with a diameter of >1m mwere removed, and materials from the same horizon were pooledwithin each island, resulting in six to 10 horizons sampled fromeach of the 30 islands and a total of 233 soil samples. The sam-ples were freeze-dried, and DNA was extracted from 50 mg ofﬁnely milled material in cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide(CTAB) buffer (3% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 2 mMEDTA, 150 mM Tris-HCl and 2.5 M NaCl, pH 8). The contentof total extracted DNA was measured spectrophotometricallyand fungal DNA was estimated by quantitative PCR of the fun-gal ITS2 region using the primers fITS9 and ITS4 (Ihrmarket al., 2012). ITS2 amplicons for 454-sequencing were producedusing the forward primers fITS9 or gITS7 in separate PCR reac-tions combined with sample-tagged ITS4 reverse primers (techni-cal triplicates, 22 –35 cycles; Ihrmark et al., 2012). Ampliconswere sequenced by LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany)on a GL FLX Titanium system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).DNA sequence analysesSequences were quality ﬁltered and clustered into operational tax-onomic units (OTUs) that proximately correspond to the specieslevel (1.5% distance single-linkage) using the bioinformaticspipeline SCATA (http://scata.mykopat.slu.se/) as detailed in Fig.S1. The entire UNITE database (http://unite.ut.ee; Abarenkovet al., 2010) and a curated selection of sequences from the NCBInr database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were included in theclustering procedure to provide validation of the species level andidentiﬁcation of some OTUs (primarily ectomycorrhizal fungi)based on the same criteria as the clustering. The globally mostabundant 557 fungal OTUs (each being represented by at least70 reads and together encompassing 92% of the total reads) werefurther identiﬁed through neighbour-joining analyses with refer-ence sequences as described in detail in Fig. S1 and by Clemmensenet al. (2013). Identiﬁed OTUs were categorized into the fungalguilds: litter-associated saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal fungi, eri-coid mycorrhizal fungi, other root-associated fungi, moulds andyeasts, based on published literature. Fungal sequences that couldnot be identiﬁed to species with known function but that clus-tered into clades together with reference sequences derived froma particular substrate (i.e. surface-sterilized roots of ectomycorrhi-zal, ericoid or other hosts or litter components) were assigned toputative guilds. Thus we attempted to deﬁne fungal guilds basedon their main source of C, with saprotrophic fungi being thosethat gain C from dead organic material and root-associated fungiNew Phytologist (2015) 205: 1525–1536 /C2112014 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112014 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comResearchNewPhytologist 1526 14698137, 2015, 4, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13208 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023].

In caseswhere the closest reference sequences were derived from differentsubstrates, the OTUs were classiﬁed as unknown with respect toguild. Ectomycorrhizal species were further ascribed to mycelialexploration types following the categories described by Agerer(2006) and implemented further by Tedersoo & Smith (2013).The relative abundances of fungal clusters in each sample werecalculated after the removal of all global singletons (on average4.3% of the reads) and nonfungal sequence reads (on average 2.1and 15.3% for the fITS9 and gITS7 primers, respectively). Eachof the 233 samples was represented by, on average, 1270 (fITS9)plus 1209 (gITS7) reads. When one of the forward primersclearly disfavoured a cluster ( <30% relative abundance of thatobtained by the other primer), data from the highest yieldingprimer were used ( <0.5% of clusters affected). Raw moleculardata are stored at The Sequence Read Archive under the accessionnumber SRP016090 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Representativesequences for the most abundant OTUs are deposited in theUNITE database under accession codes UDB020357 –UDB020913; see Table S2 for identiﬁcations and fungal guildassignments as well as links to UNITE Species Hypotheses, andTable S3 for relative abundances across all samples.To estimate the fungal community as integrated over thewhole soil proﬁle for each island, relative abundances were ﬁrstmultiplied by the total number of internal transcribed spacer(ITS) copies in each sample. Communities were then summedover the complete organic proﬁle, and new relative abundances ofall OTUs calculated based on ITS copies in the complete proﬁle.The fungal ITS copy number was signiﬁcantly correlated withthe fungal biomarker ergosterol across F and H layer samples,but not across the L samples, which had higher number of ITScopies per ergosterol content than did the F and H samples (Fig.S2). Thus, while our analyses of relative ITS abundances withinseparate horizons and fungal guilds should be largely unaffectedby possible variation in ITS copy number per biomass (Baldrianet al., 2013), some litter-associated fungi may be overrepresentedin the fungal communities as integrated for each island. Unfortu-nately, no single fungal biomarker has proved to correspond mostclosely to real standing biomass (Baldrian et al., 2013), and herewe choose to use the same fungal marker (i.e. the ITS region) tocharacterize both the fungal communities and their relative bio-mass in the samples (Fig. S3).Statistical analysesAfter removing ﬁve deeper humus samples with obvious contami-nation by litter fungi (most probably a result of accidental verticalmixing during sampling), the complete sequence-based data setconsisted of 228 samples and 4470 species-level OTUs. Theentire fungal community data set was subjected to ordinationanalyses using CANOCO version 4.55 (Biometris Plant ResearchInternational, Wageningen, the Netherlands). Detrended corre-spondence analysis (DCA) was used to depict patterns extractedfrom all variation in fungal communities, and correlation analy-ses were used to explore relationships between DCA axis scoresand selected environmental variables (Table S1): sample depth(cm) and below-ground C stock (g C m/C02) (from Clemmensenet al., (2013), based on the same samples as used here), island size(log 10ha) and time since ﬁre (yr) (from Wardle et al., 2003), andnet primary productivity (g C m/C02yr/C01) of the major tree species(Pinus sylvestris ,Picea abies ,Betula pubescens ) and understoreyspecies ( Vaccinium myrtillus ,V. vitis-idea ,Empetrumhermaphroditum ) (from Wardle et al., 2012b). Canonical corre-spondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse how much of thetotal variation (inertia) was explained by the environmental vari-ables, and CCAs were followed by Monte Carlo permutationtests (9999 permutations under full model) with forward selec-tion of explanatory variables. Because there was a strong islandsize9sample depth interaction term in the CCA of the full data-set, additional analyses were also performed for each soil proﬁlelayer separately (i.e. L1, L2, F1, F2, H1, H2, H3). Furthermore,species richness and Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s evennessindices were calculated for each soil sample after random subsam-pling of the fungal communities to 200 reads (100 per primer,corresponding to the lowest read number) using the vegan (Oksa-nenet al., 2007) and GUnifrac (Chen, 2012) packages in R, ver-sion 3.0.1 (R Core Team, 2013).Differences in diversity indices and in relative abundance offungal groups were analysed by generalized linear mixed models,using the GLIMMIX procedure in the SAS 9.3 package (Statisti-cal Analysis System Institute, Cary, NC, USA). To quantify over-all effects of island size and sampling layer (upper six horizonsincluded ( n=180), or only rooting zone included ( n=120)),island ‘size class’ (df =2) and ‘layer’ (df =5 or 3) and their inter-action (df =10 or 6) were deﬁned as ﬁxed factors. To account forpossible dependency between measures at different depths withinindividual islands, ‘layer’ was treated as a repeated measure with‘island’ as the subject and a ﬁrst-order autocorrelation structurespeciﬁed through RANDOM statements. Satterthwaite-typedegrees of freedom based on the Kenwood –Roger adjustmentwere used to calculate Wald F-test statistics of the ﬁxed factors,and the results were evaluated using Tukey’s adjustment formultiple comparisons with a=0.05. Proportional data were arc-sine-transformed before analysis, and a log-normal distributiontype was speciﬁed for all variables.ResultsDepth and island size effects on fungal communitycompositionThe ﬁrst axis of the DCA of the complete dataset identiﬁedvertical location in the organic proﬁles as the major determi-nant of fungal community composition, whereas the secondaxis described differences in fungal communities that wererelated to island size and associated variables (Fig. 1). A CCAwith sampling depth included as a covariate indicated a signiﬁ-cant effect of island size, and an interactive effect of island sizeand depth, on fungal community composition ( P=0.0001,Table S4a). When testing layers in the soil proﬁle separately,island size affected fungal communities in all layers ( P<0.01for all, Table S4b).

Forward selection of explanatory variables iden-tiﬁed C stock ( P=0.0001) and Picea (P=0.0016), Betula(P=0.0348) and Empetrum (P=0.029) productivity as the fac-tors most strongly related to fungal community composition,together accounting for 19.7% of total inertia (Table S5a).With C stock removed from this analysis, the signiﬁcantexplanatory variables were Picea productivity ( P=0.0003),island size ( P=0.0001) and Betula productivity ( P=0.022),which together explained 16.0% of total inertia (Table S5b).Island size also signiﬁcantly affected community compositionwithin each of the ﬁve fungal guilds, explaining 6 –9% of totalinertia (Table S6a). Forward selection of explanatory variablesidentiﬁed Empetrum and all three tree species as most stronglyrelated to the ectomycorrhizal fungal community. These vari-ables collectively explained 28.7% of total inertia, whereas Cstock was the factor that was most strongly related to the varia-tion in both ericoid mycorrhizal and other root-associated fun-gal communities (Table S6b). Island size and Piceaproductivity were the variables most strongly related to com-munities of litter saprotrophs, whereas Picea productivity andC stock explained most of the variation in the mould andyeast communities (Table S6b).Effects on fungal diversity, phylogenetic groups and fungalguildsFungal species richness, Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s even-ness index displayed similar patterns across soil proﬁles, and theﬁrst two estimates were signiﬁcantly higher on small and mediumislands than on large islands, whereas evenness was higher onmedium islands than on large islands (Figs 2a, S4; Tables S7, S8).However, the effect of island size was eliminated when any of theestimates were expressed per standing stock of either ITS copiesor ergosterol (not shown). On all islands, diversity peaked in theL2 and F1 layers, corresponding to the highest contribution byBasidiomycota and the lowest contribution by Ascomycota(Fig. 2a –c). Fungi belonging to Basidiomycota were most abun-dant (20 –35% of the ampliﬁed ITS sequences) in the upper10 cm, whereas Ascomycota increased in relative abundance andaccounted for over 80% of the sequences below 10 cm depth.Relative abundances of Basidiomycota, Ascomycota and Mucoro-mycotina were stable across the island gradient (Figs 2b –d, S5;Tables S7, S8).Fungal communities in the litter layers were clearly dominatedby litter-associated saprotrophic species, with fewer, more domi-nant ascomycetes in the uppermost litter layer (L1) and a largernumber of litter-degrading basidiomycetes (mainly Mycena spp.)in the lower litter layer (L2; Figs 2a –c,e,f, 3).

Yeasts were signiﬁcantly more abundant on large andmedium islands (Figs 2g, 4b, 5b; Table S8). Ericoid mycorrhizaland other root-associated fungi increased in dominance withdepth, but while the total relative abundance of ericoid mycorrhi-zal fungi was not affected by island size, other root-associatedfungi (including Phialocephala spp. and some Oidiodendron spp.)were more abundant on large islands (Figs 2k,l, 4d, 5b; TableS8). Ectomycorrhizal fungi with simple mycelia made up a ratherconstant proportion of the communities across humus layers andisland sizes, although they, together with other root-associatedfungi such as Archaeorhizomycetes, increased in relative abun-dance in the deepest humus layers of medium and small islands,which were not included in the mixed model analyses (Figs 2j,l,4c,d, 5b, S5; Table S8).DiscussionIt has recently been shown in the studied chronosequence that50–70% of the C stored in humus during the past 100 yr origi-nated from C allocated to roots and associated fungi rather thanfrom above-ground plant litter, and that accelerating accumula-tion of root-derived C could explain the increasing rate of Csequestration with time since ﬁre (Clemmensen et al., 2013).Here we present data documenting successions in fungal commu-nities, both vertically (i.e. from surface litters to deeper humuslayers) and with time since ﬁre. We observed distinct patterns inspecies composition within each of the major fungal guilds acrossthe chronosequence, and identiﬁed a speciﬁc root-associated fun-gal community in the particular humus layers where14C-basedestimates indicated high rates of C deposition.

The large-scale relationships identiﬁed in this studythus call for ﬁner-scaled manipulative experiments to furtherexplore mechanistic underpinnings and causal relationships.Cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi may restrict CsequestrationThe most obvious difference in fungal community compositionbetween the early successional-stage forests on large islands andthe late successional-stage forests on small islands was the highercontribution by cord-forming ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes(Suillus variegatus ,Cortinarius andPiloderma spp.) on the largeislands (Figs 2i, 4c). Cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi wereprimarily located in the fragmented litter and uppermost humuslayers, corresponding to the zone where14C analyses indicated alower accumulation of root-derived C on large than on smallislands (Clemmensen et al., 2013). The lower ergosterol and chi-tin concentrations below this zone on large islands (Clemmensenet al., 2013) suggest that mycelial production is counteracted bybiomass turnover and necromass degradation, preventing fungalremains from accumulating to the same extent as on smallislands. Cord-forming basidiomycetes form extensive soil mycelia(Agerer, 2006) characterized by a dense front of exploratoryhyphae that rapidly disintegrate as the mycelium differentiates,leaving behind a sparse network of long-lived, hydrophobichyphal cords that serve as transport conduits to the mycorrhizalroots (Finlay & Read, 1986). Through their growth form, ecto-mycorrhizal cord formers presumably also utilize nutrients, suchas N, more efﬁciently by transforming and recycling their ownbiomass through autolytic processes in a manner that has beenwell described for saprotrophic basidiomycetes (Dowson et al.,1989; Boddy, 1999; Falconer et al., 2007). Ectomycorrhizal cordformers in the boreal forest may recycle mycelium particularly tominimize N immobilization in their biomass and thereby providean N surplus that can be transferred to the plant host (Abuzina-dahet al., 1986). We postulate that such a strategy would act toreduce long-term C and N sequestration despite a high rate ofmycelial production in systems where cord-forming2 Chaetothyriales53 Russula paludosa41 Russula decolorans2522 Helotiales3010431 Cortinarius armillatus643613 Lactarius rufus19 Oidiodendronmajus5 Rhizoscyphus ericae686212439 Helotiales43 4 Chaetothyriales493 Ascomycete3721 Phialocephala fortinii7295144102117525723 Oidiodendron 15617924 Archaeo-rhizomycetes80 Archaeo-rhizomycetes 1565018247 Archaeo-rhizomycetes152 Mycena purpureofusca125 Phlebia livida86 Davidiella tassiana1303511211920 Mortierella1141901667 Helotiales4018 Leotiomycetes381031202821 Helotiales28 HelotialesFDepthIsland sizeC stockPinusPiceaBetulaVaccinium myrtillusVaccinium vitis-ideaEmpetrumDepthIsland sizeC stockPinusPiceaBetulaVaccinium myrtillusVaccinium vitis-ideaEmpetrumLargeMediumSmallHumus 2Humus 3(a)(b)1%3%0.3%0.1%Relative abundance:Island size:Organic layer:Medium mat typeMedium fringe typeLong exploration typeEctomycorrhizal, cord formers:Ericoid mycorrhizalEricoid mycorrhizal, putativeEctomycorrhizal, putativeOther root-associated, putativeOther root-associatedYeastsMouldsLitter saprotrophs, basidioPutative litter fungi, ascoLitter saprotrophs, ascoPutative litter fungi, basidioUnknown functionContact exploration typeShort exploration typeMedium smooth typeEctomycorrhizal, simple mycelia:Fungal guilds:DCA axis 1DCA axis 2 DCA axis 2Fig. 5 Sample (a) and species (b) plotsderived from a detrended correspondenceanalysis (DCA) of fungal communities in thedeeper humus present across the completeisland gradient (humus layers 2 and 3), withthe two ﬁrst axes shown and accounting for6.5 and 4.0% of the total inertia of 3.91.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseectomycorrhizal fungi are abundant (Fig. 6). The degree to whichsuch a strategy acts to minimize competition between the symbi-otic partners in different ecosystems may explain why mycorrhi-zal fungi in some cases (such as in our late successional-stageforests) appear to aggravate N limitation of their plant hosts(Alberton et al., 2007; N €asholm et al., 2013), whereas in othercases (such as in our early successional-stage forests) act toincrease both C and N cycling through soil pools (Drake et al.,2011; Phillips et al., 2012).Some of the dominant cord formers in our system and in theboreal forest in general – the Cortinarius species – may also be par-ticularly efﬁcient at mobilizing organic N from complex organicpolymers (Hobbie & Agerer, 2010; Hobbie et al., 2013). This isprobably a consequence of their production of oxidative exoen-zymes, such as class II manganese (Mn) peroxidases, in responseto low N availability (B €odeker et al., 2014). Hence, although allCortinarius species appear to be obligate biotrophs and depend ontheir host for easily available sugars, they may still act to degradeorganic matter in their search for N (see also Lindahl &Tunlid, inpress). Our data also indicate that communities of putative myce-lium degraders and opportunists, including various yeasts andmoulds, thrive in the rooting zone of large islands, and their activ-ity could contribute to a higher turnover of dead mycelium anddecomposition residues produced on these islands. An overallconsequence of the higher abundance of cord-forming ectomycor-rhizal fungi thus seems to be that a major part of the C allocatedto mycelial growth is turned over rapidly, reducing C inputs tolong-term storage pools in the soil and facilitating more rapidrecycling of N to the plant biomass (Fig. 6). This may seem coun-terintuitive, as mycelial cords have been found to persist for longtime periods in the soil (Treseder et al., 2005; Pritchard et al.,2008). However, the cords themselves only account for a minorfraction of mycelial production in cord-forming fungi and themajority of production consists of diffuse exploratory myceliumwhich turns over much more rapidly than the sparse network ofremaining cords (Finlay & Read, 1986). A greater efﬁciency ofmobilization and transfer of N to the plant hosts is also reﬂectedby the steeper d15N gradient and higher C : N ratio in the humusproﬁles of large islands (Clemmensen et al., 2013).Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may mediate C sequestrationEricoid mycorrhizal fungi constituted a major and stable propor-tion of the amplicon communities across all islands (Fig. 2k),although the best-characterized ericoid mycorrhizal fungus(Rhizoscyphus ericae ; Smith & Read, 2008) was clearly moreabundant on small islands (Figs 4d, 5b).

Atlater successional stages, less C is allocated tomycorrhizal symbionts, and stress-tolerant,root-associated ascomycetes (e.g. ericoidmycorrhizal species, ERM) dominate C and Ndynamics in the root zone. By buildingbiomass structures resistant todecomposition, they facilitate N retentionand long-term C storage in the humus.

Most of the root-associatedascomycetes in boreal forests belong to the Helotiales or Chae-tothyriales and form short-ranging, nonaggregated mycelia ofdark hyphae with thick, melanized cell walls that are well pro-tected against adverse environmental conditions, such as desicca-tion and ﬂuctuating temperatures (Butler & Day, 1998;Robinson, 2001; Grelet et al., 2010; Fernandez & Koide, 2013).These hyphae are likely to be characterized by slow growth (Rob-inson, 2001; Smith & Read, 2008) and long life span (Koideet al., 2013). Melanized hyphae are also likely to have cell wallsthat are more resistant to degradation (Coelho et al., 1997; Butler& Day, 1998) than the exploratory hyphae produced by most ec-tomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. We postulate that these character-istics lead to a larger proportion of fungal necromass beingpreserved in long-term humus stores on small islands, in whichroot-associated ascomycetes dominate root zone processes(Fig. 6). Previously, we have shown that C accumulation at latesuccessional stages depends on accumulation of mycelial remains,as indicated by high concentrations of the fungal cell wall compo-nent chitin in the humus (Clemmensen et al., 2013). However,chitin is relatively labile under both laboratory and ﬁeld condi-tions (Drigo et al., 2012; Fernandez & Koide, 2012; Russell,2014), and instead differences in melanin concentration inﬂu-ence variation in mycelial recalcitrance to decomposition (Fer-nandez & Koide, 2014). Fungal melanins have been found toassociate with more labile components of fungal cell walls, suchas proteins and chitin, and may form physical and chemical com-plexes that may be well protected against decomposition (Coelhoet al., 1997; Butler & Day, 1998). Hence, we propose that stress-tolerant, root-associated ascomycetes play a central role in theformation of boreal forest humus.The most intensively studied ericoid mycorrhizal fungal spe-cies, R. ericae , grows well on fungal necromass as a sole N source(Kerley & Read, 1998), and ericoid fungi have long been thoughtto be more efﬁcient mobilizers of organic N relative to ectomy-corrhizal fungi (Read et al., 2004). However, lower C : N and15N:14N ratios but higher chitin content of the humus on smallislands indicate that less efﬁcient recirculation of N to plants islinked to mycelial necromass build-up (Clemmensen et al.,2013), supposedly by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, in con-trast to Read et al. (2004), we propose that ericoid mycorrhizalfungi may lock up more C and N than they release from thelong-term soil organic matter pool, primarily as a result ofimpaired decomposition of their necromass. There was a distincttransition in community composition within the guilds of puta-tive ericoid mycorrhizal and other root-associated ascomycetesacross the island gradient (Fig. 4d). It is possible that these root-associated ascomycetes cover a wide spectrum of lifestyles fromfacultative to obligate mycorrhizal biotrophs, and that they formstructurally and functionally different associations with varioushost species (e.g. Vohnik et al., 2007; Grelet et al., 2010; Vohnik& Albrechtova, 2011). For example, the two melanized ascomy-cetes Cenococcum geophilum and Meliniomyces vraolstadiae werefound preferentially in early successional forests, probablybecause their ectomycorrhizal habit link their abundance to theproduction of their host trees. Interspeciﬁc differences in melaninproduction and mycelial dynamics may be important for Csequestration and deserve particular future research attention.Shifting vertical distribution of litter-associated fungiLitter layers were clearly dominated by saprotrophs, with a suc-cession from a few dominant ascomycete litter endophytes (e.g.Ceutospora pinastri ,Lophodermium pinastri ) in the younger litters,to basidiomycete saprotrophs (mainly Mycena spp.) in the moredecomposed litters (Fig. 3). Saprotrophic communities werelargely conﬁned to the litter layers, supporting previous studiesand showing that vertical separation of saprotrophic and root-associated communities is a widespread phenomenon in ectomy-corrhizal-dominated ecosystems (Lindahl et al., 2007; Baldrianet al., 2012; McGuire et al., 2013). However, both litter-associ-ated basidiomycetes and ascomycetes were more abundant atgreater depths on small islands than on large islands (Fig. 2e,f;Table S8), corresponding to the slower decomposition of above-ground litter components on small islands (Wardle et al., 2003).Additionally, reduced competition from ectomycorrhizal cordformers in the fragmented litter layers on the small islands mayhave allowed the litter fungi to persist at greater depths, in a man-ner similar to the competitive release of saprotrophic communi-ties shown to occur after root trenching to exclude roots ofectomycorrhizal tree species (Gadgil & Gadgil, 1971). In contrastto the litter layers, saprotrophic fungal communities in thehumus layers were dominated by yeasts and moulds, particularlyon large islands. Wood decay fungi appear to be conﬁned mainlyto discrete patches of woody debris in this system.Coordinated above-ground and below-ground successionsThe most abundant cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi in oursystem (Fig. 4c) live exclusively in symbiosis with Pinus (i.e.Suillus variegatus ,Cortinarius semisanguineus ,C. mucosus )o rBetula (i.e.C. armillatus ).Pinus andBetula dominate the earliersuccession stages after wildﬁre (Wardle et al., 2003) and couldthereby contribute to the higher abundance of these cord-form-ing species on larger islands. The increasing relative contributionof ericaceous dwarf shrubs to total net primary productivity withtime since ﬁre (Wardle et al., 2003) might explain the sustainedhigh relative abundance of ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes asisland size decreases (Fig. 2k). Conversely, fungal successions fol-lowing wildﬁre may also play a central role in driving changes inthe plant community. The increasing importance of stress-adapted traits during long-term succession in the prolongedabsence of disturbances such as ﬁre, and with declining soil fertil-ity, is probably highly coordinated between plant and fungalcommunities. The greater fungal species diversity in the late suc-cessional-stage forests matches observations of plant diversity(Wardle et al., 2012a), further highlighting the parallel develop-ment of above-ground and below-ground community responses.The declining net primary productivity associated withprolonged absence of ﬁre in our study system (Wardle et al.,New Phytologist (2015) 205: 1525–1536 /C2112014 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112014 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comResearchNewPhytologist 1534 14698137, 2015, 4, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13208 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License2012a) suggests that absolute C allocation to root-associated fungiwould be largest early in the succession. Cord-forming ectomycor-rhizal fungi have been proposed to be the most C-demanding of allmycorrhizal types, owing to their extensive mycelial production(Hobbie, 2006). Their supposedly high production of enzymeswould lead to a high energy demand, and their maintenance in thefungal community may depend on sufﬁcient quantities of C beingallocated below ground. The high demand for host-derived C bythese cord-forming fungi would be matched by a more efﬁcientsupply of nutrients back to their hosts, leading to a positive feed-back between the two partners and a higher primary production(Fig. 6). Thus, both vegetation composition and productivity arelikely to be important drivers of the observed differences in root-associated fungal communities between the large and small islands.Taken together, our observations provide evidence that long-term successional development and accompanying humus build-upin the forest chronosequence occurs in concert with phylogeneticand morphological shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal communitywith potential consequences for C and N cycling (Fig. 6). We pro-pose that these fungal community changes play an important rolein explaining the large accumulation of organic matter belowground that is often observed in older ecosystems. While stress-adapted, root-associated ascomycetes generally seem to promotebiochemical stabilization of C and N in organic matter derivedfrom mycelium, the higher abundance of certain cord-forming ec-tomycorrhizal fungi at earlier successional stages implies efﬁcientrecycling of N and C from both recently produced fungal myceliumand older humus. Long-term ecosystem succession thus involvesimpairment of mycorrhizal N recirculation and, consequently, pro-gressive nutrient limitation and compositional changes in the vege-tation with time since ﬁre (Alberton et al., 2007; Wardle et al.,2012a). Changes in plant community composition in turn inﬂu-ence total below-ground allocation of C and relative C allocation todifferent fungal symbionts, as a consequence of speciﬁcity in theplant –fungal interactions. These feedbacks result in increasing Cand N accumulation in the humus layer and reduced plant produc-tion over time –a pathway that can only be reset by major distur-bances, such as wildﬁre.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the 7th European CommunityFramework Program (Marie Curie IEF to K.E.C.), Lammska Stif-telsen, FORMAS grants (2007-1365, 2011-1747 to B.D.L.), aWallenberg Scholar award to D.A.W. and excellence grants toR.D.F. and J.S. by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sci-ences.
