The 4 carbon allocation to protein synthesis in i lluminated leaves generally accounts for ca. 1% of net 5 photosynthesis. It is likely that protein synthe sis activity varies with photosynthetic conditions 6 (CO 2/O2 atmosphere composition) since changes in photorespiration and carbon provision 7 should in principle impact on amino acid supply as well as metabolic regulation via leaf sugar 8 content. However, possible changes in protein synthesis and translati on activity when gaseous 9 conditions vary are virtually unknown. Here, we address this question using metabolomics, 10 isotopic techniques, phosphoproteomics a nd polysome quantitation, under different 11 photosynthetic conditions that were  varied with atmospheric CO 2 and O 2 mole fraction, using 12 illuminated Arabidopsis rosettes under contro lled gas exchange conditions. We show that 13 carbon allocation to proteins is within 1–2. 5% of net photosynthesi s, increases with 14 photosynthesis rate and is unr elated to total amino acid content . In addition, photosynthesis 15 correlates to polysome abundance and phosphorylati on of ribosomal proteins and translation 16 initiation factors. Our results demonstrate th at translation activity follows photosynthetic 17 activity, showing the considerable impact of  metabolism (carboxylation–oxygenation balance) 18 on protein synthesis. 19   20 4  1. Introduction 21 It is now nearly 250 years since proteins were extracted and purified from green leaves for the 22 first time [1] and nearly 85 years since protein synthesis (and degradati on) activity by leaves 23 was first shown [2-4]. Yet, physiological mechan isms that dictate leaf  protein content are 24 presently incompletely understood, and this repr esents a hurdle in the understanding of leaf 25 primary carbon and nitrogen (N) metabolism. In f act, a considerable propor tion of leaf proteins 26 is made of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylas e/oxygenase (Rubisco) and carbonic anhydrase 27 and is thus directly i nvolved in photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation. The turnover of leaf proteins 28 is the cornerstone of N metabolism, since proteins  such as Rubisco are remobilized and used as 29 a N (and sulphur) reservoir during grain filling, fruit development and leaf senescence. Also, 30 protein degradation is regulated  by N availability, environmenta l and internal signals, allowing 31 optimal plant N partitioning and gr owth [5]. However, relatively little is known about the fast 32 control of protein synthesis in response to common s ituations in leaves (such as varying CO 2), 33 in contrast with seedlings and roots in which the control of tr anslation under hypoxia has been 34 well-studied. In other words, the regulation of le af protein synthesis a nd turnover in the short- 35 term is much less understood.  36  37 It has been shown that there is a diurnal cycle of protein synthesis activity, with higher 38 translation activity (and higher polysome abundance) in the light compared with the dark [6-9]. 39 Also, protein synthesis has been suggested to rela te to growth rate [10] and sucrose content in 40 the dark [7]. In addition, the effect of light as compared to the dark has been shown to correlate 41 with the phosphorylation of transl ation initiation factor s (eIFs) and ribosomal  proteins (such as 42 RPS6), indicating that the control of cytosolic tr anslation initiation plays an important role in 43 circadian (dark/light) protein synthesis regulation [11-14]. Accordingly, pioneering works 44 using isotopic labelling (with 15N) demonstrated that leaf prot ein synthesis took place in the 45 light (from nitrate) and was ne gligible in darkness [15]. 46  47 In principle, the photosynthetic rate its elf (and therefore, atmospheric gaseous 48 composition) can be anticipated to have an eff ect on protein synthesis and translation activity. 49 In particular, translation initiation involves seve ral molecular actors that can be associated with 50 metabolic regulation. Briefly, tr anslation initiation starts w ith the formation of a 43S 51 preinitiation complex, which contains the 40S  ribosome subunit and eIFs 5, 3, 1 and 1A. The 52 preinitiation complex binds the eIF2 complex and then the mRNA-eIF(iso)4F complex (here, 53 parentheses mean two complexes,  eIF4F and eIFiso4F). The plant-specific eIFiso4F complex 54 comprises eIFs 4A, 4B, iso4G, is o4E and poly-A binding proteins. After mRNA scanning and 55 start codon identification, some eIFs are li berated, the ribosomal 60S subunit binds and 56 elongation starts [12, 16].  57  58 Many eIFs or ribosomal proteins (RPs) ca n be modified post- translationally (in 59 particular, by phosphorylation) and th is modulates their activity [17]. In yeast , General Control 60 Non-derepressible 2 (GCN 2) can phosphorylate eIF2 α under specific nut rient or redox 61 conditions [see, e.g., [18]], preventing guanyl nu cleotide recycling. Also , metabolic conditions 62 (sugar and free amino acid content) can impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 63 signaling pathway which controls RPS6 phosphor ylation (for a recent experimental study in 64 Arabidopsis , see [19]) as well as the sugar-sensi ng kinase SnRK1 which can phosphorylate 65 eIF(iso)4E [20]. Therefore, it has been hypot hesized that photosynthetic activity promotes 66 phosphorylation of RPS6 (amongst other RPs) and the initiation factor eIF4B, and disfavor 67 phosphorylation of eIF2 α, thus stimulating protein s ynthesis [11]. Furthermore, CO 2 and O 2 68 mole fractions dictate the rate of photorespiratio n, which could also impact on translation. On 69 the one hand, photorespirati on leads to peroxisomal H 2O2 generation and can induce oxidative 70 stress and perhaps, this mi ght trigger phosphorylation of eIF2α [21] thereby inhibiting 71 5  translation initiation. However, on the othe r hand, photorespiration produces amino acids 72 (glycine, serine), leads to mitochondrial ATP ge neration and enhance N a ssimilation, and this 73 might be accompanied by an increased protein s ynthesis. Nevertheless, it should be noted that 74 the specific role of GCN proteins is still unclear, and other kinases (such as casein kinase 2, 75 CK2) are capable of  phosphorylating eIF2 α in vitro  [12, 22-25]. Also, an important role of 76 SnRK1 (also involved in sucrose signaling) has been recently shown for eIF4(iso)4G 77 phosphorylation in response to submergence [26].  78 Up to now, there is limited information on the rate of protein synthesis when 79 photosynthesis varies, typically when CO 2 and/or O 2 mole fraction changes. The use of 15N 80 labelling in barley leaves has suggested that  protein synthesis correlated with chlorophyll 81 content and thus potentially w ith photosynthesis [27]. Also, 15N labelling in proteins has been 82 found to be much larger with CO 2 in air compared to CO 2-free air, suggesti ng a coupling with 83 photosynthesis [15]. In photosynthetizing l eaves, isotopic pulse labelling (with 14CO 2) has 84 demonstrated that protein synthesis repr esents a carbon flux of about 0.1 µmol m-2 s-1 and after 85 sugar export has taken place (i.e. after several hours in darkness), 14C-labelled proteins can 86 represent up to 20% of total leaf radio activity [28-31] – such a pr oportion being changed by the 87 presence of close sink organs [32] and leaf age [28]. When  photosynthesis with 14CO 2 was 88 augmented via incident light inte nsity, proteins represented a lower percentage of total leaf 89 radioactivity but in absolu te terms, represented more labelled carbon, with a 14C-flux of ≈0.1 90 µmol m-2 s-1 at low light and ≈0.25 µmol m-2 s-1 at high light [33]. In  a previous study, we 91 observed that the phosphorylation of so me eIFs and RPs could respond to CO 2 mole fraction, 92 suggesting there is a an increas e of translation activity when  photosynthesis increases [11].  93 However, there is presently no specific st udy exploring and quantifying the impact of 94 photosynthetic conditions on leaf protein synthesis and in part icular, the short-term effect of 95 CO 2 and O 2 mole fraction (and thus the bala nce between gross photosynthesis and 96 photorespiration). This lack of knowledge is problematic because the turnover rate  of proteins 97 may affect not only N assimilation but also phot osynthetic capacity itself. In fact, while it is 98 rather unlikely that the very high Rubisco conten t changes dramatically in the short-term when 99 photosynthesis varies, the pool of less abundant prot eins involved in the Calvin cycle (including 100 Rubisco activase or enzymes with a high control coe fficient in the cycle) or light reactions could 101 change within a few hours. In fact, 15N labelling has recently shown th at some proteins involved 102 in photosynthesis have a short half-life,  such as Rubisco activase (turnover rate ≈0.2 d-1) [34]. 103 Here, we took advantage of omics analyses  performed on Arabidopsis rosettes, using 104 gas-exchange under controlled conditions (CO 2, O2, light/dark) and sampling by instant liquid 105 nitrogen spraying using our system previously de scribed in [35]. Here, it  was further combined 106 to isotopic techniques and polysom e quantitation to elucidate the potential effect of short-term 107 changes in CO 2 and O 2 mole fraction on protein synthesis. The use of 13CO 2 labelling allowed 108 us to quantify the amount of car bon allocated to prot ein synthesis, while polysome relative 109 quantitation as well as eIFs and RPs phosphor ylation analysis (in particular RPS6 110 phosphorylation) gave information on translation activity. The objective of the present study is 111 not to dissect molecular mechanism of transla tional control but rather, to look at potential 112 changes in protein synthesis with  photosynthesis. In fact, our re sults demonstrate that protein 113 synthesis follows the photosynthesis rate and is  unrelated to total amino acid availability, 114 suggesting a control of translation initiation by metabolic signaling driven by the carboxylation- 115 oxygenation balance. 116  117   118 6  2. Material and methods 119  120 2.1. Plant material 121 After sowing on potting mix, Arabidopsis  thaliana (Col-0 accession) plantlets were 122 transplanted to indi vidual pots and grown for 6 weeks in a controlled environment (growth 123 chamber) under short days. Conditions were as fo llows: 8:16 h light/dark at an irradiance of 124 approximately 100 µmol photons m-2 s-1, 20/18°C day/night temper ature, 65% humidity and 125 nutrient solution (1 g L-1 PP14-12-32, [Plant-Prod, Puteaux, France] supplemented with 20 μL 126 L-1 fertoligo L [Fertil, Boulogne-Bi llancourt, France]) twice a week.  127  128 2.2. Metabolomics 129 Metabolomics profiling was performed as in [36]. Briefly, 20 mg of leaf powder from 130 lyophilized leaf samples were extracted with 2 mL  methanol:water (70:30  v/v). The supernatant 131 was vacuum dried and chemically derivatized  with methoxyamine and MSTFA in pyridine. 132 Ribitol was added as an internal standard, as well  as an alkane mix to ca librate retention index. 133 GC-MS metabolomics analyses were carried out using a Pegasus III GC-TOF-MS system 134 (Leco, France). Peak integration was verified manually for all metabolites to avoid erroneous 135 determinations by the Pegasus software. 136  137 2.3. Gas exchange and sampling  138 Arabidopsis plants were taken at fixed time of da y in the controlled growth chamber (after about 139 4 h light) and used for gas-exchange a nd labelling. Gas exchange and sampling were  carried 140 out as in [37]. Briefly, photos ynthesis and respiration rates were monitored with the gas 141 exchange open system LI-COR 6400/XT ( LI-COR , Austin, USA), under a controlled humidity 142 of 80% fixed with a dew-point generator ( LI-COR 610). Net photosynthesis ( A) was measured 143 in typical conditions (desired CO 2 mole fraction, 21% O 2, 22°C, 280 µmol m-2 s-1 PAR 144 [photosynthetically active ra diation], 10% blue). CO 2 mole fraction was either 100, 380 or 1000 145 µmol mol-1. O 2 mole fraction was either 0% (pure N 2 used as inlet gas), 21% (ordinary air) or 146 100% (pure O 2). CO 2-free conditions (no CO 2 in inlet gas) were not used here since no 13C 147 labelling would have been possible. Gas-exch ange was carried out with a purpose-built 148 chamber adapted to three Arabidopsis  rosettes connected to the sample channel of the LI-COR 149 6400 xt. Air temperature in the chamber was maintain ed with a water-bath. Leaf rosettes were 150 separated from the below-ground part and soil of the pot by a Plexiglas  wall (with specific holes 151 for collars sealed with Terostat®) so as to a void alteration of gas-exchange by soil and root 152 respiration. The upper wall of the leaf chamber was made of a tight pol yvinyl chloride film 153 allowing very fast quenching by liquid N 2 freezing. Further details on the chamber can be found 154 in our previous studies [11, 35, 37]. Photosynthesis was allowed to  stabilise under the desired 155 CO 2 and O 2 mole fraction (at 280 µmol photon m-2 s-1 PAR) and after 3 hours, rosettes were 156 instantly frozen and stored at –80°C for furthe r analyses. Rosettes sampled in darkness were 157 collected after 3 hours at 380 µmol mol-1 CO 2 and 21% O 2 in the light and th en 2 hours of dark- 158 adaptation. Isotopic labelling was carried out with 13CO 2 (99% 13C, Sigma Aldrich) for 4 hours 159 in the O 2/CO 2 conditions of interest, and sampling was carried out as above at the end of the 4- 160 h labelling time by liquid N 2 freezing. 161  162 7  2.4. Phosphoproteomics   163 The protocol used to carry ou t quantitative phosphoprot eomics analyses was similar to that 164 previously described in [35]. Total (non-phosphor ylated) protein analysis was also performed 165 on the same samples to quantify total protein abundance (and therefore check that changes in 166 phosphorylation level are not simply  due to changes in total protein content) . Protein extraction 167 was carried out using the trichl oroacetate/acetone method and pr otein digestion was performed 168 at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (w:w) overnight at 37°C with sequencing-grade trypsin 169 (Promega). Stable isotope dimethyl labelling was done according to the on-column protocol of 170 [38] using three different is otopologues of formaldehyde (CH 2O, C2H2O and 13C2H2O) thereby 171 allowing simultaneous injection of three extracts (each triplet is referred to as ‘triplex’). A 172 sample made of the mixture of  all of the samples was dimethylated (with unlabeled methyl 173 groups) and used as a reference in all triplexes. The use of triplexes thus allowed us to analyze 174 two samples per injection (intermediate and heavy labeling). After being spin-dried and 175 resuspended in acetonitrile/formic acid soluti on, peptides were subj ected to SCX (Strong 176 Cation Exchange) chromatography. Collected frac tions were enriched in phosphopeptides by 177 IMAC (Immobilized ion Metal A ffinity Chromatography) [39] and then analysed by nanoLC- 178 MS/MS using a NanoLC-Ultra system (Eksigent) . Peptides eluted from a 35-min long, 5-to- 179 35% acetonitrile gradient were analysed with  a coupled Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo 180 Electron). A “Top 8” cycle of data-dependent acquisition was used (i.e., the 8 major ions 181 detected in each MS spectrum were submitte d to MS/MS fragmentation). Resolution for 182 precursors and fragments was set to 70,000 a nd 17,500 respectively. Collision energy was set 183 at 27% and exclusion time at 40 s. 184  For identification of peptides, phosphoryl ation sites and quan tification, database 185 searches were performed using X!Tandem Sl edgehammer (2013.09.01.1) [40] with the TAIR 186 database (www.arabidopsis.org). Cysteine carb oxyamidomethylation and light, intermediate 187 and heavy dimethylation of peptide N-termin i and lysine residues were set as static 188 modifications while methionine oxidation and phos phorylation of tyrosine, serine or threonine 189 residues were set as variable modifications. Mass error tolerance was 10 ppm for precursors 190 and -0.02 Th for fragments. Identified proteins  were filtered and gr ouped using the X!Tandem 191 pipeline v3.3.1 (http://pappso.inra. fr/bioinfo/xtandempipeline/) [ 41]. Relative quantification of 192 non-phosphorylated peptides and phosphopeptid es was performed using the MassChroQ 193 software [42] by extracting ion ch romatograms (XICs) of all identi fied peptides within a 5 ppm 194 window and by integrating the area of the XIC peak  at their corresponding retention time, after 195 LC-MS/MS chromatogram alignment. 196  197 2.5. Isotopic measurements in proteins 198 Proteins were purified from frozen samples (50 mg fresh weight). First, a raw proteic extract 199 was obtained using a trichloroacet ate-acetone extraction as above. Then prot eins were purified 200 after [43] with the following modifications: the dr y pellet (proteins and cell wall debris obtained 201 in the trichloroacetate -acetone extraction) was dissolved in 1.5 mL resuspension buffer (1% 202 SDS, 150 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM dithiotreitol, 1 mM EDTA).  After centrifugation at 10,000 g 203 for 5 min at 14°C, the supernatant was collecte d and proteins were pr ecipitated by  adding 1.5 204 mL methanol. After centrifuga tion (10,000 g, 5 min, 14°C), the s upernatant was discarded and 205 the protein pellet rinsed with 1.5 mL metha nol and centrifuged. The pellet was then freeze- 206 8  dried, weighed in tin capsules and analysed. Is otopic analysis was done using an elemental 207 analyser (Carlo-Erba) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime, Elementar) run 208 in continuous flow. All sample batches incl uded standards (sucrose, glycine, cysteine; 209 previously calibrated against IAEA standards glutamic acid USGS-40 and caffeine IAEA-600) 210 each twelve samples. The isotope composition ( δ13C) was then converted to %13C. 211  212 2.6. Polysome abundance 213 Polysome abundance was determined by sucrose de nsity gradient centrifugation analysis from 214 liquid-nitrogen frozen rose ttes (protocol explained in Supplemental Methods). 215  216 2.7. Statistics 217 Phosphoproteomics and metabolomics analyses were  carried out 3 to 6 times for each condition. 218 Peptides considered to vary sign ificantly between photosynthetic (CO 2/O2 and/or light/dark) 219 conditions were those with P<0.05 using ANOVA (Fig. 4). This value ensured an acceptable 220 false discovery rate (FDR), estimated as in Tan & Xu (2014), including the Hochberg- 221 Benjamini correction (Hochberg & Benjamini 1990) , over the whole dataset. A multivariate 222 analysis was carried out with orthogonal proj ection on latent stru ctures (OPLS, with 223 phosphopeptides or metabolites  as X variables and O 2/CO 2 conditions as a quantitative Y 224 variable) carried out with Simca (MKS Umetrics, Sweden) [44, 45].  The effect of each 225 phosphopeptide or metabolite in explaining the X-Y relationship was quantified using the 226 loading along axis 1 ( pcorr(1)) and the P-value of the ANOVA in a vo lcano plot. The robustness 227 of the OPLS model was assessed with the co rrelation coefficient between prediction and 228 observations (R²), the cross-validated correlation  coefficient (Q²) and the intercept of the 229 response of Q² to similarity in iterat ed (250 iterations) permutations tests (Q² int). The statistical 230 significance of the OPLS model was tested using a ² test on the comparison with a random 231 model (mean  random error). The associated P-value was denoted as PCV-ANOVA . 232  233   234 9  3. Results 235  236 3.1. Photosynthesis and metabolism 237 Six gas-exchange conditions were used, with CO 2 mole fraction of 100, 380 or 1000 µmol mol-238 1 under 21% O 2, and O 2 mole fraction of 0% (pure N 2 used as background gas), 21% or 100% 239 (pure O 2 as background gas) at 380 µmol mol-1 CO 2. Analyses were also conducted in dark- 240 adapted rosettes after photosynt hesis under standard (21% O 2, 380 µmol mol-1 CO 2) conditions. 241 Changes in photosynthetic conditions were associat ed with considerable changes in metabolite 242 content. Metabolomics analyses by GC-MS showed  that amongst the 108 analytes detected, 31 243 were associated with significant changes ( P<0.01 with an ANOVA) with O 2/CO 2 conditions 244 (Fig. 1a). They could be grouped into three cl usters. The first cluste r comprised alanine and 245 tyrosine, considerably increased with N 2 (0% O 2) as inlet air (meaning ≈0.02% O 2 in air 246 surrounding leaves due to photosynthetic O 2 evolution). The sec ond cluster comprised 247 metabolites particularly accumulated at very hi gh photorespiration (low photosynthesis), such 248 as glycine and serine (photorespiration intermed iates) but also other amino acids such as 249 cysteine, threonine and valine, or  organic acids such as succinate. The third cluster comprised 250 metabolites present under normoxic c onditions and decreased under 0% O 2 inlet air, such as 251 glycolate (photorespiration interm ediate), fumarate or putresc ine. Unsurprisingly, several 252 metabolites (including sugars and photorespiratory intermediates glycine and serine) were 253 affected by darkness as compared to the light (F ig. S2). Multivariate an alysis yielded a very 254 good OPLS model (R² = 0.965; Q² = 0.934) that was robust (negative Q² int at –0.501) and highly 255 significant ( PCV-ANOVA  = 410-14) (Fig. S1). The volcano plot that combines univariate and 256 multivariate analysis showed that best biomarkers of O 2/CO 2 conditions were succinate, serine, 257 glycine, pipecolate and cysteine (decreased with photosynthesis), and alanine and homoserine 258 (increased at high phot osynthesis) (Fig. 1b). 259  As expected, there was a clear increase in the photosynthesis rate as O 2/CO 2 decreased 260 (showing the inhibition of photorespirati on and augmented carboxylation as the O 2-to-CO 2 ratio 261 decreased), with a significan t depressing effect of low O 2 (Fig. 1c). There was no significant 262 effect of O 2 mole fraction on the rate of dark respiration (CO 2 evolution in darkness). The sum 263 of proteogenic amino acids (expressed in signa l % of total recovered metabolites) tended to 264 increase as CO 2 increased from 100 to 1000 µmol mol-1, but there was also a high content in 265 amino acids at very high photorespiration (100% O 2) and in darkness (Fig. 1d). These effects 266 were driven by the accumulation of alanine at low O 2, the build-up of glycine and serine at 267 100% O 2, and the proportional lower content in sugars in darkness. The impact of 268 photorespiration on glycine and serine metabolism was also visible with the glycine-to-serine 269 ratio that increased considerably under 100% O 2 (Fig. 1e). 270  271 3.2. Carbon allocation to protein synthesis 272 Isotopic labelling with 13CO 2 during photosynthesis was carried out in order to follow the 273 metabolic partitioning of fixed carbon into proteins. Labelling with 13CO 2 was obviously not 274 performed in the dark since there was no photosynthetic CO 2 fixation. There was a clear 13C 275 incorporation into prot eins as shown by the 13C percentage above natu ral abundance (Fig. 2a). 276 When converted into absolute units (acc ounting for both leaf protein content and % 13C), the 277 allocation flux to proteins increased up to four times as the O 2/CO 2 ratio decreased showing the 278 10  impact of source carbon fixation to protein synthesis (Fig. 2b ). In fact, at low oxygen, the 13C 279 flux represented about 0.2 µmol m-2 s-1. However, when normalized to photosynthesis, 280 allocation fell within a narrow range of 1 to  2.5% of photosynthesis, with higher values at 100% 281 O2 perhaps suggesting a specific effect  of high oxygen on protein synthesis . 282  283 3.3. Polysome abundance 284 Polysome abundance was measured using the gradient method based on absorbance at 260 nm 285 using the signal of the polysome gradient region  (Fig. 3a). There was a substantial difference 286 in particular when comparing low O 2/CO 2 to other conditions: in fact, when expressed in 287 normalized units (% of total trac e signal), polysome relative a bundance was signif icantly higher 288 at high photosynthesis (Fig. 3b). Polysome  abundance tended to be lower at high 289 photorespiration (100% O 2) compared to that in darkness. Also, as expected, there was a 290 significant effect of O 2 mole fraction in darkness w ith less polysomes at low oxygen , 291 highlighting the specific effect of hypoxia . Of course, this analysis  encompasses all polysome 292 fractions in the same peak (organellar and cyto solic) but taken as a whol e, the polysome content 293 was found to be affected by gaseous conditions, and in the light, correlated to the photosynthetic 294 rate.  295  296 3.4. Phosphorylation of eIFs and RPs 297 The phosphoproteomics analysis allowed th e detection and qua ntification of 2,057 298 phosphopeptides (representing 1,044 individual proteins), among which 69 (3.3%) were 299 associated with protein synthesis (translation elongation factors,  translation init iation factors, 300 ribosomal proteins and other proteins associ ated with translation). The list of unique 301 phosphopeptides is provided in Table 1 and some  of them are illustrated in Fig. 4. Phosphosites 302 identified here have been found previously, except for two of them: Ser 47/Thr 51 in the 303 nucleus-encoded chloroplastic ribosomal protein RPS9 (AT1G74970), and Ser 149 of eIF2Bδ 304 (AT1G48970) (Table 1). Phosphopep tides were filtered to carry out statistics, by keeping only 305 those with less than 20% missing values. Univar iate analysis with ANOVA conducted with the 306 69 translation-related phosphopeptides, showed  that 17 phosphopeptides were significantly 307 affected by O 2/CO 2 conditions, representing 11 proteins (F ig. 4a). Hierarchical clustering 308 showed that there were distributed in two gr oups. The first cluster was assocatied with higher 309 phosphorylation at high photosynthe sis and comprised RPS6A and RPS6B at phosphosite Ser 310 240 (detailed in Fig. 4b). The second cluster was associated with lower phosphorylation as 311 photosynthesis increased (and higher phosphorylati on in the dark) and comprised eIF4G at 312 phosphosites Ser 178 (detailed in Fig. 4b). Multivariate analysis conducted on the 69 313 translation-related phosphopeptides  yielded a very good OPLS model (R² = 0.954; Q² = 0.916) 314 that was robust (negative Q² int at –0.265) and highly significant ( PCV-ANOVA  = 710-13) (Fig. 4c). 315 The volcano plot that combines univariate and multivariate analysis showed that best 316 biomarkers of O 2/CO 2 conditions were RPS6 and eIF3 d phosphopeptides (increased with 317 photosynthesis), and eIF4G and eIF5A2 phosphope ptides (decreased at high photosynthesis) 318 (Fig. 4d). Taken as a whole, the phosphopattern found here indicates th at phosphorylation that 319 promoted translation (such as RPS6 phosphoryl ation) increased whil e phosphorylation that 320 inhibits translation (such as eI F4G) decreased with photosynthe sis. Changes observed here in 321 phosphopeptide abundance were not due to cha nges in total protein amounts but were 322 11  effectively due to modifications in phosphoryl ation level, since none of the significant 323 phosphopeptides were associated wi th significant variation in tota l protein content (Fig. S3). 324   325   326 12  4. Discussion 327  328 4.1. Protein synthesis increases with CO 2/O2 329 We find that the 13C-flux to proteins increases with phot osynthesis (Fig. 2b) and our estimate 330 of the absolute carbon allocation to protein synthesis was 0.1-0.2 µmol m-2 s-1, that is, 3 to 6 µg 331 protein m-2 s-1. This estimate agrees with the order of magnitude of pr otein turnover rate 332 estimated using inhibitors ( ≈0.2 µmol C m-2 s-1) [46] or 14C-tracing (between 0.1 and 0.25 µmol 333 m-2 s-1 depending on light conditions) [33] and the average protei n synthesis rate of 6.25 µg 334 protein m-2 s-1 (assuming a specific leaf area of 180 g FW m-2) found in Arabidopsis rosettes 335 using 13C labelling [6].  336 The physiological impact of protein synthesi s not only relates to carbon allocation but 337 also to energy consumption since translati on consumes a substantial amount of ATP. In effect, 338 the average amount of ATP requi red per amino acid added during translation is about 5 [47]. 339 The order of magnitude of the rate associat ed with protein synthesis (0.1-0.2 µmol C m-2 s-1) 340 represents an ATP budget of ≈0.25 µmol ATP m-2 s-1. Of course, the rate of protein synthesis 341 was obtained via isotope labelli ng and includes not only cytopl asmic but also chloroplastic 342 protein synthesis. Therefore, the ATP demand must be met by both photosynthetic light 343 reactions in the chloroplast and day respiration in the cytoplasm.  344 It is worth noting that day respiration generates about 0.5 µmol CO 2 m-2 s-1 [48] i.e. 2.6 345 µmol ATP m-2 s-1 (using a conversion factor of 31.5 ATP per catabolized glucose molecule) 346 and thus, protein synthesis represents about 0.25/2.6 = 10% of metabolic energy generated by 347 day respiration. That said, cytoplasmic ATP not only comes from catabolism (reoxidation of 348 NADH produced by day respiratory metabolism) but also from photorespiration (reoxidation 349 of photorespiratory NADH coming fr om glycine-to-serine conversion), which in turn depends 350 on CO 2 and O 2. The contribution of photorespirati on to meet the ATP demand might  explain 351 why protein synthesis was found here to declin e more slowly than photosynthesis when the 352 O2/CO 2 ratio increased (i.e., 2% of photosynthesis at high O 2 vs. 1% of photosynthesis at high 353 CO 2; Fig. 2c) despite the down-re gulation of translation ( further explained below ). This would 354 be consistent with the non-qua ntitative recycling of photorespi ratory intermediates such as 355 glycerate at high photorespiration [49]. In other words, ATP that is not used to reform 3- 356 phosphoglycerate from glycerate co uld have been used by other processes such as protein 357 synthesis. 358 The increase in 13C-allocation when CO 2/O2 increased was accompanied by an increased 359 proportion of ribosomes in polysomes (Fig. 3)  demonstrating an augmented translational 360 activity. Furthermore, this correlated with a si gnificant increase in RPS6  phosphorylation at Ser 361 240 (substrate phosphosite of RPS6 kinase) (Fig. 4) which is usually  typical of the stimulation 362 of ribosomal activity to initiate translation (but see [50] in yeast) . There was also a stimulation 363 of translation initiation via the phosphorylation of a number of eIFs, such as eIF4B2 (further 364 discussed below). Taken as a whole, our data show that when the CO 2-to-O 2 ratio increases, 365 there is an increase in protein synthesis (in absolute terms, i.e. in moles of 13C committed to 366 protein production) and this is refl ected by higher translational activity. 367  368 4.2. Involvement of protein phosphorylation 369 13  In addition to RPS6, we found th at other proteins involved in translation were phosphorylated, 370 with significant changes with O 2/CO 2 (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, the role of phosphorylation is not 371 always well-known for many initiation factors eIFs  (or ribosomal proteins). Phosphorylation 372 might be linked to mechanisms of regulation of  translation under our conditions. For example, 373 it seems that eIF4G phosphorylation (at Ser 178)  inhibits translation as photorespiration 374 increases while eIF4B2 and eIF3d phosphorylati on stimulates translat ion as photosynthesis 375 increases (for further details on potential roles of phosphoryla tion sites, see Supplementary 376 Text). In addition to eIFs, our analysis f ound that phosphorylation of the elongation factor 377 eEF5A2 (also known as initiation factor eIF5A) anti-correlated with phot osynthesis, suggesting 378 that translation down-regulation also involve s an inhibition of el ongation. While eEF5 379 phosphorylation  (at Ser 2) is poo rly documented in plants and ha s been suggested to have no 380 effect in yeast, eEF5 activity is also known to be controlled by hypusinati on at the consensus 381 site K-x-G- (HypK)-H-G-x-A-K in yeast and Mammals (for a review, see [ 51]). A hypusination 382 site is present in Arabidopsis  eEF5 (at Lys 51) and hypusinati on has been shown to occur in 383 planta [52]. Here, hypusination co uld not be analyzed (in fact , the hypusination site GKHG is 384 cleaved by trypsin). There was no  correlation between translation activity (photosynthesis) and 385 the content in hypusine precursors, polyamines (Fig. S4). 386 Amongst phosphopeptides with more than 20% missing data, one possessed a clear 387 trend with photosynthesis (missing data mostly corresponded to samples collected in the dark) 388 and was associated with nucleol in (NUC-L1; Table 1). There wa s a clear positive relationship 389 between photosynthesis and nucle olin phosphorylation (Fig. S5). Nucleolin has been shown to 390 be associated with a variety of cellular pro cesses including in plants [53, 54]. Nucleolin 391 phosphorylation has been extensively documen ted in Mammals, where CK2-mediated 392 phosphorylation triggers nucleolin  relocation to the cytoplasm and stimulates its helicase 393 activity so as to facilitate internal ribosomal entry and translation of specific mRNAs [55-57]. 394 In fact, the phosphosite found he re at Ser 163 corresponds to  a typical CK2 phosphorylation 395 motif (with at least two acidi c residues downstream of phos phorylated Ser) (Table 1). 396 It is worth noting that RPS6A and B were not the sole RPs detected here, since we also 397 found phosphopeptides associated with RPP1 A/2A, significantly less abundant at high 398 photosynthesis (high CO 2, low O 2) (Fig. 4). It suggests that unlike RPS6, phosphorylation of 399 these two RPs inhibits translati on. This agrees with the recogn ized role of phosphorylation at 400 the C-terminus (here, Ser 102/120) by CK2 in promoting RPP1/RPP2 dissociation and RPP1 401 degradation in yeast [58-60].  402  403 4.3. Potential mechanisms 404 Our data suggest that phosphorylation events play  an important role in regulating translation 405 activity when O 2/CO 2 varies, as reflected by the progre ssive RPS6 phosphoryl ation. RPS6 is 406 phosphorylated by RPS6 kinase (S6K) which is in turn activated (phosphorylated) via the 407 mTOR pathway. Also recently, in Arabidopsis , MRF1 (MA3 domain-c ontaining translation 408 regulatory factor 1) has been shown to inter act physically with eIF4A and appears to be 409 phosphorylated via mTOR [61]. eIF2B δ1 has recently been shown to be a direct 410 phosphorylation target of mTOR in Arabidopsis  (eIF2Bδ1 being more phosphorylated in the 411 presence of sucrose) at the same phosphosite as  that found here [62]. More generally, several 412 eIFs have been shown to be amongst phosphoryl ation targets of the mTOR pathway, such as 413 14  eIF4G, eIF4B1, eIF2 β1 and eIF6A [62]. Since the mTOR pathway mediates nutrient signaling 414 [63], it might suggest that the cellular content in free sugars  and/or amino acids drive the 415 response observed here. However, under our cond itions, there was no relationship between total 416 amino acid content and protein synthesis (Fig s. 1-3). Similarly, th ere was no correlation 417 between protein synthesis and sucrose content since sucrose (which was rather variable) 418 appeared to be significantly lower under both low and high O 2 (Fig. S4). To gain insight on 419 possible relationships with metabolites, we  conducted a correlation analysis between 420 metabolites and phosphosites (Fig. S6). As expecte d, multivariate analysis showed there was a 421 positive relationship between significant phosphosite s (such as RPS6B) and metabolites driven 422 by O 2/CO 2 such as fructose or alanine (and a ne gative relationship with photorespiratory 423 metabolites glycine and serine) (Fig. S6a). Direct  regression analysis also showed a negative 424 relationship between eIF2B α phosphorylation (significantl y enhanced at 100% O 2, Fig. 4) and 425 sugars maltose and trehalose (Fig. S6b) . It is thus likely that metabolic signalling participating 426 in phosphorylation changes involved  (i) a metabolite other than sucrose or amino acids (such 427 as triose phosphates or trehalose 6-phosphate) and/or (ii) another pathway interacting with 428 mTOR, such as SnRK1 signaling which is believed to interact with mTOR , and has been shown 429 to inhibit mTOR-mediated RPS6 phosphorylation  in plants  [64, 65]. The possible involvement 430 of SnRK1 is further discusse d in the Supplementary Text. 431  432 4.4. Conclusions and perspectives 433 Taken as a whole, our result s show that cytoplasmic prot ein synthesis increases with 434 photosynthesis via the stimulation of translation initia tion. The molecular mechanism of this 435 effect involves protein phosphorylation, in part icular of RPs and eIFs. However, other 436 mechanisms not examined here could have contri buted, such as changes in mRNA stability or 437 upstream open reading frames (uORF) translat ion that can mediate metabolic sensing and 438 control ribosome dissociation from specifi c mRNAs [66, 67]. We  recognize that (i) the present 439 analysis was focused on protein synthesis whil e protein degradation might be affected by 440 photosynthetic conditions and (ii) the stimulation of cytoplasmic translation is likely to concern 441 specific mRNAs leading to differential protein turnover (for example, proteins involved in 442 photosynthesis might be synthesized more activel y when photosynthesis increases). Also, it 443 could be interesting to examine molecular m echanisms further, for example by measuring 444 mTOR activity in different photosynthetic cont exts. These aspects will be addressed in a 445 subsequent study. 446  447   448 15  Acknowledgements 449 The authors acknowledge the support by public grants overseen by the French National 450 Research Agency (ANR) through a Jeunes Cher cheurs project (contract 12-0001-01) and the 451 Investissement d’Avenir  program through the Labex Saclay  Plant Sciences (ANR-10-LABX- 452 0040-SPS) for a post-doctoral grant (to S.M.).

Metabolism of Arabidopsis rosettes under different O 2/CO 2 conditions . (a) Heat map showing metabolites (from GC-MS metabolomics pr ofiling) significantly different between O 2/CO 2 conditions in the light using a one-way ANOVA ( P<0.01). Hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation) is shown on left. Metabolite conten ts (mean-centered values) are shown with colors (color scale on top). Since most metabolites change considerably in dark ness, dark conditions are not included in the heat map so as to show metabolites only significantly af fected by photosynthetic conditions per se. Main groups identified by clustering ar e boxed and labelled with numbers. For each O 2/CO 2 condition, the n = 6 samples are shown , except under standard conditions (21% O 2-380 µmol mol-1 CO 2) where n = 9. (b) Volcano plot showing most discriminating metabolites, with –log( P-value) ( y axis) and the loading in the OPLS analysis (p corr(1); x axis). The red dash-dotted line stands for the Bonferroni threshold. (c) Photosynthesis (net CO 2 assimilation) measured by gas exchange . (d) Total content in proteogenic amino acids (relative to internal standard, ribitol, and normalized to DW). (e) Glycine-to-serine ratio. In (a), numbers on right refer to grou ps (metabolite clusters) discussed in  main text. Numbers associated with metabolite names refer to distinct derivatives (a nalytes) of the same metabolite. In (c-e), letters stand for statistical classes ( P<0.05). In (c), the rate of CO 2 evolution (respiration) in darkness is also indicated (either in 0% or 21% O 2) and in (d-e), values obtained in the dark at 21% O 2 are also shown.

List of phosphopeptides found here, associated with protein synthesis . The column “New” indicates phosphosites that are absent  from (Boex-Fontvieille et al. 2014) and references therein, and the database Phosphat 4.0 (http://phosphat.uni-hohenheim.de/). “Occ.” Indicates when a phosphopeptide was found to  be occasionally detected, that is, missing across more than 20% of the samples. Statistics reported in Fig. 4 only used non-occasional phosphopeptides, that  is, with less than 20% missing  values. In the column “Comments”, the term “common to” means that the phosphopeptides (with the same sequence) can also be fo und in other isoforms of the protein, but disambiguation could be done here. The nomenclature for eEFs and eIFs is after [12], except for the ubiquitin-binding elongation factor eEF1B (AT5G53330) wh ich is recognized as an elongation factor in TAIR but is  not listed in [12] and is also refered to as a cell wall proline-rich protein in Protein Data Bank.  ATG number Name Phosphosite Comments New Sequence Occ. Elongation  factors (eEF)AT1G07920   eEF1‐alpha Thr82  FE(pT)TKYYCTVIDAPGHR Yes AT1G30230   eEF1B‐beta Thr91  ISGVSAEGSGVIVEGSAPITEEAVA (pT)PPAADSK Yes AT5G53330   eEF1B‐related Ser58  Ubiquitin ‐binding elongation  factor N(pS)SFQHNTSPSSGIGIR Yes AT1G69410   eEF5A3 Ser2  (pS)DDEHHFESSDAGASKAT1G26630   eEF5A2 Ser2  M(pS)DDEHHFEASESGASK     Ser2  (pS)DDEHHFEASESGASK  Initiation  factors (eIF)AT2G34970   eIF2B‐epsilon  Thr522 DKLSEITQAIDDDD (pT)DDESVVPTSGELK AT1G48970   eIF2B‐delta 2 Ser149 Yes LSA(pS)LPNGGFDLTLAVR AT1G72340   eIF2B‐alpha Ser18  RSSN (pS)PPMADTTR   Ser18  SSN(pS)PPMADTTR Yes AT5G38640   eIF2B‐delta 1 Ser126 SSVPVA (pS)SLPGIGMDSMAAAK Yes    Ser88  VAVAGAAASAV (pS)PSSFSYSSR Yes    Thr230 A(pT)SQKNDVAVATGAAEK Yes    Ser108 DFPDGSTTA (pS)PGR Yes    Ser108 RDFPDGSTTA (pS)PGR   Ser69  LN(pS)SDTFPLR Yes AT5G25780   eIF3B2 Ser684 common to eIF3B1 QNLRDGEV (pS)DVEEDEYEAK Yes AT3G56150   eIF3C1 Tyr35  (pY)LQSGSEDDDDTDTKR   Ser38/40 YLQ(s)G(s)EDDDDTDTKRAT4G20980   eIF3d Thr74  NLSNPSARPN (pT)GSKAT3G13920   eIF4A1 Ser4  AG(pS)APEGTQFDAR Yes    Thr145 common to eIF4A2 VHACVGG (pT)SVRAT3G26400   eIF4B1 Ser237 (pS)STFGSSFGDSGQEER Yes AT1G13020   eIF4B2 Thr283 KADTEVSE (pT)PTAVK AT3G60240   eIF4G Ser178 TT(pS)APPNMDDQKR    Ser710 STEGSSHASSEISGS (pS)PQEK    Ser1527 QVLQGPSATVN (pS)PR AT2G24050   eIFiso4G2 Ser512 Yes (pS)LSVNSR Yes AT1G77840   eIF5  Ser200 NH(pS)SDEDISPK   Ser200/201 NH(s)(s)DEDISPK Yes 26 Other molecular  actorsAT1G64790   ILA Ser1887 ILITHYIA (activator  of GCN2 and thus of eIF2)  ALLEGG(pS) DDEGASTEAQGR Yes AT1G80930   MCP Ser187 MIF4G domain‐containing  spliceosome  subunit  VIADKP (pS)DEEDDR Ser187 VIADKP (pS)DEEDDRQRSer80  RKET (pS)DDEELARSer112 IEVD (pS)DGDGERRSer112 RIEVD (pS)DGDGERAT1G48920   NUC‐L1 Ser163 Nuclear RNA binding protein L1 (ribosome  synthesis) ESSSEDDS (pS)SEDEPAKKPAAK Yes  Ribosomal  proteinsAT3G58660   RPL10 E Ser6  TTAV (pS)PPPPQEQQLVHASQTSR   Yes AT2G42740   RPL11A Thr46  common to RPL11B, RPL11C and RPL11D VLEQLSG Q(pT)PVFSK AT5G23900   RPL13D Thr138 AGDS(pT) PEELANATQVQGDYMPIASVK Yes AT3G09200   RPP0B Ser305 VEEKEE (pS)DEEDYGGDFGLFDEE Yes AT3G11250   RPP0C Ser308 KEE(pS)DEEDYEGGFGLFDEE Yes Ser308 VEEKKEE (pS)DEEDYEGGFGLFDEE Yes AT1G01100   RPP1A Ser102 common to RPP1B and RPP1C KDEPAEE (pS)DGDLGFGLFD Ser102 common to RPP1B and RPP1C KKDEPAEE (pS)DGDLGFGLFDAT2G27720   RPP2A Ser120 common to RPP2B and RPP2D EEKKEEKEE (pS)DDDMGFSLFE Yes Ser120 common to RPP2B and RPP2D KEEKEE (pS)DDDMGFSLFEAT2G27710   RPP2B Ser12 0 common to RPP2A and RPP2D EEKKEEKEE (pS)DDDMGFSLFE Yes Ser120 common to RPP2A and RPP2D KEEKEE (pS)DDDMGFSLFESer77  LASVPSGGGGGVAVA (pS)ATSGGGGGGGASAAESK  Yes AT5G57290   RPP3B Ser90  common to RPP3A KEE(pS)EEEEGDFGFDLFG Yes Ser90  common to RPP3A KKEE (pS)EEEEGDFGFDLFG Yes AT2G45710   RPS27A Ser29  common to RPS27B and RPS27C LVQ(pS)PNSFFMDVKAT2G41840   RPS2C Ser273 AL(pS)TSKPDPVVEDQA Yes AT3G04840   RPS3Aa Ser236 LMDVHGDY (pS)AEDVGVKAT4G31700   RPS6A Ser240 L(pS)SAAAKPSVTA Yes Ser240 SRL(pS)SAAAKPSVTASer237/240 (s)RL(s)SAAAKPSVTAAT5G10360   RPS6B Ser240 L(pS)SAPAKPVAASer240 SRL(pS)SAPAKPVAASer237/240 (s)RL(s)SAPAKPVAAAT1G74970   RPS9 (chloroplastic)   Ser47/Thr51 Yes RA(s)LSITA(t)VSAPPEEEEIVELKK Yes AT5G15200   RPS9B Ser68  DLLTLDEK (pS)PR Yes
