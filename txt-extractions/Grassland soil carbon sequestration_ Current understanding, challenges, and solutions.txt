REVIEWGrassland soil carbon sequestration: Currentunderstanding, challenges, and solutionsYongfei Bai1,2*and M. Francesca Cotrufo3Grasslands store approximately one third of the global terrestrial carbon stocks and can act as animportant soil carbon sink. Recent studies show that plant diversity increases soil organic carbon (SOC)storage by elevating carbon inputs to belowground biomass and promoting microbial necromasscontribution to SOC storage. Climate change affects grassland SOC storage by modifying the processesof plant carbon inputs and microbial catabolism and anabolism. Improved grazing management andbiodiversity restoration can provide low-cost and/or high-carbon-gain options for natural climatesolutions in global grasslands. The achievable SOC sequestration potential in global grasslands is2.3 to 7.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (CO 2e year−1) for biodiversity restoration,148 to 699 megatons of CO 2e year−1for improved grazing management, and 147 megatons ofCO2e year−1for sown legumes in pasturelands.Grassland ecosystems cover an area of52.5 million km2, accounting for ~40.5%of the Earth ’s land surface excludingGreenland and Antarctica ( 1). Grasslandsprovide habitats for biodiversity, con-tribute to food production, and deliver manycultural services ( 1). They also store ~34% ofthe terrestrial carbon stock ( 1), with ~90% oftheir carbon stored belowground as root bio-mass and soil organic carbon (SOC), thusplaying a vital role in soil carbon sequestration(1,2). However, grasslands are highly vulner-able to human disturbance (e.g., overgrazingand land-use conversion to agriculture) andclimate change ( 1–3). Worldwide, grasslandshave undergone severe decreases in biodi-versity and ecosystem functions, leading toreductions in SOC storage ( 2,4,5). Here, wereview the recent advances in our understandingof SOC dynamics, current challenges, and pos-sible solutions to enhance SOC sequestration inglobal grassland ecosystems. We address threequestions: (i) How do key biotic and abiotic fac-tors regulate grassland SOC formation, turnover,and stability?; (ii) how do climate warming,alterations in precipitation, and fire affect SOCstorage?; and (iii) how does grazing manage-ment affect SOC and how can improved prac-tices result in SOC sequestration?Mechanisms and drivers of SOC sequestrationIn grassland ecosystem s, ~60% of net primaryproductivity is allocated belowground ( 6).Belowground carbon inputs are more oftenincorporated into SOC than abovegroundinputs because of their chemical composition(e.g., aliphatic compounds and root exudates)and their presence in the soil (Fig. 1) ( 6). Onaverage, root carbon inputs have a SOC stabi-lization efficiency that is five times greaterthan aboveground carbon inputs ( 6).Organic carbon in soil is distributed betweenparticulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) fractions,with only a minor portion (1 to 2%) present asdissolved organic matter. POM and MAOMdiffer in their formation, physical and chem-ical properties, and mean residence times insoil ( 7,8). POM is formed from the fragmen-tation of plant and microbial residues, andtherefore is composed of lightweight fragmentsmade of large polymers (Fig. 1). MAOM, bycontrast, is formed from single small moleculesthat are leached from plant residues or exudedfrom plant roots, which associate to mineralsdirectly (ex vivo) or after microbial assimilation(in vivo) as microbial necromass ( 7,8). MAOMon average has a lower carbon:nitrogen ratiobecause of its proportionally higher microbialorigin, its longer mean residence time in soils(from decades to centuries) compared withPOM (<10 years to decades), and its strongchemical bonding to minerals and physicalprotection in fine aggregates ( 7,8). Therefore,MAOM contributes to longer-term carbonsequestration in soil. Root exudates such asdissolved sugars, amino acids, and organicacids are the key pathway to MAOM formationlargely through microbial in vivo transforma-tions (Fig. 1) ( 8,9).

Only the topsoil microbial necromass C andcorresponding SOC data ( n= 223) were used for global and regional synthesis.All data were classified into different grassland types within regions on the basis ofsampling site information from the original study, Asia (eight grassland types,n= 122), North America (five grassland types, n= 47), and Europe (three grasslandtypes, n= 54). Within each grassland type, mean and standard error for eachvariable were calculated across different sampling sites.

Ap-proximately 46% of root exudates, 9% of roottissues, and 7% of aboveground carbon residuesare transformed into MAOM, whereas 19% ofroot litter is transformed into POM across crops,grasses, and trees growing in the field and undercontrolled laboratory conditions ( 10). Thus,plants with greater carbon allocation to rootscontribute more to soil carbon sequestration,particularly the formation of MAOM. However,it remains largely unclear how the contribu-tions of roots (root exudates and root litter) andaboveground inputs to SOC accumulation (POMand MAOM) change with grassland types, soilproperties, and climate conditions.In grassland topsoils, 50 to 75% of SOC isf o u n di nM A O M .T h ea v e r a g ec a r b o n : n i t r o g e nvaries from ~10 to ~12 for MAOM and from~16 to ~18 for POM ( 3); therefore, the accrualof SOC in MAOM requires substantially greaternitrogen than the equivalent accrual in POM(11). The formation of POM is primarily drivenby climate (temperature and precipitation). Bycontrast, the accumulation of MAOM is con-trolled by soil properties such as silt and claycontent, cation-exchange capacity, and micro-bial nitrogen availability, which means that itmay saturate ( 8,12). In European grasslands,topsoil carbon storage in MAOM saturates at~50 g C kg−1soil, beyond which the additionalincrease in SOC storage completely dependsupon accrual in POM ( 11). Currently, mostEuropean grasslands (80%) are below satu-ration, indicating a large capacity for SOCs e q u e s t r a t i o ni nt h e i rt o p s o i l s( 11).Plant diversity is a key driver of SOC for-mation and storage ( 4). High plant diversityenhances SOC storage by elevating below-ground carbon (i.e., root biomass and rootexudates) inputs ( 13,14) and promoting mi-crobial growth, turnover, and entombment ofnecromass ( 15). Maintaining consistently highlevels of biodiversity and root carbon inputsis essential for enhancing SOC storage andpersistence in grasslands (Fig. 1).Fungi and bacteria have a strong influenceon SOC accumulation, stabilization, and turn-over in grasslands (Fig. 1), as in other terres-trial ecosystems ( 6,16). Microbial necromassplays an important role in SOC accumulationand stabilization ( 9,17). In the topsoil of globalgrasslands, the contribution of the microbialnecromass to total SOC ranges from 23 to 74%,with an average of 50% (Fig. 2A), which isgreater than its contribution in agriculturaland temperate forest soils ( 17,18). The con-tribution of necromass to SOC changes withsoil depth ( 18) and is typically dominated byfungal necromass, with the fungi-to-bacterianecromass carbon ratio ranging from 1.2 to4.1 across global grasslands (Fig. 2B). This islikely because fungi produce more chemicallyrecalcitrant structural compounds and havegreater carbon use efficiency than bacteria(6,16). Moreover, mycorrhizal fungi, which livein association with plant roots and derive theircarbon directly from the plant, can regulate thecarbon sequestration capacity in soil. Carbonsequestration capacity per unit nitrogen in soilis 1.7 times greater in ecosystems dominatedby ectomycorrhizal fungi –associated plants (e.g.,savannas, shrublands, and forests) than in sys-tems dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi –associated plants (e.g., nonwoody grass-lands) because ectomycorrhizal fungi can pro-duce enzymes to degrad eo r g a n i cn i t r o g e nfrom plant litter ( 19). However, MAOM is rela-tively higher in ecosystems that are dominatedby arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( 13), such asgrasslands.Climate regulates the metabolic activity ofmicrobes and thus controls large-scale patternsof microbial necromass and SOC storage ( 18,20).At the global scale, cold, moist soils promotethe accumulation of microbial necromass car-bon. The maximum microbial necromass car-bon occurs at a mean annual precipitation of900 to 1000 mm with a mean annual temper-ature <0°C (Fig. 2C), indi cating high prioritiesfor preserving the current stocks in these sys-tems. Few studies have measured the contri-bution of microbial necromass carbon to SOCin grassland soils, and data are lacking fromBaiet al.,Science 377, 603 –608 (2022) 5 August 2022 3o f6Light grazingModerate grazingHeavy grazingChange in soil organic carbon stock (%) Change in soil organic carbon stock (%)Zhou  et al . 44Byrnes  et al . 43Eze et al . 50 –5 –10 –15 –20 –25 –30N=36N=56N=100N=61N=44N=67N=74N=59N=65Nitrogen fertilizerAmmonium nitrateAmmonium sulfateUreaPotassium phosphateOrganic amendmentsLimingRotational versus no grazingRotational versus continuous grazing01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0N=71N=28N=9N=24N=5N=244N=89 (38.5 yr)N=58 (22 yr)N=59 (22 yr)N=35 (22 yr)N=108 (26.7 yr)N=13 (8.3 yr)N=4 (9.8 yr)N=93 (18.8 yr)N=94 (23 yr)N=15N=44N=20Improved grazingLow diversityMedium diversityHigh diversityFertilizationSowing legumesSowing grassesCoversion from agriculture to grassCoversion from native to grassSoil carbon sequestration rate (Mg C ha-1 yr-1)0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.5 0.5A BCFig. 3.

Recently,microbial diversity was found to promote thestabilization efficiency of grass litter –derivedPOM but to reduce that of MAOM ( 22).Climate change impacts on SOC sequestrationSixty-seven percent of the world ’s grasslandsare distributed in semiarid, arid, and cold cli-mates, with only 23% occurring in humid cli-mates ( 1). Thus, carbon sequestration in mostgrasslands is highly sensitive to climate change,which can exert strong and diverse impacts onSOC accrual and stability through plant- andmicrobial-mediated mechanisms ( 8). The im-pacts of climate change on soil carbon seques-tration often vary with grassland type, climate,and soil conditions. In semiarid st eppe, warm-ing may enhance root-derived carbon inputbut inhibit the decomposition of MAOM bysuppressing fungal growth and soil respira-tion, resulting in an increase in the MAOMpool ( 23). In humid tallgrass prairies, warmingmay increase C 4grass cover and C 4-derivedcarbon input into soil organic matter, but italso increases the decay r ate of these fractions,resulting in a negligible change in soil car-bon sequestration ( 24). In alpine grasslands,warming-induced permafrost degradationreduces active-layer SOC storage by decreasingthe stability of microbial networks and accel-erating SOC (and specifically POM) decay ( 25).A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that long-term ( ≥5 years) warming increases the ratiosof ligninase to cellulase activity and enhancesmicrobial utilization of recalcitrant carbon,leading to a 14% reduction in the topsoil re-calcitrant carbon pool ( 26). However, warmingmay increase the accumulation of root-derivedcarbon in the subsoil MAOM pool ( 27). POM ismuch more climate sensitive than MAOM ( 3,11).The percent change in POM ( –12.2%) with cli-mate warming is on average three timesgreater than that in MAOM ( –3.8%) in globalgrasslands ( 28). This suggests that grasslandswith a high proportion of MAOM will contrib-ute less to soil carbon-climate feedbacks.Future projected precipitation anomaliesand long-lasting droughts ( 29,30) will likelyinfluence soil carbon sequestration of grass-land ecosystems by altering plant communitycomposition, productivity and carbon alloca-tion, and microbial processes. In the semiaridsteppe, increased precipitation promotes soilaggregation by stimulating fungal growthand increasing soil-exchangeable magnesium(23). Precipitation anomalies (increases anddecreases) can substanti ally alter root-to-shootratios and vertical root distribution in grass-lands ( 31), thus regulating soil microbial growthand SOC storage. Reduced precipitation strong-ly suppresses oxidase ac tivity, whereas higherprecipitation stimulates the activity of nitrogen-acquisition extracellular enzymes ( 32). However,on the global scale, only a negative tendency forPOM and a positive tendency for MAOM andtotal SOC concentrations with increased precip-itation were observed in grasslands because ofthe limited data availability ( 28).Climate change –induced increases in firefrequency can substantially modify long-termSOC storage in grasslands, particularly insavanna grasslands, by intensifying nutrientlimitation, which suppresses plant growth andcarbon inputs. Elevated fire frequencies reducesoil carbon stocks on average by 0.21 megagramsof carbon per hectare per year (Mg C ha−1year−1)in the upper soil layer (0 to 20 cm) in globalsavanna grasslands ( 33). However, a recent studyshowed that fire suppression (i.e., >60 years offire exclusion) has little effect on total SOC stor-age (0 to 60 cm) in tropical savannas becauseC4grass –derived carbon dominates the SOC,particularly in deeper soil layers, where soilcarbon is less affected by changes in fire fre-quencies ( 34). It remains unclear to what extentdifferent fire regimes regulate plant diversity,above- and belowground biomass allocation,microbial-mediated processes, and SOC stor-age in shallower and deeper soil profiles.Impacts of grazing pressure on grasslandsoil carbonNatural grasslands are grazed by wild ungu-lates, which can enhanc e SOC storage becausethey graze for short periods of time and moveacross the landscape. This results in main-tained plant cover, diversity and productivity,promotion of species with deep roots, micro-bial processing with the formation of bothPOM and MAOM, and soil-mixing processingby soil fauna ( 35,36). Increases in ecosystemmetabolism and plant labile carbon inputs(e.g., root exudates) are expected to increaseboth the ex vivo and in vivo formation ofMAOM ( 9,10,37). Conversely, increased rootinputs and allocation to depth result in higherPOM in the subsoil ( 6,38). In addition, largeherbivores create habitats for many bioturba-tors (e.g., fossorial mammals and soil macro-fauna) to loosen up soil and expose largeraggregates of soil organic matter to organo-mineral interaction by vertical soil mixing ( 36).However, both the direction and magnitude ofeffects of large wild herbivores on soil carbonstorage can vary strong ly with soil nutrientavailability, across grasslands, and under dif-ferent levels of herbivore density. For exam-ple, a recent short-term study suggested thatnutrient availability strongly moderates theimpact of herbivore grazing on soil carbonsequestration in herbaceous grasslands ( 39).Large herbivore grazing increases the upper-layer soil carbon storage under elevated nu-trient (fertilization) conditions but has no effecton soil carbon storage under ambient nutrientconditions ( 39). Sandhage-Hofmann et al.(40)report that elevated elephant densities enhanceSOC stocks [4.7 tons (t) ha−1] despite lossesof woody biomass in moist, semiarid, wood-encroached savannas of south-central Africa.However, a synthesis of 174 experiments showedthat large herbivore exclusion generally increasesSOC storage across different biomes (grassland,f o r e s t ,s h r u b l a n d ,t u n d r a ,w o o d l a n d ,e t c . ) ,s u g -gesting an overall negative impact of large wildherbivores on soil carbon storage ( 41).Livestock grazing is the most common useof grasslands worldwide. Some grasslandsare managed to improve forage quantity andquality, thereby increasing livestock productionand/or SOC storage ( 1,2,42). In livestock-dominated systems, these pathways are stronglycontrolled by grazing inte nsity and rest periods.Continuous livestock grazing reduces plantcover, diversity, and productivity, and thusroot inputs and plant- and microbial-mediatedSOC formation, while stimulating lossesthrough microbial turnover and erosion causedby increased compaction and reduced cover(1,2,43). Eze et al .(5)d e m o n s t r a t e dt h a tlivestock grazing on average decreases SOCstock by 15% across five continents, with thegreatest reduction ( –22.4%) in SOC stock inthe tropics and the least reduction ( –4.5%) intemperate grasslands. At the global scale, lightgrazing (e.g., seasonal and rotational grazing)shows the least negative effects or even pro-motes soil carbon storage, whereas moderateand heavy (continuous) grazing consistentlyreduces soil carbon stocks (Fig. 3A) ( 5,43,44).For a given category of grazing intensity, thediscrepancy in magnitude of changes in SOCstocks between these st udies may partly arisefrom the lack of quantitative measures ofgrazing intensity and the difference in datasources ( 5,43,44). Nevertheless, the magni-tude and directions of grazing impacts on soilcarbon sequestration are context dependentand vary with climate and soil conditions,vegetation properties, livestock type, herbivorediversity, grazing strategies (e.g., continuousversus rotational grazing), and grazing inten-sity and duration ( 5,38,43–45). The negativeimpact of increasing grazing intensity on SOCis lessened with greater water availability(5,44) but is more severe with warmer tem-peratures and longer grazing duration in tem-perate grasslands ( 44). With moderate andheavy grazing, SOC increases in grasslandsdominated by C4species and decreases ingrasslands dominated by C 3species ( 45). Sheepgrazing generally has a greater negative im-pact on SOC than cattle grazing, and the re-duction in SOC with grazing is substantiallygreater in topsoil than that in subsoil ( 44). Amixed cattle and megaherbivore system wasshown to be a sustainable management strat-egy in African savanna ecosystems with highBaiet al.,Science 377, 603 –608 (2022) 5 August 2022 4o f6Downloaded from https://www.science.org at National Cheng Kung University on April 18, 2023herbivore diversity ( 46). Moreover, rotationalgrazing consistently shows higher SOC stockscompared with continuous grazing (or freegrazing) ( 43), with gains observed specificallyin the mineral associated fraction ( 47).Managing for soil carbon storage in grasslandsEmpirical and experimental studies have indi-cated that improving grassland management canincrease SOC storage, thus mitigating carbonlosses caused by climate change, long-term over-grazing, and grassland degradation ( 2,42,48).Management improvements may result in soilcarbon accrual through several interrelatedmechanisms (Fig. 1). Conversion from crop-lands to grasslands removes disturbance fromtillage and increases root carbon inputs to soil(6,42). Restoring the biodiversity of degradedgrasslands may increase plant production andpromote microbial turnover and necromassentombment ( 4,13,15). Grazing improvementcan increase higher-quality root carbon (lowercarbon:nitrogen ratios) inputs ( 38)a n d / o rnitrogen retention, th us promoting the forma-tion and persistence of MAOM in soils ( 47).Sowing legumes increases soil carbon andnitrogen inputs by elevating root biomass,root exudates, and fine root turnover ( 42,49).Applications of inorganic and organic fertilizersmay stimulate primary productivity and high-quality plant carbon inputs to soil, resulting inmore efficient microbial carbon use ( 5,28,50).A number of management interventionshave been adopted to restore grasslands(Fig. 3, B and C). On the global scale, the im-proved grassland managements increase SOCstocks on average by 0.47 Mg C ha−1year−1(42). This suggests that the world ’s grazinglands, which occupy an area of ~34 million km2,have substantial potential to increase SOC stor-age (Fig. 4). Among all improved manage-ment practices, conversion from cultivation tograsslands, increasing plant diversity, sowinglegumes and grasses, and fertilization are asso-ciated with the highest soil carbon sequestra-tion rates (Fig. 3C) ( 4,42). Under moderategrazing intensity, the average SOC stock in-crease (28.4%) is substantially greater withrotational grazing than that with continuousgrazing (Fig. 3B). In the southeast UnitedStates, grassland soils managed with adaptivemulti-paddock grazing that used a high-density-short-duration rotational grazing had more car-bon (72.49 Mg C ha−1) and nitrogen (9.26 MgNh a−1) stocks compared with continuous graz-ing (64.02 Mg C ha−1and 8.52 Mg N ha−1)i nthe 0 to 100 cm soil layer ( 47).

( BandC) Global SOC sequestration potential(Mt CO 2e year−1) through optimizing grazing intensity in grazing lands and sowinglegumes in pasturelands [data are from Griscom et al.(51)]. Only maximumclimate mitigation potential with safeguards for reference year 2030 is shown.GRASSDownloaded from https://www.science.org at National Cheng Kung University on April 18, 2023direction and magnit ude of management ef-fects on soil carbon stock s are context specific,depending on factors such as climate, plantcommunity composition, and soil properties(5,43,50). Therefore, grazing practices needto be implemented with an understanding ofcontext. Moreover, further studies are requiredto examine the synergy and trade-offs amonggrassland biodiversity, primary productivity,and soil carbon sequestration under man-agement interventions.Soil carbon sequestration potential varies inboth quantity and attainability among grass-l a n d sw i t hd i f f e r e n td e g r e e so fd e g r a d a t i o nand across different regions (Fig. 4). Given that~50% of the global grassland area has beendegraded ( 1,2), restoration of grassland coverand biodiversity is an effective strategy forpromoting SOC storage and mitigating thenegative impacts of global climate change(4,15,51–53). For example, the SOC accrualrate with grazing exc lusion is on average0.68 Mg C ha−1year−1in topsoil (0 to 30 cm)and 0.62 Mg C ha−1year−1in subsoil (30 to100 cm) across 145 degraded grassland sites inChina ( 54), indicating that it has not reachedsaturation over the 27-year period of grasslandrestoration.Potential soil carbon sequestration capacitiescan be categorized as theoretical, realistic, orachievable ( 55). Theoretical soil carbon seques-tration capacity refers to the estimate of restor-ing all soils to their natural capacity or evenenhancing it through management interven-tions, realistic soil carbon sequestration capac-ity refers to the optimistic value accounting forsocial and economic con straints, and achieva-ble capacity is the value of a pragmatic sce-nario based on the current trends ( 55). At theglobal scale, the mean theoretical, realistic,and achievable capacities of SOC sequestrationwith grassland restoration are estimated to be10.2, 6.8, and 3.4 billion t CO 2equivalents peryear (CO 2e year−1), respectively (Fig. 4A). Atthe regional scale, Africa, Asia, and Europeare projected to have the largest achievablecapacity of soil carbon sequestration withgrassland restoration, with Oceania and Northand South America exhibiting the least SOCsequestration potential (Fig. 4A). These globalpatterns of SOC sequestration potential areprimarily caused by the differences in averagesoil carbon sequestration rate and the area ofdegraded grassland in different regions. Thegreater SOC sequestration potential with grass-land restoration in Africa and Asia is due to thelarger areas of degraded grasslands in thesecontinents, whereas European grasslands havea higher average soil carbon sequestration rate(Fig. 4A). In addition, optimizing grazing in-tensity (e.g., rotationa l grazing) is projected toincrease soil carbon sequestration potentialby 148 to 699 megatons (Mt) CO2e year−1inglobal grazing lands (Fig. 4B), with the greatestSOC sequestration potential occurring in Cen-tral and South America, Africa, and Asia ( 51).Moreover, sowing legumes is projected toe n h a n c eS O Cs t o r a g eb y1 4 7M tC O 2e year−1in global pasturelands ( 51), with Europe ex-hibiting the greatest soil carbon sequestrationp o t e n t i a lc a u s e db yb o t ht h el a r g e s tp a s t u r e l a n dareas and the highest average soil carbon se-questration rate (Fig. 4C). At both the regionaland global scales, large uncertainties existregarding the projected soil carbon seques-tration potential and rate of accrual. Theseuncertainties are caused by the complex inter-actions among climate change, human activ-ities, and spatial and temporal variations inecosystem and soil responses ( 51,53,56).Scientific research and management innova-tions are required in the future to maximize theattainable SOC storage in global grasslands.ConclusionRecent studies have made considerable prog-ress toward addressing major challenges as-sociated with identifying the capacity and keymechanisms of various grasslands to sequesterand preserve carbon in soils and developingknowledge-based strategies to restore bio-diversity, preserve current SOC stocks, andpromote additional sequestration for climatechange mitigation and sustainable manage-ment in grasslands. These advances highlightthe important roles of plant and soil bio-diversity in regulating the formation of micro-bial necromass carbon, MAOM, and POM,mediating the impacts of climate change,and promoting SOC storage through manage-ment improvements and restoration in globalgrasslands. They also demonstrate that theimpacts of climate change, grazing, fire, grass-land restoration, and mitigation solutions onsoil carbon sequestration are moderated bymultiple context-dependent factors. Futureresearch is needed to address the uncertaintyand context dependency of the proposed miti-gation solutions and their carbon sequestrationpotentials and to consider their possible syn-ergies and trade-offs for biodiversity conserva-tion, climate mitigation, and food production.REFERENCES AND NOTES1.
