Southeast Asiancacao plantations are often established under shade tree cover, but are later converted tonon-shaded monocultures to avoid resource competition. We compared three co-occurringcacao cultivation systems (3 replicate stands each) with different shade intensity (non-shaded monoculture, cacao with the legume Gliricidia sepium shade trees, and cacao withseveral shade tree species) in Sulawesi (Indonesia) with respect to above- and below-ground biomass and productivity, and cacao bean yield. Total biomass C stocks (above-and belowground) increased fivefold from the monoculture to the multi-shade tree system(from 11 to 57 Mg ha-1), total net primary production rose twofold (from 9 to 18 Mg C ha-1yr-1). This increase was associated with a 6fold increase in aboveground biomass, but only a3.5fold increase in root biomass, indicating a clear shift in C allocation to aboveground treeorgans with increasing shade for both cacao and shade trees. Despite a canopy coverincrease from 50 to 93%, cacao bean yield remained invariant across the systems (varia-tion: 1.1 –1.2 Mg C ha-1yr-1). The monocultures had a twice as rapid leaf turnover suggest-ing that shading reduces the exposure of cacao to atmospheric drought, probably resultingin greater leaf longevity. Thus, contrary to general belief, cacao bean yield does not neces-sarily decrease under shading which seems to reduce physical stress. If planned properly,cacao plantations under a shade tree cover allow combining high yield with benefits for car-bon sequestration and storage, production system stability under stress, and higher levelsof animal and plant diversity.IntroductionTropical deforestation and decreasing carbon sinks are one of the major drivers increasing theconcentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2), thereby enforcing global climate changePLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 1/2 2OPEN ACCESSCitation: Abou Rajab Y, Leuschner C, Barus H, TjoaA, Hertel D (2016) Cacao Cultivation under DiverseShade Tree Cover Allows High Carbon Storage andSequestration without Yield Losses.

The funders had no role in studydesign, data collection and analysis, decision topublish, or preparation of the manuscript.(e.g.[ 1–5]). A current hotspot of rainforest conversion is Southeast Asia and in particularIndonesia [ 3,5–8], which lost ~158,000 km2of its forest cover between 2000 and 2012 [ 8,9].Indonesia ’s carbon emissions reached 105 Tg C yr-1between 2000 and 2005 [ 10] and thenation is the world ’s third largest CO 2emitter by now [ 9]. Main driver of deforestation in thisregion is the conversion into agricultural cultivation systems (e.g. [ 3,7,9,11]), notably palmoil, cocoa, and rubber. Cacao ( Theobroma cacao L.) is a crop of the humid tropical lowlands,which is mostly grown by smallholders. Due to the steadily increasing demand for chocolate[12,13], the world cocoa production has increased to ~5 million t in 2012 [FAO StatisticalDatabase; http://faostat.fao.org ] and cacao ranges currently as one of the most importantperennial cash crops worldwide. In Sulawesi (Indonesia), where this study was conducted, thecultivation area of cacao expanded rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s; about 50% of the recentcacao cultivation area is located on former forested land [ 12]. Within the Indonesian archipel-ago, about 65% of Indonesia ’s cacao production is generated on Sulawesi [ 14,15]. Since cacaois an understory rainforest species, it has traditionally been planted beneath the thinned can-opy of primary or old secondary forest [ 12]. In Indonesia, this traditional cultivation systemhas increasingly been altered by removing the shade trees. In many cases, fast-growing andnitrogen-fixing shade trees like Gliricidia ssp. or Erythrina ssp., or trees which provide ediblefruits, timber or other valuable goods were planted instead. Due to the shade requirement ofyoung cacao plants, cacao is still cultivated under shade tree cover in the first years. But nowa-days, shade trees are often completely removed when the cacao matures, because farmers wishto increase cacao bean yield (e.g. [ 12,13,16–19]). The rationale is to reduce assumed competi-tion for light, water and nutrients between cacao and shade trees (e.g. [ 12,17,20]). This changein cultivation practice may have a number of negative consequences, notably losses in biodi-versity, increased soil erosion due to diminished protection from heavy rain, and largelyreduced carbon storage in biomass (e.g. [ 12,21,22]). Moreover, various monetary and non-monetary ecosystem services provided by the shade trees are no longer available to the localcommunity, among them the supply of timber, fuel, and fruit production [ 19]. Even thoughrecent research in tropical agroforests has addressed these benefits, not much is known aboutdifferences in carbon storage and carbon sequestration through net primary production(NPP) in cacao agroforests differing in shade tree cover and diversity. Even fewer studies havedealt with belowground carbon stores and C turnover of cacao agroforests and their depen-dence on variation in canopy cover.The aim of the present study was to compare cacao cultivation systems from zero to highshade intensity with respect to biomass, carbon stores and productivity. In a region of CentralSulawesi with rapid expansion of cacao cultivation in recent time, where shaded and non-shaded cacao production systems co-occur in close neighborhood, we compared three wide-spread systems (non-shaded cacao monoculture, cacao with the legume Gliricidia sepium(Jacq.) as dominant shade tree, and cacao with relatively dense cover of several shade tree spe-cies) with respect to above- and belowground biomass and related carbon (C) stores, and Csequestration with above- and belowground net primary production (NPP) in each three repli-cate plots. We tested the hypotheses that (1) increasing shade tree abundance and diversityincreases above- and belowground carbon storage and productivity, and that (2) increasingshade tree cover decreases cacao bean yield. By quantifying the biomass carbon pools and NPPof the different systems and comparing it with natural forest, we further wanted to assess therole shaded cacao cultivation systems can play in the regional carbon cycle. To our knowledge,this is the first study investigating three co-existing cacao cultivation systems (structurally sim-ple monoculture to complex multi-species agroforest) under equal climatic and soil conditionswith a focus on the carbon cycle and cacao bean yield.Diverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 2/2 2Competing Interests: The authors have declaredthat no competing interests exist.Materials and MethodsOur study complies with the current laws of Indonesia and Germany and with internationalrules. The research permit for the fieldwork in Indonesia was issued by RISTEK (KementerianRiset Dan Teknologi) with the permit number: 275/SIP/FRP/SM/VII/2013. The study itselfwas carried out on private land. The owners of the land gave their permission to conduct thestudy on these sites, thus, no specific permissions were required for these locations. The fieldstudies did not involve endangered or protected species.Study Site Description and Study Plot SelectionThe study was conducted in the Kulawi valley in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, in vicinity of thewestern border of Lore Lindu National Park (01°30´S, 120°02´E) ( Fig 1 ). Annual mean temper-ature in the region was 25°C, annual mean precipitation 2165 mm yr-1[23] without a distinctseasonality during the study time. We studied three different cacao cultivation systems, (i)monoculture of cacao ( Theobroma cacao L.) (‘Cacao-mono ’), (ii) cacao planted with the N-fix-ing legume tree Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) ( ‘Cacao- Gliricidia ’), and (iii) cacao cultivated with sev-eral different shade tree species ( ‘Cacao-multi ’). Three study plots of approx. 20 m x 20 m percultivation system type were selected on private land between the villages Marena and Lempe-lero in the South of Kulawi valley ( Fig 1 andTable 1 ). Apart from the necessary agreement ofthe plot owners, plot selection criteria were sufficient comparability in terms of topography(only low inclination), soil texture (sandy to clayey loam) and chemistry (Cambic Umbrisolswith comparable pH, base saturation and C/N ratio, Table 1 ). Soil chemical parameters weremeasured from six randomly selected soil samples taken at each study site with a soil corer (5cm in diameter) down to a depth of 60 cm (0 –10 cm, 10 –20 cm, 20 –40 cm, and 40 –60 cm).The total carbon and nitrogen concentrations were determined in a CN auto-analyzer (VarioEL III, Hanau, Germany) the total P concentration with ICP-OES analysis after HNO3diges-tion, the plant-available cation concentrations after NH 4Cl extraction and subsequent elementanalysis in the percolate by ICP-OES. To estimate the total carbon pool in the upper 60 cm ofthe soil, we used data of the bulk density of the soil and the soil organic carbon content. Largevariation was found for available P (resin P), which may partly be a result of different timespans since the last fertilization in the plots.Aboveground Stand StructureA stand inventory was conducted in all nine plots at the beginning of the study in summer2011. Tree height was determined using an ultrasonic Vertex III height meter (Haglöf, Lang-sele, Sweden) and stem diameter at breast height (dbh, at 130 cm) was measured using a mea-suring tape. In cases of some cacao and Gliricidia trees, where the stem branched before 130cm height, the stem diameter was measured at the next possible height. Subsequently, thediameter was extrapolated to 1.3 m using species-specific linear allometric regressions betweenheight and diameter, which were obtained by measuring the stem diameter of 10 trees per spe-cies in height-intervals of 10 cm.The diversity of woody species in the plots was quantified with Shannon-Wiener ’sH’(eq 1):H¼/C0Xðpi/C2log piÞ; ð1Þwith H being the diversity index, p irepresenting the relative abundance of species i (p i=n i/N),nithe number of individuals per species i, and N the total number of species per study plot.Diverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 3/2 2Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and Belowground Biomass (BGB)The AGB of cacao trees was calculated using the allometric equation of Beer et al. [ 24], see eq2). For the AGB estimation of Gliricidia sepium and all other shade tree species, we used theallometric equation of Chave et al. [ 25] for tropical moist forest trees ( eq 3). The AGB of onesingle coconut palm individual ( Cocos nucifera L.) in the plots was calculated after Hairiahet al. [ 26]u s i n g eq 4.

In two cases, where no infor-mation on wood density from these sources was available, we used the plot average of wooddensity as an estimate (e.g. [ 15,30,31].The BGB was estimated indirectly from the AGB using eq 6 after Cairns et al. [ 32].BGB¼expð/C01:0587þ0:8836 ln ðAGBÞÞ ð 6ÞAs this equation delivers data on coarse root and root stock biomass, but not on ﬁne rootbiomass, we added the standing ﬁne root biomass from our own inventory down to 3 m soildepth to the BGB on each plot (see description below).To obtain profile totals of standing fine root biomass, root inventory data from the uppersoil (0 –60 cm) and from deep soil pits (0 –300 cm) were obtained and combined as follows; Forrecording the standing fine root mass, twelve randomly selected soil samples were taken ateach study site with a soil corer (3.5 cm in diameter) down to a depth of 60 cm (0 –10 cm, 10 –20 cm, 20 –40 cm, and 40 –60 cm).In the laboratory, the root samples were soaked in water and cleaned of soil residues using asieve with a mesh size of 1 mm. Large root fractions ( >10 mm in length) were picked out byhand. Living and dead rootlets were distinguished under the stereomicroscope by color, rootelasticity, and the degree of cohesion of cortex, periderm, and stele following the method ofLeuschner et al. [ 33]. For half of the samples, an additional, more detailed analysis of small fineroot particles ( <10 mm in length) was conducted applying a method introduced by Van Praaget al. [ 34] and modified by Hertel and Leuschner [ 35]. The mass of small rootlets was extrapo-lated to the entire sample by a regression analysis of small rootlets to large rootlets. Alterna-tively, a mean ratio of small to large root fractions was used if not enough data for performinga regression analysis was available.In order to analyze the standing fine root biomass also in the subsoil to 300 cm depth, soilpits were excavated at each study site. In the cacao monoculture systems, each two soil pits ca.80 cm distant to randomly selected cacao trees were excavated. In case of the shaded cacaoagroforests, two soil pits each for two cacao trees and two shade trees were excavated (i.e. aver-age half way between the stems). Root biomass was recorded by extracting soil monoliths of 30cm x 30 cm x 20 cm size (l x w x d) down to 120 cm in the soil profile, and of 30 cm x 30 cm x40 cm in the 120 –300 cm layer, respectively. The roots were separated by species and into fineroots (roots <2 mm in diameter), large roots (2 –5 mm in diameter), and coarse roots ( >5m min diameter).In plot #6, the deep soil pits could only be excavated to a depth of 100 cm due to standingwater in the pits after heavy rainfall. In this case, we used the mean fine root biomass values for100–300 cm depth from the other two plots of this cultivation system (plots # 4 + 5) to calculatethe profile total of fine root biomass.Roots of grasses and herbs were easily distinguishable from tree fine roots by their smallerdiameter, lighter color and the absence of a lignified periderm, but these roots were ignored asthe proportion of herb and grass root mass was below 5% in all plots. In some of the studyplots, roots of trees growing outside the plots or belonging to dead tree stumps of the cut shadetrees were found. In most cases, this fraction did not exceed 5%, except for plot #1 (40%), plot#2 (11%) and plot #5 (10%). In the analysis of standing fine root biomass, these root fractionswere included.Diverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 6/2 2Above- and Belowground Net Primary Production (NPP)Annual above- and belowground NPP was quantified based on the measurement of annualcacao bean yield and total cacao fruit production, annual aboveground woody growth, litterproduction, and fine and coarse root and root stock biomass production.For analyzing cacao bean yield and total cacao fruit production (beans and pods), we useddata from each 20 cacao trees in the cacao monocultures and from each 10 cacao trees in theshaded agroforest systems that were harvested in a manner as done by the local farmers. In thisway, ripe cacao pods were cut every two weeks over a 12-month period and the fresh weightmeasured directly in the field. For obtaining dry bean weight and dry pod weight, 10 represen-tative pods per study plot were selected in all size classes to determine the ratio of whole fruitfresh weight to dry bean weight and dry pod weight in every plot. To do so, fresh pods wereweighed, all fruit components (skin, seeds and fruit pulp) dried separately (70°C, 72h) andtheir dry weight determined in the laboratory of the Tadulako University in Palu.Aboveground woody biomass production was calculated from stem increment dataobtained by repeated reading of manual dendrometer tapes (UMS, Munich, Germany) thatwere installed at breast height during a 12-month period on each 20 tree individuals per studyplot. In the shaded cacao systems, each 10 cacao and 10 shade trees were mounted. To calculatethe mean annual wood production of the 20 tree individuals of a plot, the diameter incrementwas applied to the allometric biomass equations given above. The calculated annual wood pro-duction rates per tree were extrapolated to all other tree individuals of the respective species orfamily in a plot. For two tree individuals of species not included in the dendrometer study, weapplied plot means of annual basal area increment rate. The few coconut and banana treeswere ignored because they do not show secondary stem diameter growth and we lack data onaboveground biomass production.In order to measure annual leaf and fine litter production, 10 litter traps (size approximately75 cm x 75 cm) per study site were installed. The litter was collected monthly and sorted at spe-cies level into leaves and other fine litter fractions (i.e. flowers, fruits and small twigs). The litterfractions were dried for 72 h at 70°C and weighed in the laboratory in Palu. The litter of treesnot growing inside the plot area was added to cacao trees in case of monocultures or to theshade trees in case of shaded cacao cultivation systems, assuming that approximately the sameamount of litter should move into the plot by wind as is carried out in the considered timeinterval. Assuming that monthly leaf and fine litter fall equals monthly leaf and fine litter pro-duction, we took the annual litter mass in the plots as litter production [ 15]. Here, only thedata for leaves of cacao and shade trees and the remaining litter components not sorted by spe-cies are shown, because leaves of cacao and shade trees made up the largest part of the littermass in the study sites. Traditionally, all cacao trees are pruned regularly. During the studyperiod, farmers left out pruning to avoid differences between the study sites, except of one sin-gle pruning event at the end of the study phase, where all farmers pruned at the same time.Unfortunately, the mass of cut twigs and leaves at this event could not be recorded, but thisshould not have had notable effects on our data.Fine root production was estimated in the different cultivation systems by conducting aningrowth core experiment with local soil material according to the methodology described byPersson [ 36] and Hertel and Leuschner [ 35]. At 10 randomly chosen locations in each of thenine stands, soil cores were taken (3.5 cm in diameter) from the first 30 cm of the soil. All mac-roscopically visible live and dead root material was extracted by hand in the field. The remain-ing soil material was replaced into the hole and the location marked with plastic tubes. Carewas taken that the structure and density of the soil in the cores was conserved as much as possi-ble. The samples were recollected with the same soil corer after 10 months, and the extractedDiverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 7/2 2core sliced into the soil layers 0 –10 and 10 –30 cm depth. In the laboratory of the TadulakoUniversity of Palu, root biomass was extracted as described above. Following Vogt et al. [ 37]and Hertel and Leuschner [ 35], we calculated fine root production in the cores as the increasein root biomass from the start of root recolonisation (in our study 1 month after installation)until harvest. Fine root growth in the cores during the recolonisation period was extrapolatedto 1 year and expressed in g m-2yr-1.The production of coarse root and root stock biomass was calculated from the increase inaboveground woody biomass from the beginning to the end of the study using the allometricequation after Cairns et al. [ 32] (see above). The difference was taken as annual coarse root androot stock biomass production.Carbon Pools in Biomass and ProductionAll above- and belowground biomass and production values were converted into carbon storedin plant biomass. The calculation was done based on the C concentration detected in the differ-ent plant fractions. Samples of stem wood, fine roots (diameter <2 mm), coarse roots (diame-ter>2 mm) and the different litter fractions were analyzed in a CN auto-analyzer (Vario ELIII, Hanau, Germany) at the University of Göttingen, Germany. Only for the C stock present inthe cacao bean yield, we used carbon content data from literature [ 38]. The carbon pool of thewhole cacao pods was calculated by summing up the carbon stock of the cacao bean seeds fromliterature and the carbon stock available in the cacao pods without seeds taken from the littertraps. Cacao pods that fell into the litter traps were still too small to contain seeds.Statistical AnalysesAll data were tested for Gaussian distribution using a Shapiro –Wilk test. The majority of thedatasets showed a non-Gaussian distribution and could not satisfyingly be transformed. Thus,differences between the cultivation systems were analyzed for all parameters using non-parametric analyses of variance (Kruskal –Wallis test) and a subsequent Mann –Whitney two-sample test (Wilcoxon U-test). These calculations as well as Pearson correlation analyses weredone with the software package SAS 9.3 (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Regres-sion analyses were conducted with the software package SigmaPlot (version 11.0, Systat Soft-ware Inc.). For analyzing interrelations between tree species diversity, stand structure, carbonsequestration and cacao bean yield, we conducted a Principle Components Analysis (PCA)with the package CANOCO, version 4.5 (Biometris, Wageningen, The Netherlands).ResultsAboveground Stand StructureThe Shannon diversity index H ’increased from 0 to 0.4 in the sequence cacao monocultures —Cacao- Gliricidia systems —Cacao-multi shade-tree systems ( Table 2 ). In parallel, canopy coverincreased from 50 to 93%, total tree density from 900 to 1700 ha-1, and stand basal area from12.6 to 34.6 m2ha-1. The Gliricidia shade trees were 3 –4 meters taller than the cacao trees; inthe multi shade-tree systems, several shade tree species were even taller than the Gliricidia treesand had much larger stem diameters. Total stand basal area was nearly three times larger inthe multi shade-tree systems than in the cacao monocultures, while the total number of shadetrees was smaller than in the Gliricidia systems ( Table 2 ). Stem density of cacao was 30 –40%higher in the two shaded systems than in the cacao monocultures (2370 and 2540 vs. 1800 ha-1,respectively).Diverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 8/2 2Aboveground and Belowground Biomass and Related C PoolsTotal aboveground biomass increased more than fivefold from ~17 Mg ha-1in the monocul-tures to 30 Mg ha-1in the Cacao- Gliricidia plantations and to 100 Mg ha-1in Cacao-multi sys-tems ( Fig 2 ). Total belowground biomass including the standing fine root biomass in the 0 –300cm soil profile showed a similar increase from 6.4 Mg ha-1in the monocultures to 10.5 Mg ha-1in Cacao- Gliricidia systems and to 22.9 Mg ha-1in the multi shaded tree systems. The biomassand carbon contributed by the cacao trees was somewhat lower in the Cacao- Gliricidia standsthan in the other two cultivation systems ( Fig 2 andTable 3 ). Total biomass carbon was nearlysix times larger in the multi shade-tree systems than in the monocultures.Standing fine root biomass (0 –300 cm profile) increased, although not significantly, withincreasing shade tree cover in the three systems (206, 301 and 432 g m-2, respectively) withmore than two times larger totals in the Cacao-multi plots than in the monocultures (data notshown). The biomass increase was greater in the aboveground than the belowground compart-ment, leading to a shoot: root ratio increase from 2.8 to 4.9 from the monocultures to thediverse multi shade-tree systems ( Table 3 ).Net Primary Production and Its ComponentsTotal (above- and belowground) net primary production nearly doubled from the monocul-tures to the multi shade-tree systems (19.5, 28.2 and 37.7 Mg ha-1yr-1in the three systems,equaling 9.1, 13.4 and 17.7 Mg C ha-1yr-1;Fig 3 andTable 4 ). The increase was mainly drivenby the much larger wood and coarse root production of the shaded systems than of the cacaomonocultures, while the increase in litter production from the monocultures to the multishade-tree systems was only moderate (5.3 to 9.7 Mg ha-1yr-1); fine root production remainedunchanged (1.7, 1.5 and 1.9 Mg ha-1yr-1). The total biomass production of cacao showed aslight but non-significant decrease from the monocultures (19.5 Mg ha-1yr-1) to the multishade-tree systems (15.7 Mg ha-1yr-1). Similarly, cacao fruit production (beans and pods)tended to be somewhat lower in the latter systems (8.3 vs. 9.7 Mg ha-1yr-1) while bean produc-tion was remarkably invariant across the three cultivation systems (2.0 –2.1 Mg ha-1yr-1;Table 2.

The litter production of cacao was much higher in the monocultures (5.3 Mg ha-1yr-1) than in the two shaded systems (2.9 Mg ha-1yr-1). When calculated per cacao tree individ-ual, been yield decreased from 2.4 to 2.0 and 1.6 Mg ha-1yr-1from the monocultures to theGliricidia shade system and to the multi shade-tree system (differences not significant), butthis tendency was compensated by the higher cacao stem density on the plot level in the latter.In the Cacao-mono and the Cacao- Gliricidia systems, leaf litter made up 91 and 90% ofthe total aboveground litter production, respectively, while in the Cacao-multi shade-tree sys-tems, 21% of aboveground litter referred to other components (flowers, fruits, twigs, Fig 4 ).While total fine root production did not differ bet ween the three cultivation systems, the fineroot productivity of cacao tended to decrease from monocultural to multi shade-tree systemsdespite increasing cacao stem density ( Table 4 ; difference not significant). Unexpected isthat the fine root production of cacao trees was larger than that of shade trees in both shadedsystems despite higher aboveground productivi ty of the latter, although this effect was notsignificant.Fig 2.

However,while the above- to belowground NPP ratio tended to decrease for cacao trees with increasingshade tree diversity, this ratio increased in the same direction for the shade trees (only partlysignificant at p <0.05).Interrelations between Shade Tree Diversity, Stand Structure,Productivity, and Cacao Bean YieldA Principal Components Analysis on the inter-relationships between cacao bean yield, C stor-age in biomass, aboveground, belowground and total NPP, as well as aboveground stand struc-tural properties and tree species diversity (Shannon index) in the nine stands revealed a closeassociation of the tested biomass and productivity parameters with tree density, basal area, can-opy cover and also canopy layer diversity (H ’), but not with cacao bean yield ( Table 5 ). Cacaobean yield showed a close (negative) association with axis 2 (eigenvalue 0.184) but was rela-tively independent from the other tested biomass and productivity parameters.Given are the eigenvalues (EV) of the four main axes and the loading of nine parameters onthese. The values in brackets give the fraction of variance explained by the variable. The mostimportant factors on each axis are printed bold.Bivariate Pearson correlation analyses showed that all biomass and productivity parameterswere significantly related to tree diversity in the canopy of the cacao cultivation systems exceptfor bean yield, litter production and fine root production; the latter varied independently fromthe number of shade tree species present ( Table 6 ).DiscussionShade Tree Effects on Biomass, Carbon Stores and ProductivityTotal above- and belowground carbon in biomass was five times larger in the multi-shade treesystems than in cacao monoculture. With 11, 18 and 57 Mg C ha-1in monoculture, Cacao- Glir-icidia and multi-shade tree system, respectively, the measured carbon stocks were well withinthe range of values reported for cacao agroforests in other tropical regions (e.g. [ 22,39,40]).Table 3.

Clearly, the 57Mg C ha-1are only about one third of the biomass C, which is stored in a natural tropical forestin the region (~150 Mg C ha-1,[15]). Considering soil carbon stocks as well, these losses areeven higher as Kessler et al. [ 41] reported a total above- and belowground carbon stock of 284Mg C ha-1in natural forest plots in Sulawesi. Although the soil organic carbon content from0–60 cm increased from 22 Mg ha-1to 27 Mg ha-1and 29 Mg ha-1in the Cacao-mono, Cacao-Gliricidia and Cacao-multi systems, respectively (data not shown), we could not find signifi-cant differences. Even though carbon fixation of the whole system is much lower in diversecacao agroforests than in primary forests, nevertheless it is greater than in perennial monocul-tures or annual crops (e.g. [ 12,42,43]). The huge contribution of shade trees to biomass, carbonstorage and annual carbon sequestration both above- and belowground stresses the importanceof the role of shade trees in agroforestry ecosystems in our study.Fig 3.

A sig-nificant positive interrelation between tree species richness and both, carbon stocks in above-and belowground biomass, and in annual carbon sequestration via NPP could be shown. Nev-ertheless, fine root biomass in the 300 cm deep profile was more than doubled in this sequenceof increasing shade tree diversity (206 to 432 g m-2), which must have increased the intensity ofroot competition. However, the differences in the increase of total aboveground biomass alsosuggest that the planting of tall-growing shade trees is leading to fiercer competition betweencacao and shade trees for light rather than for water and nutrients.

Indeed, stable isotope analyses con-firmed that these two species showed complementary soil water use in these plantations [ 20].Another study from Lehmann et al. [ 45] revealed that shaded crops like coffee and cacao tendto have shallower root activity than fruit trees and that most of the root activity of cacao treesoccurs in the topsoil. A consequence is high complementary in the use of soil water reservesand thus, only limited competition between cacao and the shade trees [ 20,44,46,47]. However,for the more complex rooting patterns in our Cacao-multi systems, corresponding informationon complementary root distribution and water partitioning is not yet available.Likewise to tree biomass and the corresponding C stocks, carbon sequestration rates weresignificantly highest in Cacao-multi plots with 18 Mg C ha-1yr-1compared to the less produc-tive Cacao- Gliricidia and Cacao-mono stands with 13 Mg C ha-1yr-1and 9 Mg C ha-1yr-1,Fig 4.

The productivity data for cacao trees show that increased shading resulted inpreferential allocation of carbon toward aboveground stem growth and not to root growth:Fine root production of cacao tended to decrease (from 0.7 to 0.5 Mg C ha-1yr-1)f r o mt h emonocultures to the multi-shade tree systems, while coarse root growth slightly rose and stemand branch wood production also tended to increase (from 1.1 to 1.3 Mg C ha-1yr-1). Thus, itappears that increased crowding in the canopy and root zone due to higher cacao stem densi-ties in the shaded systems does not increase the belowground productivity of the individualtree. This holds support that the presence of shade trees may not lead to pronounced increas-ing light competition in the stand as well as it appears that the presence of shade trees doesnot induce increased belowground competition since fine root production is expected toincrease under enhanced belowground competition due to increasing fine root turnover [ 48].AsTheobroma cacao is a C3-plant that is adapted to semi-shade in the forest understory, fullsunlight may represent a stress factor of growth rather than a stimulating factor. Photosynthe-sis has been found to saturate in this species already at photon flux densities of ca. 400 μmolm-2s-1[49,50], which is equivalent to about 25% of full sunlight. Our data on abovegroundwoody biomass production in systems differing in shade intensity fit to the results of otherstudies that found stable or even increased vegetative growth of cacao trees cultivated undershade tree cover [ 24,43,51]. Köhler et al. [ 52] found enhanced water uptake of cacao and asso-ciated with it higher stem diameters and leaf areas in plantations shaded by Gliricidia than inmonocultures in our study region.

The stable bean production of approx. 2 Mg d.m. ha-1yr-1(1.2 Mg C ha-1yr-1) across the three cultivation systems is relatively high comparedto other studies (e.g. [ 53,54]), but match results of Ruf et al. [ 55], who reported a yield of mar-ketable cacao beans of 2 Mg ha-1for Sulawesi. In the literature, mixed results exist with respectto cacao bean yield change under increased shade tree cover. While a number of studies founda decrease [ 13,14,18,21,56–58], others reported no negative shade tree effect on yield [ 54,59–62]. Clearly, the shade trees' species identity, the intensity of shading and the planting densityof cacao are all influencing the result of agroforestry system comparisons. Nevertheless, ourdata seem to indicate that shading does not impede cacao productivity and yield in a significantway.On the single-tree level, total NPP of cacao decreased with increasing shade cover from 22to 13 kg tree-1, while cacao bean yield per tree tended to decrease from 2.4 to 1.6 kg tree-1(bothtrends not significant at P <0.05). Accordingly, aboveground NPP per cacao tree decreased by42% from the Cacao-mono to the Cacao-multi system, while bean production decreased by33%. This shows that the stable yield at the plot level was to a large part the consequence of thehigher cacao stem densities in the shaded systems. However, since the trees ’yield loss wassmaller than their NPP reduction, shading seems to have triggered a welcome allocation shifttoward seed production, which is of economic interest.Beneficial Effects of Shade TreesShade trees may help to reduce the stress exposure of cacao to high evaporative demand andhigh radiation intensity. Miyaji et al. [ 63] found that cacao leaves have a shorter leaf longevityand thus, are shed earlier, when growing in the upper canopy with higher exposition to sun-light. Full light exposure can also lead to stomatal closure resulting from leaf water status dete-rioration, which may reduce photosynthetic activity and growth [ 49]. Such sensitive responsesmight be related to the natural occurrence of cacao in the understory of closed forests. Ourdata on leaf litter production fit into this picture. We measured a nearly twofold higher leaf lit-ter production (5.3 vs. 2.9 Mg ha-1yr-1) in the non-shaded than in the shaded systems, indicat-ing shorter leaf longevity presumably as a stress response to drought and high solar radiation.The fact that the monocultures achieved their wood production and total NPP with a muchhigher leaf production and turnover, must be interpreted as a hint on elevated stress at thefoliage level. Thus, strong evidence exists that growing cacao in non-shaded monoculturesplaces the species beyond the range of optimal growing conditions.In fact, it seems that the removal of shade trees increases cacao bean yield, if at all, only inthe short-term [ 12,14,17,18,56], while it increases physiological stress and may reduce the sta-bility of the system. Several authors argued that cacao agroforests with shade trees may producelower, but stable yields and thus, are more productive in the long-term [ 12,14,17,18,56]. More-over, shade trees seem to increase the productive lifetime of cacao trees [ 54,64] through thereduction of physical stress. In intensified cacao cultivation systems, yield tends to decreaseafter 15 –20 years [ 12]. In our cacao plantations, the trees had an age of already 20 –25 years.Given the relatively high bean yield of 2 Mg ha-1yr-1, this shows that cacao can remain produc-tive for quite long time spans under a more or less dense canopy of shade trees.There are also economic reasons for farmers to cultivate cacao under moderate shade cover.Due to pronounced fluctuation of the cocoa price on the world market, farmers should have anDiverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 16 / 22interest in a stable production, even at a perhaps somewhat reduced yield level, but at lowercost, compared to higher short-term yield with high input of labor and costs (e. g. [ 21]). More-over, shaded and more complex-structured cacao agroforestry systems provide a number ofimportant ecosystem services that may increase the farmer ’s revenue and might be able to com-pensate possible negative effects (e.g. [ 12,13,21,23,65,66]).A cover of shade trees, especially when it contains more than one tree species, harbors notonly a more diverse fauna [ 19,67] than cacao monocultures, but it also provides additionalnon-monetary and monetary goods and services that need consideration, when selecting themost appropriate cultivation system. Nutrient input through nitrogen fixation by Gliricidiaand other leguminous shade trees present on the shaded plots is likely an important N sourcein the Cacao- Gliricidia and the Cacao-multi systems. Nutrient cycling and nutrient addition tothe topsoil is increased by a higher aboveground litter mass and accelerated decomposition dueto N-rich litter. Pests and diseases cause huge losses in the cacao yield worldwide [ 68]. Diverseplant and animal communities may provide natural pest control through the provision ofniches for insectivorous birds, parasitoids and pest-feeding insects (e.g. [ 13,14,57,69,70]). Wiel-goss et al. [ 71] could show that cacao yield loss was reduced due to the co-existence of a minorpest, the mirid bug Helopeltis sulawesi , and a major pest, the pod-boring moth Conopomorphacramerella , in a shaded cacao system. Although another major pest, the black pod disease,which is caused by Phytophthora palmivora , generally tends to increase with increasing humid-ity [21], it may be hold in check by the presence of more endophytic antagonists under a morediverse tree canopy [ 72,73]. Our measurements further show that relative air humidity wasincreased only very slightly with increasing shade tree cover, suggesting that Phythopthorashould not profit significantly from the presence of shade trees in our stands and shade treesmight act more like a protection from wind dispersal. A layer of shade trees can reduce weedcover under the cacao trees and may minimize soil erosion after heavy rainfall [ 12]. Shade treesand the associated entomofauna may also indirectly increase cacao bean yield by enhancingpollination services. This may be of particular relevance for the strictly entomophilous cacao,since pollinator abundance has been found to positively correlate with pod set and thus yield[74–76]. While the monetary value of most of these services is not exactly known, Obiri et al.[64] found highest net cash flow in shaded agroforests, where additional income was generatedfrom the harvest of timber and other merchantable goods, and because labor and input costswere smaller than in intensively managed monocultures. Bisseleua et al. [ 57] showed for WestAfrican cacao plantations that the higher input needed for intensification not necessarilyresulted in higher net returns to the farmer. In the light that cacao monocultures are sufferingmore from long-term yield reduction due to soil fertility loss, and are more susceptible to her-bivore attack and disease infestations [ 12,17] and apparently also to drought than shaded cacaosystems ([ 20], this study), farmers should be encouraged to choose cultivation systems withdiverse shade trees instead of monocultures, where possible.ConclusionThe present study provides additional evidence that cacao bean yield does not necessarilydecrease under a cover of shade trees and that shade seems to reduce physical stress. As dem-onstrated in our study, somewhat lower fruit production per tree under shade can be compen-sated by higher tree numbers and the provision of ecosystem services such as enhancedpollination success, biological pest and weed control, increased nitrogen input by legume shadetrees and enhanced nutrient cycling with litter fall, as well as a reduced atmospheric vapordemand. Moreover, farmers profit from additional income provided by the harvest of timber,fruits and fuel wood provided by the shade trees. Shade trees could also lead to additionalDiverse Shaded Cacao Does Not Imply Yield LossesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149949 February 29, 2016 17 / 22income, when charged within the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and ForestDegradation) scheme or other certification programs. Our results demonstrate the carbon stor-age and sequestration potential, which is associated with a shade tree cover in cacao cultivationsystems. The additional income and lower labor and input costs make cacao production stableto highly fluctuating cacao prices and more attractive by compensating farmers for possiblylower yields in the short-time compared to monocultures. If planned properly, shaded cacaoplantations allow combining high yield with benefits for carbon sequestration, production sys-tem stability, and biodiversitySupporting InformationS1 Appendix.
