Solar thermochemical conversion and photochemical andelectrochemical CO 2reduction processes are emerging technologies in which solar energy is utilized toprovide the energy required for the endothermic dissociation of CO 2. Owing to the surface-dependentnature of these technologies, their performance is signiÔ¨Åcantly reliant on the solid reactant/catalystaccessible surface area. Solid porous structures either entirely made from the catalyst or used as asupport for coating the catalyst/solid reactants can increase the number of active reaction sites and,thus, the kinetics of CO 2reutilization reactions. This paper reviews the principles and applicationof porous materials for CO 2reutilization pathways in solar thermochemical, photochemical, andelectrochemical reduction technologies. Then, the state of the development of each technology iscritically reviewed and evaluated with the focus on the use of porous materials. Finally, the researchneeds and challenges are presented to further advance the implementation of porous materials in theCO 2reutilization processes and the commercialization of the aforementioned technologies.Keywords: porous materials; CO 2reutilization; solar thermochemical conversion; photochemicalreduction; electrochemical reduction1. IntroductionThe rising atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), largely due toanthropogenic emissions, is widely associated with the simultaneous rise in the global meantemperature [ 1,2]. The most abundant GHGs in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere are water vapor(H2O), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), oxides of nitrogen (NO 2, NO, etc.), ozone(O3), and chloroÔ¨Çuorocarbons (CFCs). While CH 4and CFCs have a higher green-housegas effect per their unit mass than CO 2[3], CO 2has the major contribution to the globalwarming [ 4], owing to its larger amount in the atmosphere. The CO 2concentration in theatmosphere has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly from approximately 280 ppm in the pre-industrialtimes to nearly 414.5 ppm in August 2021 [ 5], which is mainly due to the global dependencyon the fossil fuels for power production, as shown in Figure 1 [ 6]. However, at present,despite the urgent need to decrease CO 2emissions, fossil fuels are still used for > 80% ofthe world energy demand and are expected to remain the predominant source of energy forthe short to medium term, due to their low cost, availability, high energy density, existingEnergies 2022 ,15, 63. https://doi.org/10.3390/en15010063 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energiesEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 2 of 65reliable technology, and established position worldwide [ 7]. Nevertheless, if no action istaken, the world would be around 4C warmer by the end of this century than it was at thebeginning of the industrial revolution, which is anticipated to lead to signiÔ¨Åcantly seriouscatastrophic effects on climate [ 8]. On this basis, the Paris Agreement (2015) was created tostrengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, restricting global temperaturerise to well below 2C in this century and preferably below 1.5C, which is considered asthe limit to prevent the most catastrophic changes on earth [ 9,10]. However, to meet thisneed, the CO 2concentration in the atmosphere should not exceed 450 ppm, or more than~10% over the current concentration [ 10]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to developtechnologies enabling the reduction in CO 2emissions, while also reducing the substantialeconomic and/or political challenges that favor ‚Äòbusiness-as-usual‚Äô technologies.Figure 1. Anthropogenic CO 2sources and their contribution to the total CO 2emissions, adaptedwith permission from [6].To mitigate the CO 2emissions, the most prospective options are to reduce energyconsumption (through increasing the efÔ¨Åciency of energy conversion and/or utilizationsystems), to switch to non-fossil based and renewable energy sources such as wind, solarand biomass, and, Ô¨Ånally, to utilize Carbon Capture Storage/Reutilization (CCS/CCR) [ 11].The motivation behind the development of CCS and CCR is to minimize the effect of CO 2emission on global climate change, while also keeping the low-cost, carbon-based infrastruc-ture. CCS and CCR typically comprise three main stages: capturing CO 2at the generationpoint, e.g., power plants, compressing it to a concentrated Ô¨Çuid, and, lastly, either storing itin a safe and secure place, e.g., oil and gas reservoirs, or reutilizing it for the production ofother chemicals. CCS can be also performed to ehance the oil and gas recovery through theinjection of the captured CO 2into the oil and gas reservoirs [ 6,12]. However, it is typicallysite and geology speciÔ¨Åc. By contrast, CCR offers the potential for value proposition, as theseparated CO 2is utilized as a valuable raw material for chemical commodity production.Commensurate with this, currently approximately 3600 Mtonnes of CO 2are used globallyas a feedstock in extensive verity of industries, e.g., urea, formaldehyde, and dimethylether (DME) production and methanol synthesis [ 13]. Figure 2 provides a list of the mainindustries in which CO 2is used as feedstock and their share from the global usage [ 6].Government policies, such as a carbon tax, are expected to be implemented in the comingyears and would subsequently lead to the availability of CO 2at a low or even negativeprice. Consequently, in addition to current technologies, the need for new technologiesenabling CO 2conversion to other valuable products is expected to increase.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 3 of 65Figure 2. Industries that utilize CO 2as a feedstock, adapted with permission from [6].Table 1 summarizes some of the main CO 2reutilization (CDR) processes. The state ofdevelopment and the chemical reactions employed in these technologies are also listed inTable 1 of these technologies, solar thermochemical, photocatalytic, and electrochemicalare still under development, while the rest are commercially available. This review paperfocuses mainly on thermochemical, photocatalytic, and electrochemical CDR technolo-gies. In each of these technologies, surface-dependent reactions are vital and, therefore,high surface area materials are employed as the catalyst reactant, substrate, or a combi-nation of these [ 14‚Äì18]. Beyond just surface area, the material design in these processeshas been considered as a key factor inÔ¨Çuencing the performance and techno-economicviability [19‚Äì22].Several review papers have been published on CO 2utilization through solar ther-mochemical, photochemical, and electrochemical reduction reactions. In 2010, Loutzen-hiser et al. [ 23] reviewed the two-step solar thermochemical cycles for H 2O and CO 2splitting with ZnO/Zn reduction and oxidation (RedOx) reactions to produce synthesisgas. They provided an outline of the underlying science and the technological advancesin solar reactor engineering with Second-law, life cycle, and economic analyses. Theirsecond-law analysis indicated the potential of achieving high solar-to-chemical energyconversion efÔ¨Åciencies and, consequently, economic competitiveness vis- √†-vis other routesfor producing solar fuels from H 2O and CO 2. This is despite that several other materials,i.e., ceria oxides, and perovskites have been recently developed and analyzed for CO 2splitting. KovaÀá ciÀá c et al. [ 24] reviewed the theoretical Ô¨Årst principles of photocatalyticCO 2reduction and presented the fundamentals of reaction and doping, with theoreticaldescription including electronic calculations, kinetic modelling, macroscale simulations,calculated electronic properties, CO 2adsorption on photoactive materials, and reactionmechanisms. Strategies to improve efÔ¨Åciency of the fuels‚Äô production via TiO 2-basedphotocatalytic CO 2reduction were reviewed by Shehzad and co-workers [ 25]. They ad-dressed the fundamentals and developments in the TiO 2-based reduction systems andcovered the thermodynamics of CO 2reduction, mass transfer of reacting compounds,selectivity of solar products, and reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO 2reduction. Olaand Maroto-Valer [ 26] reviewed the state of the art in photocatalytic CO 2reduction overtitanium oxide (TiO 2)-nanostructured materials up to 2015, with emphasis on materialdesign and reactor conÔ¨Ågurations. Various surface modiÔ¨Åcation methods, e.g., impuritydoping, metal deposition, carbon-based material loading, etc., for CO 2reduction over TiO 2were also reviewed by Low et al. [ 27]. Moreover, aqueous electrochemical reduction ofEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 4 of 65CO 2over Cu electrodes was reviewed by Gattrell et al. [ 28] in 2006. The dependence of thehydrocarbon products on the reaction conditions were discussed. Catalysts and reactors forCO 2photoconversion over the metal oxides were covered by Lie et al. [ 29]. Some importantfactors including particle size, surface area, and controlling the facets for efÔ¨Åcient CO 2photoreduction, and reactor design were highlighted. Reaction kinetics for photoreductionof CO 2were covered by Thompson et al. [ 30] in 2014. Micro-kinetic, analytics, modelingapproaches, and impact of parameters on CO 2photoreduction kinetics were discussed.Nonetheless, there is lack of a comprehensive review papers that cover the recent advancesin the Ô¨Åelds of thermochemical, photochemical, and electrochemical reduction reactions,which all rely on the use of porous structures and catalysts. This paper aims to address thisgap. The paper also aims to identify technology development challenges and the requiredresearch to further advance the commercialization of the processes.Table 1.

In the followingparts of the paper, two types of porous materials, namely, TiO 2as the most common porousmaterial and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as new classes of hybrid porous materials,Energies 2022 ,15, 63 5 of 65are investigated for photochemical and electrochemical CDR reactions. Furthermore,methods for modiÔ¨Åcation and improving the performance of these materials are discussed.2. Solar Thermochemical ConversionThe solar thermochemical CO 2conversion process applies solar thermal energy ab-sorbed via Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology to reutilize CO 2and convert it tovalue-added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO), diesel (C 10H20‚ÄìC15H28), kerosene(C12H26‚ÄìC15H32), etc. through commercially available catalytic processes [ 62]. The CSPthermal energy is supplied via reÔ¨Çective surfaces, used to concentrate the solar irradiationinto a focal point, where the solar receiver/reactor is typically located. The CSP solarirradiance is measured by a unit called ‚Äúsun‚Äù = 1 kWm 2and several suns can lead totemperatures higher than 1000C [63]. As depicted schematically in Figure 3, CSP canbe employed as a high-temperature heat source for the thermochemical two-step RedOxreactions. In the Ô¨Årst step, the metal oxide MO is reduced through an endothermic reac-tion (Equation (1)). Then the reduced metal oxide MO  1reacts exothermically with CO 2,producing CO and MO (Equation (2)). This is a chemical looping process in which themetal oxide is employed as the oxygen carrier being reduced and re-oxidized by CO 2as anoxidant. The process typically produces O 2as a by-product (Figure 3).Figure 3. The CDR process via H 2O/CO 2-splitting solar thermochemical cycle as a route for solar fuels.Reduction:MO!MO 1+(1)2O2.DH>0 (1)Oxidation:MO 1+CO 2!MO+CO DH<0 (2)As per Le Chatelier‚Äôs principle, lowering the partial pressure of O 2within the metaloxide reduction reactor decreases the equilibrium reduction temperature and, hence, theassociated parasitic losses [ 64]. This can be achieved through either the use of a vacuumpump [65] or a sweeping gas [64] diluting the O 2concentration in the gas phase [66].Similar to the production of CO from CO 2, the consecutive reduction and oxidation ofthe metal oxide can be also utilized for H 2production. However, in this case, steam (H 2O)is used to oxidize the reduced metal oxide (Equation (3)).MO 1+H2O!MO+H2DH<0 (3)The simultaneous production of CO and H 2through Equations (2) and (3) will lead tothe production of a gaseous mixture known as synthetic gas (or syngas in the abbreviatedEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 6 of 65form), which is potentially a feed for the production of hydrocarbon fuels [ 67]. H 2can alsobe produced through water‚Äìgas shift reaction from CO (Equation (4)). The so producedfuels are called solar fuels enabling a closed loop of CO 2as shown in Figure 3CO+H2O!CO 2+H2.DH=2.85 kJ at 25C (4)Advantageously, the solar thermochemical CO and H 2production using the metaloxide RedOx reactions enables adjusting the H 2:CO ratio to ~2:1 that is the optimal ratiofor the methanol production via the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process [ 68‚Äì70]. The measure ofthe conversion of solar heat into chemical energy for a given thermochemical process,solar-to-fuel , is deÔ¨Åned as:solar to fuel = DGQsolar(5)where DGis the maximum amount of the possible work by solar fuel products and Qsolaris the input solar heat into the reactor. Some techno-economic analyses on the commer-cialization of the thermochemical solar fuels synthesis processes agree on a minimumsolar to fuelof 20% to make the technology economically viable [ 71,72], while the maxi-mum reported efÔ¨Åciency of the present state-of-the-art solar thermochemical technologyis around 7.5% [ 73]. This indicates the need for the research on and development of thematerials and reactor conÔ¨Ågurations, enabling signiÔ¨Åcant development in the efÔ¨Åciencyand, hence, competitiveness of the solar thermochemical technology.In the following section, the effect of porous materials on the efÔ¨Åciency of the solarthermochemical processes is discussed. Firstly, various RedOx materials, capable of per-forming thermochemical RedOx reactions, are brieÔ¨Çy explained. Then, the research workson porous RedOx materials are reviewed.2.1. Reduction/Oxidation Materials2.1.1. ClassiÔ¨Åcation of RedOx PairsDepending on the physical change of the oxygen carrier RedOx agent through the con-secutive thermochemical RedOx reactions (Equations (1) to (3)), the metal oxide species canbe classiÔ¨Åed into volatile and non-volatile groups. As a volatile oxide, the MO undergoesgas‚Äìsolid phase transition during the reduction step, while a non-volatile oxide remains inthe solid phase through the complete RedOx reactions [ 19]. The higher oxygen exchangecapability of the volatile cycles compared to nonvolatile ones enables higher oxygen re-lease/uptake during the RedOx reactions and, hence, more fuel production per unit massof oxide material [ 19]. In addition, the increased entropy due to the formation of gaseousproducts in volatile cycles makes the reduction reaction more thermodynamically favorable.However, the gaseous products of the reduction reaction in volatile RedOx materials (re-duced MO , O2at high temperatures) need to be separated, diluted, or quickly quenchedto prevent the MO re-oxidation [ 74]. Nevertheless, these are technically challenging andadd to the complexity of the process and, hence, costs [ 75]. It is worth mentioning thatthe physical phase change of the volatile oxygen carriers can lead to the regeneration ofthe structure of the active materials through each cycle, which can lead to the mitigationof the particle deactivation during some undesirable processes such as sintering and ag-glomeration [ 64]. This will lead to an improved material efÔ¨Åciency during RedOx reactions.On the contrary, the porous structure of the non-volatile materials can be altered throughconsecutive RedOx cycles and lead to their deactivation [64,76].Steam and carbon dioxide are the main reacting feeding gases for the syngas pro-duction through the solar thermochemical process. The Gibbs free energy of forma-tion of water ( DGf,H2O= 56.7 kJmol 1) is slightly lower than that of the carbon dioxide(DGf,CO 2= 61.3 kJmol 1). Thus, water splitting can be thermodynamically more favorablethan CO 2and has been the focus of some research on the application of RedOx materials.However, the obtained results could be potentially generalized to CO 2splitting as well asEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 7 of 65due to the small difference in DGfof both species. Therefore, in this part, the volatile andnon-volatile RedOx materials for both CO 2and H 2O splitting are brieÔ¨Çy reviewed.ZnO/ZnThe RedOx reactions of the ZnO/Zn pair for CO and H 2production have beenextensively investigated [ 23,77‚Äì81]. Nevertheless, the process requires high temperatures ofca. 1800C for the reduction of ZnO to Zn and O 2[77], which can lead to signiÔ¨Åcant parasiticre-radiation and convection heat losses from the reduction reactor [ 63,82,83]. Moreover,thermal dissociation of ZnO at high temperatures leads to the formation of a gaseousmixture of Zn(g) and O 2(g), due to relatively low melting and boiling points of Zn, i.e.,420C and 907C, respectively. However, this gaseous mixture is substantially explosive,leading to the recombination of Zn and O 2to generate ZnO. Therefore, signiÔ¨Åcant attemptshave been made to efÔ¨Åciently separate the Zn(g) from O 2(g) [ 77,80]. Methods includediluting the mixture with an inert gas like argon or rapidly quenching it to temperaturesof less than 420C, where Zn is solidiÔ¨Åed and, hence, separated [ 77]. A series of solarreactors have been also developed to perform the endothermic thermal dissociation of ZnOusing concentrated solar radiation [ 77], such as the one shown schematically in Figure 4 .In this directly irradiated solar cavity rotating reactor, which was developed at the PaulScherrer Institute (PSI), a bed of ZnO particles is irradiated with highly concentrated solarradiation [ 79]. The cavity reactor is sealed from the environment using a quartz glasswindow such that the concentrated solar radiation is introduced into the reactor while theleakage of the gaseous products from the reactor or inÔ¨Åltration of the air into the reactoris avoided. Consecutive thermal dissociation of ZnO in temperatures of 1534-1634C hasbeen demonstrated. Nevertheless, some Zn condensation has been also observed over thequartz window that can lead to a change in transmissivity of the window and signiÔ¨Åcanttechnical challenges, e.g., breakage of the window due to the thermal stress [ 79]. Thechallenges become even more substantial if the window size is increased. The completecycle of ZnO/Zn for CO 2and H 2O splitting has been also demonstrated at bench scale butnot at the pilot scale, mainly due to the above discussed limitations [23,78,84].Figure 4. Schematic representation of the 10-kW directly irradiated solar reactor used for thermaldecomposition of ZnO to Zn and O 2, developed at PSI [79].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 8 of 65SnO 2/SnOThe use of a SnO 2/SnO pair for the thermochemical water and CO 2splitting hasbeen investigated in several projects [ 85‚Äì88]. For example, at PROMES-CNRS (France), asolar-aided thermal reduction reactor, working at a temperature of ~1600C, was employedfor thermal dissociation of SnO 2to SnO and metallic tin (T mSn ~ 232C), followed bya hydrolysis reactor, in which H 2is produced through oxidation of SnO/Sn with H 2Oat 600C [86]. The reactivity of SnO and Sn/SnO 2nano-powders in reaction with CO 2and H 2O has been also investigated using thermogravimetric analyzers (TGA) [ 88]. Itwas found that the SnO 2/SnO pair is more reactive to H 2O than to CO 2in the range of550‚Äì650C. Activation energies of 101 10 kJmol 1and 531 kJmol 1for the Sn/SnO 2oxidation with CO 2and H 2O were also measured, respectively. Similarly, the reactivity ofSnO nanopowder in reaction with H 2O and CO 2was investigated by Abanades [ 87] et al.They used a thermogravimetric analyzer system heated by concentrated solar radiationand found a high conversion rate of 88% for SnO with H 2O at a lower temperature (at700C) than with CO 2(at 800C).2.1.2. Non-Volatile RedOx PairsThe non-volatile pairs can be further classiÔ¨Åed as stoichiometric and non-stoichiometricmaterials, in which solid solutions are formed upon reduction due to the changes in the an-ion and/or cation vacancies, although they can still remain crystallographically stable [ 19].A series of studied non-volatile RedOx pairs are reviewed here.Iron-Oxide Based CycleThese cycles typically exploit the oxygen storage capability of magnetite/w√ºstite(Fe3O4/FeO) pair (Equations (6) and (7)) and ferrites, in which a transition metal is substi-tuted in the magnetite lattice e.g., M xFe3 xO4, M = Ni, Co.ReductionFe3O4(s)!3FeO (s)+0.5O 2(g),DH=319.5 kJ/mol (6)Oxidation with CO 23FeO (s)+CO 2(g)!Fe3O4(s)+CO(g),DH= 38 kJ/mol (7)Figure 5 shows the stability phase diagram of iron and oxygen [ 89]. As shown,hematite (Fe 2O3) begins to reduce into magnetite (Fe 3O4) and then w√ºstite (Fe 1 xO) at anoxygen pressure (P O2) of 10 6mbar and 1207C, which is relatively close to the meltingpoints of Fe 3O4and FeO that are 1597C and 1377C, respectively (Figure 5) [68,90,91] .This can lead to sintering of the active materials during the RedOx cycles, if the reduc-tion of Fe 2O3is performed at such high temperatures. Sintering of the active materialsdecreases their active surface area for the reactions and hence the reaction conversion efÔ¨Å-ciency [92‚Äì94] . As shown in Figure 5, lowering the partial pressure of oxygen can reduce therequired reduction temperature; which, in addition to the mitigation of material sintering,can signiÔ¨Åcantly decrease the challenges associated with the operation and construction ofthe high-temperature solar reactors (beyond 1500C) and the associated processes [ 68,90].It is noteworthy to mention that the partial pressure of O 2within the reduction reactor canbe reduced via the application of a vacuum pump or a diluting gas, reducing the partialpressure of O 2in the reactor [ 76,95]. Nevertheless, this can add to the complexity of thereactor design, heat recovery and the associated exergy losses. Thus, to increase the ironoxide reactivity, mechanical stability and mitigate the sintering effects, ferrites materialscan be introduced as magnetite lattice doped with some transition metal ions e.g., Ni andCo (M xFe3 xO4, M = Ni, Co). In this regard, Allen et al. [ 96] found that cobalt ferrite(CoFe 2O4) in 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) lowers the reduction temperaturecompared to the pure magnetite by at least 200C. Moreover, they found that this materialpossesses a relatively high stability through consecutive RedOx reactions, as such theEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 9 of 65syngas product remained relatively constant over 50 consecutive RedOx cycles. The porestructure of the RedOx pair was then further developed via the decomposition of graphiteas the pore former and the porous structure containing 10 wt% of CoFe 2O4-YSZ found tohave a higher thermal stability and also CO production per unit mass of the material thannonporous materials. In another work, Gokon et al. [ 97] used monoclinic ZrO 2supportedferrites of Fe 3O4and NiFe 2O4powder particles (Fe 3O4/m-ZrO 2and NiFe 2O4/m-ZrO 2).A hydrogen/oxygen ratio of 2 to 1 for both materials was reported with greater oxygenrelease rate for NiFe 2O4powder. Lastly, coating of NiFe 2O4/m-ZrO 2on the MPSZ andtesting in a Xe-light reactor showed a successful repeatable production of H 2with a ferriteconversion efÔ¨Åciency of 24‚Äì76% [97].Figure 5. The stability phase diagram of iron and oxygen [89].Doping of iron oxides for the improvement of their thermochemical properties wasalso investigated [ 98,99]. For instance, co-sintered iron oxides and YSZ were used in a TGAsetup (TR: 1400C and CDS: 1100C) [98]. The results suggested that Fe in the form of asolid solution with YSZ (8 mol% Y 2O3in ZrO 2) is more reducible compared to bulk ironoxide. Furthermore, the co-sintering process helped the cyclability of the ferrites.HercyniteAnother class of nonvolatile stoichiometric RedOx materials is aluminum spinel inthe form of hercynite or (A x, B1 x)+2Al2+3O4, in which ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚ÄòB‚Äô sites can be elementssuch as Ni, Co, Fe, Cu, etc. with +2 oxidation state [ 100‚Äì103]. For instance, atomic layerdeposition of CoFe 2O4(with a 5-nm Ô¨Ålm thickness) on Al 2O3substrates showed a lowerreduction temperature (TR: 1200C) than the coated form on ZrO 2(TR: 1400C), whichis due to the hercynite evolution as a result of reacting ferrite with the substrate [ 100].In another study [ 101], water splitting was carried out with the O 2and H 2yields of 1.6and 0.37%, respectively, by using Al‚ÄìCu ferrite. A recent study [ 102] was performed onthe CO 2conversion capability of NiFe 2O4on porous Alumina foams within a directlyirradiated solar reactor heated by a high-Ô¨Çux solar simulator using CO 2and CH 4as thereactive gases. Results showed the formation of hercynite class materials (FeNiAlO 4andFeAlO 4), because of high temperature reduction reaction, could result in a relatively higherthermal-to-chemical energy conversion efÔ¨Åciency. Similarly, a work on spinel aluminatesrevealed a tradeoff between the thermodynamics and kinetics of H 2production reactionEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 10 of 65with the positive effect of Co addition on CO 2reduction kinetics (Co 0.4Fe0.6Al2O4), whilethe highest fuel yield was reported for the composition without Co (FeAl 2O4) [103].CeO 2/Ce 2O3Substantial research focused on ceria (CeO 2/Ce 2O3) as a nonvolatile non-stoichiometriccycle, for both CO 2and water splitting [ 70,87,104‚Äì124]. This, in addition to the relativelyhigh morphological stability of the CeO 2/Ce 2O3in consecutive RedOx cycles, is becauseof the high capability of ceria oxide in releasing oxygen through relatively fast reductionreactions [ 109]. However, despite the fast kinetics, cerium oxide (CeO 2) requires hightemperatures even at low P O2to reduce to Ce 2O3, as shown in the stability phase diagramof Ce and O (Figure 6). This, in turn, leads to signiÔ¨Åcant parasitic losses, e.g., radiative andconvective from the reactor [ 82,125,126], which adds to the capital and operational costs ofthe process. It also limits the material compatibility, enabling signiÔ¨Åcantly harsh operatingconditions. On the other hand, ceria tends to sinter at high temperatures that stronglydecrease its active surface and, thus, oxygen conductivity [ 127]. Therefore, signiÔ¨Åcant efforthas been allocated to the development of doped crystal structures of cerium oxide to reducethe required reduction temperature. For example, Call et al. [ 116] assessed zirconia-dopedcerium oxide in the form of Ce 1 xZrxO2powder particles for a CO 2splitting processusing a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Here ‚Äòx‚Äô is the stoichiometric amount of adoping element, i.e., Zr in this case. They found that an optimum value of x is in therange of 0.15x0.225 and can enhance the splitting process by up to 50% comparedto the pure ceria. However, besides the improvements in the lowering of the reductiontemperature and the needed partial pressure of O 2, PO2, some deactivation of the activematerials over 100 sequential RedOx reactions was also observed [ 116]. On the other hand,it has been found that increasing Zr content to x = 0.38 could lower the performance aslow as pure ceria. Meng et al. [ 110] carried out some experiments on ceria doping in theform of Ce 0.9M0.1O2 ceramics with M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Y, Dy, Zr, and Hf followed by acomparison on their reactivity in H 2O splitting. They showed that the doping of cationswith higher valences and a smaller ionic radius could efÔ¨Åciently enhance the O 2releasedduring the reduction step. It was concluded that the higher bulk ionic conductivity couldenhance the amount of H 2evolved through the oxidation step by improving the ratio of H 2to O 2. Although they found Ce 0.9Hf0.1O2with the highest reactivity, they suggested somedoping of lower valence cations as well as for a better bulk ionic conductivity and, thus,an improved amount of evolved H 2. The RedOx pair of CeO 2/Ce 2O3was investigated atlab scale for hydrogen production with complete hydrolysis of Ce 2O3within 5 min withsublimation at temperatures greater than 2000C [106]. It was found that a higher acti-vation energy for CO 2dissociation is needed compared to that of H 2O dissociation whennon-stoichiometric cerium oxide (CeO 2-CeO 2 ) is employed [ 107]. Thereafter, dopingceria lattice by Y, La, Sm, Gd, Mn, Al, Fe, YSZ, Cu, Zn, Zr, and Co elements was assessedto improve the oxygen ion mobility [ 87,115,120]. Some noticeable improvements in thereducibility of ceria were reported for doping the structure with zirconia, with a linearincrease in the range of 0‚Äì54%, while Y, La, Pr, and Gd were found to just affect the materialstability during consecutive cycles [115].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 11 of 65Figure 6. Ce-O stability phase diagram in different partial pressures of O 2[127].PerovskitesPerovskites, with a general form of ABO 3, have been traditionally used as bipolarplates in fuel cells. However, recently they have been also suggested as an oxygen carrierin thermochemical reactions [ 128‚Äì131]. The attempt for the use of perovskites in the ther-mochemical CO 2splitting process returned back to 2013, when Scheffe et al. [ 130] usedLanthanum Strontium Manganese perovskites for splitting of H 2O and CO 2using aTGA. In another work, disk-shaped pellets of La 1 xSrxMO 3(M = Mn, Fe) were exploitedfor hydrogen production, through water splitting [ 130]. The maximum weight losses of5.5 wt% for x = 1 in La 1 xSrxMnO 3and 1.7 wt% for x = 0 in La 1 xSrxFeO 3were observed.Lanthanum‚Äìstrontium‚Äìmanganese perovskites with Sr content of 0.3 and 0.4 wt% in theform of LSM30 and LSM40, respectively, were assessed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)facilities for both water and CO 2splitting. In another work at Sandia National Laborato-ries (SNL), Sr- and Mn-doped lanthanum aluminate perovskites (La 1 xSrxMn yAl1-yO 3 )were considered for two-step solar-thermochemical CO 2and water splitting cycles [ 129].Interestingly, the mass of H 2and CO produced per mass of the RedOx materials employedin this cycle, known as splitting capacity, increased by factors of nine and six, respectively,while, in addition to a higher stability, the required reduction temperature was decreasedby ~ 300C compared to the pure ceria cycle. In another survey, Fe-doped CaTiO 3wasused as the RedOx active material and a similar performance to that of Ce/CeO 2pair wasobserved [ 131]. In a recent study [ 132], Ba, Ca, or Y (A site) and Al, Mg (B site)-dopedLa1 xSrxMnO 3 perovskite were used as active material for CO 2splitting. High RedOxactivities were observed for La 0.6Sr0.4Mn 0.83Mg 0.17O3 (LSMMg17). Decreasing of thereduction temperature was observed by doping Y3+in the perovskite structure, while itcould bring some difÔ¨Åculties in terms of the oxidation cycle [ 132]. Moreover, doping Mg2+provides an enhanced solid‚Äìgas reaction kinetics, thermal stability, and resistance to sinter-ing [ 132]. Bork et al. [ 133] tried to lower the operational temperature by using perovskitematerials in the form of La 0.6Sr0.4Cr1 xCoxO3 using TGA followed by experiments in aÔ¨Çuidized bed reactor. They showed that the CO 2conversion can be increased by ~25 timesfor cobalt doping at x = 0.2 compared to ceria within the temperature range of 800‚Äì1200C,which is ~300C lower than that of the ceria cycle. This implies a great potential for lessheat loss from the process and, thus, higher efÔ¨Åciency per mass of the RedOx materials.The investigations on the perovskite materials typically showed improvement in the re-duction part of the cycle via achieving a relatively lower reduction temperature, while there-oxidation part of the cycle with CO 2and H 2O still needs further development [ 130].Therefore, a trade-off should be considered between lowering the reduction temperatureEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 12 of 65and re-oxidation capability of the perovskite materials in reaction with CO 2and H 2O.Through an investigation of eight formulations of the lanthanum manganite perovskitegroup, Cooper et al. [ 134] showed that the Sr- and Ca-doped perovskites in the form ofLa0.6Sr0.4Mn 0.6Al0.4O3and La 0.6Ca0.4Mn 0.6Al0.4O3can lead to a 5‚Äì13-fold enhancementin the reduction extent, i.e., higher oxygen release compared with the ceria cycle in therange of 1200‚Äì1400C. Thermodynamic analysis by Takacs et al. [ 135] discovered that thelanthanum manganite perovskites doped with Ca, Al, in the A and B sites, respectively(La 0.6Ca0.4Mn 0.6Al0.4O3), had the highest mass speciÔ¨Åc oxygen release, 0.290 mol O 2permass of the metal oxide at T = 1500C and p O2= 2.3610 3bar and 0.039 mol kg 1at T = 1300C and p O2= 4.506610 2bar. This comparative study was carried out forthe La 0.6A0.4Mn 1 yAlyO3(A = Ca, Sr and y = 0, 0.4) family and the results showed that,despite the reduction extents of the perovskites being higher compared to CeO 2, theirre-oxidation with H 2O and CO 2was thermodynamically less favorable. Consequently, alower mass speciÔ¨Åc fuel productivity compared to CeO 2under the conditions of relevanceto the solar thermochemical cycles was obtained [ 135]. This was attributed mainly to thelower standard partial molar enthalpy ( DHO) and partial molar entropy ( DSO) of theperovskites relative to the cerium oxides.2.2. Application of Porous Materials in Solar Thermochemical ConversionRe-oxidation of the reduced RedOx materials during the thermochemical cycles is stronglydependent on the available solid surface area for the reactions. Thus, the use of porous materials,enabling a high surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio, is substantially advantageous in terms of reactionkinetics and mass transfer [14,15,17,18,73,97,112,114,118,119,136‚Äì139] . Different types of porousmaterials including reticulated porous ceramics (RPCs) [ 18,73,114,140], honeycombs [ 141,142],foams [ 14,97,137,138,143], and felts as well as 3D ordered macroporous materials have beenutilized successfully in this regard. These materials were either applied entirely made of activeRedOx agent or as a thin layer of RedOx coating over a stable structure. The pore size of theRPCs can be classified as micro (<2 nm), meso (2‚Äì50 nm), and macro (>50 nm) [ 144]. In thefollowing sections, the application of porous materials in solar thermochemical CO 2conversionis reviewed. In addition, a chronical list of works on solar thermochemical conversion processesare presented in Table 2. Since the oxide materials for carbon dioxide and water splitting can beused interchangeably in a similar series of reactions (Equations (2) and (3)), the application ofporous materials in both CO 2and water splitting are summarized here.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 13 of 65Table 2.

In this study, the per-formance of the honeycomb structure (4-mm square holes, 0.5-mm wall thickness) provedto be more efÔ¨Åcient than that of the 10-ppi (pores per inch) foam. Nevertheless, it wasconducted to make a comprehensive conclusion, and more assessment is needed. In theHYDROSOL project in 2005, a monolithic honeycomb medium made from re-crystallizedsilicon carbide (reSiC) was used in the framework of a solar reactor (Figure 7) [ 141]. Theporous materials were structurally similar to the automobile catalyst media and consisted ofMn/Zn ferrites coated on reSiC honeycombs. They were tested within a series of reduction(1300C) and oxidation (800C) reactions for water splitting. The reactor reached a conver-sion efÔ¨Åciency of ~ 80% and hydrogen yield of >90% at oxidation temperatures as low as800C. The measured hydrogen evolved in these experiments was in a good agreementwith the laboratory experiments with the oxides in the form of powders, showing thatthe RedOx materials coated on a porous substrate with mean d p= 6m maintained theirreactivity [ 141,147]. The main advantage of the HYDROSOL reactor is that it has no movingparts or even particles. Moreover, it enables controlling the temperature and the reactoroperation through adjusting the mass Ô¨Çux density in each reactor module, in response tothe variations in the inlet solar heat Ô¨Çux. This is signiÔ¨Åcantly important given the diurnaland annual variations of the solar insolation.Figure 7. The HYDROSOL solar receiver-reactor used for water splitting showing the installmentposition and conÔ¨Åguration of Mn/Zn-ferrite coated SiC honeycombs [141].The next work in this Ô¨Åeld was published in 2008 when Gokon et al. [ 137] conducted anexperimental study on the application of Fe 3O4, as RedOx agent, coated on both cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia (Fe 3O4/c-YSZ) and magnesia partially stabilized zirconia (MPSZ) tocompare the potentials for water splitting and production of hydrogen. The aerial oxidationof the aqueous suspensions of Fe(II) hydroxide was used to coat Fe 3O4on zirconia dopedEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 16 of 65with 8 mol% Y 2O3as the active powder material. To coat MPSZ substrates, YSZ was loadedon the porous MPSZ to increase the surface area. The structure was then impregnatedinto the iron nitrate solution to be coated with Fe 3O4. Coating of Fe 3O4on a substratemainly prevents the coagulation or sintering of particles. The thermal reduction andwater splitting reactions were performed in two different reactors equipped with infraredfurnaces. The results revealed a ferrite conversion of 20‚Äì27% for a 10.5 wt.% Fe 3O4-coatedporous MPSZ after 32 consecutive cycles of hydrogen production (TR: 1400‚Äì1450C andWS: 1100C) and an irradiation period of 60 min during each RedOx cycle. However, itseems that performing thermochemical reactions in two separate reactors could lead tosome uncertainty in the measurements, while the use of a single reactor for both RedOxreactions may enable a better control over the reactor atmosphere and the inlet/outlet gasesand, hence, more accurate measurements. In their next work [ 97], monoclinic zirconia(m-ZrO 2)-supported NiFe 2O4and Fe 3O4powders were similarly tested in powder andcoated on MPSZ foam for water splitting process. A ferrite conversion of 24‚Äì76% wasobtained after 10 repeated cycles and an irradiation period of 30 min in each cycle. Thesedemonstrated the competency of foam-like RedOx materials compared to powder materialsand the signiÔ¨Åcance of the surface area in reactions.Due to the signiÔ¨Åcance of the surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio, a substantial attempt wasalso allocated to the direct fabrication of the RedOx powders into monolithic structuresthrough methods like robocasting and slurry processes [ 127,148]. For example, cast 3Dlattice-structured monoliths were manufactured from 1: 3Co 0.67Fe2.33O4: YSZ to enhancethe vacancies within the structure and, thus, oxygen mass transfer within solids. Similarly,polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as pore former was added to the materials to increaseporosity within rods. These porous networks were utilized in cyclic lab scale and on sunwater splitting reactions within the temperature range of 1000‚Äì1400C. Although thestructure‚Äôs integrity was improved, the 1:3 Co 0.67Fe2.33O4:YSZ showed limited capabilityfor the cyclic water splitting, due to unfavorable side reactions of ferrite with the YSZsupports [127].Porous, monolithic ceria was used in a directly irradiated solar cavity receiver/reactorfor H 2O and CO 2splitting. The material demonstrated stable and rapid oxidation reactionsfor CO and H 2production over 500 cycles with solar-to-fuel = 0.7‚Äì0.8%, which was arguedto be dependent on the system scale and design rather than materials‚Äô chemistry. That isbecause both the reaction rates and the efÔ¨Åciency of the reactor were found to be limitedmainly by the thermal losses as a result of both convective and radiative heat losses [70].In another work, two adjacent thermochemical reactors consisting of nine siliconizedsilicon carbide (SiSiC) monoliths (146 146 mm2) coated with iron‚Äìzinc mixed oxide wereemployed as chambers within a 100-kW thdirectly irradiated solar water splitting reactorwith a reduction temperature of ~1200C, followed by water splitting at 800C [149]. Theconversion of steam was reported to be ~ 30%, while slight degradation and deactivationof the RedOx material were also observed, which were due to both the volatilization of thezinc oxide content of the porous structure and inhomogeneous temperature distributionwithin the solar reactor. Nonetheless, this was a successful demonstration of the use ofRedOx-coated porous absorbers at a pilot-scale solar receiver/reactor. Gokon et al. [ 143]utilized ferrite/zirconia foam spin-coated with zirconia-supported Fe 3O4or NiFe 2O4.i.e.,Fe3O4/m-ZrO 2, Fe 3O4/c-YSZ, NiFe 2O4/m-ZrO 2, and NiFe 2O4/c-YSZ coated on MPSZas RedOx materials. These materials were tested for the two-step water splitting in adirectly irradiated solar reactor by means of a Xe lamp solar simulator with a power outputof 4106kW th. The highest reactivity was observed from the NiFe 2O4/m-ZrO 2paircoated on MPSZ with a relatively constant hydrogen production rate and maximum ferriteconversion of 60% in 20 consecutive cycles [ 142]. Polymer-based coextrusion ceramichoneycombs of zirconia and iron oxide (Figure 8) were used for splitting of carbon dioxide.This synthesis method enables controlling the surface area of the honeycombs. Moreover,the addition of 3 mol.% and 8 mol.% of yttria improved the oxygen conductivity of thematerials, leading to a noticeable increase in both iron oxide conversion from 41% to 58%Energies 2022 ,15, 63 17 of 65and the stability of the CO production in consecutive RedOx cycles. Additionally, theresults showed that the CO generation signiÔ¨Åcantly depended on the reaction temperatureand CO 2Ô¨Çow rate. Interestingly, the increasing of substrates‚Äô surface area from ~2.6 to~8.5 cm2did not lead to a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in CO generation per unit volume ofthe extruded honeycomb structure, as it did not signiÔ¨Åcantly differ in terms of pore size.The reaction mechanism was also found to be initially spontaneous over the surface ofthe RedOx materials, while, over time, the diffusion mass transfer through pore structurebecame dominant and the reaction rate controlling, which can be attributed to the enhancedtransport phenomena [142].Figure 8. Polymer-based coextrusion ceramic honeycombs made from homogeneous composites ofiron oxide and zirconia for the solar thermochemical dissociation of CO 2to CO [142].Furler et al. [ 150] examined porous ceria felt for thermochemical CO 2and watersplitting in a solar directly irradiated cavity-receiver, exposed to a mean solar concentrationratio of 2865 suns (TR: 1527C and WS/CDS: 827C). The dependence of the compositionof the product syngas on the composition of the feeding mixture of CO 2and H 2O in a rangeof 0.8 to 7.7 was investigated. Advantageously, it has been found that the composition ofthe product syngas can be optimized enabling a H 2to CO ratio of ~2, which is neededin Fischer-Tropsch processes, through varying the feeding ratio of the H 2O to CO 2forthe oxidation of the porous ceria felt. Nevertheless, ceria sublimation and depositionon other reactor components, in particular irradiation widow, were found as the maintechnical challenges, which can lead to thermal stress and crack in the reactor structure.Sublimation of the ceria also leads to the loss of active materials and reduction of the oxygentransfer capacity and hence reactor yield over consecutive RedOx cycles. This directlyirradiated solar reactor was further scaled up to accommodate four RPC rings, entirelymade from ceria as depicted in Figure 9a [ 114]. A mean solar to fuel energy conversionefÔ¨Åciency of 1.73% together with a maximum spontaneous efÔ¨Åciency of 3.53% was reportedfor CO 2splitting. They also observed oxygen deÔ¨Åciency ( ), ranging from 0.016 to 0.04for the temperatures of 1400 to 1600C. Also, the use of porous RedOx material in thissetup (Figure 9b) was compared with the optically thick ceria felt used in their previousstudy [150] and conÔ¨Årmed a 17 times improvement in the fuel yield per cycle.Three-dimensionally macro-porous (3DOM) CeO 2and non-ordered macroporous(NOM) CeO 2were also used for CO 2splitting [ 151]. These structures were synthesizedusing polymeric colloidal spheres as templates and tested in an infrared furnace (TR:1200C, CDS: 850C). The results in this case conÔ¨Årmed the advantages of using porousover non-porous structures, as the structure of the porous RedOx materials was almoststable in over 55 cycles, leading to a considerable improvement in the CO productionrate (10-fold enhancement) relative to that of the nonporous CeO 2structure. This wasattributed to the differences in reactivity of materials because of differences in their surfaceaccessibility by the oxidative gas through the oxidation cycle. This research revealed theimportance of pore engineering of porous materials through pore templating that couldpotentially improve the interconnectivity of the three-dimensional pore structure and massEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 18 of 65transfer, especially through the oxidation stage, and, thus, the kinetics of the oxidation stepbesides improving the resistivity toward sintering.Figure 9. (a) Ceria-coated RPCs consisting of a 20-mm thickness, 100-mm o.d. disk, and four 20-mmthicknesses, 60-mm i.d., 100-mm o.d. rings; ( b) High-Flux Solar Simulator and the conÔ¨Åguration ofporous modules‚Äô assembly at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) (bottom) [114].The novel conÔ¨Åguration of ceria RPCs with dual scale porosity, i.e., larger macropores,between struts and smaller m-sized pores inside struts, was also examined [ 118]. Indoing so, some ceria foams were manufactured with pore sizes in the millimeter range(dmean = 2.5 mm and "= 0.76‚Äì0.82) macroscopically through the bulk and micrometerorder (d mean = 10m and"strut = 0‚Äì0.44) inside the struts by using some sacriÔ¨Åcial carbon-based pore-forming agent with particle sizes of 0.4‚Äì12 m. The synthesized dual-scaleceria foam is shown in Figure 10. Thermogravimetric experiments (TR: 1500C andCDS: 600‚Äì1000C) revealed a 10 times‚Äô higher yield for the samples with porous struts(porosity: 0.44) compared to samples with non-porous solid struts. It was hypothesizedthat the millimeter pores could enhance the reduction reaction, providing an improvedpenetration of thermal irradiation into depth and, thus, a uniform heating, while themicrometer pores could help the oxidation kinetics by providing a better surface areafor such a surface-limited process and decreasing the oxidation time to about one-ninth.Indeed, there was trade-off between the speciÔ¨Åc mass of active RedOx material per unitvolume and porosity. While a higher speciÔ¨Åc mass led to a higher conversion, due to theavailability of more active materials, a low porosity resulted in less radiation penetrationand, hence, reduction extent. Finally, for a validation of TGA results, the dual-scale RPCwas used in a solar cavity-receiver (3.8-kW radiative power at 3015 suns) and showed ameansolar-to-fuel of 1.72% [ 139]. MPSZ foams coated with ferrite supported on monocliniczirconia (NiFe 2O4/ m-ZrO 2/MPSZ) and cerium oxide (CeO 2/MPSZ) were also testedin a directly irradiated receiver/reactor equipped with a Xe solar simulator for watersplitting [ 138]. Results showed that the NiFe 2O4/m-ZrO 2/MPSZ RedOx material had loweryields than CeO 2/MPSZ as a result of some sintering effects at reduction temperaturesof TR = 1450 and 1550C. The effects of the porous substrates‚Äô materials on the methaneEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 19 of 65reforming for syngas production and water splitting was also investigated [ 112]. SiC, Ni,and Cu foams coated with zirconia-supported cerium oxide were heated to 900C using asolar simulator. Results revealed higher gas yields for the Ni and Cu foams than for theSiC one. This was related to the catalytic nature of Ni and Cu for the methane reformingreactions and the better radial thermal distribution within these metals. Indeed, the poorthermal conductivity of the SiC foam substrate compared to the metallic ones resultedin CeO 2particle sintering in consecutive cycles and, thus, a decrement on the overallefÔ¨Åciency.Figure 10. Ceria RPC with dual-scale porosities; macro-porous structure with mm-sized pores thatare ideal for reduction and m-sized pores inside struts (SEM micrograph) responsible for oxidationreaction in the carbon dioxide splitting process [118].The cerium oxide as a RedOx material was examined in various works. For example,the powder and porous forms of the cerium (IV) oxide was tested for CO 2splitting in athermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) setup (TR: 1450C and CDS: 1100C) [152]. The resultsshowed a mean value (after 2000 cycles) of = 0.0197 in CeO 2!CeO 2 cycle with amaximum value of = 0.0383 at 1450C. Higher degrees of non-stoichiometry ( ) led tomore oxygen storage/loss and mobility, while also maintaining the crystallographic Ô¨Çuoritestructure of ceria, leading to more fuel production yield. The porous samples were reportedto slightly lose some of their surface area. However, the porous structure maintained itsreactivity even after 2000 cycles, which is a prerequisite if the RedOx cycle based on thecerium oxide is going to be commercialized.Some efforts on the bench scale as a prerequisite for large-scale demonstration andcommercialization of the RedOx materials have been also reported [ 139,153]. For example,in a recent attempt, a 4-kW solar reactor featuring a ceria RPC with dual porosities as shownin Figure 11a was developed and utilized for CO 2splitting [ 139]. The thermal reductionwas carried out at T reduction = 1450‚Äì1500C and vacuum pressures (p total= 10‚Äì1000 mbar)by means of a solar simulator with a power of 2.4‚Äì4.1 kW. By turning off the solar simulatorand cooling down into T oxidation = 700‚Äì1000C, the oxidation reaction occurred at CO 2Ô¨Çowrates of 3‚Äì7 L min 1completing a 15-min RedOx cycle. Through a temperature/pressure-swing operation within a reactor depicted in Figure 11b, separate streams of O 2and COwith almost 100% selectivity were produced. Also, a molar CO 2conversion to CO of 83%together with solar-to-fuel = 5.25% were obtained, which is around three times more thanthe previously reported values i.e., 1.73% on average and 3.53% at peak [118].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 20 of 65Figure 11. (a) Schematic representation of the solar reactor for carbon dioxide splitting, comprising awindowed cavity-receiver containing a ceria RPC with dual pore sizes (mm- and m-sized pores);(b) images of the front face of the solar reactor with the windowed aperture and its interior containingthe octagonal ceria RPC structure insulated with a line of alumina [153].A volumetric, directly irradiated solar cavity receiver equipped with 5-ppi ceria RPCwas directly irradiated in the temperature range of 950‚Äì1050C for syngas production andisothermal H 2O/CO 2splitting [ 154]. The ceria reduction was performed with methane(partial oxidation of methane), while the oxidation was completed by H 2O/CO 2under thesame operating temperature. Methane was employed to reduce the reduction temperatureand, hence, the technical challenges associated with the high temperatures and the parasiticlosses. Various operating parameters such as methane Ô¨Çow rate and reduction temperaturewere studied on the CO 2conversion and, thus, syngas yield. It was shown that an increasein the methane Ô¨Çow rate and decrease in temperature resulted in carbon formation duringmethane cracking, while increasing the nonstoichiometry value ( up to 0.38) led to greatersyngas yields, with a maximum value of 8.08 mol of methane per kg of CeO 2. The materialstability was reported to be high enough after 15 successive ceria RedOx cycles with thehighest solar-to-fuel energy conversion efÔ¨Åciency of 5.22% and the energy upgrade factorin the range of 0.97‚Äì1.10. Nonetheless, further cyclic RedOx assessments are needed tojustify the material stability.Despite the signiÔ¨Åcant effort that has been allocated to the development of variousRedOx pairs, the cerium oxide and perovskite materials have been relatively more attractive.This is due to their potential for higher efÔ¨Åciency and durability over successive RedOxcycles. In a recent, unprecedented work, a nano perovskite-coated silicon carbide RPCwith dual pore sizes of macro pores between struts (d p= 2.54 mm) and m-sized poresinside struts (d p= 490m) was tested in an infrared furnace to assess the capability of thedeveloped materials for CO 2splitting [ 18]. The porous structure was coated by the dip-coating method [ 155] with ca. 15-mm thickness of La 0.6Ca0.4Mn 0.6Al0.4O3(LCMA) asactive RedOx material. The LCMA-coated porous substrate could convert CO 2to CO with aconcentration of [CO%] = 3.2 in a controlled atmosphere of 10 vol.% CO 2feed gas at 1050Cafter around 1.5 h of reduction reaction at 1240C. However, the XCT characterizationrevealed that the process distorted the RPC by coagulation of smaller pores within strutsand some diffusion of LCMA into struts‚Äô pores. As a complementary work [ 136], threedifferent pore sizes of porous substrates, i.e., 5, 12, and 75 ppi, were also investigated toassess the effects of pore architecture on CO 2conversion efÔ¨Åciency. Figure 12 illustratesthe 2D tomograms of 12 ppi sample (a) before; (b) after LCMA perovskite coating; (c) aftertomograms registration showing the perovskite coating layer. Although the sample withpore size of 12 ppi possessed the most homogeneity of RedOx coating layer as much as thehighest perovskite loading, 75 ppi porous sample with the smallest pore sizes deliveredEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 21 of 65the highest CO yield of ca. 0.07 molg 1LCMA. The non-stoichiometry oxygen was alsocalculated to be = 0.4.Figure 12. The 2D tomogram slices of a porous SiC sample with dual-scale pore sizes including macropores between struts and m-sized micropores inside struts; ( a) before; ( b) after LCMA perovskitecoating; and ( c) after tomograms‚Äô registration showing the perovskite mapping [136].Haeussler et al. [ 73] tested a series of ceria RPCs with gradient pore sizes in the range of10‚Äì60 ppi within a 1.5 kW thdirectly irradiated solar reactor. The temperature-swing RedOxreactions were performed (TR: 1400‚Äì1450C and WS/CDS at 700‚Äì1100C) to producepure H 2or CO inside the same reactor (Figure 13). Similarly, the results demonstrated thatthe degree of ceria reduction increases with decreasing of both the temperature and theoperating pressure. Moreover, it was found that the oxidation rate could be improved (up to9.3 mLg 1min 1) by increasing the inlet CO 2Ô¨Çow rate which is attributed to the increasingof the reactions driving force. A maximum solar-to-fuel of ~7.5% was also measured after 64cycles with a high stability of the porous RedOx structures [73].Figure 13. Schematic of the 1.5-kW thdirectly irradiated solar reactor equipped with a series of ceriaRPCs with 10‚Äì60-ppi gradient pore sizes used for H 2O or CO 2splitting [73].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 22 of 65Subsequent to the previous work, the La 0.5Sr0.5Mn 0.9Mg 0.1O3(LSMMg)-coated ce-ria foam was tested for steam and carbon dioxide splitting [ 14]. The results showed animproved reduction extent mainly due to the perovskite layer, but no improvement wasobserved in the re-oxidation and the fuel production rate compared to the pure uncoatedceria RPC. It was concluded that the use of LSMMg perovskite coating (~10- m thickness)worked as a layer that hindered the oxidant gas (H 2O or CO 2) from accessing the reactiveceria, which possessed a higher re-oxidation capability. However, it was shown that byoptimization of some reaction parameters such as pressure during the reduction cycle andthe total gas Ô¨Çow rate as well as the oxidant molar fraction during the re-oxidation step thefuel production rate could be increased. This research on porous RedOx materials with cou-pled positive aspects of two different active materials showed a maximum solar-to-fuel = 5.3,which was very close to the value for the uncoated ceria foam (peak solar-to-fuel = 5.5). Therole of this composite synthesis was synergistic oxygen release in the reduction cycle andresulted in a higher total fuel production relative to the uncoated ceria.The majority of the proposed and assessed reactors for the thermochemical CO 2and H 2O splitting was based on the direct irradiation of the porous oxygen carriers ina cavity receiver/reactor [ 69]. This is mainly because the cavity shape has been foundas the most suitable conÔ¨Åguration for efÔ¨Åcient harnessing of highly concentrated solarradiation [ 156], due to its potential for the mitigation of the re-radiation and convectionheat losses [ 82,125,126,157]. However, recently, an indirectly heated reactor concept forthe two-step partial RedOx cycles was proposed by Yuan et al. [ 158], which is heatedindirectly by a molten metal heat transfer Ô¨Çuid (MLHTF). In this system, the MLHTF isÔ¨Årst heated within a solar cavity receiver and then is transferred and used to feed thesolar energy captured in the receiver to the reactor. The reactor comprises an array ofsealed reaction chambers that are interconnected with a piping network, which allows theLMHTF to transfer heat between the chambers. The liquid metal also facilitates efÔ¨Åcientheat both within the solar receiver and the reaction chambers [ 159]. The overall thermal-to-chemical efÔ¨Åciency of this system (from the thermal energy in the liquid metal to thechemical energy in the hydrogen fuel) is estimated to be ~20% when ceria is employedas the reactive oxygen storage material [ 158]. The estimated efÔ¨Åciency of this system isan order of magnitude higher than that of previous designs based on direct irradiationof the reduction reactor. Additionally, it offers potential both to integrate solar thermalenergy storage into the system, i.e., via a series of tanks [ 7,64], and to mitigate the powerdensity mismatch between the demand of the reduction reactor and the concentrated solarradiation [ 158]. However, this technology is at the embryonic stage of development andfaces signiÔ¨Åcant challenges in regard to material compatibility, handling, containment, andtransfer of molten metals through various components of the system [ 160,161] and needssigniÔ¨Åcant further assessments and developments.2.3. Potentials and Critical Research ChallengesFrom a fundamental point of view, using sunlight as a source of thermal energyprovides advantages over photocatalytic approaches. This is because it enables the useof the entire solar spectrum, as opposed to only using the high energy portion of thespectrum with energy greater than the photocatalyst bandgap [ 158]. Techno-economicanalyses have also shown that the production of solar fuels through thermochemicalmethods can be economically viable, if the solar-to-fuel efÔ¨Åciency of a system exceeds20% [ 71,72]. Notwithstanding the potential advantages of the use of solar thermal energyfor thermochemical CO 2and H 2O splitting, this technology is still at a relatively earlystage of development with all demonstrations being at bench scale. Therefore, furtherresearch, development, and pilot-scale demonstrations are required if the technology is tobe implemented in large scale. In particular:1. RedOx material improvements are necessary to reduce both the required temperatureof the RedOx reactions preferably to less than 1000C, and the degradation of theEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 23 of 65materials over a very large number of cycles. This is especially important for thereduction of the oxygen carriers used in the RedOx cycles (Equation (1)), because:a. The heat loss from the solar systems increases signiÔ¨Åcantly with tempera-ture [ 82,125,126,157]. The re-radiation heat losses from the cavity solar receiverand reactors increases with the fourth power of the reactor absolute tem-perature [ 7,63,75,162], while the challenges associated with the start-up andshut-down of the solar receiver and reactors and the associated parasitic lossesalso increase with the temperature [63].b. Material compatibility is a substantial challenge of the state-of-the-art reactors,which can be greatly reduced through lowering the operating temperatureof the system. Commensurate with this, operating temperatures of less than~1000C would enable the use of commercially available stainless steels witha lower cost of insolation and, hence, bring down the capital costs [68].c. To achieve temperatures of more than 1000C within the solar receiver and re-actors there is need for high concentration ratios from the heliostat Ô¨Åeld, which,in turn, increase the spillage losses and capital costs of the solar concentrators.Porous structures have been shown to assist in the increasing oxidative capacity anddurability and, hence, are likely to be a key part in the commercial implementation ofthermochemical cycles for CDR.2. Along with the progress in material synthesis and design, improvement in the per-formance of the reactors is needed to efÔ¨Åciently utilize the solar heat to drive theendothermic reduction reactions.i. The majority of the proposed and assessed RedOx cycles are based on thedirectly irradiated solar reactors [ 83,163‚Äì165], employing a quartz glass win-dow [ 68]. Windows are often used in laboratory-based reactors [ 68]. In com-mercial application there are potential issues with the high cost of large quartzwindows and the need to maintain/clean them in the Ô¨Åeld [ 68]. That is be-cause the windows are vulnerable to particle deposition, thermal shock, andhigh/low pressures, while also they need effective sealing [ 166‚Äì168]. To avoiddirectly irradiated, windowed solar reactors, an approach is to use highlyconcentrated solar radiation to heat a heat transfer Ô¨Çuid (HTF), which is trans-ported into an indirectly heated reduction reactor and used to provide therequired heat of the endothermic reactions [ 158,159]. Nevertheless, the concepthas recently begun to be explored such that the full extent of its potentials andchallenges are yet to be identiÔ¨Åed. It is worth noting that potentially a relativelyhigher thermodynamic efÔ¨Åciency can be achieved in directly irradiated solar re-ceiver/reactors relative to indirectly heated ones, due to the elimination of theexergy losses associated with the heating of the intermediate HTF and the tem-perature difference needed within the required heat exchangers to efÔ¨Åcientlytransfer heat from HTF to reactors and other components of the process [ 64].It is also worth mentioning that a high-temperature pump has been recentlydeveloped and demonstrated to circulate molten tin at 1200‚Äì1400C in such asystem [ 169]. Another potential approach is to use a windowless reactor [ 170].This avoids the issues of using a window [ 64], although this would be achievedat the expense of a lower efÔ¨Åciency. The concept of windowless reactors hasbeen recently explored at bench scale by Long et al. [ 170]. They characterizedthe isothermal Ô¨Çow-Ô¨Åeld within a vortex-based solar cavity receiver with anopen aperture. However, further demonstration and assessments are neededto better understand the performance of these receiver/reactors under morerealistic conditions, e.g., on solar towers, where they are well above the groundwind boundary layers and exposed to substantial turbulence from relativelypermanent wind in different directions [82].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 24 of 65Finally, further research in whole cycle conÔ¨Ågurations is needed to identify processconÔ¨Ågurations that enable minimum exergy loss through efÔ¨Åcient heat recovery.3. Photoreduction of CO 2Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2into hydrocarbons offers the potential for low-costand sustainable amelioration of energy shortages and CO 2emissions [ 21]. Nevertheless,despite signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in the efÔ¨Åciency of the photoreduction process since theÔ¨Årst report in 1979 [ 171], it is still far from being economically viable [ 172]. Therefore,widespread attention has been allocated to this technology. In this method, as shown inFigure 14, the photocatalyst is excited via absorption of photons with energy higher orequal to the energy of a gap between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). Theirradiated energy excites an electron from the VB to the CB, creating a deÔ¨Åcit of negativecharge in the VB (referred to as a ‚Äúhole‚Äù), and acts as a positive charge carrier. Then,the electrons act as a reducing agent for the adsorbed CO 2molecules on the surface ofthe photocatalyst, and the holes drive a charge-balancing oxidation reaction. Finally, theproduced molecule has to desorb and diffuse to the gas or liquid phase to accomplish theconversion process [24,173,174].Figure 14. Schematic of the overall photocatalytic reaction process for CO 2reduction (E+Potential(V) vs. NHE at pH 7).Among the various known photocatalysts, TiO 2has been found as the most promisingmaterial due to its availability, high chemical stability, and low cost [ 25,175]. Furthermore,the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new class of organic-inorganic hybridmaterials with an extended 3D network has recently drawn widespread attention, whichis mainly due to their unique properties such as structural Ô¨Çexibility, tunable and well-ordered porous structures, and high speciÔ¨Åc surface area. TiO 2and MOFs along with theirmodiÔ¨Åcation methods will be the focus of this section.3.1. TiO 2Photoreduction CatalystThe use of TiO 2for CDR offers signiÔ¨Åcant advantages such as high photoactivity,high physical and chemical stability, non-toxicity, low cost, and widespread availabil-ity[176‚Äì178] . Notwithstanding these signiÔ¨Åcant advantages, TiO 2has also the drawback ofits wide band gap (3.2 eV), which limits its activation only to the UV region, which accountsfor only 5% of solar insolation [ 26,179‚Äì181]. In addition, TiO 2shows relatively low CO 2reduction efÔ¨Åciency and selectivity due to the fast electron-hole recombination and the com-peting side reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H++ 2e !H2) [182,183].Thus, extensive works have been performed to enhance TiO 2-based photocatalyst per-formance. These include doping with metals and non-metals, surface sensitization, andEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 25 of 65coupling with other semiconductors to enhance visible light absorption and reductionefÔ¨Åciency [27]. In the following sections, these are discussed in more detail.3.1.1. Metals‚Äô and Non-Metals‚Äô Doping and CocatalystsDoping with metals or non-metals is a method that is extensively applied to increasethe spectral response of TiO 2-based nanocomposites. In this method, the excitation of theelectrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) is facilitated by reducingthe absorption edge of TiO 2[184,185]. Additionally, doping TiO 2with metals reduces theelectron-hole recombination by trapping photo-generated charge carriers [ 186]. A list ofresearch items on the doping of TiO 2with metal and non-metals is presented in Table 5.Indium (In) is an efÔ¨Åcacious metal to increase TiO 2photoactivity and selectivity, since In-metal can produce large number of electrons and reduce recombination of photogeneratedcharges over TiO 2. Besides, In-metal has other particular characteristics, e.g., it is relativelycheaper and has multiple oxidation states and low toxicity [ 187,188]. Therefore, In-dopedTiO 2nanoparticles were synthesized for CO 2photoreduction with H 2O vapor under UVlight irradiation in a cell-type photoreactor. The reaction was performed at 373 K and 0.2bar with a CO 2-to-H 2O feed ratio (P CO2/PH2O) of 1.43. The presence of the indium overTiO 2produced the anatase phase of mesoporous TiO 2with smaller particle size and largersurface area. As shown in Table 5, CO and CH 4were the main products. The maximumyield rates for CH 4and CO were obtained over 10 wt.% In-doped TiO 2of 244 and 81 mol,which are 7.87 and 1.76 times greater than that pure TiO 2, respectively. On the other hand,the selectivity of CH 4was increased from 40% over TiO 2to 70% over In-doped TiO 2. As aresult, the In-doped TiO 2catalyst showed better catalytic performance compared to thepure TiO 2due to the higher active surface area, efÔ¨Åcient production, and suppressingrecombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. [184].Among noble metals, platinum demonstrates the highest work function (5.65 eV) and,thus, lowest Fermi level, and, therefore, the strongest photoexcited electron-extractingcapacity from the conduction band of TiO 2, which prolongs the electron lifetime andenhances Pt/TiO 2catalytic activity compared to bare titania. Notably, Pt has indicatedhigher selectivity to CH 4compared to other cocatalysts in photocatalytic CDR [ 189‚Äì191].In this regard, additional factors, other than the purely electronic, ones should play acrucial role in differentiating Pt nanoparticles, such as surface chemistry and interactionwith adsorbates [ 189,191,192]. Therefore, Pt was deposited on a composite of commercialTiO 2(Degussa P25) using mesoporous silica (COK-12) to prepare Pt/TiO 2and Pt/TiO 2-COK-12 photocatalysts with various amounts of Pt. The CO 2photoreduction test wasperformed in the presence of H 2O as a reductant under UV light irradiation inside acontinuous Ô¨Çow photoreactor. After a 16-h irradiation, H 2, CH 4, and CO were detectedas the main products. Moreover, CO was the main product when pure TiO 2was appliedas a photocatalyst. They also found that the optimum amount of Pt can improve CO 2photoreduction toward CH 4with approximately 100% selectivity. Furthermore, supportingthe Pt/TiO 2photocatalyst on COK-12 keeps the CH 4selectivity and also improves theoverall photoactivity of the Pt/TiO 2photocatalyst due to the increment of the surface areaand titania dispersion [182,186,193].Larimi et al. [ 194] applied supported Pt-TiO 2photocatalyst on carbonaceous sup-ports such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), singe-walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and activated carbon (AC) as a photocatalyst forCO 2reduction in the presence of water vapor under visible light irradiation in a continuousgas-phase Ô¨Åxed-bed photoreactor. Carbonaceous materials have excellent properties suchas high surface area, high mechanical and chemical resistance, and great electron transferproperties. They act as electron acceptor, consequently suppressing the electron-hole re-combination of synthesized photocatalyst. As shown in Table 5, the highest CH 4yield wasobtained for Pt-TiO 2/MWCNT (1.9 mol g cat. 1h 1), which implied that smaller particlesimprove photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, it implies better catalytic activity com-pared to the other types of carbonaceous supports Table 5. Co-doped TiO 2exhibits betterEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 26 of 65light absorption in the visible range compared to the bare titania and single-doped samplesbecause of the decreasing recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Amongtransition metals, nickel has good properties such as high activity for CH 4production, ischeaper than noble metals, and has better optical properties. Additionally, the electron-holerecombination rate efÔ¨Åciently reduced in the presence of Ni [ 195‚Äì198]. On the other hand,doping Bi ion in TiO 2shows high CO 2adsorption and also increases visible light absorption,resulting in improving photocatalytic properties of TiO 2[199‚Äì201]. With all these in mind,different amounts of Ni and Bi were utilized to prepare Ni-doped TiO 2, Bi-doped TiO 2,and co-doped samples. The results showed that the synthesized samples had narrowerband-gap energy and signiÔ¨Åcantly increased visible light adsorption with a decreased rateof electron-hole recombination. Ni and Bi atoms can act as trapper for photogeneratedelectron-hole pairs and reduce the recombination rate. When the doped Ni ions trap thephotogenerated charge carriers, the valence layer of the Ni2+(3d8) is changed from highspin state to low spin state, resulting in a remarkable spin energy loss. The trapped chargecarriers will migrate to the adsorbed water molecules on the surface to reinstate its energy.This will Ô¨Ånally inhibit the recombination of electron-hole (e /h+) pairs. Among thesesamples, 1 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Bi co-doped TiO 2demonstrated the highest methane production(21.13mol/g cat.), which was about 6.5 times greater than pure TiO 2[186].In addition, copper can also inhibit electron-hole pair recombination. Therefore,Spadaro et al. investigated alternative reactor designs for direct conversion of CO 2exhaustusing 0.5 wt% CuO/TiO 2photocatalysts [ 202]. The comparison of three different photore-actor systems, a continuously stirred ‚Äúsemi-batch‚Äù (SB) photoreactor, a packed-bed (PB)photoreactor, and a multi-tubular (MT) photoreactor, was performed. Different reactionconditions were applied for the systems as follow:(a) SB photoreactor: photoreactor tests were carried out in water media and gas mixtureof 92% CO 2and 8% N 2at room temperature. Then, 1.5 g of photocatalyst and 600 mLof K 2CO 3solution (0.1 M) were loaded.(b) PB photoreactor: 90% gas mixture (i.e., 92% CO 2/N 2) and 10% of water vapor atthe saturated pressure of 46C were applied. The reaction was performed at roomtemperature and pipelines were heated at 50C to prevent water condensation.(c) MT photoreactor: This type of photoreactor was utilized to perform CO 2photore-duction tests in the industrial environment. For this purpose, a gas treatment unitwas utilized to enrich CO 2content up to 60‚Äì80%. Thereafter, the MT photoreactorwith 20 Pyrex reactor tubes connected in series was applied. The photoreaction wasperformed continuously with a stream of 60% CO 2/N2at 60‚Äì70% of relative humidity(RH).The obtained results have been showed in Table 3. According to Table 3, TiO 2promotesCH 4formation which is two times greater than methanol formation. On the other hand,Cu-TiO 2demonstrates a low rate of CH 4formation and a higher rate of CH 3OH formation(47mol g cat. 1h 1) after 60 h irradiation. A comparison between quantum efÔ¨Åciencyand thermal energy of MT (0.063% of AQE maxand 5 W h/m2) and PB (6% of AQE maxand 315 W h/m2) photoreactors implies that PB photoreactor is the greatest performingtechnical choice [202].Non-metal dopants create a heteroatomic surface structure, which leads to decreasingthe band gap energy, which subsequently increases photoactivity in the visible light region.In other words, dopants narrow down the TiO 2band-gap through introducing new energystates above VB and promote electrons‚Äô excitation from VB to CB. Among various non-metal dopants, nitrogen (N) has been widely studied [ 25,203,204]. That is because nitrogenhas an almost similar atomic size to oxygen, so it is possible to introduced it easily into thetitania structure in both substitutional and interstitial positions. Doping with nitrogen canchange the band edge of the TiO 2, resulting in extending activity into the visible region.Notably, doping TiO 2with nitrogen induces optical transitions from N 2p states and theband-gap narrows by mixing with O 2p. Finally, it leads to obtaining better structural andmorphological properties [ 205,206]. Liu et al. [ 186] synthesized Cu-N-co-doped TiO 2andEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 27 of 65N-doped TiO 2for CO 2photoreduction with the presence of water in the liquid phase underUV irradiation. The acetone yield of N 3/TiO 2and Cu 0.6N4/TiO 2(Cu: 0.6 wt.% and N: 4wt.%) were 52.6 and 33.2 mol/g h, respectively. The obtained results showed that thesmaller particle sizes and little higher band gap of the N-doped TiO 2than Cu-N-co-dopedTiO 2led to improving the UV light absorption and, hence, a higher photoactivity thanpure TiO 2. Furthermore, Matejova et al. [ 207] prepared nitrogen-doped TiO 2throughvarious methods such as the sol-gel method combined with calcination (N/TiO 2-SG-C),the hydrothermal method combined with calcination (N/TiO 2-HT-C), and the sol-gelmethod combined with pressurized Ô¨Çuid processing (N/TiO 2-SG-PFE). The preparedphotocatalysts were utilized for CO 2reduction in 0.2 M NaOH solution as a reductionmedium under UV light irradiation. CO, CH 4, and H 2were the detected products withthe yields‚Äô (mol g 1cat.) order of CO > H 2> CH 4. Surprisingly, the presence of nitrogencaused the decline of the formation of all products, in particular over TiO 2-SG-C. In theCO 2photoreduction, the structure of the surface phase junction within the bicrystallinemixture of anatase and brookite played a crucial role instead of defect sites because itcaused decreasing electron-hole recombination. Therefore, the nitrogen loading did notlead to CO 2photoreduction enhancement.Table 3. Results of CO 2photoreduction reaction under UVA 285-W/m2irradiation [202].Photoreactor.

Surface PhotosensitizationIn this method, light-sensitive materials are utilized in conjunction with TiO 2to facili-tate electron transfers from their CB into the TiO 2CB, as shown in Figure 15. This, in turn,enables TiO 2to be applicable under visible light [ 25], in addition to the UV band. That isTiO 2surface photosensitization is found to improve the photoactivity through modifyingthe optical features, enabling more effective harvesting of the visible light illumination.Table 5 provides a list of materials investigated as surface sensitizer onto TiO 2. Li et al. [ 208]used N,S- containing carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) as a sensitizer onto TiO 2to enhancelight absorption through acting as a bridge for carrying and transferring electrons fromTiO 2. The nanocomposite was applied as a photocatalyst for CO 2reduction with H 2Oas a reductant and proton donor under solar irradiation. After 1 h irradiation, 0.769 and1.153mol CH 4and CO, respectively, obtained which are 7.79 and 7.61-fold greater thanpristine TiO 2. This photoactivity enhancement of NCQDs/TiO 2is due to excellent lightabsorbance and effective charge separation induced by CQDs. Furthermore, photogener-ated electrons transfer from TiO 2to NCQDs, suppressing recombination of photogeneratedelectron-hole pairs. On the other hand, NCQDs act as electron reservoirs. Ionic liquids(ILs) such as azolate-, alcoholate-, phenolate-, amino acid containing anion- and pyridine-containing anion-based ILs have been also extensively investigated for efÔ¨Åcient CO 2captureat ambient conditions and conversion. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, ILs demonstrate remarkable potentialin increasing CO 2photoreduction nevertheless, few studies have been conducted in thiscontext [ 209‚Äì212]. Recently, Chen et al. [ 213] applied tetrabuthylphosphonium citrazinate([P4444]3[p-2,6-O-4-COO]), tetrabuthylammonium citrazinate ([N 4444]3[p-2,6-O-4-COO]),and [P 4444]2[pH-2,6-O-4-COO] as ILs and anatase TiO 2. The photoreaction was performedin the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of IL (50%) with triethanolamine (TEOA) asEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 28 of 65hole scavenger under visible light irradiation ( > 420 nm). The obtained results are shownin Table 5. The IL, [P 4444]3[p-2,6-O-4-COO], signiÔ¨Åcantly improved CO 2photoreduction(3.52mol g 1h 1for CH 4) and selectivity (96.2%) compared to the other ILs, whichcan be attributed to both the higher absorption capacity to CO 2and superior visible lightabsorbance after CO 2absorption.Figure 15. Schematic of the Surface photosensitizer.Generally, TiO 2surface photosensitization is highly recommended to improve pho-toactivity signiÔ¨Åcantly through modifying the optical features so that it can effectivelyharvest the visible light illumination.3.1.3. Semiconductor CouplingCoupling TiO 2with a low band gap semiconductor can induce red shift to theband gap and reduce electron-hole recombination, improving the photocatalyst perfor-mance [214,215] . Xu et al. [ 216] utilized an amorphous-TiO 2-encapsulated CsPbBr 3nanocrys-tal (CsPbBr 3NC/-TiO 2) hybrid structure to increase CO 2photoreduction. This structuralimprovement inÔ¨Çuenced signiÔ¨Åcantly the CH 4production rate which is more thermody-namically favorable than CO and H 2formation despite the kinetic challenges due to theeight electrons involvement. This hybrid structure increased photoactivity from 2.06 to20.15 mmol CH 4g 1cat.after 3 h photocatalytic reaction (see Table 4). Generally, the photoac-tivity enhancement was related to accelerated photoinduced charge separation and themultiplied CO 2adsorption. It is worth mentioning that TiO 2provides surfaces with highCO 2adsorption. Furthermore, increasing tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) precursor, decreasingnanocrystal size which would increase the speciÔ¨Åc surface area of CsPbBr 3NC/a-TiO 2(x),and therefore contributing to the performance of photocatalyst. In this regard, the stablechemical state of CO 2activated by incorporating with Ti-O bonds, which facilitated thekinetics of subsequent photoreactions. Therefore, a-TiO 2has a synergistic inÔ¨Çuence on theincrement of photocatalytic performance through charge improvement.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 29 of 65Table 4.

[ 217] synthesized TiO 2/carbon nitride nanosheets‚Äô (CNNS) het-erostructures using a hydrothermal in situ growth method and utilized for CO 2pho-toreduction into CO under UV-Vis light irradiation with H 2and H 2O as reductant. TheTiO 2/CNNS composites synthesized in the presence of HF and deionized water werenamed Ti-NS/CN and Ti-ISO/CN, respectively. Notably, porosity and surface area areimportant properties of a photocatalyst, which increase interactions between the reac-tants and the active sites. In this respect, Ti-NS/CN showed the highest surface area(174 m2g 1) compared to the Ti-ISO/CN (119 m2g 1). Furthermore, the porosity of Ti-NS/CN (V total= 0.294 cm3g 1) was increased compared to the parent materials (V total(TiO 2-NS) = 0.085, V total(CNNs) = 0.141 cm3g 1), which can be attributed to the self-assembly ofTiO 2-NS in the presence of CNNS forming a porous structure. Therefore, the Ti-NS/CNstructure can provide efÔ¨Åcient pathways and enhance the concentration of reactants in thevicinity of catalytic sites. As it was expected, Ti-NS/CN exhibited higher CO evolutionrates (2.04mol g 1cat.h 1) compared to the Ti-ISO/CN (1.55 mol g 1cat.h 1). Further-more, H 2and O 2were products in addition to CO when the reaction proceeded in thepresence of H 2O over Ti-NS/CN. Under these conditions, CO and H 2evolution rates were0.8 and 2.67mol g 1cat.h 1, respectively. This decline in CO production was due to theH2production from water splitting. On the other hand, under UV-vis illumination, bothCNNS and TiO 2reduced CO 2to CO because both of them absorb photons and generateelectron-hole pairs. The increase of Ti-NS/CN photoactivity was due to the availability ofCO 2and photoexcited electrons. Furthermore, CO 2concentration on the catalytic sites wasincreased due to their greater CO 2adsorption. Additionally, photogenerated electron-holepairs‚Äô recombination was suppressed. In another study [ 218], chromium (III) oxide (Cr 2O3),a p-type semiconductor, was utilized to prepare core-shell Cr 2O3@TiO 2nanoparticles. Theprepared X-Cr 2O3@TiO 2(X refers to the calcination temperature) was used as a photo-catalyst to reduce CO 2into CH 4with H 2O as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent under UV illumination.The results are shown in Figure 16. The highest yield rates for CH 4increased with in-creasing calcination temperature from about 105 mol g 1cat.h 1for 400-Cr 2O3@TiO 2to approximately 168 mol g 1cat.h 1for 700-Cr 2O3@TiO 2. The increment in the CH 4production over X-Cr 2O3@TiO 2core-shell structure was due to the close contact betweenthe formed p-n junction of Cr 2O3and TiO 2. Additionally, the formed p-n junction reducedthe migration distance of the photogenerated electrons.In 2020, Iqbal et al. [ 219] synthesized ZnFe 2O4/TiO 2heterojunctions for CO 2photore-duction into methanol under visible light illumination. The BET surface areas of ZnFe 2O4,ZnFe 2O4/TiO 2(2:1w/w), and ZnFe 2O4/TiO 2(1:1w/w) were 2.479, 5.027, and 6.521 m2g 1,respectively. Therefore, ZnFe 2O4/TiO 2(1:1w/w) had highest BET surface area and bet-ter morphological structure. Furthermore, ZnFe 2O4/TiO 2(1:1w/w) showed the highestmethanol yield, 693.31 mol g 1cat., which highlights the importance of surface area inheterogenous catalysis.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 30 of 65Figure 16. CH 4photoreduction using Cr 2O3coupled with TiO 2photocatalysts showing ( a) Cr 2O3,(b) 400-Cr 2O3@TiO 2, (c) 550-Cr 2O3@TiO 2, (d) 700-Cr 2O3@TiO 2, and ( e) 850-Cr 2O3@TiO 2[218].3.2. CO 2Photoreduction by Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)MOFs as new porous hybrid materials that are composed of organic linkers and metalions have unique properties such as extremely large surface area (up to 8000 m2g 1),uniform and tunable porous structure, and tailorable chemistry, which have led to thedevelopment of these materials as potential photocatalysts for CO 2reduction [ 220,221].In 2006, Garcia et al. [ 222] made a historic work, which has drawn widespread attentiontoward MOFs as a new type of promising photocatalysts. In order to accelerate the pho-togenerated charge separation and transfer and, consequently, increasing photocatalyticperformance, different forms of MOFs are utilized as photocatalyst. Furthermore, MOFs‚Äôlight absorption ability can be facilely tuned by modiÔ¨Åcations on the metal ions and theorganic linkers, owing to versatile coordination chemistry of the metal cations, availabilityof variety organic linkers, and the feasibility to modulate the composition, structure, andproperties of the MOFs. Therefore, efÔ¨Åcient utilization of solar energy by MOFs can beobtained [223]. These modiÔ¨Åcation methods will be discussed in the following sections.3.2.1. NH 2-ModiÔ¨Åed MOFAmong different functional groups, amine groups are most investigated for function-alizing MOFs due to their strong afÔ¨Ånity to acidic gas molecules, and they also can provideactive sites for catalysis. In this respect, NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) was synthesized by using 2-aminoterephtalate acid (H 2ATA) as an organic linker to utilize as a photocatalyst for CO 2reduction. The photoreaction was performed in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA)as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent under visible light irradiation. After a 10-h illumination, the parentMIL-125 (Ti) did not show any photoactivity, whereas NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) demonstratedmoderate activity, with 8.14 mol HCOO produced. These results conÔ¨Årmed the visiblelight photoactivity of NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) was induced by amino functionality, which wasalso conÔ¨Årmed by UV/Vis spectra, Figure 17 [224].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 31 of 65Figure 17. UV/Vis spectra of ( a) MIL-125 (Ti) and ( b) NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) [224].In another study [ 225], NH 2-UiO-66(Zr) was utilized as a photocatalyst for CO 2re-duction and showed higher photocatalytic activity than a prior study, NH 2-MIL-125(Ti),under visible-light irradiation. It is worthy to note that the RedOx potential of ZrIV/ZrIIIismore negative than TiIV/TiIII, which is more favorable for CO 2photoreduction reaction.Furthermore, UiO-66, a zirconium-based MOF, is a potential material for CO 2capture andstorage because of its higher chemical and thermostability compared to NH 2-MIL-125(Ti).Furthermore, UiO-66 shows semiconductor behavior that can promote charge transfer andharvest solar light. Besides, the prepared, mixed NH 2-UiO-66 (Zr), which was synthe-sized by mixing 2-aminoterephthalate (ATA) and 2,5-diaminoterephthalic acid (H 2DTA),demonstrated an improvement in photoactivity of >50% compared with the pure NH 2-UiO-66(Zr) for the reduction of CO 2, which was attributed to the increasing of both CO 2adsorption and light adsorption in the visible region. Iron is an earth-abundant element.Fe-containing complexes are generally utilized as catalysts and photocatalysts. Particularly,Fe-based MOF materials are highly attractive due to their visible-light-response, whichoriginates from Fe-O clusters. Therefore, a series of both parent and amine-functionalizedFe-containing MOFs (MIL-101 (Fe), MIL-53 (Fe), MIL-88B (Fe)) were applied as a photo-catalyst for CO 2reduction, producing formate under visible light irradiation. While aremarkable increase in photoactivity was observed for all assessed materials, MIL-101(Fe)and its amino-functionalized structure showed the best photoactivity of 59 and 178 molHCOO , respectively. That was attributed to the existence of dual pathways: (1) direct exci-tation of Fe-O clusters and (2) NH 2functionality excitation followed by an electron transferto the metal center. This phenomenon is schematically shown in Figure 18. Generally, thisstudy conÔ¨Årmed that the structure of the MOF can signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence photocatalyticactivity [226].In order to improve the photoactivity of NH 2-UiO-66, for the Ô¨Årst time, Cheng et al. [ 22]used 2,4,6-tris (4-pyridyl) pyridine (tpy). The tpy facilitated charge transfer because of itsstrong electron-donating ability and can lead to improvement in CO 2to CO conversionas illustrated in Figure 19a, therefore, the performance of modiÔ¨Åed MOF is improved forCO 2photoreduction reaction. Furthermore, commensurate with this Figure 19b presentsthe variations of the CO evolution as a function of the time and clearly shows that thephotocatalytic performance of NH 2-UiO-66-tpy is greatly improved for CO 2reduction incomparison with the NH 2-UiO-66.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 32 of 65Figure 18. Reaction pathways over NH 2-MOFs (Fe) [226].Figure 19. (a) Reaction pathway of CO 2photoreduction over NH 2-UiO-66-tpy. N: blue, O: red, Zr:indigo, C: light gray. ( b) CO evolution over NH 2-UiO-66-tpy (I) and NH 2-UiO-66 (II) as a function oftime [22].3.2.2. Semiconductor MOF CompositeSince semiconductor photocatalysts have high CO 2photoreduction activity, also, MOFmaterials have great CO 2capture ability, the incorporation of these two materials is a usefulmethod to design and synthesize composite photocatalysts that integrate the advantagesof both materials. The integration of semiconductor and MOF structures possess bettercapability on light harvesting because of the synergistic effect [ 227]. Conjugated graphiticcarbon nitride (g-C 3N4) polymers possess an extreme thermal stability up to 550C in airand high chemical stability, high speciÔ¨Åc surface area, with great semiconductor RedOxenergetics for CO 2reduction [ 228‚Äì230]. Furthermore, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks(ZIFs) have excellent structural stability in water, high thermal and chemical stability, also,have excellent CO 2adsorption properties [ 231]. Wang et al. [ 232] investigated g-C3N4integrated with cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-9) for CO 2con-version under visible light illumination. Besides, bipyridine (bpy) and TEOA were utilizedas an auxiliary electron mediator and electron donor to reduce CO 2into CO, Figure 20a.As illustrated in Figure 20b, the rate of CO production increased throughout the reaction.However, this increase was more signiÔ¨Åcant in the Ô¨Årst 2 h of the experiment, which wasattributed to the CO 2and bpy depletion/degradation, while Co-ZIF-9 and g-C 3N4arestable to retain their intrinsic reactivity. In addition, the stability of the photocatalyst wasinvestigated by introducing fresh bpy and CO 2into the reaction after each 2 h of reaction.Obtained results implied that the original catalytic activity was not changed even afterseven repeated operations (Figure 20b, inset).Energies 2022 ,15, 63 33 of 65Figure 20. (a) Reaction pathway of the cooperation of Co-ZIF-9 and g-C 3N4for CO 2photoreductionunder visible light illumination, ( b) CO production from the Co-ZIF-9 and g-C 3N4-based hybridsystem as a function of the reaction time. Inset: recycling tests for CO 2photocatalytic reduction undervisible light illumination [232].To increase the efÔ¨Åciency of the photocatalysts for gaseous reactions, it can be in-tegrating the gas adsorption into MOF with electron-hole generation by an inorganicsemiconductor which can efÔ¨Åciently transfer photoexcited electrons from the semicon-ductor to the MOF. In this respect, Cu 3(BTC) 2@TiO 2core-shell structure was utilized as aphotocatalyst to reduce CO 2into CH 4under UV-light irradiation in the presence of theH2O in the gas phase. As shown in SEM and TEM images (Figure 21), the synthesizedcore-shell structures preserve the octahedral proÔ¨Åle of the Cu 3(BTC) 2cores and the layerof shell formed on it, Figure 21a,b. Their results show that the photogenerated electronscan be efÔ¨Åciently transferred from TiO 2(shell) to the Cu 3(BTC) 2(core) which promotescharge separation in the semiconductor. Furthermore, it supplies energetic electrons togas molecules adsorbed on Cu 3(BTC) 2. Besides, the microporous structure of TiO 2im-proves gas molecules capture in the cores (Cu 3(BTC) 2) and create adequate surface area.As demonstrated in Table 5, the yield of produced CH 4with Cu 3(BTC) 2@TiO 2was overÔ¨Åve times more than pure TiO 2under same reaction conditions. In addition, no productswere found except CH 4which implies that the selectivity of CO 2to H 2O is signiÔ¨Åcantlyimproved through this catalyst design [ 233]. CO 2photoreduction reaction can proceed intwo pathways to produce CH 4, formaldehyde and carbene pathways, which are illustratedin Figure 22 [234].Figure 21. (a) TEM and ( b) SEM images of the synthesized Cu 3(BTC) 2@TiO 2core-shell struc-tures [233].Energies 2022 ,15, 63 34 of 65Figure 22. Two proposed pathways for the CO 2photoreduction into CH 4: formaldehyde (left) andcarbene (right) [234].Graphene-based materials have drawn attention because of their great properties,e.g., high surface area (up to 2600 m2g 1), tunable band gap, mechanical and chemicalstability, high electrical and thermal conductivity that makes them as potential photocat-alysts. Besides, graphene as an excellent electron acceptor-transporter plays signiÔ¨Åcantrole in increasing the transfer and preventing electron-hole pairs recombination, result-ing in improving the photoactivity of CO 2reduction [ 55,235‚Äì237]. Graphene-based MOF(NH 2-rGO/Al-PMOF) was applied for CO 2photoreduction. For this purpose, tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) was utilized as a ligand to prepare Al-PMOF. To Ô¨Åndout the impact of the graphene on the structure and performance of photocatalyst, differentpercentages of NH 2-rGO were utilized to synthesize NH 2-rGO (0, 5, 15, 25 wt.%)/Al-PMOF.Figure 23 compares the SEM images of the morphology of the prepared samples. As shown,the morphology of the photocatalyst was changed from cubes to platelets with increas-Energies 2022 ,15, 63 35 of 65ing the amount of NH 2-rGO, which, in turn, led to increasing the electrons‚Äô generation,enhancing the accessibility to the CO 2molecules, resulting in increment in CO 2photore-duction. Moreover, the thin platelets of NH 2-rGO (25 wt.%)/Al-PMOF were observed toagglomerate, which decreased the crystallinity of the structure, preventing the irradiatedlight adsorption by photocatalyst and, consequently, the generation rate of photoinducedelectron-hole pairs was reduced. In other words, with increasing NH 2-rGO content inthe structure, the Al-PMOF molecules were wrapped by NH 2-rGO sheets, which can actlike a shield to prevent the light adsorption. Therefore, the photocatalyst activity for CO 2reduction was decreased. The photoreactor test of NH 2-rGO (5 wt.%)/Al-PMOF showedsigniÔ¨Åcant photoactivity for CO 2reduction. The amount of produced HCOO was con-tinuously increased to 205.6 mol after a 6-h visible-light irradiation in the presence ofTEOA as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent, which was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than values obtained in otherstudies [238].Figure 23. SEM images of ( a) GO, ( b) NH 2-rGO, ( c) Al-PMOF, ( d) NH 2-rGO (5 wt %)/Al-PMOF,(e) NH 2-rGO (15 wt %)/Al-PMOF, and ( f) NH 2-rGO (25 wt %)/Al-PMOF [238].The synthesized ternary photocatalysts‚Äô structure could integrate the advantages ofeach component such as high CO 2adsorption capability, efÔ¨Åcient light adsorption, andrich, accessible, active sites. In this context, the leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks(ZIF-L) were grown on a branch-like TiO 2/C nanoÔ¨Åber to fabricate different leaf‚ÄìbranchTiO 2/C@ZIF-L composite photocatalysts. Notably, the CO 2photoreduction was performedwithout the addition of any sacriÔ¨Åcial reagents. Additionally, the metal Lewis sites inZIF-L are interesting for converting CO 2into CO. The existing Lewis sites in the MOFstructure promoted CO 2activation to form a *COOH intermediate, which was favorable interms of CO selectivity improvement. The CO production rate of TiO 2/C@ZnCo-ZIF-L was28.6mol h 1g 1,which was more than those of TiO 2/C@Co-ZIF-L and TiO 2/C@Zn-ZIF-L, 22.7 and 18.7 mol h 1g 1,respectively. On the contrary, TiO 2@ZnCo-ZIF-L showed aEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 36 of 65low CO production rate, 6.6 mol h 1g 1. These results implied that graphitic carbon withsuperior electron mobility plays a crucial role for accepting and transferring electrons be-tween TiO 2and ZnCo-ZIF-L [ 239]. Since the bandgap of the PCN-224(Cu) is narrow, about1.68 eV , it can absorb solar light. Furthermore, it contains a nitrogen-rich skeleton, providinghigher CO 2adsorption during the photocatalysis process. Therefore, coupling PCN-224(Cu)with other semiconductors can promote light absorption and suppress the electron-holerecombination due to the accelerated charge transfer [ 240,241]. Wang et al. [ 242] formeda photocatalyst by the growth of TiO 2PCN-224 (Cu) (simpliÔ¨Åed as P(Cu)) to prepareP(Cu)/TiO 2composites. As shown in Table 5, the sample of 15% P(Cu)/TiO 2was anoptimal photocatalyst with the highest potential for CO production. The photocatalyticperformance of prepared photocatalysts increased with increasing P(Cu) content. This wasattributed to the increasing of the charge separation efÔ¨Åciency at the interface between TiO 2and P(Cu) as a result of the broad absorption edge. Notably, increasing P(Cu) content from15% to 30% decreased photoactivity, which was speculated to be due to the side reaction ofO2+ 2H++ 2e !H2O2, which can be dominant over P(Cu).3.2.3. Metal-MOF CompositeMetal-MOF composites as an important type of MOF were studied. The d-blocktransitions metals were the most applied metals due to their d-block electrons showinggreat functionality regarding their complex-forming capability and acid‚Äìbase interactions.Furthermore, more than one type of metal atom also can be utilized in composites [ 243,244].The M-doped NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) (M = Pt and Au) was synthesized and applied as a photo-catalyst in saturated CO 2with TEOA as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent under visible-light irradiation.The results showed that both hydrogen and formate were produced over the M/ NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) photocatalyst and the rate of formate evolution was promoted comparedwith the use of pure NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) as a photocatalyst. On the contrary to the pureNH 2-MIL-125 (Ti), hydrogen was produced as the main product over M/ NH 2-MIL-125(Ti) under similar conditions. Notably, Pt and Au had different effects on photocatalyticactivity for formate formation. While Pt/ NH 2-MIL-125 (Ti) was found to increase thephotoactivity for formate formation, Au showed a negative effect on this reaction [ 245].Recently, Guo et al. [ 20] applied a bimetallic photocatalyst, Ni/Mg-MOF-74, in pure CO 2inthe presence of MeCN/TEOA (5:1 v/v) as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent and [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl2(bpy = 2,20-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer. The reaction was performed under visible-light illumina-tion for 0.5 h. It was observed that Ni 0.75Mg 0.25-MOF-74 has the highest formate evolutionrate of 0.64 mmol h 1g 1, which was more than Ni 0.87Mg 0.13-MOF-74, 0.54 mmol h 1g 1.Meanwhile, the monometallic photocatalyst Ni-MOF-74 showed 0.29 mmol h 1g 1andMg-MOF-74 was inactive. All of these results exhibit that the reactivity of photocatalystsrely on metal nodes.3.2.4. Other Forms of MOF-Based PhotocatalystIn comparison with all the transition metals, e.g., copper, vanadium, and chromium,cobalt is applied as the most efÔ¨Åcient dopant to enhance the light response and photoac-tivity of TiO 2, besides acting as an active component for photo/electrochemical wateroxidation. Generally, cobalt-based materials have attracted intense research interest be-cause of their low cost and toxicity, earth abundance, and simple RedOx transformationbetween different chemical valence states, resulting in a high performance with tunableproperties [ 220,246,247]. A Cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-9)was utilized as a cocatalyst with a ruthenium-based photosentitizer to convert CO 2intoCO. The obtained turnover number (turnover number is the number of reacting moleculesor product molecules formed per surface active site for heterogeneous photocatalyst) wasabout 450 after 2.5 h [ 248]. In addition, 2D Co/PMOF was synthesized by utilizing TCPPas a linker and cobalt as a node and applied as a photocatalyst for CO 2reduction intoformate (HCOO ) under visible-light irradiation in the presence of TEOA as a sacriÔ¨Åcialagent. They assumed that the formed C-O-metal bond acted as the electron charge transferEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 37 of 65channel between TCPP and Co and accelerated the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).The photocatalytic properties of the TCPP ligand behaved as a light-harvesting unit con-trolled and modiÔ¨Åed by inserting the metal cations into the porphyrin ring. Co/PMOF hadsigniÔ¨Åcant metal coordination stability due to the chelation effect of the aromatic ligandand occupied cis-coordination sites, which can hinder different possible side reactions andresult in a selective photocatalyst process [220]. Chambers et al. [249] utilized UiO-67 andCp*Rh (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadiene) to prepare a Cp*Rh@UiO-67 photocatalystwith different percentages of rhodium loading. The low rhodium loading catalysts notonly showed higher initial rate selectivity for formate but also unprecedented stability andrecyclability. On the contrary, formate selectivity was lost at a larger loading because ofthe decomposition of formate into CO 2and H 2catalyzed by UiO-67. In another study [ 21],Al-PMOF was synthesized utilizing TCPP as a ligand and denoted as S p, and then Cu2+was embedded in the structure (denoted as S Cu). The prepared photocatalysts were appliedto reduce CO 2into CH 3OH in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a sacriÔ¨Åcial agent.The CH 3OH generation rate with S Cu(262.6 ppm g 1h 1), which was higher than thatof S p(37.5 ppm g 1h 1), indicated that the incorporation of coordination-unsaturatedCu2+improved CO 2adsorption ability and, consequently, improved photocatalyst perfor-mance. Sadeghi et al. [ 250] used TCPP as a ligand to prepare Zn/PMOF and applied it as aphotocatalyst to reduce CO 2in the presence of H 2O vapor as a sacriÔ¨Åcial electron donor.The results showed that the CO 2conversion when using Zn/PMOF (10.43 mol) was~80.6% greater than bare ZnO. On the other hand, no other products were detected, whichconÔ¨Årmed the reaction over Zn/PMOF had high selectivity. Notably, from the reader‚Äôsperspective, to avoid prolonging the article, other studies in each section are summarized inTable 5 .to get a quick glance of the development. It is worth noting that it is hard to decidewhich experiment or photocatalyst is better or has the best activity because of differentissues: (1) Different sacriÔ¨Åcial agents were applied, which leads to producing differentproducts, and (2) photoreduction reactions were performed in the different photoreactorsunder different conditions. Therefore, there is a lack of widely adopted, standardized,and complete reporting of reactor operating conditions such as illumination intensity andspectral distribution of the light source; furthermore, different conventions were used innormalizing production rates, with a lack of reference calibrations.

Potentials and Critical Research ChallengesGlobal warming and energy shortage are the main environmental concerns for hu-mankind in the 21st century. Among all the renewable sources, solar energy is expectedto tackle the energy demand, owing to its ubiquitous and cost-free nature. Therefore,among different methods that have been utilized for reducing CO 2in the atmosphere, thephotocatalytic conversion of CO 2into valuable fuels and chemicals (e.g., CO, CH 4, CH 3OH,HCOOH) is considered as one of the most economical, sustainable, and environmentallyfriendly methods for ameliorating energy shortages and greenhouse effects.In addition to applying clean and abundant solar energy, this process can be performedin almost mild conditions (room temperature and pressure) and also can directly convertCO 2into short-chain hydrocarbons, which reduce the increasingly tense energy crisis.Nevertheless, there are several challenges that limit CO 2photoreduction commercialization.A major critical challenge is the low CO 2solubility in water [ 29]. To overcome thisdrawback, different organic solvents such as methanol [ 261‚Äì264], isopropanol [ 265], andacetonitrile [ 220,225,226,266] have been used. Despite their higher CO 2solubility andphotoactivity, they are toxic, environmentally unfriendly, and not economic. Alternativesolvents with high CO 2solubility, low cost, and low environmental impact are required toadvance CO 2photoreduction.A further challenge of water as a solvent is the kinetically favorable hydrogen evolutionreaction (HER) [ 267]. This leads to severe competition between CO 2reduction and HERfrom water, which is adsorbed in greater quantity onto the catalyst surfaces comparedto CO 2.Beyond limitations of CO 2, photocatalysis in general requires material improvementto improve efÔ¨Åciency. The efÔ¨Åciency limitations are mostly due to poor light-harvesting(large band-gap of material), low charge separation and transport (intrinsic propertiesof the semiconductor), and dependence on solar insolation. In this regard, Ô¨Åndings inphotocatalytic water splitting have recently shown a quantum efÔ¨Åciency of >95%. Theseimprovements may be applied to driving CO 2photoreduction [ 268]. These Ô¨Åndings includealiovalent doping of the semiconductor to reduce recombination [ 269] and use of speciÔ¨Åcco-catalysts‚Äô systems to drive each reaction that occurs in water splitting without alsocatalyzing the reverse reaction [270].Selectivity of reaction is vital considering CO 2photoreduction may follow a series ofpathways and is often in competition with HER. This is a particular challenge since themechanisms and reaction pathways of CO 2reduction on heterogeneous photocatalysts arestill vague. Here, improvements in DFT calculations can assist in driving experimentaldesign [ 271]. Porous materials and controlling adsorption of reactants appear to be the mostpromising strategies to controlling selectivity. Porous materials with active sites within theporous matrix can be used to drive a particular product, while also enhancing adsorptionof reactant.From a photocatalyst deactivation point of view, photocatalytic deactivation is ob-served after illumination for a long time. This phenomenon can be attributed to the (1)adsorption or accumulation of intermediate product/by-product on the active sites ofphotocatalyst and (2) desorption of produced hydrocarbons from photocatalyst surface notbeing complete. These two items can hinder the adsorption of CO 2or H 2O on the surfaceof the photocatalyst and subsequently deactivate the CO 2photoreduction efÔ¨Åciency afterlong-time irradiation. Therefore, more detailed studies are necessary about photocatalysts‚Äôdeactivation in future works, which are crucial to have a deep and clear understanding ofthe reaction mechanisms.4. Electrochemical Reduction of CO 2Electrochemical CO 2reduction is a promising method that has drawn widespreadattention of researchers because it can be performed in ambient conditions and be drivenby the electricity generated from renewable resources. Nonetheless, high energy demandfor CO 2reduction due to relatively low efÔ¨Åciency and the presence of competitive reactionsEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 45 of 65(e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction) are the main disadvantages of this process. Therefore,Ô¨Ånding efÔ¨Åcient electrocatalysts that decrease energy demand and suppress the competitivereaction have a crucial importance [ 59,272]. Metallic electrodes (e.g., Au, Pt, Cu, Ni, Ag)have been extensively utilized as electrocatalysts because of their excellent conductivity.However, low selectivity and a small surface area of the metal electrodes compared to otherporous materials are drawbacks, preventing their development [273,274].An ideal electrocatalyst is expected to have high stability (>20,000 h), selectivity(90%), and current density (>200 mA cm 2) [275‚Äì277]. In this context, different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with various metal centers have been utilized for CO 2electrore-duction. That is because of the permanent porosity, large surface area, tunable structure,and abundant active sites of the MOFs [ 278‚Äì280]. Fe-based MOFs have been extensivelyapplied as photocatalysts and for water splitting, utilized as electrocatalysts for CO 2con-version [ 281,282]. Dong et al. [ 283] utilized Zr 6a clusters-based MOF of PCN-222(Fe),[Zr6O8(OH) 4(H2O)4][(TCPP-Fe(III)-Cl) 2], which is built from Fe-TCPP , with the ligand as acatalyst. Notably, applying active porphyrin molecules into the MOFs‚Äô structure enhanceseffectively the active surface concentration, which leads to accelerating CO 2reductionkinetics. Furthermore, carbon black was introduced into PCN-222(Fe) with a mass ratio 1:2in order to improve the catalytic activity of Fe-based MOF (denoted as PCN-222(Fe)/C).The PCN-222(Fe)/C catalyst was loaded on carbon paper for CO 2electrochemical reduc-tion. The BET surface area of PCN-222(Fe) is high, about 2200 m2g 1, which provides agreat number of available sites for CO 2adsorption and Ô¨Åxation, resulting in the incrementof surface CO 2concentration. Moreover, after adsorption, CO 2activation is obtained bybending the CO 2molecule, which signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased the activating energy of the CO 2reduction process. The faradaic efÔ¨Åciency (this term deÔ¨Ånes the efÔ¨Åciency with whichelectrons transferred in a system facilitate the CO 2electroreduction reaction) of CO (FE CO)increased with increasing the applied overpotential and the maximum FE CO(91%) obtainedat ‚Äì0.6 V vs. RHE with the overpotential of 494 mV in a CO 2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3electrolyte. Additionally, the FE COwas over 80% even after 10 h, implying high catalyststability at ‚Äì0.6 V vs. RHE. Overall, the PCN-222(Fe)/C had a signiÔ¨Åcant catalytic effecton the CO 2electrochemical reduction because of integrating the intrinsic activity of theporphyrin molecule, including the intrinsic macrocyclic framework and tunable metalcenters with the tunable oxidation state, with the high CO 2adsorption ability because ofthe conserved porosity and the great conductivity of carbon black.Cobalt shows different oxidation states, e.g., Co (II), Co (III), and Co (IV), such that itbe used for the synthesis of various Co-based MOF a wide range of coordination geometries.For example, Wang et al. [ 284] synthesized different polyoxometalate-metalloporphyrinorganic frameworks (PMOFs) by applying tetrakis [4-carboxyphenyl]-porphyrin-M (M-TCPP) as linkers. Notably, polyoxometalate-based MOFs have high structural robustnessand chemical stability which is necessary for the durability test of the CO 2reductionreaction. In addition, different transition metals were utilized (i.e., Co, Fe, Ni, and Zn) toprepare PMOFs as shown in Figure 24a. These materials were tested as electrocatalystfor CO 2reduction in CO 2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3solution, Figure 24b. As shown inFigure 24b, FE COcontinuously increases with increasing the potential and the maximumvalue of 98.7% was obtained at  0.8 V . Furthermore, Co-PMOF selectively converts CO 2into CO with the highest FE CO(98.7%) compared to the other M-PMOFs (Fe-PMOF, 28.8%,Ni-PMOF, 18.5%, and Zn-PMOF, 1.2%, respectively). This result was explained by the factthat polyoxometalates and Co-porphyrin have synergistic effects in the CO 2reductionreaction. Also, the desirable active site is the Co in Co-TCPP instead of POM. Actually,Co-PMOF can transfer charges more efÔ¨Åciently and have a larger active surface in thecatalytic process compared to other investigated M-PMOFs. Consequently, Co-PMOF canprovide more active sites in electrocatalyst to contact the electrolyte which can enhance thereaction speed of electroreduction of CO 2.Copper (Cu) is a promising catalyst candidate for CO 2electroreduction due to itsability to produce hydrocarbons. Nonetheless, copper produces a variety of reactionEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 46 of 65products and selectivity of each product is low. One solution to improve its selectivity isthe dispersion and speciÔ¨Åcations of the reaction site and changing the concentration ofprotons, which are necessary for CO 2electrochemical reduction [ 28,285,286]. In this regard,the copper-based MOF was utilized as electrocatalysts for CO 2reduction for the Ô¨Årst timein 2012 [ 287,288]. For this purpose, a Cu-rubeanate MOF (CR-MOF) was synthesized forthe electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2into HCOOH. For this purpose, the prepared CR-MOFwas dropped on the CP to form a working electrode, and also 0.5 M KHCO 3was preparedas an electrolyte. The amount of produced HCOOH was 13.4 mol cm 2h 1, which was 13times greater than that of a Cu metal electrode (1.14 mol cm 2h 1) at the potential of  1.2V vs. SHE. Additionally, the selectivity of produced HCOOH by CR-MOF electrodes amongthe CO 2products was more than 98%. The density of electrons on the metallic site of the CR-MOF was smaller than that on the Cu metal, which was the cause of the weak adsorptionof CO 2on the reaction site and high selectivity of HCOOH [ 288]. In another study [ 287],Cu3(BTC) 2was applied as am electrocatalysts in 0.01 M N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)containing tetrabutylammonium tetraÔ¨Çuoroborate (TBATFB) for CO 2reduction. Theydemonstrated that the CO 2-saturated solution inÔ¨Çuences the activity and selectivity of theCO 2reduction in addition to the structure of the catalyst. The obtained results indicatedthat Cu 3(BTC) 2on the glassy carbon electrode signiÔ¨Åcantly reduces CO 2into oxalic acidwith 90% purity and FE of 51%. According to the proposed reaction pathway, a carbondioxide radical anion was formed during the reduction process and dimerized to formoxalate anion. Then, oxalate anion abstracted proton from a non-aqueous DMF solventand the oxalic acid was formed. In summary, these results revealed that the solvent andelectrolytes inÔ¨Çuence the reaction pathways, Ô¨Ånal products, and CO 2adsorption capacityof electrocatalysts.Figure 24. (a) Schematic of the structures of M-PMOFs (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Zn), ( b) Faradaic efÔ¨Åcienciesof M-PMOFs for CO [287].Zn-based MOFs have drawn much interest due to their unique properties, whichhas led to various applications such as gas adsorption and separation, sensing, catalysis,and CO 2capture [ 289]. On the other hand, ionic liquids (ILs) have unique propertiessuch as nonvolatility, high chemical and thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and awide electrochemical window [ 290‚Äì292]. Electroreduction of CO 2to CH 4was investigatedover deposited Zn‚Äì1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (Zn‚ÄìBTCMOFs) on carbon paper (CP) as cathodes by using ionic liquids (ILs) as the electrolytes.As shown in Figure 25a, the CH 4production rate drastically enhanced at the potentialsunder 2.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Then, the rate of CH 4production increased very slowly.Consequently, electrolysis less negative than  2.2 vs. Ag/Ag+is more favorable forCH 4production. According to the proposed mechanism in Figure 25b, Ô¨Årst of all, theimidazolium cations were absorbed on the surface of the Zn-MOF. Afterward, CO 2wascaptured by the adsorbed IL on the surface of the Zn-MOF, and a CO 2intermediate wasformed by taking one electron. Then, the CO 2intermediate took another electron andgenerated CO. Because of the higher adsorption capacity of CO compared to CH 4on theEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 47 of 65Zn-MOF, CO prefers to reduce to CH 4by taking six electrons instead of desorbing from thesurface of the Zn-PMOF [293].Figure 25. (a) The produced CH 4(ACH40volume at standard temperature and pressure) in 2 h as afunction of potential, ( b) the proposed reaction pathway for electroreduction of CO 2to CH 4on theZn-MOF/CP cathode in ILs [293].On the other hand, among zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZIF-8 has high CO 2adsorption properties, e.g., a high surface area, well-ordered pores, a distinct morphol-ogy, and strong coordination between metal ions and ligands in the framework [ 294,295].Wang et al. [ 295] investigated the effects of the counter anions and electrolyte on the CO 2electrochemical reduction. For this purpose, different ZIFs with various zinc sources weresynthesized and applied as an electrocatalyst for CO 2reduction in an aqueous solution.Their experimental results showed that the synthesized ZIF-8 using ZnSO 4had the bestelectroactivity towards CO 2reduction with FE COof 65% at 1.8 V vs. Hg/Hg 2Cl2(SCE).The weaker interaction between SO 42 and Zn nodes was the main reason for the highactivity and selectivity of ZIF-8SO4. On the other hand, ZIF-8SO4in 0.5 M NaCl electrolyteshowed the highest FE compared to other electrolytes, NaHCO 3, NaClO 4, and NaHCO 3.Noble metal-based MOFs showed high activity and selectivity in CO 2electroreduction,but instability is their main disadvantage. For the Ô¨Årst time, Ye et al. [ 296] incorporateda ReL(CO) 3Cl (L = 2,20-bipyridine-5,50-dicarboxylic acid) catalyst into highly oriented,surface-grafted MOF (SURMOF) thin Ô¨Ålms grown on a conductive Ô¨Çuorine-doped tin oxide(FTO) electrode by liquid-phase epitaxy. The Re-SURMOF-based electrode showed a signif-icantly high faradaic efÔ¨Åciency of 93 5% at 1.6 V vs. NHE for CO 2electroreduction intoCO, which is much more than other studied MOF thin Ô¨Ålm-based systems. The signiÔ¨Åcanthigh faradic efÔ¨Åciency of Re-SURMOF is because of the excellent oriented structure ofRe-SURMOF at the electrode surface compared to the other framework materials. Thegaseous products were collected and analyzed via gas chromatography (GC). The maingaseous product was CO (40.5 moL) with a small amount of H 2(3.1moL). No otherproducts were detected in both liquid and gas phases.Ag is broadly utilized as an electrocatalyst for CO 2reduction with CO as the mainproduct. Many attempts have been devoted in order to improve the catalytic activity.Grafting of a catalyst on an electrode is one way to promote catalytic performance [ 289].Another way to improve the CO faradaic efÔ¨Åciency over an Ag catalyst is applying MOFs.For this purpose, MOFs are decorated with a metal nanoparticle. In this respect, anAg2O/layered ZIF composite was synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal transformationof ZIF-7 nanoparticles (NPs) in an AgNO 3aqueous solution. In this study, CO was themain product and H 2was the byproduct. Furthermore, Ag 2O/ layered ZIF showed themaximum catalytic performance at various potentials and the CO faradaic efÔ¨Åciency andcurrent density were 80.5% and 26.2 mAcm 2at 1.2 V vs. the reversible hydrogenelectrode (RHE), respectively. On the other hand, the CO faradaic efÔ¨Åciencies of ZIF-7, thelayered ZIF, and the Ag/layered ZIF were 25, 61.6, and 54% at  1.2 V , respectively. Theparticle sizes of distributed Ag 2O NPs on the Ag 2O/layered ZIF were between 2 and 4 nm.On the other hand, the particle sizes of Ag NPs in the Ag/layered ZIF were between 4 andEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 48 of 6530 nm with some particle aggregation. The BET surface areas of the Ag 2O/layered ZIF andAg/layered ZIF were 25.5 and 10.9 m2g 1. Therefore, the small-sized Ag 2O NPs and thesynergistic effect between the Ag 2O NPs and the layered ZIF with a high speciÔ¨Åc surfacearea greatly facilitated CO 2mass transport, leading to a higher CO faradaic efÔ¨Åciency andpartial current density for Ag 2O/layered ZIF compared to the other catalysts [297].Among the large number of investigated MOFs for electrocatalytic CO 2reduction,copper-based electrocatalysts have been found as promising, enabling the conversion ofCO intermediate into multi-carbon product. However, the stability of Cu is not good for along time and the required overpotential for CO 2reduction at the Cu electrode is more than1 V , particularly at the polycrystalline Cu electrode [ 298‚Äì300]. For instance, Zhao et al. [ 301]prepared oxide-derived Cu/carbon (OD Cu/C) catalysts via a facile carbonization of Cu-based MOF (HKUST-1) and utilized an electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KHCO 3as the electrolyte.The results showed that the OD Cu/C selectively reduced CO 2to methanol and ethanolwith production rates of 5.1‚Äì12.4 and 3.7‚Äì13.4 mg L 1h 1, respectively, at potentials be-tween 0.1 and 0.7 V vs. RHE, respectively. Moreover, in situ infrared reÔ¨Çectance (IR)spectroscopy and theoretical calculations implied that the CO 2intermediate as a mainintermediate during CO 2electrochemical reduction was adsorbed on the surface of the ODCu/C catalysts. The adsorbed CO 2then reacted with another proton-electron pair andÔ¨Ånally was reduced to the product of methanol. For ethanol production, C-C coupling tookplace between surface-bound C 1oxygenates, accompanied by the formation of enol-likeintermediates and then hydrogenation and dihydroxylation Figure 26.Figure 26. Proposed reaction pathways for electroconversion of CO 2into alcohols on OD Cu/C-1000 [301].Notably, the formation of hydrocarbons decreased with decreasing the Cu diameterbelow 5 nm due to the surface tendency to bind strongly with intermediates owing tod-band narrowing. Therefore, optimization of the surface topography and the size of Cuclusters to affect intermediate reaction pathways are interesting solutions to obtain highC2 hydrocarbons‚Äô selectivity [ 302,303]. Therefore, a strategy was proposed to optimizethe selectivity, activity, and efÔ¨Åciency for carbon dioxide reduction reaction. HKUST-1Energies 2022 ,15, 63 49 of 65(C18H6Cu3O12, Cu 3(btc) 2.xH 2O, btc = benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylate)-derived uncoordi-nated Cu sites enhanced the faradaic efÔ¨Åciency of C 2H4from 10 to 45% for calcinatedHKUST-1 at 250C for 3 h with the lowest Cu-Cu coordination number (CN), which wasgreater than other MOF-derived Cu cluster catalysts. Moreover, H 2production decreasedto below 7%. The distortion of the Cu dimer in HKUST-1 applying the thermal treatmentpromoted the CO 2photoreduction performance of Cu clusters, which was due to retaininga low Cu-Cu CN among the Cu clusters during the reaction. Generally, this study pro-vides insight into the design and synthesis of potential electrocatalysts for CO 2reduction tomulti-carbon products [ 304]. Hwang et al. [ 305] synthesized a composite of Cu 3(BTC) 2withgraphene oxide sheets, denoted as Cu-MOF/GO. The prepared composite was utilized forCO 2electroreduction in six different electrolyte systems, viz., KHCO 3/H 2O, tetrabutylam-monium bromide (TBAB)/dimethylformamide (DMF), KBr/CH 3OH, CH 3COOK/CH 3OH,TBAB/CH 3OH, and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP)/CH 3OH, to investigatetheir effect on product formation. According to the obtained results, the highest concentra-tions of HCOOH as the main product for various electrolytes were 0.1404 mM (  0.1 V),66.57 mM ( 0.6 V), 0.2651 mM (  0.5 V), 0.2359 mM (  0.5 V), 0.7784 mM (  0.4 V), and0.3050 mM ( 0.45 V) in the various electrolytes, KHCO 3/H2O, TBAB/DMF, KBr/CH 3OH,CH 3COOK/CH 3OH, TBAB/CH 3OH, and TBAP/CH 3OH, respectively. On the other hand,a signiÔ¨Åcant Faradaic efÔ¨Åciency of 58% was achieved with 0.1 M TBAB/DMF electrolyte,which was about 1.5 times greater than that of Cu-MOF alone. Because of the signiÔ¨Åcantconductivity of the graphene oxide and the basicity of Cu in MOF structures, which attractsthe adhered gas molecules on the electrodes, the reduction process was promoted. As men-tioned, the sizes of copper nanocrystals have a crucial role on the hydrocarbons‚Äô formation.Therefore, their sizes can be increased with increasing the pyrolysis temperatures, but theagglomeration of large metal atom clusters should be controlled at higher temperatures.With all these in mind, Rayer et al. [ 306] carbonized two commercial MOFs, HKUST-1 andPCN-62, at a temperature range of 400‚Äì800C and coated on the nickel and copper sup-ports as inks. The prepared catalysts were used for CO 2electroreduction in a conventionalelectrolytic cell with 0.05 M K 2CO 3solution.Table 6 summarizes the performance of the CO 2reduction reaction (CO 2RR) catalystsand selectivity of the isopropanol formation over other carbon products (FE isopropanol /FEother). Even though both copper mesh and foil showed higher FE isopropanol thanother tested catalysts, MOF-derived catalysts contained only small amounts of coppercompared to the bulk metal, conÔ¨Årming that the high surface area of these preparedcatalysts was signiÔ¨Åcantly effective in CO 2RR. This is owing to the increment in the local pHat the catalytic surface, leading to the ethylene intermediates‚Äô formation, which improvedpropanol production. Additionally, Cu-HKUST-1 600C as a promising material amongother prepared electrocatalysts indicated the highest selectivity of FE isoproanol /FE other (2.7)with isopropanol as the main product (FE of 22.5%).Table 6.

In this context,Energies 2022 ,15, 63 50 of 65ZIF-8 assisted the generation of Ni single atoms distributed in nitrogen-doped porouscarbon (Ni SAs/N-C) for efÔ¨Åcient electroreduction of CO 2. The prepared catalyst showedan excellent Faradaic efÔ¨Åciency for CO production of 71.9% at a potential of  0.9 V , whichwas some 3-fold higher than that of Ni NPs/N-C. In addition, the obtained current densitywas 10.48 mAcm 2with an overpotential of 0.89 V . The prepared single-atom catalystpromoted electron and mass transfer due to both the high synergetic effect of the enhancednumber of surface-active sites and the excellent electrical conductivity and lower adsorptionenergy of CO over single Ni sites. Besides, Ni SAs/N-C implied a lower interfacial chargetransfer, so electrons can transfer faster from electrodes to CO 2, which leads to facilitatingCO 2intermediate formation [ 301]. In another study [ 307], bimetallic Co/Zn ZIFs weresynthesized with three atomically dispersed Co catalysts with different Co-N numbers at800, 900, and 1000C and denoted as Co-N 4, Co-N 3, and Co-N 2, respectively. The electro-reaction was performed in a CO 2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3solution as electrolyte. Amongdifferent applied catalysts, Co-N 2showed the highest activity and selectivity, with thecurrent density of about 18.1 mA cm 2and the faradaic efÔ¨Åciency of 94% at an overpotentialof 520 mV . Both experimental and theoretical calculations implied that the low coordinationnumber promoted CO 2intermediate formation and, therefore, increased electroactivity ofCO 2reduction. In other words, the Ô¨Årst electron transfer can signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the overallreduction process. In this context, Co-N 2showed the lowest interfacial charge transfer,leading to electron transfer to CO 2forCO 2intermediate formation more rapidly. Onthe other hand, the potential for surface adsorption on Co-N 2was more negative, whichresulted in the stronger adsorption of CO 2on Co-N 2. All these are beneÔ¨Åcial for the CO 2reduction reaction. Furthermore, iron-based, single-atom catalysts can also be obtainedby pyrolysis of ZIF-8 as a template through conÔ¨Åning the Fe precursor on the surface ofthe ZIF-8 to achieve numerous exposed active sites. For this purpose, ammonium ferriccitrate (AFC) as the Fe precursor was applied to functionalize the surface of ZIF-8. Theisolated single Fe atom catalysts were applied for CO 2electroreduction in the KHCO 3solution. In comparison to the Fe-based nanoparticles, the isolated single Fe atom showedhigh CO 2reduction activity and selectivity. On the other hand, the results displayed thatthe performance of prepared catalysts was highly dependent on the synthesis methodof single-atom catalysts. The isolated Fe-N sites on the surface of ZIF-8 provided moreexposed active sites compared to the isolated iron species inside the cage of ZIF-8 [ 308].Other recent studies have been summarized in Table 7. According to Table 7, the highestreported Faradaic EfÔ¨Åciency for CO can be achieved with Co-PP@CNT. In comparison to thetraditional physical mixing method, chemically grafting cobalt porphyrins onto the surfaceof carbon nanotubes (CNT) can signiÔ¨Åcantly increase the level of dispersion at the highloading of immobilized molecular catalysts. All these lead to stronger catalyst‚Äìsubstrateinteraction and promotion of long-term stability and electron transfer to the intermediates.Therefore, a considerable performance for CO 2electroreduction can be achieved by graftedCo-PP@CNT [309].Co-PP@CNT: cobalt porphyrin was covalently grafted onto the surface of a carbonnanotube; CuBi12 (12% Bi): blending 79 wt.% HKUST-1 (Cu) with 21 wt.% CAU-17 (Bi);H-M-G: hemin and melamine molecules were synthesized through thermal pyrolysis ongraphene for the fabrication of H-M-G; ZIF-A-LD: phenanthroline-doped ZIF-8, ZIF-7-A-LD: phenanthroline-doped ZIF-7; Ni@NC-900: Ni coordinated graphitic carbon shells;w-CCG/CoPc-A hybrid: washed cobalt (II) octaalkoxyphthalocyanine was immobilized onchemically converted graphene via -stacking; Cu 2O/Cu@NC-800 (carbonizing Cu_btcat 800C): Cu_btc (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate)-derived Cu 2O/Cu anchored in anitrogen-doped porous carbon framework (Cu 2O/Cu@NC); PdAg_2 contains 61.9 wt% Pdand 38.1 wt% Ag; Ag 1-Cu 1.1NDs contains 52.4 wt.% Cu.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 51 of 65Table 7.

Impurities inthe electrolytes and/or CO 2feed gas and by-products resulting from corrosion of theelectrolyzer components can poison catalysts. Therefore, the stability of the electrocatalyst,particularly under operating voltage/current conditions, is a challenge.Similar to photocatalysis, the low solubility of CO 2in water (~0.034 M [ 321]) is atremendous challenge when utilizing aqueous electrolytes. A major research challenge isthe solvent system for electrocatalytic CO 2reduction that meets the demands of high CO 2solubility, low cost, a wide electrochemical window, and low environmental impact.Obtaining a high CO 2selectivity to favorable products is yet another challenge tosigniÔ¨Åcantly reduce the complexity and costs of product separation processes. It is worthnoting that achieving a high selectivity is also difÔ¨Åcult owing to the different reactionsof CO 2and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which all have almostthe same standard potential. Of the possible products, CO and formic acid are the mostproÔ¨Åtable due to the greatest product value per electron, $8000 and $16,100/electron,respectively [ 322]. On the other hand, these products require little power, resulting in thereduction of the electricity cost and electrolyzer size. For formic acid, most of the cost isEnergies 2022 ,15, 63 52 of 65related to the distillation step, which can be more cost effective by utilizing other industrialprocesses compared to the distillation. Therefore, the proÔ¨Åtability of formic acid can befurther improved. For instance, the operating and capital costs for formic acid separationare reduced to 50%, which gives a net present value of $84,500,000 [ 322]. These are Ô¨Åveimportant challenges for commercialization of this technology.5. ConclusionsIn this paper, the application of porous structures within CDR pathways such assolar thermochemical, photochemical, and electrochemical reduction technologies wasreviewed. The porous materials, either entirely made from an active catalyst agent orbeing used as a catalyst support, will dramatically contribute to the enhancement of thereactions‚Äô kinetics through providing more available surface area for such surface-controlledreactions. Through summing up the results of the available research in literature, it wasconcluded that: The use of porous materials, made either entirely from or coated by the active reduc-tion/oxidation materials, is a promising way to increase the conversion efÔ¨Åciency ofsolar to fuel in the solar thermochemical CDR cycle. The maximum reported solar-to-fuel efÔ¨Åciency is currently about 7.5%. Nevertheless, further research and developmentare needed to take the cyclic solar-to-fuel efÔ¨Åciency to about 20%, if the technology isto Ô¨Ånd a commercial use. This can be achieved through further optimization of boththe porous materials‚Äô intrinsic properties, such as pore density, size, shape, tortuosity,etc., and the geometrical conÔ¨Åguration of the reactive porous structures inside a solarreceiver/reactor. Moreover, there is a need to decrease the temperature of the RedOxreactions to mitigate the parasitic heat losses, i.e., re-radiation and convective heatlosses from the solar receiver/reactors through the reduction reaction step. In doing so,the porous structures need to be precisely pore-engineered both to efÔ¨Åciently absorbthe thermal energy and to achieve a high conversion during RedOx cycles. The porousstructures need to be also properly conÔ¨Ågured inside the solar reactor to proÔ¨Åcientlytrap and absorb the solar radiation, in case a directly irradiated reactor is employed. Since CO 2solubility in water is very low and CO 2adsorption and activation/excitationare more difÔ¨Åcult than H 2O, Ô¨Ånding a clean, non-toxic, and environmentally friendlysolvent to increase CO 2solubility/selectivity for the photocatalytic reduction processis still challenging. Finding solar-active and stable photocatalysts, enabling a high selectivity and con-version efÔ¨Åciency to completely suppress the competition reaction of water reductionto hydrogen, is also still challenging and requires a deeper understanding of themechanisms and reaction pathways of the reduction of CO 2on the heterogeneousphotocatalysts within the porous structures. Development of a highly stable electrocatalyst for the long-term operation is challeng-ing, while also the low solubility of CO 2in water (~0.034 M) hinders reactions whenaqueous electrolytes are employed. Additionally, obtaining a high CO 2selectivity tofavorable products is critical to reduce the costs and complexity of the down-streamprocess for the separation of products. There is a need to develop reactors facilitating the mass transfer from the gaseousCO 2phase into the electrolyte and from the electrolyte into the active sites within theporous cathode catalysts.Energies 2022 ,15, 63 53 of 65Author Contributions: Conceptualization: A.M.P ., N.S., A.R., M.J.; writing‚Äîoriginal draft prepa-ration: A.M.P ., N.S., A.R.; writing‚Äîreview and editing: M.J., C.J.S.; supervision: A.M.P ., M.J.;visualization: A.M.P ., N.S.; project administration: A.M.P .
