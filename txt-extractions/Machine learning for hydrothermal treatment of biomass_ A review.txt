ARTICLE INFO  Keywords: Machine learning Hydrothermal carbonization Hydrothermal liquefaction Hydrothermal gasification Biomass ABSTRACT  Hydrothermal treatment (HTT) (i.e., hydrothermal carbonization, liquefaction, and gasification) is a promising technology for biomass valorization. However, diverse variables, including biomass compositions and hydro -thermal processes parameters, have impeded in-depth mechanistic understanding on the reaction and engi-neering in HTT. Recently, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed to predict and optimize the production of biofuels, chemicals, and materials from HTT by feeding experimental data. This review compre -hensively analyzed the application of ML for HTT of biomass and systematically illustrated basic ML procedure and descriptors for inputs and outputs of ML models (e.g., biomass compositions, operation conditions, yield and physicochemical properties of derived products) that could be applied in HTT. Moreover, this review summa -rized ML-aided HTT prediction of yield, compositions, and physicochemical properties of HTT hydrochar or biochar, bio-oil, syngas, and aqueous phase. Ultimately, future prospects were proposed to enhance predictive performance, mechanistic interpretation, process optimization, data sharing, and model application during ML- aided HTT.  *Corresponding author.

It is necessary to develop renewable energy utilization technol -ogies. Biomass energy (bioenergy) is considered as the only carbon- based renewable energy, which undoubtedly plays a critical role in replacing petroleum (Xiu and Shahbazi, 2012 ). Hydrothermal treatment (HTT), including hydrothermal carbonization, liquefaction, and gasifi -cation, is a kind of emerging thermochemical process for disposing and valorizing wet biomass (without prior drying), such as lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., agricultural waste and wood) (Velvizhi et al., 2022 ), an-imal manure, food waste, sewage sludge, and algae (Becker et al., 2014; Leng et al., 2021a; Peterson et al., 2008 ). The numerical and category descriptors for biomass are shown in Table 1. During the HTT, biomass raw materials are distributed into four phases, namely hydrochar or biochar, bio-oil, syngas, and aqueous phase. Under 180–250 •C, the solid hydrochar is the main product, which can be used as solid fuels and carbon materials, is the primary product of HTT. With higher temper -atures, valuable oil and gas products that can be considered biofuels and biochemicals to replace fossil resources are generated gradually, and supercritical water conditions favor syngas production (Ragauskas et al., 2014; Tuck et al., 2012 ). Still, limited solid residue would be formed within higher temperature. On the other hand, the aqueous phase is produced inevitably in large amounts irrespective of processing tem-peratures (Leng et al., 2020c; Leng and Zhou, 2018 ). The HTT process is a complex reaction system covering various chemical reactions (Marzbali et al., 2021 ). Many factors influence HTT performance, and it is challenging to investigate the HTT reaction mechanisms and transformation behavior through traditional experi -mental studies. Applying various modeling methods to simulate the HTT of biomass is preferable. The reactor and kinetic modeling for waste biomass thermochemical conversion have been systematically discussed (Perera et al., 2021 ). Physical and mathematical models for biomass HTT process systems could be converted into numerical models. The results are often preferable to understand the process of biomass to products. However, these models are mainly based on kinetic equations and transport phenomena (mass, energy, and momentum), which can only be obtained from vast experiments. Thus, reactor and kinetic modeling are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, kinetic models are generally applied for biomass model compounds (e.g., car-bohydrate, protein, lipid, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) modeling but are hard to be generalized to real-world biomass (compositions too complex) (Liu et al., 2022 ). In summary, the quantitative assessment of the impact and process optimization with traditional experimental or simulation investigations are arduous (Li et al., 2022a ), due to the research objects are often limited to one or a few raw materials types (specific biomass or model compound). Artificial intelligence (AI) has quickly been developed with the advancement of computer science and big data technology (Jordan and Mitchell, 2015 ). Machine learning (ML), an essential part of AI, is popularly applied in a wide range of areas, such as data mining, com-puter vision, pattern recognition, and natural language processing (LeCun et al., 2015 ). Additionally, ML is adept at solving complex nonlinear classification or regression problems in biomass treatment domains because of its strong data fitting ability (Elmaz et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2021 ). Recently, ML has also been applied to aid the HTT of biomass for prediction and optimization. Few studies reported using ML to study HTT of biomass before 2019. Till now, extensive studies have been performed pertaining to ML-aided predic -tion of the quantity (yield) and quality (compositions and properties) of different products from HTT of biomass. More recently, reviews regarding ML-aided thermochemical treatment of biomass have also been reported just recently. For example, the applications of ML in the thermochemical conversion of biomass were briefly mentioned (khan et al., 2023 ). Besides, there are some studies overviewed the use of ML for gasification (Ascher et al., 2022a ); gasification and pyrolysis (Ascher et al., 2022b ); and anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) (Li et al., 2022b ). These reviews were generally organized by 1) introducing the various ML al-gorithms used in this filed; 2) summarizing the prediction performance and discuss the model results; and 3) putting forward prospects, while HHT was mentioned with only a few words. Products poly-generation from HTT was not considered by any of those, and hydrothermal Table 1 The input and output descriptors for hydrothermal treatment of biomass.

Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 1285473liquefaction (HTL) was not addressed. In addition, the descriptors of inputs and outputs for HTT process were not stated comprehensively, and aqueous phase products were ignored. In particular, the ML-aided HTT of biomass by model interpretation and optimization has not been appropriately elaborated. This review aims to summarize up-to-date development in ML-aided HTT of biomass and propose future directions. The review covers brief introduction to basic ML procedure and classic algorithms (Section 2), analysis and discussion of recent advance in ML-aided predictions and applications for multiple products from HTC, HTL, and HTG (Sections 3, 4, and 5), research gap and future prospects (Section 6), and concluding remarks (Section 7). 2.ML procedure and algorithms 2.1. ML procedure Basic ML procedure includes data collection, data preprocessing, model development, evaluation and interpretation, and model sharing (Fig 0.1). Data collection is the initial core step of ML, and data are generally collected from reliable literature with data extraction soft-wares, such as PlotDigitizer (Zhang et al., 2021 ) and Getdata (Tang et al., 2021 ). The descriptions of biomass, HTT process, and products are shown in Table 1. Data include not only input features but also output variables. Feature quantification is to describe fuzzy variables with numerical data. When the number of input features is much larger than the number of output variables, dimensionality reduction methods (i.e., principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, and independent component analysis) are possibly required for integrating features. The statistical analysis indicates data distribution for all features and can further test outliers. If the range of values for different variables varies greatly, data normalization is conducted to transfer these data into same magnitude within  1 and 1. After data collection and preprocessing, suitable ML algorithms should be chosen based on various datasets. To balance the accuracy and generalization of models, 70–90 % data among whole data are generally randomly selected to train ML models, and the remaining data are used as testing data, which are vital for evaluating models. ML models have two kinds of parameters, called model pa-rameters and hyperparameters. Model parameters are configuration variables inside the model (e.g., the weights coefficients of neurons in neural networks models), whose values can be estimated based on data. Hyperparameters are configurations outside the model (e.g., the depth of decision trees in tree-based models), whose values cannot be directly determined from the data training. Hyperparameters are generally applied to configure a ML model or to minimize the loss function of the specific algorithm, and must be adjusted before learning a ML model because they define the model frame. The optimal ML models should be developed to fit the data with best hyperparameters. Hyperparameters of ML training models must be tuned, and k-fold cross-validation is an efficient method for determining optimal hyperparameters (Leng et al., 2022d ). The optimal average performance of the k-fold cross-validation corresponds to optimal hyperparameters. The final ML models are re- trained with the best hyperparameters using the training data and assessed with the testing data. During the hyper-parameters tuning process, traversing methods (Li et al., 2021c; Zhang et al., 2021 ) and various optimization algorithms (Leng et al., 2022d ) can be used for fitting ML models. In general, the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE ) are used for evaluating regression models. And receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) value are commonly applied for classification models. A ML model with high R2 (near 1) and low RMSE values is generally accurate to fit data. The R2 of ML models used in HTT are mostly higher than 0.85, and some can reach as high as 0.99 (Tables 2–5). However, relying on these statistics indicators alone cannot explain the effects and mecha -nisms of the input features on the outputs. Feature importance analysis and partial dependence plots (PDP) (Goldstein et al., 2015 ) are thus conducted to study the correlations between inputs and outputs. The reasonability of the model interpretation may not necessarily be favor -able, although with acceptable predictive performance. ML-based opti-mizations for desired outputs and inputs are practical to obtain optimal solutions. Experimental schemes can be designed with these solutions to Table 2 Machine learning aided prediction for yield, compositions, and properties of hydrochar from hydrothermal carbonization.

Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 1285474verify models ’ reliability further. Model sharing provides convenient communication platforms for researchers. Both online platforms based on websites (Leng et al., 2022d ) and offline applications (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ) are available to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the final optimal ML models. With these GUIs, output values can be obtained quickly and accurately by inputting values of independent variables. The above ML modeling, optimization, and sharing can be realized in some open-access coding platforms, such as C/Clanguage (Serrano et al., 2017 ), Py-thon (Castro Garcia et al., 2022 ), R language (Natekin and Knoll, 2013 ), Matlab (Qi et al., 2021 ), and Julia language (Gao et al., 2020 ), etc. 2.2. ML algorithms ML algorithms can be classified into three types: supervised, semi- supervised, and unsupervised algorithms (Fig. 2b). The classic and common algorithms, such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting de-cision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN), can be used in different fields. More details about the principle and implementation of ML algorithms can be referred to (Ouadah et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2021 ). Many ML libraries and frameworks are available for carrying out ML algorithms, e.g., Scikit-learn (the most popular one), TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Each ML algorithm has its hyper- parameters, which must be tuned to fit specific datasets into different problems. Hyper-parameters adjusting can be realized manually (i.e., grid search or random search) or by an automatic process using opti-mization algorithms. Due to the high computational cost of manually optimizing hyper-parameters, it is preferable to use optimization algo-rithms for finding the best hyper-parameter configurations. The theory and practice of hyper-parameter optimization libraries and frameworks for developing ML models were discussed in ref. (Yang and Shami, 2020 ). Particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Juneja and Nagar, 2016 ), genetic algorithm (GA) (Oliveira et al., 2010 ), simulated annealing al-gorithm (Lin and Chen, 2014 ), and Bayesian optimization (BO) are recommended for hyper-parameter optimization. In general, NN algo-rithms are more complex than traditional ML algorithms (tree-based algorithms), but they can probably achieve high prediction accuracy. First, it is necessary to determine whether it is a regression problem or a classification problem according to the different problems in HTT field. For example, the regression models are often used to conduct the hydrothermal products prediction (yield, composition, and properties) and optimization, the classification models are employed for dis-tinguishing different biomass or hydrothermal products, and similar properties of biomass or products could be labeled by the clustering models (Fig. 2). Then, the suitable models could be selected based on different data types (i.e., data numbers, features numbers, character types, digital data, and image data). Traditional ML models includes logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, SVM, RF, GBDT and so on, which are sensitive to digital data. The NN models are preferable to read and treat image data (usually contains amount of data and features) than traditional models (Zhu et al., 2022 ). The advantages and disad -vantages of using common models in the prediction and optimization can be seen in supplementary material .

Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 12854763.Hydrothermal carbonization 3.1. Hydrothermal carbonization process HTC, or so-called wet torrefaction, works at low temperatures (180 –260 •C) and low pressures (2–5 MPa), and the main product of the HTC process is a solid phase product called hydrochar (Peng et al., 2017; Leng et al., 2021e; Zhai et al., 2017 ). Limited gas (the main compound is CO2) and a massive amount of aqueous phase will be generated.

Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 1285477been investigated (Kruse et al., 2013; Leng et al., 2021d ). The formation of hydrochar can have mainly-two different pathways to form primary char via pyrolysis and secondary char via repolymerization. When biomass is heated in subcritical water, cellulose and hemicellulose are hydrolyzed to glucose or other saccharides such as fructose, protein to amino acids, lignin to guaiacol, and lipid is hydrolyzed to fatty acids (Li et al., 2019; Shahbeik et al., 2022 ). Higher temperatures correspond to higher pressures under an environment where water is the medium, and the most hydrochar with desired energy density was prepared at tem-perature near 255 •C and pressure near 5 MPa (Hoekman et al., 2011; Mu et al., 2022 ). High-pressure (20 MPa) water can promote cellulose HTC in low temperatures (117 •C) by cleaving the hydrogen bonding, activating the C–H bonds, and facilitating the dehydration (Yu et al., 2022 ). The residence time of HTC is generally from one hour to several hours, and even one day, if not more. As the reaction goes on, these hydrolyzed products are gradually decomposed and recombined to form hydrochar through chemical reactions, particularly interactive reactions (Funke and Ziegler, 2010; Li et al., 2019 ). Among the biochemical compositions of biomass, carbohydrates are the primary source of hydrochar during the HTC process of biomass. Generally, the increase of ash contents could reduce hydochar yield. However, the release of alkali and alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca) in ash compositions to the hydrochar surface could obtain the higher yield (He et al., 2022a ), because the presence of inherent alkali and alkaline earth metals (especially Ca) in the biomass can catalyze the hydrolysis of biomass to hydrochar (Liu et al., 2021a ). And the generation of hydrochar with high aromaticity from organic acids could be restrained in an alkaline environment (Liu et al., 2021c ), indicating lower H/C (D1.4) and O/C (D0.4) ratios of the hydrochar (He et al., 2022a ). The accumulated Ca in the hydrochar could also decreased combustion properties, due to formed stable bonds between Ca and volatile carbon (He et al., 2022c ). As reported in pre-vious literature, a series of reactions occurred (e.g., hydrolysis, dehy-dration, aromatization, decarboxylation, and polymerization) from carbohydrate to hydrochar (Shi et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2017 ). The H/C and O/C of hydrochar are lower than raw biomass, which is close to some kinds of coal (Xu et al., 2021 ). Thus, HTC is considered a promising technology for fuel production to obtain coal-like char. The other fuel properties, such as calorific value, density, porosity, and energy/carbon recovery (Table 1), are also decisive to hydrochar characteristics for replacing coal (E. Leng et al., 2021). H/C, O/C, and the ratio of fixed carbon/volatiles can be treated as hydrochar carbon stability indexes representing the potential of climate change mitigation of char (Chen et al., 2021; Leng et al., 2019 ). Besides, hydrochar has been studied for use in many other applications by acting as adsorbents, catalysts, carbon-based materials (Zhu et al., 2021 ), fertilizers, soil additives, etc. (Mihajlovi ˘c et al., 2018 ). These various applications depend on material properties, for example, surface area, pore volume, pore size distribu -tion, pH, cation exchange capacity, thermal conductivity, and so on (Kan et al., 2016 ). For example, the surface area and pore volume of hydro -char determine the adsorption of pollutants in the wastewater (Sigmund et al., 2020 ) and the adsorption of CO2 and H2 in gases (Maulana Kusdhany and Lyth, 2021 ). Cation exchange capacity is the most important to remove heavy metals from wastewater (Zhu et al., 2019 ). The elemental compositions and surface characteristics of hydrochar can be used to predict soil heavy metal immobilization (Palansooriya et al., 2022 ). By tailoring the hydrothermal conditions, hydrochar could also be used for not only sludge management in waste water treatment plant (e.g., enhance anaerobic digestion performance) but also contaminants control in industrial wastewater treatment (He et al., 2022b ). Hence, it is critical to explore the effects of biomass compositions and hydrothermal parameters on these application-performance-decisive properties of hydrochar. 3.2. ML-aided HTC High yield and preferable compositions and properties of the hydrochar are the major focuses of HTC ’s effectiveness (Xiang et al., 2020 ). The chemical compositions (C, H, O, N, S, H/C, O/C, N/C, etc.), proximate compositions (volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash, and mois-ture), and functional groups (especially O/N/S-containing functional groups) are usually employed to assess the potential of hydrochar in numerous applications (Leng et al., 2021d; Leng et al., 2022a ). RF and NN are the most frequently used ML algorithms for predicting hydrochar with single-target or multi-targets models. Representative examples of ML-aided prediction and optimization for HTC are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. Table 2 reviewed ML-aided prediction for yield, compositions, and properties of hydrochar from HTC. A gaussian process regression (GPR) model was used to predict yield with high performance (R2 0.94), considering elemental compositions and HTC operating conditions as inputs (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ). The temperature and C content of biomass were the two most important input variables to hydrochar yield (Table 6). A hybrid PSO-NN model was built for yield prediction with proximate analysis, elemental compositions, and operating conditions as inputs (Mu et al., 2022 ). Herein, the PSO algorithm was coupled with NN models for hyper-parameter adjusting, which helped to reduce the relative error of predictive models. However, the performance of the hybrid model (R2 0.86) is inferior to that of the GPR model (Shafi -zadeh et al., 2022 ), which may result from the differences in input features and datasets. Among biomass compositions, the pure lignin is necessary to be used as raw material for valorization, which is the dominant aromatic polymer in nature (Ragauskas et al., 2014 ). How-ever, the reaction behavior of lignin to hydrochar is challenge to un-derstand because of the many possible interactions between operating conditions. Recently, a RF model has been developed to predict the hydrochar yield from HTC of lignin with the addition of solvents and catalysts (Castro Garcia et al., 2022 ). The lignin/solvent ratio, catalyst zeolite, and catalyst/solvent ratio were considered as descriptors for solvents and catalysts. The prediction accuracy can reach a high level of R2 0.94 and RMSE 3.84. The feature importance showed that temperature was also the most crucial factor, accounting for 26 % of the weight. However, the hydrochar yield was not dependent on the sol-vents or catalysts compared to other variables (Castro Garcia et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022c ). The compositions and properties of hydrochar were predicted and interpreted with ML models in addition to hydrochar yield. ANN and RF models were applied to predict the N content and total phosphorus (TP) of hydrochar with favorable performance, respectively (Djandja et al., 2022 , 2021). In addition, various ML models, including decision tree (DT), RF, SVM, radial basis function (RBF), adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were developed and compared for pre-dicting specific surface area (SSA) (Leng et al., 2022b ), higher heating value (HHV) (Chen et al., 2022b ), and energy recovery of hydrochar (Rasam et al., 2021 ). The predicted values of these three targets from best SVM models (R2 ~ 0.97) were consistent with the experimental values (relative error D3 %), showing strong prediction and general -ization ability of ML models in the HTC process. Furthermore, the par-ticle size of biomass was the most influential parameter for hydrochar SSA compared to temperature and residence time. The reduction of particle size brought about more water permeation into pores of the biomass and thereby, a bigger hydrochar SSA would be obtained under the enhancement of the heat and mass transfer (Rasam et al., 2021 ). Long residence time and moderation temperature could improve HHV and energy recovery of hydrochar due to biomass oxygen removal or hydrolysis of hemicellulose (Li et al., 2023; Rasam et al., 2021 ). Though the accuracy of these models for predicting hydrochar yield, composi -tions, and properties were slight different, the R2 can be higher than 0.90 in optimal ML models with various datasets. The critical reaction factors (especially temperature and C content) can be considered to improve the accuracy of prediction models for hydrochar properties, which are also important to hydrochar yield. Different multi-task models (RF, SVR, and DNN) were used to W. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 1285478simultaneously predict multiple characteristics of hydrochar from HTC of the municipal solid waste, including yield, HHV, carbon content, carbon recovery, energy recovery, N/C, H/C, and O/C (Li et al., 2021d ). These results revealed that all three ML models had satisfactory per-formance (average R2 above 0.88) for predicting eight targets together, and DNN obtained the highest expression with R2 0.91. From feature analysis based on multi-task models, the critical input feature to predict H/C and O/C was temperature, while N content of the biomass was the most significant to N/C prediction (Table 6). Meanwhile, the multi- objective optimization was integrated with ML models to optimize the desired properties of hydrochar and experimental conditions. In another study of the same group, RF and SVM models were developed and compared to predict the fuel properties (yield, energy recovery, and energy densification) of hydrochar and pyrochar. The SVM showed better performance (average R2 0.88 –0.91) than RF (average R2 0.75 –0.79). The N content of biomass had an essential effect on hydrochar (Li et al., 2020a ), and the N content differences among sewage sludge, food waste, manure, and other biomass impact hydro -char significantly. For various dataset with different data numbers and features, the performance accuracy difference. The reasons for the dif-ference among the prediction accuracy of these three models may be as follows: First, the dataset is different with various input and output features; Secondly, SVM seems to show better prediction accuracy than DNN in small sample data; Thirdly, the models and algorithms of DNN, SVM, and RF are different, resulting in different prediction accuracy (see supplementary material ). 4.Hydrothermal liquefaction 4.1. Hydrothermal liquefaction process HTL is used to produce biocrude (bio-oil) under moderate operating conditions (240 –375 •C and 5 – 25 MPa). Interactions between subcritical water and biomass in HTL helps to break the chemical bonds of the biomass to obtain bio-oil of high calorific value (F30 MJ/kg) (Leng et al., 2020b ). In subcritical water, HTL involves a lot of complex chemical reactions and structural transformations. The major composi -tions of biomass feedstocks (e.g., protein, lipid, carbohydrate, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) are depolymerized, decomposed, and recombined to produce bio-oil, hydrochar, aqueous phases, and gas during HTL (Brindhadevi et al., 2021 ). The contents of alkali and alka-line earth oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates among biomass ash components could explain the alkalinity of biomass (Vassilev et al., 2013 ). For most cellulosic biomass, the main hydrothermal product was 5-(Hydroxy-methyl)-furfural (HMF) rather than carboxylic acids leading to relatively high bio-oil yields under weak alkaline conditions (Yin et al., 2011 ). And the bio-oil yield decreased with an increase alkalinity due to the generation of polar carboxylic acids. However, the bio-oil yield from lignin-rich biomass increased with strong alkaline condi -tions, because high alkalinity can greatly promote the degradation of lignin from biomass (Castro Garcia et al., 2022 ). Bio-oil comprises organic constituents, such as fatty acids, aromatic hydrocarbons, phe-nolics, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, amides, and esters (Aierzhati et al., 2019 ). The extraction solvent and procedure for phase separating bio-oil and aqueous phase could affect bio-oil yield (Leng et al., 2020c, b). The modest increase of temperature (range from 300 •C to 350 •C) and pressure (~10 – 20 MPa) could obtain maximum bio-oil yield from biomass, and a stable bio-oil yield would produce with further increasing pressure (Mathimani and Mallick, 2019; Mishra et al., 2022 ). The bio-oil yield is generally lower than 60 % and mostly ranges from 20 % to ~ 40 % (Leng et al., 2020b ). Aqueous phase yield from HTL of biomass, which represents carbon yield in the aqueous phase, is also high (Fan et al., 2020 ), and values were reported in the range of 7–48 % (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ). According to relevant experiment works, the ranges of gas yield from HTL were 0.14 % to 41.10 % (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ). The main gas compositions from HTL are CO2 and CO, while CH4 and H2 are the minorities. 4.2. ML-aided HTL Different ML models have been used to predict the quantity and quality of bio-oil from HTL of biomass. The common targets were yield, elemental compositions (O and N content), and HHV. The most employed ML algorithms were GBR and RF. Fig. 4 shows a typical procedure for ML-aided prediction, mechanism interpretation, and optimization for bio-oil from HTL, and more cases are listed in Table 3. The bio-oil yield was frequently predicted due to the higher data availability for bio-oil yield than compositions and properties. The predictive performances of yield by various ML models differed sharply, with R2 ranging from 0.78 to 0.98 (Cheng et al., 2022; Leng et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2022 ). The influence of input features (proximate and ulti-mate analysis of biomass) on bio-oil yield can be visually presented by PDP based on the optimal RF model (Ullah et al., 2021 ). Tree-based ML models (i.e., DT, RF, and GBR) were applied to predict bio-oil yield, N content, and energy recovery by considering biomass compositions and HTL conditions as input features (Li et al., 2021c ). The RF models Fig. 3.ML-aided prediction, interpretation, and optimization for hydrochar from hydrothermal carbonization. Figure modified from ref. (Li et al., 2021d ). Copyright Elsevier 2021. W. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 1285479expressed optimal performance (average R2 0.80) among these algo-rithms for predicting three targets simultaneously. To assess the model ’s reliability, reverse optimization schemes based on RF models were designed and verified experimentally to guide desired bio-oil produc -tion. The GPR models for predicting the yields of all products (hydro -char, bio-oil, aqueous phase, and syngas involved in the HTL system) and bio-oil elemental compositions and calorific value were developed by inputting elemental compositions and HTL conditions (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ). The feature importance and effects analysis were also conducted to determine the formation mechanisms of various products. The maximum bio-oil yield can reach 48.7 –53.5 % from the optimal biomass compositions (C, H, O, N, S, and ash) and HTL parameters (dry matter, temperature, residence time, and pressure) optimized by the ML model. Furthermore, RF models were developed with different input features for predicting nitrogen heterocycles in bio-oil from HTL of biomass (Leng et al., 2022c ). The predictive performance was improved (R2 from 0.59 to 0.82) after considering the bio-oil yield and N content as inputs, and the N content of bio-oil was the most important parameter to nitrogen heterocycles of bio-oil. Generally, the HHV of bio-oil obtained from HTL of algae during was similar to that of conventional diesel (Chen et al., 2022a; Eboibi et al., 2014 ). Thus, algae, including both microalgae and macroalgae, is regarded as a promising renewable biomass for HTL to generate bio-oil with high HHV (Kumar et al., 2020 ). The GBR and RF algorithms were used to predict yield, N content, and O content of bio-oil from HTL of algal biomass (Zhang et al., 2021 ). The forward and reverse optimiza -tions for high-quality bio-oil (e.g., high yield but low N and O contents) were conducted to design experiments for the Chlorella based on GBR models. Due to the limited datasets and redundant features for ML training, the errors between experiments and prediction values were relatively large (F35 % for some bio-oil yield and N content) from revered optimization. However, the overall errors for these three targets are acceptable (D8%) from forward optimization. This way, ML-aided HTL can be promising to guide experimental studies to engineer bio- oil. Recently, a ML-based mechanism study reported that the RF model could effectively predict and produce bio-oil from lignin Table 6 The main inputs and outputs of four-aqueous products from hydrothermal treatment.

Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 12854710depolymerization during HTL considering solvent and catalyst (Castro Garcia et al., 2022 ). The solvent-related properties and temperature were more important than the catalyst to bio-oil yield. Compared to biomass compositions, the reaction solvent (mostly water), extracting solvent (mostly dichloromethane), and extraction solvent and procedure had little effect on bio-oil yield (Li et al., 2021c ). 5.Hydrothermal gasification (supercritical water gasification) 5.1. Hydrothermal gasification process HTG, or supercritical water (e.g., 374 •C and 22 MPa) gasification (SCWG), is a promising and clean process for syngas production under severe hydrothermal conditions (temperature F380 •C and pressure F25 MPa) (Leng et al., 2020a ). During HTG, wet biomass and wastes can be converted to gaseous fuel. The main compositions of syngas from HTG are CO2, CO, H2, and C1–C4 hydrocarbons (Shahbeik et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2010 ). The involved stoichiometric reaction equations in HTG were summarized from biomass model compounds (e.g., lignin, carbohydrate, phenols, alcohols, lipids, protein, and amino acids) (He et al., 2014 ). In detail, water promoted the hydrolysis of these macro -molecules by acting as a solvent and catalyzing the derivatives to generate H2 or CH4 (Lee et al., 2015 ). For lowering the HTG operating conditions and improving syngas productivity, applying either homo -geneous or heterogeneous catalysts to HTG was discussed frequently (Kruse, 2009; Shahbeik et al., 2022 ). For example, the most used ho-mogeneous catalysts in HTG of biomass were Na2CO3, KHCO 3, K2CO3, NaOH, and KOH. In contrast, metal catalysts (e.g., Ni, Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir) were commonly used as heterogeneous catalysts (Guo et al., 2010 ). The heterogeneous catalysts expressed higher hydrogen selectivity than homogeneous catalysts (He et al., 2014 ). Besides, the formation of tar would be restrained by the introduction of catalysts, which influenced the chemical properties of syngas. 5.2. ML-aided HTG ML has been applied to study HTG performance, particularly the prediction of H2 productivity. For example, predicting H2 production from sewage sludge by proximate compositions, ultimate compositions, and HTG conditions was accurate (R2 0.997) using the Gaussian per-formance regression model (Haq et al., 2022 ). The RF algorithm could accurately predict H2 yield (R2 0.98) for HTG of the agricultural waste and municipal solid waste using biomass compositions and HTG pa-rameters (Zhao et al., 2021 ). Temperature, solid contents, pressure, and time are the top four critical features for H2 yield, though these orders may be slightly different in different studies (Table 6). The PDP indi-cated that H2 yield increased with the increasing temperature, which showed a strong positive relationship between H2 production and HTG temperature. However, the effect of pressure on H2 yield was complex, and high pressure seemed to promote H2 production. Increasing reaction time could raise H2 yield only when residence time was within 10 min. Still, the H2 production would decrease when residence time was longer than 10 min, possibly due to the methanation reactions (Zhao et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, ML-aided process parameters optimization was employed for generating maximum H2 with various biomass. Despite limited studies concerning ML-aided catalytic HTG, NN models were used for maximal H2 by screening catalyst and optimizing HTG process parameters (Li et al., 2021a ). Among all solutions of the ML model optimization, Fe-compound catalyst (FeCl 3 or Fe) might be an optimal choice for promoting H2 production among different catalyst types at high temperatures and low solid contents (Li et al., 2021a ). However, the optimal schemes and conclusions should be validated by experi -mentalists to enhance the model ’s credibility. The joint prediction of various gas compositions by ML can better simulate the gas phase products from HTG. A GBR model with tuned hyper-parameters was built for the prediction of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 with testing R2 F0.90 (Li et al., 2020b ). ML-based optimization could realize the directional adjustment and control of syngas compositions, such as H2-rich syngas (Fig. 5). Besides, a multi-task NN model was proposed for predicting syngas compositions (CO, CO2, CH4, and H2) from HTG of food wastes, and R2 as high as 0.99 and mean squared error (MSE) value below 0.30 were obtained (Shenbagaraj et al., 2021 ). However, the aforementioned ML models only developed relationship between inputs and syngas compositions, while the ML-based feature analysis and multicomponent optimization were not conducted.

Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 12854711Nevertheless, the feature effects based on multi-task models were analyzed by Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis (Lundberg and Lee, 2017 ) in another study for the four main gas compositions (Li et al., 2021a ). The three most critical features were temperature, carbon content, and N content, contributing about 70 % importance among all input variables. The yield of the tar and four main gas compositions has been predicted and optimized by ANN models for clean gas from biomass gasification (Kargbo et al., 2021 ), which could be a reference for further application of ML in the HTG field. 6.Research needs and future directions 6.1. ML-aided valorization of aqueous phase byproduct from hydrothermal processes Since water acts as a reaction solvent in HTT, the abundant waste -water (process byproduct) from the aqueous phase is inevitably pro-duced (Xu et al., 2022 ). The aqueous phase was generated in a large amount, about 1–20 times more than the weight of dry biomass feed-stocks (Leng et al., 2021b, 2020a ). The valorization of aqueous phase byproducts is becoming a research hotspot for resource recycling and a challenge for commercial viability of HTT (Watson et al., 2020 ). Many effective methods have been proposed to treat and utilize the valuable component in aqueous phase wastewater (Leng et al., 2021c ). However, the complex nature of the aqueous phase hinders its valorization. ML has been applied for the prediction of pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) of the aqueous phase within testing R2 higher than 0.85 (Leng et al., 2022d ). Fig. 6 shows ML-aided prediction and mechanism inter-pretation of aqueous phase wastewater properties from HTT. ML was also proved to be an efficient method to valorize valuable chemicals from HTT aqueous phase. For instance, maximum sugar yield can be optimized and explained by ML combined with the orthogonal experi -mental design from hydrolysis of oil palm mesocarp fibers (Lee et al., 2022 ). ML-aided glucose production and optimization in HTT were conducted by NN models and experiments (Wei-Hsin Chen et al., 2022 ). The quantitative correlations have been revealed between biomass compositions & HTT conditions and these wastewater indicators (Ta-bles 5-6), which can guide the selection of suitable biomass and HTT parameters. Furthermore, it is essential to consider more properties or composi -tions of the aqueous phase in ML modelling, such as K, Na, phosphate, and heavy metal (Leng et al., 2021b, 2020a ). More valuable chemicals can be prepared effectively with the guidance of ML. The experiments or testing for more properties or compositions of the aqueous phase are different to achieve, and can inevitably cause more statistical errors. Generally, picking the aqueous phase evenly, increasing the number of parallel measurements or experiments (at least 3 times) and adding controlled trials are effective ways to reduce statistical errors. More characteristics of the aqueous phase are valuable to ML models for comprehensively prediction and understanding the relationships be-tween inputs and outputs. Despite more statistical errors may be generated, the errors could be ignored generally by ML training models with the data of the aqueous phase due to their strong fitting capabil -ities. Finally, the considered properties or compositions of the aqueous phase (major descriptors can be seen in Table 1) should be agreed with the requirement of the researchers, which means that not all properties need to be measured. Most of the HTC-related studies would not several limited bio-oil and aqueous phase, the properties of liquid phase would be measured as a whole. Thus, the accurate ML models for predicting the properties of liquid phase in HTC should be developed with same measurement methods (measure bio-oil and aqueous phase as a whole). In addition, ML prediction of aqueous phase byproduct is promising and meaningful to understand the HTT mechanisms because many substance composi -tions are first hydrolyzed to the aqueous phase, then converted to hydrochar, bio-oil, or gas products. 6.2. ML-aided hydrothermal reaction mechanisms Traditionally, the hydrothermal reaction mechanisms are revealed Fig. 5.ML-aided prediction and mechanism interpretation for syngas from hydrothermal gasification. Figure cited from ref. (Li et al., 2021b ). Copyright Elsevier 2021. Fig. 6.ML-aided prediction and mechanism interpretation for aqueous phase from hydrothermal treatment. Figure cited from ref. (Leng et al., 2022d ). Copyright Elsevier 2022. W. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 12854712through lots of experiments and characterizations. Generally, experi -ments were carried out with specific biomass and limited operating conditions in general. Biomass and model chemicals have different re-action pathways and mechanisms to generate various products from HTT. For example, the carbohydrate was main participant to hydrochar (Obeid et al., 2020 ), the protein and carbohydrate interact for promot -ing Maillard reactions to produce aromaticity and nitrogenous hetero -cyclic functional groups (Lu et al., 2022 ), and lipid and lignin expressed an antagonistic effect on the bio-oil yield (Lu et al., 2018 ). Therefore, there is still a lack of universal laws to understand the reaction mech -anisms during different hydrothermal processes in terms of biomass compositions and quality of obtained products. The explanation results based on accurate ML models can effectively aid the study of product formation and reaction mechanism during HTT of biomass. For example, feature importance analysis can show the relative importance of different input variables on the output, and the nonlinear function re-lationships between inputs and targets can be explicitly drawn with PDP. In detail, the molecular modeling data (e.g., biomass model chemicals, catalysts, solvents, and additives), as well as hydrothermal conditions, can be treated as input features to figure out the biomass hydrothermal conversion behavior and their effects on the yields, compositions, or properties of bio-oil, hydrochar, syngas, and aqueous phases with ML models. Hence, real-time monitoring of HTT products and intermediates is essential to achieve a comprehensive understand -ing of the reaction pathways during the HTT of biomass, which should be conducted in the subsequent work for thorough data. Moreover, ML studies can combine with density functional theory (DFT) to reduce computational cost and analysis time for a rational pathway (Butler et al., 2018 ). In detail, the data can be obtained from different molecular numbers and structures during the HTT process (Liu et al., 2021b ). The descriptors of these data could be targeted as inputs or outputs to ML models for training. The physicochemical properties and structural parameters of biomass models calculated by DFT can be inputs. The physical and chemical properties and applied property pa-rameters obtained by DFT can be outputs. In detail, the structures and atomic numbers of biomass could be geometric optimized as inputs. The DFT results could be used as outputs, such as van der Waals surface electrostatic potential, bond strength of different functional groups, bond energy, molecular vibrations and orbitals, electric density and so on. As the different kinds of biomass feedstocks have different compo -sitions, the gaps of certain biomass for generating intermediates and products (hydrochar, bio-oil, gas, and aqueous phase) in HTT vary sharply. For example, the protein and ash contents of sludge are higher than lignocellulosic biomass, while carbohydrate (here containing cel-lulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) is the major compound of lignocellu -losic biomass (see supplementary material ). Thus, protein decompositions were main reactions in HTT of sludge, and the bio-oil and hydrochar from sludge usually have low yields and quality (e.g., N content is high). The lignocellulosic biomass could be conversed into various chemicals and biofuels due to high carbohydrate contents. The predictive performance (R2 F0.85 for bio-oil yield and N content) (Zhang et al., 2021 ) of ML models from HTT of algae was better than that (R2 ~ 0.80 for bio-oil yield and N content) (Li et al., 2021c ) of all considered biomass types (i.e., food waste, manure, algae, sludge, and lignocellulose). The mainly reason is that the different and complex reaction pathways of various biomass limited the accuracy of ML, while ML could show satisfactory performance for specific group of feedstocks (i.e., algae). In summary, the existing data and features are not enough to train an accurate ML model or conduct data-driven mechanism interpretation with all biomass data. The ML models are encouraged to train models for accuracy prediction with the specific biomass type or model compound, because of the similar compositions and reaction pathways of these biomass or model compounds. 6.3. Development of machine learning technique Single ML model may not be capable of simulating the reaction process due to the complexity of different hydrothermal processes. The combination of ML models with advanced statistical technologies and optimization algorithms has excellent potential in biomass conversions. Thus, researchers turned attention to hybrid models to simulate and understand the biomass thermal conversion process. The hybrid ML models generally show better abilities of accuracy and generalizability than traditional models. Some hybrid ML models have been developed in the biomass thermal conversion processes. For example, a genetic algorithm based features selection before training RF models was employed for bio-oil yield prediction (Ullah et al., 2021 ); a response surface methodology was integrated into ANN models for optimizing process parameters and maximum bio-oil production (Gupta et al., 2022 ); and Adaboost was coupled with an ANN algorithm to describe relationships between the thermal treatment process and product yield precisely (Hu et al., 2022 ). Therefore, using these advanced hybrid ML models in HTT of biomass is full of great possibilities. Moreover, deep learning (DL) has been an ideal choice for its diversification and accuracy of prediction compared to traditional ML methods. The relationships among AI, ML, and DL can be shown in Fig. 1a. DL, or advanced ML, has been widely used in other biomass conversion technologies. For example, a DL network was successfully applied to predict the lower heating value of the syngas from biomass gasification (Kartal and Ozveren, 2020 ), with R2 reaching 0.99. The R2 of CO, CO2, CH4, H2, and HHV predictions for gas from biomass gasifi -cation were higher than 0.85 by MLP models (Elmaz et al., 2020b ). DL models have numerous advantages, especially in image identification (Wang et al., 2017 ), but few DL-based models have been built in hy-drothermal processes. There are still some problems to be solved when using DL models in this field, such as the requirement of big data, the high computational cost, and the difficulty in model interpretation. 6.4. Increase model generalizability and interpretability In general, 80 % of the entire data is considered as a training dataset, and the remaining 20 % is considered a testing dataset during the ML model development. Different training and testing datasets ratios can be tried to increase model predictive ability and generalizability, but too few testing data can result in overfitting. The training process and results with different datasets ratios should be shown and discussed in detail. Besides, the R2 and RMSE are simply used for evaluating ML models in most studies. More statistical indicators (i.e., mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared relative error (RMSPE)) could be applied to comprehensively assess ML models ’ performance. The data numbers, descriptors, and distributions should be evaluated carefully to achieve good generalizability. If the distributions of data are unsatisfactory (e.g., data features of limited or biased coverages), bad generalizability of the models may appear. Creating highly generaliz -able models suitable across a wide range of feedstocks and various thermochemical parameters & ranges should be promoted in the future. Recently, a synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) algorithm (Chawla et al., 2002 ) was introduced to ML models for dealing with imbalanced data to get accurate predictive performance for plant-scale biogas production (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The input data of HTT de-scriptors can be filled with synthetic samples from the SMOTE algo-rithm, then unevenly distributed data can be effectively improved. Although ML models generally express high performance, their “black box” nature is the main drawback. To further explain the developed ML models, open the “black box” of ML. Interpretation methods can be adopted and compared, such as PDP, Individual Con-ditional Expectation (ICE), Permuted Feature Importance, Global Sur-rogate, Local Surrogate (LIME), Shapley Value, and Gini importance (Ribeiro et al., 2016 ). These interpretable methods depend on different W. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 12854713principles, which could be selected and compared as needed for various ML models. All of those interpretation methods can be used to explain the behavior and predictions of trained machine learning models. But the interpretation methods might not work well in the following cases (Molnar, 2019 ): 1) if model models interactions (e.g., when a random forest is used); 2) if features strongly correlate with each other; 3) if the model does not correctly model causal relationships; 4) if parameters of the interpretation method are not set correctly. 6.5. Data and model sharing It is challenging for researchers to collect the original hydrothermal data (containing important descriptors) from all related literature. Data processing and feature cleaning are time-consuming and laborious. It is necessary to share the continuous dataset in open-source communities. Besides, the developed ML models with different algorithms are rec-ommended to share the codes in the public platform (e.g., GitHub project, https://github.com/ ). The shared data and models can be assessed, used, and improved by others for a better understanding of the hydrothermal process of biomass. Compared with local application software that should be downloaded (Shafizadeh et al., 2022; Ullah et al., 2021 ), the online website ’s graphical user interfaces (Leng et al., 2022d ) are more user-friendly. Therefore, such communities should be built to promote the development of HTT. 6.6. ML-aided industrialization of hydrothermal processes The ML is a strong and effective tool for prediction, optimization, and interpretation in HTT of biomass. For example, a accurate prediction models could be developed with abundant data, data-driven schemes could be obtained based on ML for experimentalists, and explainable relationships could be established between input and outputs for sci-entists. With accurate prediction performance, the final purpose of ML models is to guide actual experiments (Ai et al., 2022 ). The as-obtained models can be applied to various functions. Firstly, the prediction functions of ML models are primarily used for predicting the yield, compositions, and characteristics of HTT products. Without conducting complex experiments, the results can be easily obtained with given input variables by ML. Moreover, the optimization functions of ML models are necessary and valuable for optimal output results within some restricted conditions. Therein, the forward optimization is to screen desired so-lutions with predictive results of ML models. For example, the prediction values from trained ML models can be presented by inputting one spe-cific biomass (with measured compositions) and each variable of oper-ating conditions (with set steps in the range). The optimum product property is taken as the standard for choosing optimal conditions within iteration results from ML. The reverse optimization means optimum input parameters combinations can be determined through orientation- basis target functions (e.g., maximum or minimum yield, compositions, and properties of the hydrothermal products) using optimization algo-rithms, such as the heuristic optimization method (i.e., PSO and GA). The optimization of process conditions (Fang et al., 2022 ) for preferable targets is practical and instructive. Still, limited studies considered the hydrothermal process optimization, let alone experiment validations. Most studies focused on single-target predictions for one specific yield, composition, or property of hydrothermal products. Only a few works studied the prediction of multiple targets (Alabdrabalnabi, 2021; Castro Garcia et al., 2022 ), and their results were obtained from multiple single-target prediction models (Shafizadeh et al., 2022 ). Single target prediction cannot describe the HTT performance adequately. To achieve biomass biorefinery, all products from HTT of biomass should be valo-rized or disposed of (Watson et al., 2020 ). Hence, multi-target ML models are preferable for simultaneously predicting multi-phase prod-uct yield, compositions, and properties, which are worth further investigation. In the engineering industry, a wide variety of solvents and catalysts could be applied to improve the properties of products from HTT. However, the descriptors of solvents or catalysts are rarely considered to build ML models in this field. In general, solvent properties can be described by critical pressure, critical temperature, molecular mass, density, solubility, polarity, and so on. And catalyst characteristics include catalyst ratio, catalyst size, catalyst BET surface area, catalyst pore size, catalyst total pore volume, molecular mass, valency, ioniza -tion energy, electron affinity, conductivity, etc. Therefore, the screening of optimal solvents and catalysts for HTT apart from other common operating conditions (temperature, residence time, and solid content) can be realized based on these ML models. Moreover, the developed models are encouraged to be put into industrialized applications. The data needs to be processed before it can be trained in the ML models (Fig. 1), and visual platform system should be developed stably with ML models. Different models may have different data process methods, which resulting the complexity of training processes. Still, there is no comprehensive unified data and machine learning platform to meet the requirements and applications for hydrothermal treatment of biomass. Therefore, the application of machine learning is still a long way off. One way is to simplify and embed ML algorithms to chips, and then target products ’ monitoring and regulation can be realized in real-time. The data from the factories were generally intermittent and time-sensitive. In this way, the long short- term memory (LSTM) network (Wu et al., 2021 ) can be used for training these data from sensor measurements. In the future, suitable ML models could be developed for predicting and optimizing products with various types of industrial data. 7.Conclusions ML has demonstrated great potential to predict the yield, composi -tions, and properties of hydrochar, bio-oil, syngas, and aqueous phases obtained from the HTT of biomass. Nevertheless, ML prediction is just the first step with a low technology readiness level to realize ML-aided optimization, monitoring, and controlling of HTT. Although the pre-dictive performances of most ML models were accurate (R2 F0.85), it is still challenging to interpret and compare various models with no completely-satisfactory model being developed. Therefore, it is imper -ative to improve ML predictive performance, mechanistic interpreta -tion, process optimization, data sharing, and model application for HTT of biomass towards high-quality production.
