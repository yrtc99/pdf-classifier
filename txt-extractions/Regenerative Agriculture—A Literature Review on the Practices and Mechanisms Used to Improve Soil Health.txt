The fundamental principles of RA are to keep the soil covered,minimise soil disturbance, preserve living roots in the soil year round, increase species diversity,integrate livestock, and limit or eliminate the use of synthetic compounds (such as herbicides andfertilisers). The overall objectives are to rejuvenate the soil and land and provide environmental,economic, and social beneﬁts to the wider community. Despite the purported beneﬁts of RA, a vastmajority of growers are reluctant to adopt these practices due to a lack of empirical evidence on theclaimed beneﬁts and proﬁtability. We examined the reported beneﬁts and mechanisms associatedwith RA against available scientiﬁc data. The literature suggests that agricultural practices such asminimum tillage, residue retention, and cover cropping can improve soil carbon, crop yield, andsoil health in certain climatic zones and soil types. Excessive use of synthetic chemicals can lead tobiodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Combining livestock with cropping and agroforestry inthe same landscape can increase soil carbon and provide several co-beneﬁts. However, the beneﬁts ofRA practices can vary among different agroecosystems and may not necessarily be applicable acrossmultiple agroecological regions. Our recommendation is to implement rigorous long-term farmingsystem trials to compare conventional and RA practices in order to build knowledge on the beneﬁtsand mechanisms associated with RA on regional scales. This will provide growers and policy-makerswith an evidence base from which to make informed decisions about adopting RA practices to realisetheir social and economic beneﬁts and achieve resilience against climate change.Keywords: soil health; regenerative agriculture; soil carbon; microbial function1. IntroductionRegenerative agriculture (RA) is a farming strategy that uses natural processes toincrease biological activity, enhance soil health, improve nutrient cycling, restore landscapefunction, and produce food and ﬁbre, while preserving or increasing farm proﬁtability. Thestrategy is based on a set of guiding principles, and practitioners use a variety of tactics thatintegrate biological and ecological processes with the objective of increasing productionand restoring landscape functionality.The objective of RA is not to restore the native pre-agriculture ecology and biologicalfunction, but rather to leverage ecological processes in nature within an agricultural systemto improve farming system health. The term “regenerative agriculture” was ﬁrst coined byGabel [ 1], then Rodale [ 2] further developed the concept of regenerative organic farming toSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15032338 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 2 of 41include some options that encompass a holistic approach with a focus on environmentaland social improvements without the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Sincethen, several deﬁnitions of RA have been put forward by various researchers. Franciset al. [ 3] proposed that RA emphasises the use of resources found on the farm whilerestricting the use of synthetic inputs. Project Drawdown [ 4] uses the term to refer toannual cropping systems that include at least four of six sustainable practices withoutthe system being organic. Sherwood and Uphoff [ 5] and Rhodes [ 6] proposed that RAis a system built on biological principles that seeks to enhance both productivity andenvironmental management. Conversely, systems that reduce soil fertility, carbon storage,and biodiversity are considered as degenerative agriculture.In order to address these concerns, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)proposed that the aim of RA is to go beyond the “do no harm” principles of sustainableagriculture [ 7]. According to a SYSTEMIQ report, RA is one of the 10 transitions neededto transform food and land use. In general, it includes approaches that regenerate soil,reduce the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, and have a positive impact on theenvironment [ 8]. RA is considered to achieve the target speciﬁed by United NationsSustainable Development Goal 2: “By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systemsand implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production,that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change,extreme weather, drought, ﬂooding and other disasters and that progressively improveland and soil quality”.Despite there being various descriptions of RA, there is no agreed deﬁnition, whichposes considerable challenges for researchers, farmers, agriculture advisors, policy-makers,and consumers in understanding and applying RA concepts. Recently, researchers andpolicy-makers have attempted to deﬁne regenerative agriculture to guide future researchand policy development. Based upon a qualitative analysis of 28 studies, Schreefel et al. [ 9]proposed a provisional deﬁnition of RA as “an approach to farming that uses soil conserva-tion as the entry point to regenerate and contribute to multiple provisioning, regulating andsupporting services, with the objective that this will enhance not only the environmental,but also the social and economic dimensions of sustainable food production”. By contrast,Newton et al. [ 10] using a meta-analysis approach found that many RA deﬁnitions wereeither process- or outcome-based or, in a few instances, a combination of both. Hence, theyproposed that “individual users of the term ‘regenerative agriculture’ to deﬁne broadly fortheir own purposes and contexts”.Five principles that guide the approach are as follows: (1) minimise soil disturbance,(2) keep the soil covered year-round, (3) keep live plants and roots in the soil for as long aspossible, (4) incorporate biodiversity, and (5) integrate animals. Advocates and practitionersof RA argue that these methods will prevent soil erosion and depletion, actively buildsoil, provide appropriate crop nutrients with minimum external inputs, produce healthy,high-yielding crops with few weeds and pests, limit greenhouse gas emissions, increasefarmers’ ﬁnancial returns, and improve human health (Figure 1). However, such claimshave been widely criticised, and the general consensus is that they are not supported byrigorous empirical science [11].RA practitioners use a number of methodologies that combine biological and ecologicalsystems to increase productivity and restore landscape function. The overarching goal is tocapitalise on natural processes, including by doing the following:1. Capturing soil carbon through the photosynthesis of high-biomass-producing plants.2. Improving symbiotic soil microbiota–plant interactions.3. Using biological systems to enhance soil structure and water retention.4. Including livestock, with an anticipated positive impact on ecosystem services.There is no universal approach; instead, these practices must be tailored to the speciﬁcfarming and climatic environment in which they are used. Factors such as precipitation,temperature, soil type, farm enterprise mix, markets, and individual preferences must beaddressed before implementing an RA system. Furthermore, RA is not organic farmingSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 3 of 41and is not a prescriptive agricultural method. Rather, it is based on core concepts that assistindividuals in implementing a variety of techniques on their properties in order to achievethe desired outcomes. Many of the practices used by RA farmers are well-established “goodfarming” practices that conventional farmers also use. Some RA practices overlap withother forms of sustainable agriculture practices, such as conservation agriculture, organicfarming, low-input farming, climate smart agriculture, and carbon farming.Sustainability  2023 , 15, 2338  3 of 43   Figure 1.

Significance of Regenerative Agriculture to Western Australian Farming Systems  Australian drylands comprise approximately 372 million ha of agricultural land, en-compassing grazing and cropping, and most of the cropping zones have a semi -arid cli-mate. Soils are predominantly coarse  textured with inherently low soil carbon. Land deg-radation is a major issue facing Australian agriculture; two -thirds of agricultural land is already degraded due to erosion, declining soil fertility, salinity, acidification, and declin-ing rainfall [12]. A ustralia is the world’s driest inhabited continent, thus it is important to quickly develop and implement strategies to prevent further land degradation and restore soil health.

RA (Regenerative Agriculture) principles, practices, and purported beneﬁts and mecha-nisms to improve soil health.Signiﬁcance of Regenerative Agriculture to Western Australian Farming SystemsAustralian drylands comprise approximately 372 million ha of agricultural land,encompassing grazing and cropping, and most of the cropping zones have a semi-aridclimate. Soils are predominantly coarse textured with inherently low soil carbon. Landdegradation is a major issue facing Australian agriculture; two-thirds of agricultural land isalready degraded due to erosion, declining soil fertility, salinity, acidiﬁcation, and decliningrainfall [ 12]. Australia is the world’s driest inhabited continent, thus it is important toquickly develop and implement strategies to prevent further land degradation and restoresoil health. Otherwise, these issues could lead to an increased propensity for desertiﬁcation.Among grains, wheat is the dominant commodity in Australia, with an annual pro-duction of 25 million tons, followed by barley and canola (https://www.aegic.org.au/australian-grain-production-a-snapshot/ Australian Export Grains Innovation Centre, ac-cessed on 20 September 2022). Western Australian grain production today is predominantlya system of continuous high-input, high-output cropping. There are many emerging issuesassociated with this approach; in particular, farm proﬁtability is declining due to reducedseasonal rainfall in the major grain-growing regions, posing ﬁnancial risks if crop failureoccurs. Declining soil fertility, herbicide/pesticide resistance, consumer concerns aboutthe use of glyphosate and other environmental issues, plateauing grain production, andincreasing competition from other international export markets, particularly in the BlackSea region, are some of the other challenges for the grain industry [ 13]. In the face of thesechallenges, Australian growers will need to embrace new opportunities to sustain the prof-itability of grain production. Farmers are responding to these challenges in different ways.For instance, some farmers are shifting their focus from maximising yield to maximisingSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 4 of 41proﬁt, and some are moving towards lower-risk systems or diversiﬁcation of cash crops.The farmer-led effort for the adoption of RA principles and practices is another example ofa shift in focus towards reduced cashﬂow risk and increased returns. Several cost-effectivefarming practices are already in use that would be consistent with RA principles. Threemain anticipated outcomes of RA are assumed: the agricultural ecosystem will regenerate,landscape functions will improve, and farming will remain proﬁtable.Despite the perceived beneﬁts of RA, wide-scale adoption has not been achieved on aglobal scale. Barriers to adoption include biophysical, cultural, social, institutional, andeconomical concerns, and the major barrier is the lack of regionally speciﬁc knowledge,science-based evidence, and bio-economic models for transitioning from conventionalsystems to RA. The aims of the current review were (1) to examine the purported outcomesof RA against the current scientiﬁc evidence, and (2) to identify knowledge gaps forfuture research. Two broadly reported beneﬁts are that RA helps to sequester and/orretain carbon in the soil and improves soil biology. Based on literature searches for peer-reviewed scientiﬁc evidence on the beneﬁts of RA, almost no scientiﬁc studies have beenconducted directly in the context of RA. However, there are numerous peer-reviewedscientiﬁc publications on individual RA practices reporting their inﬂuence on soil carbonand soil biology. Therefore, the focus of the review shifted to looking at the scientiﬁcevidence (local and overseas studies) on RA practices that affect soil carbon build-up andimprove soil health.2. Potential Beneﬁts of RA for Soil HealthSoil health has been deﬁned as the ability of soil to continue to function as a vitalliving system within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, thereby sustaining biologicalproductivity, maintaining air and water quality, and promoting plant, animal, and hu-man health [ 14,15]. More recently, the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS)deﬁned soil health as “the ability of the soil to sustain the productivity, diversity, andenvironmental services of terrestrial ecosystems” [ 16]. The health of soil is attributed toits desirable physical (texture, water holding capacity), chemical (pH, soil organic matter(SOM), and biological (microbial diversity, N mineralisation, and soil respiration) propertiesthat support healthy productive crops. Soil is considered a living and complex ecosystemharbouring a wide array of both micro- and macrobiota that regulate its properties. Theintensiﬁcation of agriculture with modern technology has deteriorated the capacity of soilto maintain its functions, affecting long-term productivity and causing a loss of ecosys-tem services [ 17–19]. Improving soil health by increasing organic matter and boosting itsfertility and productivity is the primary focus of RA.2.1. Increased Soil CarbonSoil is considered to be an active storage pool of C due to its capacity to store three timesmore carbon than the atmosphere [ 20]. One of the primary causes of soil degradation is theloss of soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC has been shown to improve soil structure, fertility,nutrient availability, aeration, water inﬁltration, and water-holding capacity [ 21]. Recently,it is also being considered as a solution for mitigating climate change [ 22]. According tothe “4 per 1000” initiative launched by the French government at the 21st COP , an annualincrement of 0.4% SOC in the ﬁrst 30–40 cm of soil in all land uses could absorb a signiﬁcantamount of CO 2emitted due to human activities, with the co-beneﬁts of improving soilhealth and food security. To meet this goal, stakeholders are encouraged to implementmanagement practices that enhance SOC sequestration.Despite criticisms of the calculations and achievability of the initiative in terms ofmitigating climate change [ 23], there is broad consensus that even a small increase inSOC could provide tremendous beneﬁts by restoring soil health [ 24–26]. Moreover, thereis anecdotal evidence that the “4 per 1000” target could be achieved in arable crops inthe Mediterranean climate by using mitigation strategies including no/minimum tillage,organic fertilisers, and stubble retention in coarse-textured soils [ 27]. Diminishing SOCSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 5 of 41stocks from terrestrial ecosystems are a major concern for declining agricultural production.Management practices that increase SOC are recommended to optimise agricultural yields.Increasing SOC up to 2% has been shown to increase yield in maize and wheat, andmay reduce reliance on N fertiliser [ 28,29]. Although soil carbon build-up is inﬂuencedby regional climate and management practices [ 30], phenomena such as deforestation,ﬁre, land use conversion, and erosion are attributed to a loss of SOC. In particular, landcultivation removes topsoil, destroys soil aggregate structure, and exposes SOC to oxidation,affecting nutrient availability and soil physical properties [ 23,31–33]. Several croppingpractices implemented to maintain or increase SOC are discussed below.2.1.1. Minimum/No TillageA key practice used by RA farmers is minimum or no tillage to minimise soil dis-turbance. Among the other beneﬁts of minimising disturbance to the soil, the practice isaimed at allowing fungal hyphae to proliferate, thus enhancing nutrient cycling in thesoil. Soil disturbance due to extensive tillage causes carbon dioxide (CO 2)ﬂuxes to theatmosphere and water resources [ 34]. Minimum or no tillage is widely adopted in somecountries not only as a cost-saving means, but also to provide beneﬁts in areas prone to soiland water erosion risk. Aside from these beneﬁts, some experts believe that conservationtillage methods can increase carbon sequestration, thereby mitigating the consequences ofglobal warming [35].Minimum tillage combined with residue retention in a double-cropping system isthe most promising management strategy for increasing SOC stocks in croplands [ 36].Increased SOC stock or concentration in the topsoil not only supports more productivesoil with increased biological activity, but also promotes resilience to harsh weather con-ditions. Haddaway et al. (2017) [ 37] based upon a global metanalysis suggested that theincreased C stock under no tillage versus high tillage in the upper soil (0–30 cm) wasaround 4.6 Mg/ha (0.78–8.43 Mg/ha, 95% CI) over 10 years, while no effect was detectedin the full soil proﬁle [ 38]. In contrast, SOC accumulation was found to be insigniﬁcantwith continuous cropping under zero tillage in a warm semi-arid temperate or sub-tropicalclimate; however, slow accumulation of SOC was possible with the inclusion of perennialpastures in rotation [ 39,40]. Increasing SOC with conservation tillage depends upon severalfactors, including precipitation, soil depth, crop yield, stubble retention, and decompositionrate [40].Soil carbon is unlikely to increase with current farming practices in Southeast Australiain the short-term [ 41]; however, incorporating legume leys into grasses could restore soilorganic matter (SOM) in the long-term due to increased root biomass [ 42]. Long-term tillagepractices produce more noticeable changes in SOC than short-term tillage practices [ 33,43].Furthermore, SOM storage is modulated by the clay content of soil. Tillage practices reducecarbon (C) stabilisation within microaggregates in clayey soils but have little effect in sandysoils [ 44]. According to studies conducted in North America, soil disturbance caused bytillage was the primary cause of SOC loss, and substantial SOC sequestration could beachieved by switching from conventional to conservation tillage practices [45].To improve soil biological properties, no-till (NT) farming has been proposed. Mar-tinez et al. (2013) [ 46] discovered that soil chemical fertility increased under NT, withhigher levels of N, P , and K, when they compared selected soil properties in irrigatedMediterranean no-till and conventional tillage (CT) systems. Compared to conventionaltillage, no-till sequestered more C. Increased SOC resulted in higher biological activityunder NT than CT. The increased productive capacity of NT soil has also been proposed interms of soil chemical properties. Powlson et al. [ 47], however, asserted that while no-till isbeneﬁcial for soil quality, its role in mitigating climate change is greatly exaggerated.Differences in SOC increase with tillage practices in different soil proﬁles have beenreported, which may be due to discrepancies in the methodologies used to determineSOC. Soils were only sampled to a depth of 30 cm or less in almost all cases where con-servation tillage was found to sequester C, even though crop roots often extended muchSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 6 of 41deeper. Conservation tillage showed no consistent accrual of SOC in a few studies wheresampling extended deeper than 30 cm, with higher concentrations either near the surfacein conservation tillage or in deeper layers in conventional tillage. These disparities maybe due to differences in thermal and physical conditions caused by tillage, which affectroot growth and distribution. Another study that used gas exchange measurements on amaize/soybean rotation for 2 years discovered no C sequestration in either conservationor conventional tillage, suggesting that long-term studies and deeper soil sampling areneeded in order to improve the predictability of C sequestration potential with changes intillage practices [48].No Tillage and Yield ImprovementSeveral studies have indicated a positive impact of no or minimum tillage on cropyields and proﬁtability, subject to regional agroclimatic conditions and crop and soil factors.When compared to conventional tillage, NT reduced the global warming potential at acidicsoil sites, increased barley yield by 49%, and showed potential to reduce greenhouse gasemissions (GHG) in dry climates, according to a meta-analysis of 740 paired measurementsfrom 90 peer-reviewed articles [ 49]. As a result of its potential to mitigate climate changeand improve crop yield, NT is recommended as an effective climate-smart agriculture(CSA) management practice. However, various environmental and agronomic variablesalter the net effect of NT (compared to CT). Therefore, the agroecological context must betaken into account when comparing different tillage techniques. In contrast, from a studyof historical wheat yield patterns under NT and CT, [ 50] concluded that the tillage systemhad no effect on wheat yield and that Australian wheat varieties were not adapted to theNT system.On its own, no tillage is not considered beneﬁcial in certain circumstances, especiallywhere stubble decomposes very quickly. Nouri et al. (2019) [ 51] demonstrated that long-term incorporation of cover crops, particularly vetch, in conjunction with NT improved thephysical properties of soil, such as soil aggregation and moisture retention during dry spells.A study conducted on deep sands in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia over a 7-yearperiod revealed that different tillage treatments had no effect on crop yields; however, soilcarbon and microbial function increased under CT and NT treatments in the top 0.10 and0.05 m of soil, respectively [ 52]. Using data from 678 peer-reviewed publications, a globalmeta-analysis assessed the impact of various crop and environmental variables on NTrelative to CT yields. The study found that the impact of NT on yield varied depending onthe region, with yield declining in tropical regions with maize-based systems and increasingin moisture-limited arid regions [ 53]. A long-term tillage experiment demonstrated that,in a semi-arid subtropical environment, it would take at least 20 years to achieve the fullsoil beneﬁts (physical, chemical, and biological) of an NT system [ 54]. When NT was usedinstead of traditional tillage, yield increased by 47 and 28%, respectively, with and withoutthe use of N and Zn fertilisers.The prevailing environmental conditions of a region have the greatest inﬂuence oncarbon sequestration and, as a result, crop yields. A recent global analysis of NT-inducedchanges in soil C and crop yield based on 260 and 1970 paired studies, respectively, revealedthat compared to CT, conservation agriculture beneﬁts arid regions the most by achievinga win–win outcome of increased C sequestration and crop yield. In more humid areas,only SOC gains are likely to occur, with no effect on crop yield, whereas in some colderareas there will be a negative impact on both SOC and yield [ 55]. According to thesestudies, adopting conservation management practices in Western Australia would result ina win–win situation. Sun et al. [55], however, emphasised the need for more rigorous andlong-term studies evaluating the regional climate-related beneﬁts of such practices.Despite the variability in responses to the NT effect on increasing SOC, a substantialamount of literature has demonstrated that SOC can potentially be increased using NT inconjunction with crop residue retention and mixed rotation, with a plausible positive impacton crop yield [ 56–58]. According to the literature, the addition of organic residues such asSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 7 of 41compost, biochar, and manure can result in signiﬁcant SOC gains [ 59]. However, critics ofRA deny the validity of such claims and state that most of these studies lack the propermethodology for measuring and verifying SOC changes [ 23]. With modern techniquessuch as hyperspectral remote sensing, it may be possible to provide SOC predictions inthe future.Scientiﬁc evidence from overseas and limited studies in Western Australia indicatethat C sequestration is possible in moderately degraded soils in warm arid zones by usingimproved farming practices. Any system in which the input of biomass-C exceeds the loss(due to decomposition, erosion, etc.) will result in soil organic carbon sequestration (DrRattan Lal, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA, personal communication, July 2020).There is also inorganic carbon in arid and semi-arid regions. According to the publishedliterature, a signiﬁcant increase in SOC is expected 6–10 years after a change in managementpractices (NT and rotational complexity), with an equilibrium reached after 15–20 yearsunder constant weather conditions. Increased SOC can lead to a higher crop yield, whichcan be attributed to increased plant available water holding capacity and N availability,particularly in N-deﬁcient soils. While a critical SOC threshold of 2% is established forsustainable crop production in temperate regions and about 1% in tropical regions [ 60],it would be worthwhile to investigate the minimum critical SOC threshold for cerealsand other rotational crops in Western Australia’s Mediterranean climate. Importantly,management practices that boost SOC are site-speciﬁc. Furthermore, SOC loss from winderosion in dryland agriculture in the region necessitates research into farming practicesthat can prevent such SOC loss. Identifying the best socioeconomically feasible practicesfor increasing SOC storage in Western Australian soils will not only improve soil qualityand long-term productivity, but also aid in implementing the key principles of RA.No-Tillage and Nitrous Oxide (N 2O) EmissionsDespite the advantages of NT management practices for increasing SOC, there areconcerns that they result in higher N 2O emissions. This is concerning, as even a smallconcentration of this gas has a large effect on warming, which could offset the beneﬁts ofan NT system [ 61,62]. Increased N 2O with NT is attributed to a higher use of N fertiliserscausing denitriﬁcation, possibly due to low organic matter in combination with low oxygenconditions and low soil pH and texture [ 63–65]. Changing from diverse perennial systemswith high SOM to an annual cropping system causes high N 2O ﬂux due to greater mineral-isation and denitriﬁcation [ 66]. Conversely, some studies have predicted low emissions ofN2O from NT compared with CT systems in the longer term [ 67]. Management strategiesare required to mitigate the impact of N 2O emissions from reduced- or no-till agriculture.It is suggested that enhanced-efﬁciency nitrogen fertilisers be used to reduce N 2O emis-sions [ 68]. Plant diversity can also reduce N 2O emissions in restored agricultural soils [ 69].The type of cover crop used may also inﬂuence N 2O emission rates. Leguminous crops, forexample, can increase crop productivity while having no effect on N 2O emissions due totheir ability to ﬁx atmospheric N [ 70]. Organic and inorganic fertilisers have been shownto reduce nitrogen loss while increasing N accumulation in soils when used together [ 71].Furthermore, matching N supply to crop demand, in conjunction with animal waste andresidue management, can reduce N 2O emissions by 0.38 Tg N 2O-N [72].Another major issue with NT is the overuse of herbicides for weed control, whichcauses environmental pollution and resistant weeds, and threatens human health. It maybe possible to reduce herbicide use under no-till crop production by using an integratedapproach such as crop competitive enhancement, seed bank reduction technologies, croprotation and biological control [73–75].2.1.2. Cover CropsThe second and third RA principles involve keeping soil covered and living rootsin the soil all year. One method is to incorporate cover crops into the farming system.Cover crops are typically grown between main crops to cover and keep living plants onSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 8 of 41the soil during non-cash-cropping periods. This is accomplished by either planting covercrops after harvest or under-seeding cash crops, typically grains, with perennial crops thatwill then develop to maintain soil cover post-harvest into the following season. Covercrops can be single species or multi-species blends. Despite the ease with which singlecover crop species can be managed, a mixture of species may provide all the beneﬁts ofeach species in the mix [ 76]. Multi-species cover crops, including legumes, are thoughtto improve ecosystem functions such as biological nitrogen ﬁxation, microbial diversity,compaction reduction, attraction of beneﬁcial insects, suppression of weeds, regulation ofsoil temperature, and increased water inﬁltration. Cover crops, in addition to improvingsoil fertility, aid in carbon sequestration, and their widespread adoption could reduceagricultural GHG emissions by 10%, which is comparable to using no-till or other croppingpractices [ 77]. One of the key beneﬁts of cover crops is enhanced microbial biomass throughthe addition of extra SOM in soil [ 78]. However, it can take several years for soil carbon toincrease signiﬁcantly [ 79,80]. A variety of cover crop responses to SOC accumulation havebeen reported on a global scale in various agroclimatic regions. Cover cropping was shownto increase surface storage of SOC in a temperate humid region of North America by theuse of cover crops six times in eight years, improving soil functionality, but proﬁtabilitywas dependent on the type of production system used [ 81]. The mechanism of SOC storagewith cover crops remains unknown; it could be due to either below- or above-groundbiomass input or rhizodeposition.Soil carbon accumulation with cover crops has been linked to soil texture, with anincrease in soil carbon more likely to occur in clay soils with cover crops. In Argentina,studies have shown that cover crops grown on ﬁne- and coarse-textured soils accumulatemore soil carbon [ 82]. While cover crops can help eroded soils with low C content accu-mulate more carbon [ 83,84], the beneﬁts are more visible with no tillage due to a slowerrate of residue decomposition than with conventional tillage [ 85]. A recent meta-analysisof 131 global studies found that incorporating cover crops into the rotation signiﬁcantlyimproved SOC, with ﬁne-textured soils showing the greatest increase; the increase wasgreater in shallow soil (30 cm) than in subsurface soil (>30 cm). This increase in SOCwas associated with improvements in soil quality and mineralizable N and C, and wasinﬂuenced by the annual temperature, number of years after cover cropping began, initialSOC concentration, and latitude [86].Plant diversity is important in both natural and managed systems and is thought to beessential for maintaining soil productivity. Crop diversiﬁcation provides a multitude ofbeneﬁts, including increased crop productivity and biodiversity, suppression of pests andpathogens, and improved water and soil quality [ 87]. Without the use of nitrogen fertilisers,legume cover crops have a positive impact on the yield of the subsequent main crop [ 88].A meta-analysis of 1001 paired observations from 121 papers found that species mixesincreased SOC content and stock by 6–8% more than monocultures [ 89]. The researchersconcluded that the functional groups within the mixtures had little effect on increasingSOC but did have an effect on increasing microbial biomass carbon when compared tomonocultures. Crop rotation and mixed species cover crops combined with no tillagerestored degraded cropland and increased C stocks in tropical sandy soils in just ﬁveyears [ 90]. In contrast, recent modelling indicates that increasing the cover crop area by30% could increase annual C stocks by 35 Tg within 50 years [91].Furthermore, the mechanisms by which cover crops inﬂuence the yield of subsequentcrops can vary among cropping systems and environments and are thus poorly under-stood [ 92,93]. Cover crops have been shown to have a negative effect on gross margins inWestern Australia’s low-rainfall environments [ 94]. Another concern is that cover cropsplanted in the summer will consume all available moisture, which will be detrimentalto subsequent crops, especially if dry conditions prevail at the start of the season. How-ever, yield improvement in corn and soybean has been reported after cover crops in adry year [ 95]. Similarly, increased yields of main crops after summer cover crops wereattributed to reduced compaction and soil temperature, and increased soil aggregate sta-Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 9 of 41bility, carbon, and nitrogen concentration and soil water content [ 96]. Conversely, a 10%reduction in wheat yield has been reported following cover cropping [ 93]. Furthermore,cover crops may harbour pests and diseases that infect subsequent crops, although there isevidence that mustard cover crops have a biofumigation effect and can lessen the impact ofsoil-borne pathogens [ 97,98]. In order to garner the beneﬁts of this technology in drylandagriculture, careful management and selection of cover crop species are required.Due to high temperatures and a lack of summer rain, cover cropping is infeasiblein Western Australia’s north-central and north-eastern low-rainfall zones, whereas in thesouth, where summers are relatively cooler, sowing cover crops may be opportunistic,depending on the frequency and intensity of summer rain events. Growers must balanceproﬁtability and long-term soil health beneﬁts when incorporating cover crops into theircropping programmes.2.1.3. Stubble RetentionRetaining stubble after harvest has numerous advantages, including reduced soil ero-sion and soil water run-off, returning nutrients to the soil, and increased carbon input andwater inﬁltration [ 99]. Wind erosion is a serious problem in Western Australia, particularlyin soils with fewer clay and silt particles, and can result in a 3% loss of carbon stocks up to a1 m soil depth [ 100]. In general, stubble retention has a greater impact on C build-up whencombined with other management practices [ 101]. Plant diversity inﬂuences the formationand accumulation of SOC through the decomposition and transformation of above- andbelow-ground plant litters [ 102]. Furthermore, the amount of carbon sequestered is affectedby the quality of the residue C input (C:N ratio). Stubble with a higher C:N ratio decom-poses slowly and thus adds more C to the soil, and vice versa. Horwath and Kuzyakov(2018) [ 103] proposed that N is required for SOC sequestration. A 50-year study on vertisolat the Hermitage in Queensland, Australia, found that stubble retention and N fertilisationimproved soil health and kept soil carbon levels stable [ 104]. The addition of N fertiliserto a system combining stubble retention and no tillage improved soil aggregate forma-tion, which inﬂuenced C sequestration [ 105,106] and microbial community structure [ 107],whereas other studies found insigniﬁcant effects on SOC [ 108,109]. Burning stubble harmsphysical, chemical, and biological properties, decreases SOM, and contributes to GHGemissions [ 110]. Fifty percent of WA growers burn narrow windrows to control weeds, andthis practice has been shown to deplete C stocks [ 111]. Over a 19-year period, no tillagecombined with stubble retention yielded 2–5% SOC compared to 1.5% with tillage andstubble burning [112].Another way to improve soil biodiversity and SOC is to use residue as a surfacemulch [ 113]. The effect of incorporating stubble on carbon sequestration potential rangesfrom large [ 114,115] to negligible [ 116] and is dependent on soil type. Clay soils withincorporated stubble sequester more C than sandy soils. A few studies have found thatwhen no tillage was combined with stubble retention, crop yield and SOC stocks increasedsigniﬁcantly [ 117,118]. There is little information available on the impact of stubble reten-tion on the yield of subsequent crops. Flower et al. (2017) [ 94] found that reducing cerealresidue by 40–66% had a beneﬁcial effect on wheat yield in years with high levels of cerealresidue but a negative or no effect in years with low residue levels.While stubble retention has been advocated to promote soil health, it can be detrimen-tal in terms of spreading stubble-borne diseases that impact crop production. However, thenegative consequences can be mitigated by implementing integrated disease managementapproaches.2.1.4. Crop Rotation and DiversityCrop rotation, also known as diversiﬁcation, is a centuries-old practice that improvesyield and proﬁt by providing nutritional beneﬁts and breaking the pest–disease–weed cycle.However, crop rotation as a practice reverted to monocultures in the middle of the lastcentury due to a heavy reliance on inorganic fertilisers and pesticides, improved crop vari-Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 10 of 41eties, and, in some cases, economic considerations. All of these eventually resulted in landdegradation and the loss of SOM [ 119]. Crop rotation is becoming increasingly recognisedfor its potential to improve soil quality [120], crop yield, and water use efﬁciency [121].Recent research has found that crop rotation improves soil functionality and SOC [ 122].Blair and Crocker (2000) [ 123], in a long-term experiment in New South Wales Australia,discovered that including some legume-based rotational crops increased the concentrationof labile carbon and potentially improved the soil structure. Another recent Australianstudy in NSW revealed that SOC was generally higher in native or grazing ﬁelds comparedto cultivated ﬁelds, while precipitation and land management on speciﬁc farms mayhave a role in SOC distribution [ 124]. The Mediterranean climate of Western Australia ischaracterised by high summer temperatures, irregular rainfall, and low cloud cover. Suchcircumstances will limit the soil’s ability to sequester carbon. Lopez-Bellido et al. [ 125],in a 29-year long-term experiment in a rainfed Mediterranean climate, demonstrated thatno tillage combined with legume crop rotation was critical to improving soil fertility andincreasing both C levels and its rate of accumulation by soil. A global meta-analysis of69 ﬁeld experiments consisting of 276 paired experiments compared C sequestration ratesin response to reduced tillage intensity or increased rotation complexity. A shift from CT toNT signiﬁcantly increased C sequestration, with crop rotation adding even more C [ 126].The SOC increase may be minimal or non-existent in the ﬁrst 2–5 years following a changein management practice, but that may be followed by a signiﬁcant increase in the next5–10 years [127,128].Deep-rooted perennials may beneﬁt from sequestering SOC at greater depths, es-pecially in marginally productive soils. Over a 22-year period, a comparison of SOCsequestration potential and stocks in tagasaste (a woody N-ﬁxing perennial) and annualcrops in high rainfall zones of WA revealed that tagasaste had a higher C sequestration rateand stock to a depth of 0.9 m [ 129]. In a study conducted in the Albany sand plain of West-ern Australia, Hoyle et al. [ 130] reported that the actual SOC was consistently highest inperennial pastures across all soil types. The main factors inﬂuencing SOC, which was higherin annual pastures than in mixed or continuous cropping, were soil depth and rainfall. Theyalso noted that the topsoil surface under perennial pastures is already saturated with SOC,and that even with a 30% decrease in rainfall in the future, any additional increase in SOCstorage capacity under mixed or continuous cropping would be in less than 0.1 m of thesoil surface. Cropping practices that include rotating with high-residue-producing crops,as well as maintaining surface residue cover and reducing tillage, can signiﬁcantly increaseSOC and N [ 131]. However, crop rotation had little effect on SOC in fertile soil of WA [ 111].Pulse crops contribute signiﬁcantly to biological nitrogen ﬁxation, and as a result improveSOC. However, the yield beneﬁt of wheat and pulse crop rotation is more dependent on thetype of pulse crop in rotation than SOC, because some pulse crops produce comparativelylower biomass and residue inputs [132].Sanderman [ 133] examined the C sequestration potential of Australian soils andconcluded that while management practices such as enhanced rotation, no till, and stubbleretention clearly increased SOC compared to conventional practices, SOC stocks decreasedover time, implying that the practices likely mitigated C losses rather than sequesteredadditional SOC.2.1.5. Rotational GrazingAnother popular RA practice is to integrate livestock to improve soil health anddiversify the income stream, despite the fact that livestock farming is widely blamedfor contributing to methane emissions [ 134]. To increase SOC and improve soil health,rotational grazing is preferred over continuous grazing [ 135–138]. Anecdotal evidencesuggests that rotational grazing may increase SOC in some grasslands, particularly in drierand warmer climates. According to reports, pasture management practices can increase soilcarbon stocks [ 139,140]. However, in south-eastern Australia, a survey using paired-sitesampling found no difference in SOC stocks in different pasture and management practices,Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 11 of 41with the exception of higher SOC in improved pastures, which the authors attributed tomethodological issues [ 141]. Sanderman et al. [ 142] discovered that rotational grazing hadlittle effect on SOC in a subsequent study in Southern Australia. Rotational grazing ofpastures, however, increased SOC in the 0–40 cm layer by about 25% more than no-tillﬁelds [134].In terms of increasing soil carbon and retaining N stocks, adaptive multi-paddockgrazing outperforms conventional grazing [ 143]. Light to moderate grazing has been shownto improve SOC and soil structure signiﬁcantly more than heavy grazing [ 144,145]. Theeffect of grazing intensity (GI) on extensively managed grasslands in various environmentsis poorly understood. A meta-analysis of 83 studies from around the world found thatthe impact of GI on SOC varied by climate zone and grass type, implying that grazingintensity should be optimised based on the regional climate [ 146]. A combination ofimproved grazing and biodiversity management practices can lead to a substantial amountof accumulated SOC in soil [ 147]. Similarly, a recent large-scale survey conducted across sixcontinents demonstrated that the intricate connection between grazing intensity and climatein drylands drives rates of carbon storage, organic matter deposition, and erosion [148].2.2. SOM-Mediated Improvement of Soil Moisture/Water UptakeSOM is well known for its functional beneﬁts, including increased soil water holdingcapacity (SWHC). However, reports on the role of SOC in increasing SWHC are inconsistent.Some studies have found little effect [ 149,150] or no effect [ 151,152], while others havefound signiﬁcant effects of increased SOC on soil WHC [ 153]. Most researchers associatethis property with soil texture. An increase in SOM was found to increase soil ﬁeld capacity(FC) more quickly in sand and silt loam croplands in the midwestern United States [ 154].Based on a meta-analysis, Rawls et al. [ 155] proposed that sandy soils were more sensitiveto changes in SOM at a low organic carbon content. Increasing soil carbon was shown toincrease soil water retention in sandy soils and decrease it in clayey soils. Interestingly,with high SOC, all soil types increased water retention as SOC increased.Organic carbon has a favourable effect on soil water holding capacity, but the formsof carbon responsible for this effect, as well as their synergistic behaviour with other soilfeatures, remain unknown [ 154]. According to Jong et al. [ 156], increased SOM/SOC isassociated with increased soil water content. At ﬁeld capacity, 1% SOM added 1.5% moremoisture by volume [ 157,158]. Emerson and McGary [ 159] reported that a gram of extracarbon resulted in a 50% increase in water due to the binding of soil particles with organiccarbon exudates from ectotrophic mycorrhiza, which resulted in a change in pore size andwater retention at 10 kPa suction.According to a recent study, while an increase in available water holding capacity(AWHC) was more prominent in sandy soils, a 1% increase in SOM increased AWHC byup to 1.5% depending on soil texture and minerology [ 160]. Minasny and McBrateny [ 161]concluded that increasing SOC had a minor effect on soil water retention, and a 1% increasein SOC caused a 1.16% volumetric increase in water retention. Sandy soils were moreresponsive to increased SOC, whereas clayey soils showed no effect. Some researcherscontend that increasing SOC through simple changes in management practices can increaseSWHC; however, such improvement is limited by soil type [ 162,163]. In sandy soil, forexample, a 1% increase in SOC had a signiﬁcant impact on SWHC [ 164]. Currently, noSOM threshold has been established due to diverse soils, different growing conditionsand management practices, and different types and levels of land degradation. However,Oldﬁeld et al. [ 165] recently deﬁned an SOM threshold (up to 5%) associated with increasedwheat productivity under controlled greenhouse conditions, implying that developingoptimal SOM targets is critical for improving water retention and soil fertility.A variety of factors inﬂuence soil water holding capacity, including soil bulk density,inﬁltration rate, and crop residues. Soil aggregation, porosity, and inﬁltration rates canbe improved by soil fauna and retaining residues on the soil surface [ 166–168]. Calegariet al. [ 169] demonstrated that better physical characteristics, conferred by crop rotationSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 12 of 41and no tillage, boosted soil water inﬁltration from 20 mm/h with conventional tillage to45 mm/h with no tillage (soybean–wheat system). Increased water inﬁltration combinedwith increased organic matter content has a positive impact on soil water storage, andmixing organic matter with soil mineral content signiﬁcantly improves the water holdingcapacity of soil. More water can be stored, especially in topsoil, which has a higher organicmatter content. A 9-year study involving 17 long-term experiments found that addingorganic amendments improved available water and soil properties, and the quality oforganic C was an important factor [ 170]. Li et al. [ 171] recently studied the beneﬁts ofearthworm casts on soil water retention and other properties and concluded that the useof small earthworm particles improved soil water retention and decreased soil evapora-tion. Earthworms were found to increase the percentage of water stable aggregates andwater holding capacity, but the amount varied depending on the earthworm species [ 172].Another study found that combining corn straw with chemical fertiliser increased thesoil water storage capacity of aeolian sandy soil [ 173]. Reduced aggregate stability due todecreased SOC can reduce soil water retention [ 174]. Cropping practices that increase soilorganic carbon increase the soil’s capacity to store moisture [175].2.3. Increased Soil Biodiversity and Microbial FunctionSoil biodiversity, which covers a wide range of living organisms, including microbesand meso-, macro-, and megafauna, plays an important role in ecosystem functioning dueto their complex interactions [ 176,177]. RA practices emphasise improving the functionalityof soil microbes in order to reclaim degraded soil fertility (70% globally), grow the healthiest,most nutritious food possible, and combat climate change [ 178]. The soil microbiota isessential for organic matter breakdown, nutrient cycling, and soil fertilisation [ 19,179].Soil microbes are also essential for the growth of a healthy soil structure. Soil resilience isan excellent indicator of an ecosystem’s overall functioning. Soils with higher microbialdiversity are more resistant and resilient to disturbances than soils with lower microbialdiversity [180].Prior to the development of next-generation sequencing techniques, the soil microbialcommunity was described as a “black box” [ 181–183]. Understanding the structure ofmicrobial communities is critical for unravelling microbe-driven biogeochemical cycles.It is now widely acknowledged that functional diversity patterns, rather than taxonomicrichness, may allow more robust testing of biodiversity theories [ 184]. However, challengesin characterising microbial function remain due to the lack of a suitable methodology fordistinguishing microbial functions, as most studies to date have focused on communitystructure rather than function. New tools such as meta-transcriptomics/metabolomics willimprove our understanding of microbial functions in diverse ecosystems.Microorganisms account for 80–90% of total soil metabolism and therefore are essentialin the biochemical transformation of organic matter and nutrient bioavailability [ 185]. Intemperate grasslands, 1–5% of C and N in soil is stored in living microbial biomass, whichis estimated to be 1–2 t ha 1[180,186]. Plant-associated microbiota are well known fortheir ability to mobilise nutrients that are not readily available to plants, such as inorganicphosphate and iron, through solubilisation, mineralisation, or excretion via iron-chelatingsiderophores [187].Agricultural intensiﬁcation is one of the leading causes of soil biodiversity loss and re-duced food-web complexity among the various human-induced changes [ 188–190]. Severalsoil microbiological parameters, such as microbial biomass carbon, extracellular enzymes,fungi-to-bacteria ratio (F:B), and basal respiration rate, have been proposed as potentialindicators of soil quality [ 191]. Intensively managed farmed soils frequently have a lowerF:B biomass ratio compared to more extensively managed soils. This phenomenon isthought to be due to tillage, high rates of fertilisation, and a lower C:N ratio favouringbacteria [ 192,193]. Because fungi have a higher C:N ratio and produce complex enzymes tobreak down lignin, they have greater potential to sequester carbon. Lower fungal biomassand ratio are generally associated with lower soil C sequestration capacity [194,195].Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 13 of 412.3.1. Role of Microbes in Stable Organic Carbon FractionIt is widely assumed that plant-derived C accounts for the majority of stable carbonfractions. Living microbial biomass accounts for 5% of SOC, resulting in a minimal con-tribution to sequestered carbon [ 196,197]. Microbes, however, have been shown to playan important role in sequestering C into stable soil C pools [ 198,199]. There is mountingevidence that microbial necromass contributes signiﬁcantly to soil stable organic carbon. Arecent meta-analysis of 148 peer-reviewed journal articles concluded that microbial necro-mass contributes nearly half of the SOC in croplands, which is stimulated by temperatureand soil pH [ 200]. One of the parameters used in modelling long-term SOC storage ismicrobial carbon use efﬁciency (CUE), with high and low CUE indicating the increasedand decreased C sequestration potential of soil, respectively [ 193]. Plant species richnesshas been associated with rapid microbial development and turnover, resulting in morenecromass and higher SOC [ 201]. Kallenbach et al. [ 202] used a model soil system todemonstrate that soil microbes produce stable and chemically varied SOM by utilisingsimple C substrates. While the effect was more pronounced in soils with higher fungalabundance, clay minerology had no effect on SOM accumulation and stabilisation. Micro-bial necromass has been shown to contribute more than 50% of total SOC in temperateagriculture topsoil, implying that good management practices that promote microbialbiomass are critical for maintaining healthy soils [ 203]. However, due to the limitations ofcurrent SOM estimation methods, the relative contributions of plant- and microbe-derivedrecalcitrant carbon fractions are debatable [ 204]. Microbial biomass and necromass appearto be key factors in regulating soil carbon storage; however, the mechanism of necromasscarbon stabilising to stable soil carbon is not fully understood [205].2.3.2. Nutrient Cycling and AcquisitionMicrobial CUE is important to C cycling. Soil microbial community structure andbiodiversity have been linked to a variety of important functions in agricultural systems,including plant productivity, C and N cycling regulation, and positive effects on livestockproduction and yield [ 18,206,207]. C and nutrient cycling are heavily reliant on microbialcommunities and are inﬂuenced by both biotic and abiotic factors, which can have eitherpositive or negative consequences [ 208,209]. Abiotic factors such as precipitation and soilmoisture can alter the bacteria–fungi ratio and decomposition of organic matter [210].The majority of nutrients in SOM are derived from mineralisation and become avail-able to plants during decomposition [ 158]. Mycorrhizal fungi have been well recognisedfor their role in C, N, and P cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shownto contribute signiﬁcantly to Zn uptake in cereals, and the mycorrhizal pathway of Znuptake is dependent on plant species and available soil zinc [ 211]. Several Australianstudies, however, indicate that AMF contribute little to crop nutrition and productivity inAustralian cropping zones, possibly due to the low soil temperature (10C) in the southernregion [ 212]. The role of microbes in nutrient uptake is further discussed below. Conserva-tion agricultural practices such as minimum tillage and mulching should be encouraged,because they help to establish AMF communities and the associated agroecosystem ser-vices, whereas inorganic fertilisation inhibits AMF colonisation. Mulching and minimumtillage were found to increase maize root colonisation, which increased the uptake of moreP and N from the soil, resulting in better maize growth [213].NitrogenNitrogen is the most important macronutrient for food crop production. In croplands,90–95% of N is bound to organic matter, with the remainder available as ammonium, nitrate,or nitrite. N is a component of nucleic acids and proteins, and is involved in a variety ofplant metabolic processes. N deﬁciency in crops can result from losses due to leaching,volatilisation, surface runoff, denitriﬁcation, and the plant canopy, although N is usuallysupplied in sufﬁcient quantities to compensate for such losses. Nitrogen mineralisation is acomplex process involving diverse microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes)Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 14 of 41that produce nitrates from various substrates such as plant residues, humus, microbialnecromass, and manure. However, the rate of mineralisation varies depending on soil type,SOM, crop residue type, microbial communities, and environmental and climatic factors indifferent ﬁelds. Recently, it has been hypothesised that global soil microbial biomass, totalnitrogen, and mean annual precipitation all have a positive impact on N mineralisation,indicating the importance of microbes in determining N availability [214].1. N 2-Fixing BacteriaBiological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) is the ﬁrst step in the nitrogen cycle, in which aspecial class of N-ﬁxing bacteria convert atmospheric N 2into usable compounds. Therole of nitrogen-ﬁxing organisms (rhizobia) in symbiosis with leguminous plants is wellunderstood. Biological nitrogen ﬁxation is carried out by various groups of bacteria,archaea, and some fungal and algal species [ 215]. A symbiotic relationship exists betweenleguminous plants and N 2-ﬁxing bacteria in biological N 2ﬁxation. Through photosynthesis,legumes provide energy and carbon to rhizobia, and rhizobia provide nitrogen to hostsin the form of ammonium [ 216]. Rhizobacteria colonise host plant roots by responding toroot exudates via chemotaxis. Grain and forage legumes are frequently used in sustainablefarming systems to correct N fertility issues if crop residues are incorporated into thesoil after harvest [ 217,218]. The environment has a signiﬁcant impact on the efﬁciencyof biological N ﬁxation. High temperature, water stress, and soil acidity/salinity allhave a negative impact on the BNF process. A recent meta-analysis found that elevatedtemperature and precipitation affected BNF in mid- to high-altitude biomes in responseto nutrient enrichment [ 219]. To address the environmental concerns associated withBNF efﬁciency, management practices such as no or minimal tillage and cover crops arerecommended [220,221].2. Free-Living N 2-Fixing BacteriaThere are some free-living organisms in the soil that ﬁx nitrogen from the atmosphere.The presence of free-living N 2ﬁxation (FLNF) bacteria is dependent on the availabilityof C from root exudates, which is required for the energy demands of N 2ﬁxation [ 222].While diazotrophs achieve nearly 80% of biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) in symbiosiswith legumes, free-living soil bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas ,Azospirillum , and Azotobacter )can ﬁx considerable amounts of nitrogen (0 to 60 kg N ha 1year 1), particularly underorganic crop production [ 223]. In general, symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxers ﬁx more nitrogen thanfree-living and associative nitrogen ﬁxers [224].FLNF bacteria are common in agricultural soils in Southern Australia. Populations aregenerally higher in clay soils than sandy soils, and they predominate in cereal paddocks.Signiﬁcant N ﬁxation occurs in areas of NSW with signiﬁcant summer rainfall; however,low summer soil moisture (such as in WA) limits FLNF populations [ 225]. In tropical forests,free-living N ﬁxation was found to be suppressed by N fertilisation and stimulated by Mofertilisation and P additions, implying that nutrient limitation of free-living N ﬁxation is acommon phenomenon [ 226]. FLNF bacteria and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria isolatedfrom the cotton rhizosphere were found to increase cotton growth by producing plant-growth-promoting hormones [ 227]. Gupta and Roper (2010) [ 228] concluded that the abilityof aggregates to provide protection against biocidal exposure within the soil matrix wasrelated to the survival of FLNF bacteria in different soils.Kennedy et al. [ 229] reported that FLNF bacteria improved plant growth and yield in avariety of Australian ﬁeld crops by increasing N supply in the soil, consequently reducingthe need for fertiliser application. FLNF organisms have recently gained prominence inarid climates due to their role in soil development. FLNF bacteria and some archaea species,in particular, have been found to carry nifH genes from the rhizospheres of plants growingin harsh conditions such as extreme water stress, extreme temperature, high salinity, andlow-nutrient deserts [ 230–232]. Recently, two strains of free-living diazotrophic bacteriawere isolated from salt-affected soils of Syria that may have potential for the developmentof novel biotechnological products for dryland agriculture [ 233]. Some summer-activeSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 15 of 41perennial grasses growing in low-fertility sandy soils in Southern Australia’s Mediterraneanregion have been shown to support FLNF diazotrophs in the plant rhizosphere, leaves, androots, with N-ﬁxing potential ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg N/kg/day [234].Non-symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation is likely to be greater with the use of NT practicesthan in cultivated soils due to the aggregate stability under no-till, which is required formaintaining low oxygen tension and protecting against microcidal exposure [ 228,235,236].Crop rotation and stubble retention are two other management strategies that can promotenon-symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation, whereas certain fungicides and herbicides, particularlyglyphosate, can harm non-symbiotic nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria. Certain crop cultivars aregenetically superior in their interactions with N-ﬁxing bacteria [ 237]. The technologyfor the use of non-symbiotic inoculations may become available in the future, and couldpotentially reduce the input of synthetic fertilisers. Signiﬁcant research is being conductedto develop biological N ﬁxation in cereals. Although N-ﬁxing bacteria have been isolatedfrom some cereal crops, the amount of nitrogen obtained was insufﬁcient to meet the needsof the plant and did not match that obtained with chemical fertilisers [ 238]. Developingcereal crops for nitrogen ﬁxation requires a greater understanding of the microbial traitsthat promote plant colonisation, persistence, and competitiveness.Phosphorus (P)Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant growth. As an important componentof phospholipids and nucleic acids, it plays a major role in various plant biochemical pro-cesses, including energy transfer, photosynthesis, reproduction, and nodule developmentin legumes. Despite P being abundant, P deﬁciency is common in soils all over the worlddue to the low concentration of readily available P in the form of orthophosphate [ 239].Plant–microorganism interactions enhance the uptake of available P or access to previouslyunavailable P sources in P-deﬁcient conditions. AMF, as well as a variety of bacteria andfungi, can solubilise insoluble mineral phosphate complexes, including calcium phosphatecomplexes. P-solubilizing bacteria and fungi account for 1–50% and 0.1–0.5%, respec-tively, of the total microbial population in soil, thus P-solubilizing bacteria outnumberP-solubilizing fungi by a factor of 2–150 [240–242].The role of AMF in increasing P availability in plants is well established [ 243,244].Mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to be responsible for up to 75% of plant P acquisitionon an annual basis [ 245]. Extensive research has been conducted on the solubilization ofmineral phosphates by microorganisms other than AMF, and the rate of mineralisationvaries depending on the soil type [ 246,247]. Several bacterial genera, including Pseudomonas ,Burkholderia ,Bacillus ,Rhizobia , and Micrococcus , have the capacity to solubilise inorganicP [248]. Many soil fungi, such as Penicillium ,Trichoderma , and Aspergillus , can solubiliseinsoluble phosphates or help plants acquire P and are thus used in commercial formulations.The mechanisms of microbial P solubilisation include chelation, organic acid production,proton extrusion, exopolysaccharide production, and siderophore and enzyme productionand depend on the fungal isolates and types of P sources used [ 249,250]. Fungi are thoughtto be more effective than bacteria at solubilising inorganic phosphate because they canmove more freely through the soil and release a variety of organic acids [251].Potassium (K)Potassium is the third essential element for plant growth and development. It regulatesseveral plant functions, in particular stomatal movement. It plays an important role inpathogen suppression and drought tolerance. Because of its insoluble form, K is generallyunavailable to plants in most agricultural soils, resulting in K deﬁciency. Aside fromusing K-based fertilisers, introducing certain microbes can facilitate K uptake through Kmineralisation. Several K-solubilizing bacterial ( Bacillus ,Acidothiobacillus ,Pseudomonas , andBurkholderia ) and fungal ( Aspergillus, Glomus, and Penicillium ) genera have been shown tosolubilise K and make it available to plants [252].Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 16 of 41Sulphur (S)The majority of sulphur in soil is bound to organic molecules, with only a small fractionof total sulphur available for plant uptake in the form of inorganic sulphate. Consequently,sulphur deﬁciency is commonly observed in crop species. Several bacteria, prokaryotes,and fungi are known to oxidise elemental sulphur to form sulphates that can be readilyused by plants [ 253,254]. Some crop plants, such as canola, have high requirements forsulphur. To alleviate sulphur deﬁciency in canola, some microbial formulations are appliedwith elemental sulphur [255].3. Pest, Pathogen, and Weed Control/SuppressionCrop pathogens/pests/weeds cause signiﬁcant production and economic losses world-wide. Climate change is likely to exacerbate the occurrence and severity of certain diseasesand pests, particularly those that thrive in warmer climates. Elevated temperature and CO 2,humidity, and nutritional status all have an impact on plant immune responses [256–259] .Certain agricultural practices, such as monocultures, promote pests and disease. To reducesubsequent losses, integrated disease and pest management is frequently recommended.Traditional plant disease/pest control using fungicides/insecticides is one of the recom-mended strategies, but it has several limitations. Pesticide overuse in recent years hasresulted in pesticide resistance, in addition to pollution and negative effects on soil mi-crobiota. Consequently, there is worldwide interest among researchers in developingenvironmentally safe and sustainable disease control solutions.Several soil-borne microbes, including bacteria and fungi, have been identiﬁed as pestand disease suppressors. Microbial biological control agents protect crops from pathogensthrough a variety of mechanisms, including competition, hyperparasitism, and antibiosis.Several beneﬁcial soil bacteria, fungi, viruses, and microfauna have been reported aspotential candidates for biological control and ecological balance restoration [ 260]. Babikovaet al. [ 261] discovered that mycorrhizal fungi, via their mycorrhizal network, can transmitdefence signals from aphid-attacked plants to unaffected plants, providing an early warningto intact plants. Manipulating plant microbiomes to make plants more resilient to pestsand diseases has recently gained traction. However, because the research is still in itsearly stages, a collaborative cross-disciplinary effort is required to develop and realisethe full potential of this technology in diverse farming systems. There is evidence thatmanagement practices such as reduced tillage, intercropping, cover cropping, and the useof organic fertilisers increase predatory and beneﬁcial insects, thereby providing naturalpest control [262–265].Weeds are a serious problem in WA farming systems, and chemical weed controlis heavily used. Weed control in no-till and other regenerative farming practices will beextremely difﬁcult unless new non-chemical methods are developed quickly. In Europe,research is being conducted to ﬁnd sustainable non-chemical solutions for weed controlin arable crops [ 266]. Chemical weed control is not only expensive, but it also has seri-ous issues in terms of weed species developing resistant populations. Integrated weedmanagement (IWM), which combines physical, cultural, genetic, biological, and chemicalapproaches, is the way forwards for long-term weed control.Allelopathy is another approach that could be used to reduce weedicide use. Soilmicrobes such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have the ability to reduce theweed seed bank [ 267,268]. However, one of the major drawbacks of using microbes forweed control is that the majority of microbes are pathogens common to both weeds andcrop plants. Furthermore, inconsistencies in ﬁeld efﬁcacy and product maintenance aresigniﬁcant barriers to developing bio-herbicides [ 268]. Due to their early vigour, cropvarieties with enhanced weed-competitiveness traits have a chance of being developed.Some wheat cultivars with such characteristics can help reduce weed populations and theneed for chemical applications [ 269–271]. Recently, a new technology for post-emergenceweed control in cereals has been developed by combining digital image analysis withautomatic harrowing intensity adjustment [272].Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 17 of 414. Mechanisms Involved in Improved Microbial Functions4.1. Liquid Carbon PathwayProponents of RA have suggested that the liquid carbon pathway (LCP) comprisesa 420 million-year-old symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and 90% of allplants. Plants produce excess carbohydrates (simple plant sugars), which they exude intothe soil to feed the fungi. In exchange, mycorrhizal fungi mine and transport nutrients andwater back to their host. AMF can gain access to nutrients and water that larger plant rootscannot. The liquid carbon pathway is regarded as the primary mechanism of long-termsoil carbon sequestration. According to RA advocates, pasture soils with healthy LCPassociations increase the amount of carbon sequestered beneath the grass every year. Somepastures are currently sequestering up to 32 tonnes of CO 2per hectare per year. This isdue to glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), which is produced in the hyphal cell walls ofmycorrhizal fungi and acts as a carbon storehouse, inﬂuencing aggregate formation andstabilisation and contributing to soil carbon sequestration [ 273,274]. Another study foundthat roots and rhizodeposition products are highly efﬁcient C sources for the formation ofparticulate- and mineral-associated organic carbon [ 275]. This study also suggested thatSOC in degraded croplands can be effectively increased by including plants with higher Callocation to below-ground biomass.Our understanding of the importance of microbes in carbon sequestration is growing.Liang et al. [ 199] proposed a microbial carbon pump (MCP), a conceptual framework fordemonstrating soil C storage mechanisms by microorganisms. According to this model,microbes actively pump carbon into the soil via the metabolic processing and depositionof microbial necromass into stable C fractions. Zhu et al. [ 276] recently demonstratedthat microbial necromass was the dominant contributor to recently accumulated SOC inperennial energy crops, implying that diverse perennial crops are important in stimulatingsoil MCP .Root exudates play a key role in shaping microbial communities in the rhizosphere,and the rate of root exudation is inﬂuenced by the presence of microbes in the rhizo-sphere [ 277]. In young seedlings, the transfer of photosynthates to below-ground com-ponents, including the rhizosphere and roots, ranges from 20–50% [ 278]. Using isotopetracer studies, Villarino et al. [ 275] demonstrated that rhizodeposition was highly efﬁcientin the formation of mineral-associated organic carbon (46%) compared to below- andabove-ground plant inputs, whereas root biomass contributed 19% to the formation ofparticulate organic matter (POC), suggesting that growing plants with higher exudationmay increase C stocks. Root exudates are also known to stimulate some soil-borne fungiand can thus negatively impact plant production [ 279]. However, root exudates recruitbeneﬁcial microorganisms that provide robust plant protection and counteract the negativeeffects of pathogens [280,281].4.2. Improved Uptake of WaterThe highly branched hyphae of AMF are about 2 m in diameter, can move throughsoil particles less than 30 m in diameter, and can access water in either an active or passivemanner [ 282]. AM fungi facilitate water uptake through a variety of mechanisms, includingchanges in soil properties, stomatal conductance, and hydraulic conductance. However,the role of hyphae in water uptake is still debated, with some studies supporting theircontribution and others claiming that they play a minor role [ 283]. Under limited moistureconditions, the roots of AM plants can increase apoplastic water ﬂow and switch betweendifferent water transport pathways [ 284]. Kaya et al. [ 285] and Ruiz-Lozano and Aroca(2010) [ 286] reported increased water use efﬁciency due to mycorrhiza. The number ofexternal hyphae and the frequency of root colonisation have been linked to water uptakeefﬁciency of AM fungi [ 287]. Kakouridis et al. [ 288] recently demonstrated that watertransport by AM fungi is extra cytoplasmic, and their results indicated that AM fungiaccounted for 46.2% of the water transpired by AM plants.Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 18 of 414.2.1. Drought ToleranceDeclining rainfall due to climate change is having an adverse impact on crop pro-ductivity world-wide. Breeding for drought tolerance is the key to reducing this impact;however, breeding programs are complex and it may take several years before drought-resistant/-tolerant crop varieties become commercially available. Furthermore, plant ﬁtnessresponses to drought have been linked to changes in below-ground microbial communitiesrather than plant trait evolution [ 289]. There is growing interest in using plant-associatedmicrobial communities to manage various abiotic stresses in crops, including droughttolerance. Drought causes the reshaping of plant-associated microbiomes, which beneﬁtsplants by allowing them to better cope with moisture stress conditions [290].Currently, studies are being conducted to assess the ability of plant-associated mi-crobiomes to alleviate drought stress in agricultural crops [ 291]. Drought induced theenrichment of Actinobacteria in a grassland biome, and these bacteria are more abun-dant in the root endosphere than in the surrounding soil under drought conditions [ 292].Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have also been linked to increased droughttolerance in plants under water stress conditions [ 293–296]. Drought-tolerant microbialconsortia (mixtures of beneﬁcial bacteria and AM fungi) are likely to provide a solution todrought stress in the face of climate change [297]. AM fungi have been shown to improveplant drought tolerance by improving osmotic adjustments in the roots, thus increasing thewater potential of the leaves [ 298,299]. Drought tolerance in rice and maize by AM fungiis attributed to the increased AMF colonisation and conversion of putrescine to aminobutyric acid, respectively [300,301].4.2.2. Nutrient UptakeThe interaction of plant roots and soil microorganisms inﬂuences nutrient availabil-ity and uptake [ 302–304]. Factors that improve P and N nutrient acquisition are highlydesirable for plant growth and development. Certain root characteristics, such as rootelongation, high root-to-shoot biomass, increased root branching and angle, root hair andproteoid roots contribute to P uptake [ 305–307]. A rhizophagy cycle is proposed for nutrientacquisition in plant roots by symbiotic bacteria and fungi, in which plant nutrients capturedby microbes are released into the roots via an oxidative process [ 308]. Root exudates areessential for making P available to plants and increasing microbial activity [309].Microbial-mediated plant growth has been attributed to hormonal signalling in plants,outcompeting pathogenic strains and increasing the bioavailability of soil nutrients [ 310].Several microbial processes depolymerise and mineralise organic N, P , and S, and releasetheir inorganic forms into the soil [ 245]. The ﬂavonoid pathway, via root exudates, isimportant in legume rhizobia-mediated N ﬁxation [ 310]. Furthermore, ﬂavonoids havebeen linked to hyphal branching and, as a result, improved nutrient uptake by mycorrhizalfungi [ 311,312]. According to some metagenomics studies, certain microbial genes are moreabundant in soils with lower fertiliser inputs [ 313]. However, little is known about whichspeciﬁc microbial strains contribute signiﬁcantly to plant nutrition and which do not.Plant growth can be hindered by a lack of nutrients. Because the crops grown in WAfarming systems require high soil fertility, high doses of fertilisers are applied to meet theirnutritional demand. Nutrient uptake by plant roots in nutrient-deﬁcient soil is generallythought to be low [ 314] and is more pronounced in the rhizosphere than in the outsidezone [302].4.2.3. Role of Soil Microbes in Enhanced Aggregates, Plant Growth, and PhotosynthesisSoil structure is central to crop management and sustainable crop production. Sand,silt, and clay particles of varying sizes combine to form micro- (250 m) and macro-(>250 m diameter) aggregates. It is surmised that soil microbes, including bacteria andfungi, inﬂuence aggregate formation by producing extracellular polysaccharides that bindsoil particles [ 315]. Microbial community structure is thought to play an important role inthe formation of different aggregate types. Certain soil bacterial taxa (e.g., Rubrobacteria )Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 19 of 41have been shown to have a high correlation with macro-aggregates [ 316]. Two mainmechanisms by which fungi help form soil aggregates are suggested [ 317]. In the directmechanism, fungal hyphae entrap soil particles and force them together. In the indirectmechanism, AM fungi produce glomalin and other fungi and bacteria produce mucilageand polysaccharides that bind the soil particles to form aggregates. In a study by Tanget al. [ 318], fungi were found to form large aggregates, and fungicide application reducedaggregate stability hence conﬁrming the role of fungi in aggregate formation. There is littleinformation on the mechanisms underlying root-exudate-mediated C dynamics and theireffects on root aggregation at different depths. Under artiﬁcial experimental conditions,the addition of more exudates resulted in a shift in the microbial community in favour offungi that promoted macro-aggregates, with a notable effect in C-deﬁcient soils [ 319]. Rilliget al. [ 320] proposed that glomalin may play an important role in the hyphal-mediatedprocess of soil aggregate stabilisation for a water-stable aggregate size of 1–2 mm.To improve plant growth under biotic and abiotic stress conditions, soil microbes usea variety of molecular and physiological mechanisms. PGPR facilitate plant growth by reg-ulating various growth hormones or improving nutrient availability and acquisition. Suchbeneﬁcial effects are thought to be more pronounced in plants growing in poor soil condi-tions [ 321]. To suppress crop pathogens, some PGPR produce volatile organic compounds(VOCs) and other antimicrobial compounds, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) [ 322,323].The inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase and other metalloenzymes involved in respirationand other cellular processes is attributed to HCN’s toxicity in terms of suppressing plantpathogens [ 324]. Endophytic microbes residing in plant roots inﬂuence plant growth bysending chemical signals to above-ground plant parts [325].Under physiological stress conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage thephotosynthetic capacity of crop plants. Several researchers are looking into the role ofmicrobes in enhancing photosynthesis under stress conditions. AM fungi were foundto inhibit chlorophyll loss in watermelon under water-stress conditions [ 326]. Likewise,other endophytic genera, including Piriformospora and Trichoderma , have been reportedto reduce the loss of photosynthetic capacity of crop plants during salinity stress andpathogen infection. Some phosphate-solubilising bacteria have been shown to increasephotosynthetic capacity in Cameline oleifera and rice [327,328].5. Effect of Management Practices on Microbial ActivityAgriculture intensiﬁcation reduces the functional groups of soil biota and jeopardisessoil functions, reducing agricultural productivity [ 329]. Conservation agricultural practicessuch as crop rotation, manuring, reduced tillage, and cover crops improve or maintainsoil quality for sustainable crop production by regulating microbial communities [ 330,331].Nutrient management and long crop rotations, however, may have a direct impact oncommunity structure and the associated ecosystem services across croplands [331].Crop rotations that include cover crops and incorporate organic amendments improvesoil fertility by increasing soil C, N, and microbial biomass, beneﬁting agroecosystems inthe longer term. One of the most serious consequences of reduced crop rotation is theloss of biodiversity. A meta-analysis of 122 studies on the effects of crop rotation on soilbiological properties found that rotation signiﬁcantly increased the soil microbial biomassC and N by 20.7 and 26.1%, respectively [ 78]. Some research has found that diversiﬁed croprotation improves plant resource use efﬁciency by increasing microbial functions [332].When cover cropping is combined with other agricultural practices, the soil micro-biome can become more robust [ 333]. Combining crop residues from mixed species andmonocultures with agricultural soil was shown to stimulate microbial diversity and func-tion, and the nutrient content of the cover crops was indicated as the main driver of nutrientrelease [ 334]. Diverse cover crops have been shown to increase microbial activity in sandysoils, with a long-term positive impact on yield [ 335]. It has been demonstrated in severalstudies that cover crops increase microbial biomass and enzyme activity [ 179,336–338].However, Kim et al. [ 333] cautioned that the increased microbial activity could be due to in-Sustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 20 of 41creased microbial abundance or an increased per capita enzyme production rate. In contrast,some studies found no strong relationship between species diversity and ecosystem func-tions [ 339,340]. Because speciﬁc cover crop species can increase the abundance of particularmicrobial groups [ 179], different combinations of species can be used to tailor the microbialcommunity composition in order to achieve the desired microbial functions [ 341]. Diversi-ﬁed catch crop mixtures were found to improve cropping system, C cycling efﬁciency andhave a positive impact on microbial abundance, activity, and diversity [342].Retention of crop residues signiﬁcantly increases soil microbial diversity and func-tion [ 343]. In the low-fertility sandy–loam soils of WA, stubble retention increased microbialbiomass, function, and enzyme activity but had no effect on microbial diversity [ 344]. No-tillage farming practices, combined with crop rotation and residue retention, have beenshown to increase microbial biomass and physiological diversity [ 345]. Soil microorganismsregulate mineralisation and organic matter stability by producing a variety of extracellu-lar enzymes [ 346]. Cropping practices have varying effects on soil enzyme production;for example, enzyme activity can be increased with no tillage but be unaffected by croprotation in the short-term [ 347]. A few studies have found that the use of cover cropsincreases microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme activity, and glomalin [ 348]. Continuousapplication of inorganic fertilisers may be harmful to soil enzyme activity and biologicalhealth in the long run [ 349]. Because of their low C/N ratio, legume cover crops provide asigniﬁcant amount of biologically ﬁxed N to primary crops and decompose easily.Increased microbial biomass and activity with various cropping practices has beenreported [ 350–354]. Microbial biomass in no-till soils contain more nutrients than microbialbiomass in conventionally tilled soils, implying greater nutrient cycling and ﬂuxes throughmicrobial biomass without tilling [355].In a Mediterranean climate, the combination of no tillage and liming has been shownto increase mycorrhizal colonisation, N content, and biomass of a mixed oat and vetchcrop, possibly due to increased nutrient efﬁciency via crop–microbe interactions [ 356].Reduced tillage, residue retention, and cropping promote higher microbial biomass, whilecover cropping has variable effects [ 357–360]. Tillage generally accelerates crop residuedecomposition and organic matter, resulting in decreased overall soil resource quality [ 359].A higher fungi-to-bacteria biomass ratio has been linked to quantitative and quali-tative improvements in SOM when no-till practices are used [ 361]. Furthermore, fungal-dominated communities are expected to have a slower rate of C turnover than bacterial-dominated communities due to their higher-efﬁciency C use. No-till farming systemswere found to have higher soil carbon and a higher fungi-to-bacteria ratio compared toconventional farming systems [ 362]. The transition from direct drilled to conventional orstubble-incorporated practices resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in organic C, total N, soilwater holding capacity, microbial biomass, and fungi-to-bacteria ratio respiration in the top0–5 cm of red duplex soils in NSW [363].5.1. Role of Biofertilisers and BiostimulantsFertilisers are used in almost all cropping systems to meet the nutrient demands ofgrowing plants. There is increasing concern that excessive fertiliser use is contributing tosoil degradation, soil and water pollution, and GHG emissions. Global research effortsare currently focused on developing microbial-based nutrient solutions that can replacesynthetic fertilisers and pesticides. Due to growing concerns about the health effects offarm chemicals, the use of biofertilisers and biostimulants in agriculture has gained tractionin recent years. Furthermore, consumer demand for clean, safe, and nutrient-dense foodis increasing.Plant biostimulants derived from natural materials are thought to be environmentallyfriendly and innovative alternatives to chemicals/inorganic fertilisers for increasing cropproduction by modifying physiological processes such as nutrient use efﬁciency and toler-ance to abiotic and biotic stresses [ 364,365]. While there is no agreement on the deﬁnitionof “biostimulants”, the EU recently deﬁned the term according to speciﬁc agriculturalSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 21 of 41functions involving various natural compounds such as humic and fulvic acid, plant-and animal-derived hydrolysates, seaweed extracts, silicon, and microorganisms such asAM fungi and N-ﬁxing bacteria [365}. The term “biological amendments” encompassesbiostimulants, organic amendments, biological inocula, and composts [366].Beneﬁcial microbes are of particular importance and will almost certainly play a sig-niﬁcant role in revolutionising agriculture over the next several decades. There is now asigniﬁcant resurgence of interest in developing microbial-based agricultural products, andall of the major agribiotech companies are investing in the development of biological ap-plications. According to a recent Meticulous Research report [ 367], the global biopesticidemarket is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.1% from 2019 to 2025,reaching USD 10.24 billion. Signiﬁcant research efforts are being directed towards develop-ing environmentally friendly biocontrol strategies for crop disease and pest management.There are also numerous scientiﬁc publications that describe the roles of various soil andaerial microbes in promoting plant growth, facilitating/improving nutrient acquisition byplants, and providing tolerance to moisture stress, salinity, and various pests and diseases.The effectiveness of a biostimulant is determined by the type of biostimulant and the crop.A recent greenhouse study reported that marine and fungal biostimulants increased grainbiomass and positively impacted grain protein in durum wheat [368].There are around 21 commercially available rhizobacterial-based plant-growth-promotingproducts for horticultural and field crops, including cereals, in various parts of the world [ 74].In Australia, a biostimulant coating called FerticoatTMhas recently been developed toimprove fertiliser use efﬁciency. This product can be mixed with UAN or applied withgranular fertiliser. Certain biostimulants have been shown to improve food nutritionalquality, especially in horticultural crops [ 369]. The use of an amino acid biostimulant wasreported to increase soybean yield and antioxidant potential [ 370]. Similarly, in winterwheat, some amino-acid-based biostimulants have been shown to increase nutrient content,particularly copper (31–50%), sodium (35–43%), calcium (4.3–7.9%), and molybdenum(3.9–16%) [ 371]. Zinc foliar spray combined with the biostimulant fulvic acid increasedgrain Zn content in wheat grains by 16% [ 372]. The demand for biostimulants will rise inthe future, but signiﬁcant ﬁeld-based research is required to test these products at multiplescales and develop effective formulations for wide-scale adoption of this technology.It is uncertain whether RA can supply appropriate plant nutrition while substitutingor reducing the need for synthetic inputs. However, research shows that some managementstrategies, such as no-till, cover crops, crop rotation, and perennial crops, boost SOC,microbial activity, and nutrient cycling. Soils with SOC as low as 1% contain considerableamounts of nitrogen and other nutrients and may offer a sufﬁcient supply if they becomeaccessible to plants. Furthermore, because of its high cation exchange capacity (CEC), SOCimproves soil nutrient retention [373].5.2. Effect of Synthetic Inputs on Soil Microbial ActivitySome pesticides used for crop protection have an impact on soil chemical and biologicalfertility, with numerous potential negative effects on soil microorganisms, including non-target species [ 374–376]. Broad-spectrum fungicides are toxic to most fungi and result in adecline in the beneﬁcial types [ 377]. Some foliar fungicides reduce non-target microbialcommunity structure and functionality in the short-term [ 378]. The fungicides azoxystrobinand pyraclostrobin were shown to reduce microbial richness and biodiversity [ 379,380].Fungicide use may also have an effect on the foliar microbial community. Accordingto Katsoula et al. [ 381], repeated use of iprodione may affect both epiphytic and soilmicrobial communities, potentially affecting the yield and quality of agricultural produce.Repeated use of the fungicide chlorothalonil has been shown to have a detrimental effect onmicrobial respiration, dehydrogenase activity, and microbial community structure undergreenhouse conditions [ 382]. Among the fungicides, carbendazim, mancozeb, captan,metalaxyl, ﬂudioxonil, thiram, and triﬂoxystrobin have been reported to decrease soilmicrobial biomass and AMF [ 383–385]. Topsin, another fungicide, was found to reduceSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 22 of 41AMF colonisation and biomass production in Andropogon gerardii , a warm-season grass.Despite a reduction in AMF colonisation, the biomass of a cool-season grass, Pascopyronsmithii , was not reduced [386].There have been numerous reports of insecticides having a negative impact on soilbacterial and fungal communities. Some insecticides, such as endosulfan, chloropyriphos,and imidacloprid, have been shown to have a negative impact on soil microbes [ 387,388].Herbicides, however, have contradictory effects on soil microbes. Glufosinate had no effecton soil bacterial community structure and diversity when applied to glufosinate-tolerantrapeseed plants [ 389]. Likewise, some herbicides did not have any adverse effects on non-target microorganisms. In contrast, herbicides such as atrazine and metribuzin adverselyimpact Bradyrhizobium populations [390].Intensive fertilisation is thought to harm soil microbes, and in particular AMF diver-sity and abundance, and changes interactions between below- and above-ground plantcommunities due to changes in soil chemical properties [ 391,392]. The effects of N fertili-sation on AMF, however, are debatable. Some studies have found that large amounts ofN fertilisation have a suppressive effect on AMF [ 393,394], while others have found nodiscernible impact on root colonisation or species diversity [ 395–398]. High levels of a ho-mogeneous P supply have been shown to strongly suppress AMF colonisation, abundance,and diversity [ 399,400]. N fertilisation has been linked to soil acidiﬁcation, with seriousconsequences for soil organisms [401].Aside from fertilisation, many other factors, such as N and P availability ratios, [ 402,403],soil pH [ 404,405], AMF species [ 406], soil organic matter content [ 407], and plant communitycomposition [ 408], can inﬂuence AMF communities in an ecosystem. P treatment was foundto brieﬂy inhibit the formation of new arbuscules in AMF [ 409]. The long-term effects of Nand other inorganic fertilisers on plant- and soil-based fungal and bacterial communities arebeing studied extensively. Nitrogen fertilisers, in particular, reduce the ability of rhizobiato promote plant growth and alter the function of AM fungi by reducing their richness anddiversity [ 410–412]. Huang et al. [ 413] recently reported that the use of inorganic fertilisersin grassland ecosystems over 150 years reduced the richness and diversity of both plantand soil microbes, and, more importantly, decreased potential associations between plantsand functional microbes.Pesticides have also been shown to inhibit a variety of soil biological processesand enzymes, including hydrolases, oxidoreductases, urease, and dehydrogenase) [ 414].Some fungicides temporarily inhibit the C-cycling activity of soil fungi [ 415]. Mancozeb,chlorothalonil, thiram, and carbendazim are fungicides that inhibit nodulation and nitrogenﬁxation [ 416]. Ridomil Gold, however, has been reported to increase N and P mineralisation.A recent European study found that fungicide use and land-use intensiﬁcation reduce thenatural nutrient uptake capacity of AM fungi [417].6. Nutrient-Dense FoodRA practitioners claim that higher yields have resulted in decreased nutrients inplants, and that adopting RA practices can improve the nutritional quality of food. Climatechange, particularly elevated CO 2, can have a negative impact on the nutritional qualityof grain [ 418]. Nutritional security is critical to global food production and is inextricablylinked to human health. Soil quality and fertility have a large impact on nutrient levelsin food crops. Poor nutrient content in food has been linked to soil depletion of micro-and macronutrients. Soil mineral content has been reported to be depleted by up to 85%in several countries over the last century [ 419]. Mineral nutrients in fruits and vegetableshave been found to be signiﬁcantly reduced [420,421].Cunningham et al. (2001) [ 422] compared the nutrient contents of 44 types of Aus-tralian vegetables and fruits and discovered no signiﬁcant differences in mineral contentover time. In another study comparing historical plant and soil samples [ 423,424], it wasfound that the decline in mineral content in wheat grains after 1960 was caused by changesin wheat cultivars, whereas the mineral content of soil remained stable or increased due toSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 23 of 41the addition of mineral or organic fertilisers. McIntyre et al. [ 425] proposed that implement-ing efﬁcient farming systems could improve human nutrition and health. Alternatively,crop species with higher micronutrient contents should be identiﬁed and used in breedingprogrammes to improve the nutritional quality of food crops [426].Although prevailing climatic conditions can inﬂuence food nutrient content, soil typemay play an important role in plant nutrient accumulation [ 427]. In the semi-arid regionof Saskatchewan, for example, low protein content in wheat under no till compared tominimum tillage has been reported, whereas no signiﬁcant difference was observed onsandy loam soil [ 428]. To date, no scientiﬁc studies have been conducted to demonstratethe role of the RA system in improving the nutrient density of arable crops. Certainmanagement strategies, such as the use of appropriate soil amendments and beneﬁcialmicroorganisms and legume-based crop rotation, are suggested to improve soil health andfood nitrogen content [429].7. Climate MitigationAccording to RA practitioners, one of the co-beneﬁts of RA is reduced greenhouse gasemissions. Australian agriculture accounts for 14.6% of annual GHG emissions, includingmethane and nitrous oxide from enteric fermentation of livestock/animals and cropping,respectively. Increased temperature and potential soil erosion can reduce agriculturalproductivity by 10–20% due to SOC loss [ 430]. Agricultural soils are thought to be a majorC sink, with potential C sequestration of 1.1–2.2 Pg C over the next 50 years [ 431]. The abilityof agricultural practices to mitigate climate change is attributed to SOC sequestration in soilvia photosynthesis. Carbon sequestration could potentially offset fossil fuel emissions by5–15% on an annual basis, with croplands, grazing/range lands, degraded/deserted lands,and irrigated soils having the highest sequestration potential [ 128]. C sequestration in soilis aided by management practices such as the use of perennial forage crops, the eliminationof bare fallows, the cultivation of biofuel crops, improved nutrient management, reducedtillage, and the production of high residues [108].Tiefenbacher et al. [ 432] recently reviewed the potential C sequestration of agriculturalmanagement practices in topsoil. Composting, no tillage, and cover crops have the highestpotential for sequestration. The C sequestration potential of mineral N fertilisers is almostneutral, and bare fallow has negative potential due to the loss of carbon stocks. However,the authors cautioned that the beneﬁts of C sequestration must be validated under speciﬁcsoil and climatic conditions. Climate smart agricultural practices have been advocatedin order to increase crop yields, proﬁtability, and resource efﬁciency and reduce GHGemissions [ 433]. However, cultural, physical, and economic barriers must be overcomebefore these practices can be widely adopted. Some researchers believe that the estimationof climate change mitigation by agricultural practices is uncertain because it requirescomplex and expensive quantiﬁcation and monitoring technologies [ 434]. Hence, simpleon-farm monitoring tools must be developed [ 435]. Some analytical and predictive toolshave been used to estimate C stocks and sequestration potential [436–438].The literature on the climate mitigation potential of fully regenerative farming is scarce.In South Carolina, US, investigations revealed a signiﬁcant increase in SOC at multiplefarms that switched from conventional fallowing to regenerative cover cropping practiceswith limited chemical and N application [ 439]. Similarly, recent modelling indicates thatadopting RA practices could reduce GHG emissions by 14-27% in arable lands in the UKwithin 30 years [ 440]. As mentioned in previous sections, some individual RA practices canpotentially sequester C in soils, but it is also possible that when these practices are usedholistically, they may have a synergistic effect on sequestering C.Overall, the literature indicates that four-way interactions (plant–microbe–managementpractices–environment) are the primary drivers of C sequestration, improved soil health,and resilience in an agricultural biome (Figure 2). The scale of RA will be determined byseveral factors, the most important of which are farmers’ well-being and ﬁnancial feasibility.The ﬁnancial and social elements of RA are not included here since they are outside theSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 24 of 41scope of this review; however, separate studies on the topic have been published [ 441–443].The exact level of RA uptake in different areas of the world is difﬁcult to estimate because itdiffers by location and country. Elements that make RA popular depend on the individualfarmer to a large extent, but can include low operating costs (due to reduced inputs),perceived improved soil health, perceived increased soil organic carbon (and associatedbeneﬁts), producing more nutritious food, and probably a feel-good factor from farming ina more sustainable manner. Another socioeconomic impediment in the uptake of RA is alack of technical competence and understanding of RA procedures, as well as governmentpolicies, market access, and sufﬁcient research on the beneﬁts of RA. Governments, non-governmental organisations, and research organisations can all play an important role inpromoting the adoption of regenerative agriculture by providing education and training,enacting policies that support these practises, and assisting in the development of marketsfor regeneratively grown products [444].Sustainability  2023 , 15, 2338  25 of 43  benefits of RA. Governments, non -governmental organisations, and research organisa-tions can all play an important role in promoting the adoption of regenerative agriculture by providing education and training, enacting policies that support these practises, and assisting in the development of markets for regeneratively grown products [444].   Figure 2. Plant × microbe × environment × management interactions impacting soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health.  It is acknowledged that switching to RA could result in lower yields in the first few years, but the production l osses may be offset by lower input costs. Farmers must be able to generate income to sustain their livelihoods while transitioning to RA. Rattan Lal, a distinguished soil scientist and World Food Pri e winner, believes that “if farmers are expected to do t hings that are useful to the global community and the world, incentiviza-tion rather than penalty is the best option.”  8. Conclusions  RA is gaining traction in response to the challenges posed by climate change and rising input costs. The adoption of climate smart agricultural approaches, including RA, is proposed to reduce the impact of extreme weather events and combat GHG emissions. RA is not a completely new farming system; rather, it incorporates features from estab-lished sustainable agricultural systems with the primary goal of restoring soil health in order to revitalise degraded land and bring environmental, economic, and social b enefits to a broader community. Furthermore, the system could help in carbon sequestration if the recommended management techniques are followed.  Due to the paucity of empirical research comparing the benefits of a completely re-generated system against the  traditional system, this review paints a complicated picture to give an evidence base clearly outlining the pros and cons of implementing this technol-ogy. This is due, in part, to the lack of a globally agreed definition of RA, which makes evaluating the purported benefits challenging for researchers. However, there is strong scientific evidence that the  individual RA methods discussed in this review have the Figure 2.

RAis not a completely new farming system; rather, it incorporates features from establishedSustainability 2023 ,15, 2338 25 of 41sustainable agricultural systems with the primary goal of restoring soil health in orderto revitalise degraded land and bring environmental, economic, and social beneﬁts to abroader community. Furthermore, the system could help in carbon sequestration if therecommended management techniques are followed.Due to the paucity of empirical research comparing the beneﬁts of a completelyregenerated system against the traditional system, this review paints a complicated pictureto give an evidence base clearly outlining the pros and cons of implementing this technology.This is due, in part, to the lack of a globally agreed deﬁnition of RA, which makes evaluatingthe purported beneﬁts challenging for researchers. However, there is strong scientiﬁcevidence that the individual RA methods discussed in this review have the ability toachieve outcomes such as restored soil health and, to lesser extent, higher yields. One ofthe most important aspects of RA is improved SOC, which is critical for facilitating nutrientcycling and sustaining both plants and soil inhabitants. The carbon pool in the soil is morethan three times higher than that in the atmosphere. Soil carbon has been signiﬁcantlydepleted as a result of land use changes, notably agricultural management systems andsoil erosion. Climate change will also have an impact on global carbon reserves. There iscompelling scientiﬁc evidence that agricultural soils will serve as the largest carbon sink fordecades; however, the magnitude of the carbon sequestration capacity is mostly inﬂuencedby regional climate and soil types. Combining regenerative farming approaches couldboost soil carbon sequestration capacity and soil quality.SOM and SOC are major drivers of soil biodiversity, regulating a wide range ofbiological processes in soil, and even a slight decrease in SOC can harm soil health byimpeding ecosystem functions. Management practices have a profound effect on shapingmicrobial communities, thus inﬂuencing ecosystem services. Soil biodiversity loss inintensively managed soils is well documented. Agricultural soils in Western Australia arenaturally low in SOC, and the potential threat to soil biodiversity is currently very high.The literature shows that sustainable management practices increase microbial biomass,activity, and soil functions. Despite the signiﬁcant challenges in developing SOC in WAdrylands, particularly in areas with limited water availability, the literature suggests that, byadjusting agronomic practices, there is potential for carbon sequestration and enrichmentof below-ground biodiversity.Evidently, the scalability and successful implementation of RA systems will dependon site-speciﬁc studies demonstrating their economic viability, as growers are more likelyto switch if there are no ﬁnancial or environmental risks. Consumer demand for food that issafe and produced using environmentally sustainable technologies is undeniably growing.Researchers around the world are working to develop such technologies, and scientiﬁcevidence is mounting that various RA practices can potentially help prevent soil degra-dation, improve soil health, and produce nutritionally rich food in dryland agriculture.However, researchers face a signiﬁcant challenge in attracting adequate funding to under-stand, evaluate, and unravel the complexity of RA systems. Extensive research is requiredto develop regionally speciﬁc RA approaches. Soil biodiversity in different agro-ecologicalzones is poorly understood including Western Australia. Long-term multi-disciplinaryresearch is needed to understand whether RA methods improve soil biological traits andfertiliser efﬁciency, and thus reduce reliance on synthetic inputs. Government and industryresearch support is critical to unlocking this potential and developing novel cost-effectiveregenerative farming technology applicable to Mediterranean climatic conditions, as wellas extension programmes that not only increase RA acceptability and implementation butensure food and nutritional security.Author Contributions: Conceptualisation, D.F., R.K., J.B.; writing—original draft preparation, R.K.;writing—review and editing, R.K., D.F., C.W. and J.B.
