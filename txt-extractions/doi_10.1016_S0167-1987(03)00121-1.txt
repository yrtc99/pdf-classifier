Since differences in primarycrop productivity between CT and NT are generallynot pronounced ( McConkey et al., 1996 ), C seques-tration under NT is believed to result from reduceddecomposition of SOC because of less aerobic en-vironment ( Doran, 1980 ) and better physical protec-tion of SOC within aggregates ( Beare et al., 1994;Balesdent et al., 2000 ).Soil texture is known to affect both the amount ofSOC and the retention of organic matter from crop0167-1987/$ – see front matter.

Linear correlations were found between soiltexture and the SOC ( Spain, 1990; Hassink, 1994 ).Added of crop residues decompose more rapidly insandy soils than in clay soils ( Sörensen, 1981; Laddet al., 1985 ). With the same input of organic material,clay soils usually contain more organic matter thansandy soils ( Jenkinson, 1988 ). Differences in decom-positionratesandamountsofSOCinvarioustexturedsoils have been attributed to differences in physicalprotection of SOC. The stabilizing effect has been as-cribed to adsorption of organics onto surfaces suchas clays ( Oades, 1989 ) and encapsulation betweenclay particles ( Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Elliott andColeman, 1988 ).Liang et al. (1998) reported that soiltexturedirectlycontrolstheproportionofcropresidueC retained in the soil. Other work has conﬁrmed thataggregation and texture indirectly determine the levelof C retained in soil by suppressing biological activ-ity (Hassink, 1996 ). Reduced tillage can improve soilaggregationandreducelossesofSOCthatresultfromcultivation ( Havlin et al., 1990; Carter, 1992; Weillet al., 1989 ).Recent research suggest that gains in SOC afteradoption of NT increase with clay content ( Campbelletal.,1996a ).InsemiaridsouthwesternSaskatchewan,Canada,Campbell et al. (1995, 1996a,b) reported thatNT gained from 0.5 to 5Mgha−1more C than CTin the 0–15cm soil within 11 or 12 years, and themagnitude of SOC increase was related to soil claycontent. However, because of variations in the dura-tion of experiments and limited number of soil typesreported by Campbell et al. (1995, 1996a,b) it is notclear whether these increases in SOC under NT werequantitatively related to soil texture. This informationmay be important for providing a quantitative mea-sureofCsequestrationunderNTforCanadianprairiesoils. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantifythe impact of crop rotations and tillage on C seques-tration, and (2) to quantify the impact of soil textureon C increase under NT in six Saskatchewan soils.2. Materials and methodsThe six experiments involved a range of climates,soil textures, crop rotations, and tillage systems(Table 1). Based on general moisture regime, we di-vided the sites into semiarid (Hatton ﬁne sandy loam,Swinton silt loam, and Sceptre clay) and sub-humid(Elstowloam,IndianHeadclay,andMelfortsiltyclayloam). All of these studies were originally designedto compare the agronomic performance of tillage sys-tems. Common to all experiments was relatively largeplot size (350–1400m2), so full-size farm equipmentwas used for tillage and planting. Also common wastillage depth of 5–7cm. All experiments received Nand P fertilizer to remove nutrient stress for averagecrop production levels. Finally, common to all exper-iments was that in-crop herbicides were used in allsystems, as required to control weeds.Experimental design, the spring wheat ( Triticumaestivum L.) rotations and tillage practices were sim-ilar for the Swinton silt loam (SiL), Sceptre clay (C)and Hatton ﬁne sandy loam (FSL). Experimental de-tailsthatarerelevanttothisstudyarebrieﬂydescribed.Other details of management of these experiments arereported elsewhere ( Campbell et al., 1995, 1996a,b ).Two crop rotations, continuous wheat (Cont W) andfallow-wheat (F-W) were used. Each phase of F-W,thefallowphase((F)-W)andthewheatphase(F-(W))was presented each year. Tillage systems for thesestudies consisted of minimum tillage (MT) and NT.Pre-seeding tillage with one operation of heavy-dutycultivator equipped with sweeps and rodweeder, ormounted harrow, was used for MT. For NT, weedswere controlled before planting with herbicides.

Planting was performedwithanoffsetdiscpressdrill( DyckandTessier,1986 )for NT and a conventional hoe drill for MT.On the Melfort silty clay loam (SiCL), three tillagesystems (CT, MT and NT) under a F-W rotation wereused. Each phase of the rotation was present eachyear. A heavy-duty cultivator equipped with sweepswas used for tillage operations on summer-fallow; insome years a rodweeder replaced one or more of thecultivation operations. The ﬁrst fallow tillage opera-tion was performed usually in early June with subse-quentthreetoseventillageoperationsperformedonanB.G.

Treat-ments of NT for weed control during fallow generallyreceived a ﬁrst herbicide application in late May orearlyJunewithrepeatapplicationsasrequiredusuallyinJulyandAugust.TillageoperationforMTwassim-ilar to that of CT, but the number of tillage operationwas reduced to twice a year by substituting herbicidesfor some weed control. From 1969 to 1976, all tillagesystems including NT received tillage before seeding(Zentner et al., 1990 ), thereafter only the CT and MTsystems received pre-seeding tillage. Other details ofthe experiment are reported ( Zentner et al., 1990 ).On the Indian Head clay (C), crop systems con-sisted of three, 4-year rotations. One crop rotationincluded 1 year of fallow in four, fallow–springwheat–spring wheat–winter wheat (FWWwW) whilethe other crop rotations were continuous croppingsystems, pea ( Pisum sativum L.)–spring wheat–ﬂax(Linum usitatissum L.)–winter wheat (PWXwW)and spring wheat–spring wheat–ﬂax–winter wheat(WWXwW)( Lafondetal.,1992 ).Eachphaseofeachrotation was present each year. Three tillage systems(CT, MT and NT) were used. MT included only onetillage operation in the spring using a heavy-duty cul-tivator equipped with 41cm sweeps. CT included falltillage after harvest and spring tillage before seeding.In the NT system, weeds on fallow were controlledwith herbicide applications. In the CT system, weedcontrol on fallow was by mechanical means, with 2–4cultivations and 0–3 rodweeder operations per year.Weed control on MT fallow was accomplished withherbicides and one operation with heavy-duty culti-vator followed by one operation with a rodweeder.Details of the experiment can be found elsewhere(Lafond et al., 1992 ).On the Elstow clay loam (CL), two crop rotationsincluding a continuous cropped rotation of wheat–wheat–canola ( Brassica napus L.)–wheat–wheat–ﬂax(WWCWWX) and a rotation containing one fallowin 3 years, fallow–ﬂax–wheat–fallow–canola–wheat(FXWFCW), were used. Only one phase of WWCW-WX was present each year and only three phases oftheFXWFCWrotationwerepresenteachyear.Tillagesystems were CT and NT. Herbicides were used ex-clusively for weed control in the NT treatments. Inthe CT cropping system, tillage with a heavy-dutycultivator equipped with spikes or sweeps was per-formed on stubble in late fall. Early spring tillage wascarried out with a cultivator equipped with mountedharrows followed by cultivating or rod weeding justprior to planting for all CT treatments. The tillage fal-low normally required three operations with a cultiva-tor and mounted harrows, plus one or two operationswith a cultivator or rodweeder. Seeders used includeda double-disc press drill, an offset double-disc pressdrill and a narrow hoe press drill. Further experimen-tal detail can be found in Brandt (1992) .In all studies, NT was designed to maximize con-servation of crop residue such that there was typically60–100% soil cover after planting whereas CT hadtypically 10–40% soil cover after planting. Soil coverwith residue after planting under MT was between20 and 70% cover. For all tillage systems, the leastamount of residue within the above ranges would oc-cur the year after fallow, the year after dry year hav-ing low crop residue production, or the year after peaor canola that do not produce large persistent cropresidue pieces (note straw was chopped and spreadduring harvesting). Conversely, the maximum residuecoveragewouldoccuraftercerealcropsinyearswhenthey produced abundant residue.Soil samples were taken from 0 to 7.5cm and7.5–15cm depths for the Hatton FSL, Swinton SiLand Sceptre C in the spring of 1994, for the MelfortSiCL and Indian Head C in the fall of 1994, and forthe Elstow CL in the fall of 1995. Four soil cores perplot were extracted and composited by depth. Theresulting samples were air-dried and sieved througha 2mm sieve. Crop residues remaining on the sievewere discarded. Representative sub-samples wereground with a rollermill ( <153/H9262m) and analyzedfor SOC using an automated combustion technique(Carlo ErbaTM, Milan, Italy). To remove carbonatessoil samples were pre-treated with phosphoric acid ina tin capsule after weighing, then drying the samplefor 16h at 75◦C prior to analysis for C. Because ofpossible changes in soil bulk density (BD) as a re-sult of crop rotations, especially tillage practices, theamount of SOC in the 0–7.5 and 0–15cm depth wascalculated on an equivalent soil mass basis ( Ellertand Bettany, 1995 ). In this calculation procedure, theequivalent soil mass was set to that of the observationwith the least mass. Thus, the effective mean depthfor calculating SOC mass was less than the stateddepth so that all treatments comparisons were for theidentical soil mass.B.G. McConkey et al./Soil & Tillage Research 74 (2003) 81–90 85For the Hatton FSL, Swinton SiL and Sceptre C,contrasts were used to separate treatment differences.For these three sites two contrasts were selected tocompare crop rotation effect including Cont W versusF-W, and F-(W) versus (F)-W. Only one contrast wasselected to compare tillage effect, MT versus NT. Forthe Melfort SiCL and Elstow CL experimental datawerestatisticallyanalyzedasone-ortwo-factorfacto-rial, randomized complete block design, while for theIndian Head C, a split-plot design with tillage in mainplots and crop rotations in sub-plots was used. Formean separations, a least signiﬁcant difference (LSD)was used at P=0.05 level. Regression analysis wasusedtoassessthelineareffectofclaycontentonSOCincreases.All experiments were located on land that had beenin long-term CT cereal-based fallow-containing rota-tions. We deﬁned SOC increase or sequestration forreduction of fallow as the difference between SOCfor the continuous cropped rotation and that withfallow-containing rotation and SOC for reduction intillage as the difference between the SOC under NTand that under MT and/or CT.

Results and discussionThe SOC for the Hatton FSL, Swinton SiL andSceptre C have been reported previously ( Campbelletal.,1995,1996a,b ).Ingeneral,therewasnointerac-tion effect of crop rotations and tillage on SOC at anysite.Thus,tillageandcroprotationeffectonSOCwillbe discussed separately. Where more than one phaseof crop rotation was sampled the speciﬁc phase of ro-tation had no impact on SOC in either the 0–7.5 or0–15cm soil for the Hatton FSL, Swinton SiL, Scep-tre C and Elstow CL ( Tables 2 and 3 ). This was ex-pected because one crop year would not produce anysigniﬁcantchangeinSOC.However,continuouscrop-ping, compared with fallow-containing rotations, hada higher amount of SOC in the 0–7.5cm soil for allsites except for the Sceptre C ( Tables 2 and 3 ). Thissame effect was existed for the 0–15cm depth of soil86 B.G.

In-crease in total SOC with continuous cropping variedfrom0.3to6.9MgCha−1inthe0–15cmsoil,mainlydepending on the duration of experiments and soiltype. These increases in SOC were 27kgCha−1peryear for the Sceptre C, 110kgCha−1per year for theHatton FSL, 217kgCha−1per year for the SwintonSiL,363kgCha−1peryearfortheIndianHeadC,and430kgCha−1per year for the Elstow CL. A one-wayANOVA showed that SOC increase for reducing fal-low in the sub-humid sites was greater than the semi-arid sites (analysis not shown). This was despite thefact that continuous cropping represented a smallerdecrease in fallow frequency for rotation comparisonsin the sub-humid sites than the semiarid sites. Soilsin the sub-humid sites also had higher levels of SOCthaninthesemiaridsites.GreateramountsofSOCse-questered with continuous cropping in the sub-humidsites contradicted with the hypothesis of Janzen et al.(1998),whosuggestedthattheabilitytoincreaseSOCwould depend not only on the amount of residue Cinputs, but also on the C content of the soil at thetime of initiation with improved management prac-tices. However, because we do not have SOC at theinitiation of NT we cannot determine if the differencebetween cropping systems is due to increasing SOCwith continuous cropping or to decreasing SOC withfallow-containing systems or a combination of both.CroprotationeffectonBDwereonlysigniﬁcantforthe semiarid sites ( Tables 2 and 3 ). The effect was notconsistent as Cont W had lower BD than F-W in the0–7.5cmdepthattheHattonFSLandtheSwintonSiLsites but, at the Sceptre C site, Cont W had higher BDthan F-W in the 7.5–15cm depth. Generally, the BDwas greater under NT than the tilled systems althoughthe difference was only signiﬁcant for Hatton FSLand Sceptre C sites for the 0–7.5cm depth and forNT compared with MT for the 7.5–15cm depth atthe Indian Head C site ( Tables 4 and 5 ). The trend ofgreater BD under NT than the tilled systems wouldcausereportingofrelativelymoreSOCmassunderNTthan the tilled systems using a volumetric calculation(data not shown) compared with our reporting usingthe equivalent soil mass calculation.Tillage practices had signiﬁcant impacts on SOC inthe0–7.5cmsoilforallsites( Tables4and5 ).Increasein SOC under NT in the 0–15cm soil varied from 0.8to 12Mgha−1, depending mainly on the duration ofﬁeld experiments and soil texture. Annual increase inSOC under NT was 67–512kgCha−1per year. Car-bon increase under NT in the Hatton FSL was greaterthanthatintheSwintonSiL.OntheCanadianprairies,sandy soils are especially susceptible to wind erosion(AndersonandWenhardt,1966 )sobettercropresidueconservation under NT than MT greatly reduceserosion (Saskatchewan Agriculture, 1988 ). Reducederosion may have contributed to this greater relativeincrease in SOC for the Hatton FSL. As mentionedin the methods, severe erosion was noted for MT in1984ontheHattonFSL.Winderosionwasnotspecif-ically observed in other years or sites but may haveoccurred.Only the Indian Head site had a signiﬁcant croprotation ×tillage interaction for SOC. In contrast tothe other rotations, the SOC ranking was MT >NTfor PWXwW ( Table 6). This was inconsistent withthe results for the other sites and for the other rota-tions at the Indian Head C site. Other studies havefound differing effects of tillage for different crop ro-tations (Potter et al., 1997; Yang and Kay, 2001 ), al-thoughnotasdramaticchangeineffectasweobservedfor the Indian Head C.

At the Melfort site, MT had anrotation average of 1.5 tillage per year with mosttillage during fallow. When the soil was moist duringfallow, tillage would promote SOC mineralization. Atthe Indian Head site MT had an rotation average ofonly one tillage per year.It is very important to know other possible mech-anisms that favor C sequestration under NT in addi-tion to reduced wind erosion in coarse-textured soils.There had been no crop yield differences betweentillagesystemsattheHattonFSL,SwintonSiL,Scep-tre C (McConkey et al., 1996 ), and at the MelfortSiCL(Zentneretal.,1990 ).Cropyieldsaveraged10%higher for NT than CT at the Indian Head C site(Lafond et al., 1992 ) and 5% higher for NT than CTat the Elstow CL ( Brandt, 1992 ). Therefore, increasedproduction of crop residues cannot explain increasedSOC from adoption of NT, although it may be a con-tributing factor at the Elstow CL and particularly, In-dian Head C site.In order to assess the effect of soil texture on SOCincrease the relative annual increase in SOC was cal-culated as follows:RAISOC =SOCNT−SOCCTSOCCT×Years×100where RAISOC (% per year) is a relative annualincrease in SOC per year under NT, SOC NTtheamount of SOC under NT (MgCha−1in the 0–15cmsoil), SOC CTthe amount of SOC under tilled sys-tems (MgCha−1in the 0–15cm soil), and Year theFig. 1.

If the value of RAISOCfor the Hatton FSL were excluded because of proba-blyadditionalCsequestrationassociatedwithreducedwind erosion under NT, there was a linear relation-ship between RAISOC and the clay content of soil,indicating the role of soil clay content in sequesteringC under NT.

We did not ﬁnd any singleobservation to have an inﬂuential impact on the over-allrelationship,suggestingthatthisrelationshipcouldbe real. We could not separate the inﬂuence of textureother site effects so further investigation is warrantedto conﬁrm this relationship.4. ConclusionsThe SOC increase for reducing fallow in thesub-humid sites was greater than the semiarid sites.This was despite the fact that continuous croppingrepresented a smaller decrease in fallow frequencyfor rotation comparisons in the sub-humid sites thanthe semiarid sites. Similarly, NT compared with tilledsystems increased SOC from 70 to 510kgCha−1per year. The potential for gains in SOC under NTwas also greater in the sub-humid soil climates.The relative annual increase in SOC under NT overtilled systems increased approximately linearly withincreasing clay content. The combined impact ofcontinuous cropping with adoption of NT resulted inan increase in SOC by approximately 300kgCha−1per year in the semiarid region of the Canadianprairie regardless of soil texture, and approximatelyB.G.
