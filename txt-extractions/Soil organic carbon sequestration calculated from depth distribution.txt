New assessmentapproaches are needed to quantify how conservation agriculture might contribute tosoil health improvement and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration. In the southeast-ern United States, conservation management has been repeatedly shown to stratifySOC concentration with depth. Starting immediately below a zone of tillage influ-ence (i.e., 30-cm depth), SOC concentration is rarely affected by management dueto low C inputs and high decomposition potential, whereas concentration increasestoward the surface in a nonlinear manner, presumably with greater inputs of residueand root inputs and changing temperature and moisture conditions. Using these obser-vations as an ecological foundation, SOC sequestration was calculated as the sum-mation of SOC stock greater than the baseline condition at 30-cm depth. Data fromliterature sources were mathematically fitted with this new approach as a validation.Two on-farm surveys with different agricultural management practices (5–40 yr) inthe southeastern United States yielded preliminary estimates of SOC sequestration.The interquartile range of calculated SOC sequestration was 4.2–9.4 Mg C ha–1forconventional-tillage cropland ( n=45 fields), 13.6–29.7 Mg C ha–1for no-tillagecropland ( n=97 fields), and 15.9–26.1 Mg C ha–1for perennial pasture ( n=29fields). This new approach will be valuable to estimate SOC sequestration from agreater diversity of conservation agricultural systems practiced on farms within aregion and independent of soil type.1 INTRODUCTIONSoil contains a large reservoir of organic C (2,273 Pg in 0–2 m depth) and is an important part of the global C cycleAbbreviations: BD, bulk density; IQR, interquartile range; SOC, soilorganic carbon.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the originalwork is properly cited.Published 2020.

Much has been written of how cer-tain soils and management systems might be contributingas sources or sinks to the atmospheric pool of C, currentlyestimated as 864 Pg, or 272 Pg greater than prior to industri-alization (Lal, 2019 ). Debate continues as to whether conser-vation agricultural systems might be sequestering SOC or just158 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/saj2 Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 2021;85:158–171.FRANZLUEBBERS 159redistributing C in the soil profile (Angers & Eriksen-Hamel,2008 ; Kravchenko & Robertson, 2011 ).In the southeastern United States, soils have had a long his-tory of agricultural cultivation, with enormous losses of soilthrough erosion (Trimble, 1974 ) and a general decline of SOCfrom a precultivated condition (Hendrix et al., 1998 ). Loss ofSOC with cultivation may have been as much as 20–60% ofnative conditions (Davidson & Ackerman, 1993 ;G u o&G i f -ford, 2002 ), which would have been a loss of 12–36 Mg C ha–1if original conditions were 60 Mg C ha–1in the surface30 cm of soil. Precultivated SOC conditions are difficult todetermine for the diversity of soil types in the southeasternUnited States because there are few pristine areas remain-ing, especially for agriculturally productive soil types that arewidespread across the region. Research has shown that regain-ing lost SOC through conservation agricultural managementcan be significant in the region (Franzluebbers, 2010 ) andcomparable to rates of SOC accumulation in other regionsof the United States (Franzluebbers & Follett, 2005 ). Esti-mates of SOC sequestration have been variable, and manage-ment and edaphic factors contributing to this variation havenot been easily discerned with the limited number of researchstudies under highly controlled soil and management condi-tions (Franzluebbers, 2010 ). Long-term management compar-isons require dedicated resources and repeated analyses overtime, which are expensive requirements to obtain this valu-able information. However, weather variations and changes inmanagement can cause additional uncertainty in SOC seques-tration estimates. An approach to gather more and lower-costestimates of SOC sequestration across a wider diversity of soiltypes and land management conditions would greatly assistthe scientific endeavor and help understanding of the factorscontributing to SOC sequestration.Detecting change in SOC sequestration with increasingdepth in the profile is challenging (Syswerda et al., 2011 ) dueto progressively lower SOC concentrations deeper in the pro-file and greater random variation among replicates or pseudo-replicates that can mask relatively small changes that may beoccurring (Franzluebbers, 2010 ). In eastern Nebraska, SOCsequestration to 150-cm depth was asserted from multipleyears of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) biofuel produc-tion, despite enormous random variation that increased withprogressively greater soil depth (Follett et al., 2012 ). Across42 paired-field comparisons in Minnesota, North Dakota, andSouth Dakota, SOC concentration was statistically greaterat a depth of 0–5 cm under switchgrass than under crop-land fields (difference of 4.3 g kg–1) and marginally greaterat the 30-to-60-cm and 60-to-90-cm depths (difference of1.0 g kg–1) (Liebig et al., 2005 ). Curiously though, a sig-nificantly greater SOC concentration was found with switch-grass than with cropland in only 14% of all depth incrementsof all fields within the surface 30 cm, whereas 9% of obser-vations were lower with switchgrass than cropland. BelowCore Ideas∙Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration can becalculated from profile distribution of C.∙SOC is highly stratified with depth in conservationsystems in the southeastern United States.∙The surface 30 cm of soil reflects the majority ofmanagement-induced SOC.∙No tillage cropland and perennial pastures resultedin significant SOC sequestration.30-cm depth, significantly greater SOC concentration underswitchgrass than cropland was found in 10% of observations,whereas 6% of observations were lower with switchgrass thancropland. Other paired management comparisons can lead toequivocal results when landscape settings are not adequatelymatched (Blanco-Canqui & Lal, 2008 ; Boddey et al., 2009 ;Franzluebbers, 2009 ). Chronosequences with mixed edaphic-and management-controlled variations can lead to wild esti-mates of SOC sequestration (Machmuller et al., 2015 ).In the southeastern United States, the amount of organicC that can be deposited below the plow layer (i.e., typicallyconsidered the 0-to-30-cm layer) is oftentimes low even underperennial grasses that have deep rooting and potentially highproductivity (Garten & Wullschleger, 1999 ; Ma et al., 2000 )because root C inputs progressively decline with depth. Rootmass of 3-yr-old bermudagrass [ Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.]estimated from soil depths of 0–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cmwas 3.3±1.7, 0.9±0.5, and 0.9 ±0.5 Mg ha–1, respec-tively (Adams et al., 1966 ). In other studies, root mass to20-cm depth only was 6.7 ±1 . 2M gh a–1under a varietyof warm-season grasses in Florida (Siqueira da Silva et al.,2019 ), 9.4±1.5 Mg ha–1under bermudagrass with different Nfertilizer levels (Liu et al., 2017 ), and 2.5–5.5 Mg ha–1underbermudagrass (Alderman et al., 2011 ). Warm-moist condi-tions persist throughout the year in this region and lead to highdecomposition rates, contributing to relatively low SOC con-centrations. At least in upland soils of the southeastern UnitedStates, perhaps it would be a better assumption that insignifi-cant SOC accumulation occurs below the plow layer; instead,information on SOC distribution within the plow layer shouldbe used to make SOC sequestration calculations. This wasthe premise of this study that SOC concentration immediatelybelow the zone of tillage influence could be used as a base-line condition to which SOC concentrations nearer the sur-face could be compared. This assumption may not be validin saturated soils with variable organic deposition and migra-tion of organic matter with Fe and Al (e.g., Histosols or Spo-dosols) (Franzluebbers, 2013 ). The hypothesis was that SOCsequestration could be calculated from a SOC stock change 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

It is rec-ognized that SOC could potentially accumulate below 30 cmdepth, but it is my contention that this would require severaldecades and centuries to find statistically significant changein SOC concentration due to management (unless physicallydeposited through injection or deep tillage in upland soilsand natural migration in saturated soils). Therefore, a betterapproach to quantify the effects of contemporary managementwould be to focus on the upper 30 cm to get more useful infor-mation to make urgent decisions with our rapidly changingenvironment.The objective of this study was to develop a SOC seques-tration calculation method based on depth distribution of SOCconcentration. Soil-profile data from several published stud-ies were assembled to make calculations and compare resultswith more standard approaches to calculation of SOC seques-tration. Mathematical description of SOC depth distributionwas presented before (Franzluebbers, 2013 ), but the approachof calculating SOC sequestration based on an internal soil-profile reference condition is novel and developed here forpotential further use.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 Experimental sites and characteristicsData from several previous studies in the southeastern UnitedStates with SOC concentration (determined by dry combus-tion in all cases) by multiple depth increments were assem-bled for this analysis, including from a forage utilization studyon perennial pasture in Georgia (GA-1); a tillage and covercrop study in Georgia (GA-2); a biofuel production study inNorth Carolina (NC-1); a switchgrass cultivar study in NorthCarolina (NC-2); a survey of crop and pasture land uses inAlabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Vir-ginia (SE-1), and a survey of corn ( Zea mays L.) productionfields in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia (SE-2).Study GA-1 was a 12-yr beef cattle pasture comparisonnear Farmington, GA (33˚44 ′38″N, 83˚ 23 ′57″W). Soilat the site was Cecil, Madison, and Pacolet sandy loam andsandy clay loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhap-ludults). Forage base was ‘Coastal’ bermudagrass during thefirst 5 yr and mixed bermudagrass/‘Georgia 5 ′tall fescue[Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort., nom. cons.]during the final 7 yr. Soil cores (4-cm diameter) were col-lected at depth increments of 0–5, 15–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, and 120–150 cm with a hydraulic probe at initiation ofmanagement in 1994, at the end of 5 yr in 1999, and at the endof 12 yr in 2006. Soil organic C concentration was reportedin Franzluebbers and Stuedemann ( 2009 ). This study had 12treatments (3 nutrient sources ×4 forage utilization strategies)and was replicated in the field three times. Nutrient sourceswere (a) broiler litter two times per year for the first 5 yr andthree times per year for the final 7 yr, (b) crimson clover ( Tri-folium incarnatum L.) cover crop plus inorganic N for the first5 yr and broiler litter once per year and inorganic N twice peryear for the final 7 yr, and (c) inorganic N twice per year dur-ing the first 5 yr and inorganic N three times per year for thefinal 7 yr. Forage utilization was unharvested ConservationReserve Program simulation, low grazing pressure to main-tain high residual forage mass ( ∼2M gh a–1), high grazingpressure to maintain low residual forage mass ( ∼1M gh a–1),and hayed monthly when sufficient forage accumulated.Study GA-2 was a multiple-year cropping comparison fol-lowing termination of long-term pasture near Watkinsville,GA (33˚52 ′55″N, 83˚ 25 ′30″W). Soil was Cecil sandy loamand sandy clay loam. Grain crops were grown in rotationwith cover crops, which were either grazed by cattle or accu-mulated for conservation. Tillage was with (a) initial mold-board plow and subsequent disk tillage and (b) no tillage usingchemical termination. Soil cores (4-cm diameter) were col-lected at depth increments of 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–90,90–120, and 120–150 cm at the end of 6 yr of managementin 2007, but primary calculations of SOC sequestration werefrom 0-to-60-cm depths only. Soil organic C concentrationwas reported in Franzluebbers and Stuedemann ( 2013 ). Fourtreatments (2 tillage systems ×2 cover crop utilization strate-gies) were replicated eight times. Soil was also collected fromdepth increments of 0–3, 3–6, 6–12, 12–20, and 20–30 cm atthe end of Years 1, 3, 5, and 7 (Franzluebbers & Stuedemann,2014 ). Narrow-depth increments were a composite of five toeight cores (4-cm diameter) at each sampling event.Study NC-1 was an evaluation of biofuel crop managementnear Salisbury NC (35˚ 41 ′12″N, 80˚ 36 ′31″W). Soil wasMecklenburg clay loam (fine, mixed, active, thermic UlticHapludalfs). Biofuel crops of switchgrass, giant miscanthus(Miscanthus ×giganteus ), and biomass sorghum [ Sorghumbicolor (L.) Moench] were grown in comparison with tra-ditional tall fescue hay and a common 2-yr crop sequenceof corn–wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)/soybean [ Glycine max(L.) Merr.]. Soil cores (4-cm diameter) were collected at depthincrements of 0–6, 6–12, 12–20, and 20–30 cm at the end of3 yr of management in 2015. Soil organic C concentration wasreported in Wang et al. ( 2017 ). The five management systemswere replicated four times.Study NC-2 was an evaluation of two fields of differ-ent switchgrass cultivars near Clayton, NC (35˚39 ′59″N,78˚30 ′36″W). ‘Colony’ and ‘Performer’ switchgrass culti-vars were grown on separate fields ∼1 km apart. Colonywas grown on a Varina loamy sand (fine, kaolinitic, thermicPlinthic Paleudults), and Performer was grown on a Wagramloamy sand (loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Arenic Kandiudults).Both cultivars were lowland ecotypes developed by USDA 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Soilcores at depth increments of 0–5, 5–15, and 15–30 cm werecollected in early spring 2015 after ∼15 yr of grass establish-ment (unpublished data). Three areas (separated by ∼30 m) ineach field served as pseudo-replicates from which eight cores(4-cm diameter) were composited in each.Study SE-1 was a multisite survey of crop and pas-ture lands in a five-state region of the southeastern UnitedStates (Causarano et al., 2008 ). Dominant soils were Kanhap-ludults, Kandiudults, Hapludults, and Paleudults, with loamyto clayey texture in thermic to mesic temperature regimes.Three management systems were sampled: conventionallytilled cropland, no-till cropland, and pastureland from adja-cent fields within each of three locations in two physiographicregions (Coastal Plain and Piedmont) of Alabama, Georgia,South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (target of 90fields, but only 87 sampled). Management duration of no-tillcropland and pastures after conversion from conventionallytilled cropland was from 5 to 40 yr, but good records were notavailable to discriminate duration among sites. Soil cores (5-cm diameter) at depth increments of 0–5, 5–12.5, and 12.5–20 cm were collected from May 2004 to May 2005.Study SE-2 was a multisite survey of corn production fieldsin North Carolina (58 fields), South Carolina (two fields),and Virginia (29 fields). Soils varied widely but were dom-inated by Ultisols and including some Alfisols and Entisols.Crop fields varied in previous crop, tillage history, and useof livestock manure. Management duration was variable, butall sites were at least 5 yr in no-till cropland and more oftenwith 20 yr or more. Soil cores were collected in March–Mayperiods of 2015–2017, and SOC concentration was reportedin Franzluebbers ( 2018 ,2020 ). Four pseudoreplicate sampleswere collected from a composite of eight cores (4-cm diame-ter) at depth increments of 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm.2.2 Nonlinear depth distributioncalculationsA minimum of three depth increments were needed to fit anonlinear response of soil organic C concentration (g kg–1)with soil depth (cm). The following nonlinear equation wasused for all soil-depth profiles:SOC =𝐴+𝐵∗(1−𝑒(−𝑏∗SD))(1)where SOC is soil organic C (g kg–1),Ais SOC deep inthe profile without management influence (i.e., baseline SOCcondition, A≥0 only, g kg–1), and Bis the pool of SOC thataccumulates at the soil surface (g kg–1) and declines exponen-tially as a function of a rate constant ( b, |cm|–1) at any particu-lar soil depth (SD, |cm|). All nonlinear regressions were fittedto available data using SigmaPlot v. 14 (Systat Software Inc.).In cases where Equation 1produced an estimate of A<0,Aw a ss e tt o0u s i n gam o d i f i e df o r m :SOC =𝐵∗(1−𝑒(−𝑏∗SD))(2)In other cases that would be valid with five or more mea-sured soil depth increments, a two-pool nonlinear modelmight be considered appropriate:SOC =𝐴+𝐵∗(1−𝑒(−𝑏∗SD))+C∗(1−𝑒(−c∗SD))(3)where A,B, and bare as described for Equation 1, and Cis a pool of SOC that accumulates at an intermediate depthbetween the soil surface and deep within the profile anddeclines exponentially as a function of a rate constant ( c,|cm|–1) at any particular soil depth (SD, |cm|).In Studies GA-1 and GA-2, SOC depth distribution calcu-lations were made from (a) a full set of depth increments from0 to 150 cm and (b) a reduced set of depth increments from 0to 60 cm. Comparing these two different sets of depth incre-ments was only across mean values of selected treatments,yielding four treatments (no harvest, low and high grazingpressure, and hayed) at the end of 12 yr in GA-1 and fourtreatments (2 tillage ×2 cover crop management systems) atthe end of 6 yr in GA-2. This restricted comparison was con-ducted to test whether sampling depth limit influenced calcu-lated SOC estimates.In all evaluations, soil bulk density (BD, Mg m–3)w a sassumed using the pedotransfer function described in Fran-zluebbers ( 2010 ):B D=1.71 ∗𝑒(−0.013∗SOC)(4)where SOC is soil organic C (g kg–1), 1.71 Mg m–3is max-imum BD with low SOC, and –0.013 is a decay coefficientin response to changing SOC concentration. The pedotrans-fer function allowed calculation of SOC stock at multiple5-cm depth increments throughout the entire 30-cm profile.However, soil BD was also measured in studies with narrowdepth increments in the surface 30 cm, and comparisons weremade against values predicted with the pedotransfer function(n=546). Root mean square error was calculated from the 1:1correspondence that was expected.In all evaluations, after fitting SOC profile concentrationat 5-cm depth intervals with the nonlinear depth distributionfunction, SOC stock of each 5-cm depth increment was calcu-lated from the average values of the product of predicted SOCconcentration and predicted BD at upper and lower depth lim-its. Soil organic C stock of the 0-to-30-cm depth was fromthe summation of 5-cm increments. Base SOC stock was 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Calculated SOC sequestrationwas from SOC stock – SOC base. With a time frame, calcu-lated SOC sequestration (Mg C ha–1) could be used to calcu-late SOC sequestration rate (Mg C ha–1yr–1). An appropri-ate elapsed time could sometimes be assumed, but in othercases management duration was difficult to ascertain. Pre-dicted concentration of SOC at 30-cm depth was selected asa value to compare among treatments and across studies as astandardized soil property.Data of SOC stock, base SOC stock, calculated SOCsequestration, and basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depthfrom studies GA-1, GA-2, NC-1, and NC-2 were subjected toANOVA using the general linear model of SAS v. 9.4 (SASInstitute Inc.), according to the original experimental designof each separate study with associated replication. Signifi-cance among treatments was declared at α=.05. Orthogonalcontrasts were used to separate multiple treatments within anexperimental design. These same four response variables werecalculated for the two on-farm survey studies. Categories ofmanagement and physiographic region were tested for signif-icance using orthogonal contrasts and paired Student ttests.Results were interpreted with view toward traditional calcula-tions reported in the literature and as in original reports fromthese experiments. Data were plotted with SigmaPlot v. 14.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3.1 Forage utilization regimes (Study GA-1)Using the proposed SOC depth distribution method, SOCstock was not different among forage utilization treatments atinitiation of the experiment in 1994; nor was there any differ-ence in SOC base and calculated SOC sequestration (Table 1).After 5 yr of pasture management, SOC stock in the surface30-cm depth was greater with unharvested and cattle graz-ing systems than with hayed management. This was due toan increase in SOC sequestered while the SOC base remainedunchanged or declined slightly. After 12 yr of pasture manage-ment, these same effects became more clearly expressed, andgreater SOC sequestration occurred with both low and highgrazing pressures than with unharvested forage. All effectswere similar to those measured in original depth incrementsand summation of depths from traditional analysis of SOC(Franzluebbers & Stuedemann, 2009 ).Soil organic C stock at initiation of this pasture grazingexperiment was nearly equally divided between base SOCstock and SOC sequestered from some undescribed recenthistory that included a few years of pasture establishment(Table 1). Implicit in the argument for this separation ofSOC sources was that base SOC stock was derived over cen-TABLE 1 Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-to-30-cm depth),SOC base calculation (based on SOC concentration [kg m–3] at 30-cmdepth projected throughout the 0-to-30-cm depth), SOC sequestrationas the difference between SOC stock and SOC base (0-to-30-cm depth),and basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth as affected by forageutilization in a long-term pasture study near Farmington, GeorgiaForage utilizationSOCstockSOCbaseSOCsequestrationBasalSOCMg C ha–1gk g–1Initially in 1994Unharvested CRP 42.6 19.4 23.2 4.0Low grazing pressure 43.7 19.7 24.0 4.1High grazing pressure 42.2 19.1 23.0 3.9Hayed 43.3 19.4 23.9 4.0SE 1.1 0.9 0.9 0.2At end of 5 yrUnharvested CRP 47.4a 17.0 30.3a 3.5Low grazing pressure 50.3a 18.0 32.3a 3.7High grazing pressure 47.7a 15.4 32.3a 3.1Hayed 41.7b 17.7 24.1b 3.7SE 1.5 2.1 1.7 0.5A te n do f1 2y rUnharvested CRP 52.6b 17.3 35.2b 3.6Low grazing pressure 59.1a 18.0 41.0a 3.7High grazing pressure 54.4ab 14.4 40.0a 2.9Hayed 45.8c 16.5 29.3c 3.4SE 1.3 2.0 1.1 0.4Note.

In this specific case, a rather large pool of SOCsequestered in the upper 30 cm would seem likely from man-agement over a longer period of time than the few years ofgreen fallow and pasture preparation stages required to getthe∼0.7-ha paddocks ready for experimentation. The sitewas considered to be highly eroded and in a degraded con-dition prior to the experiment, but these data suggest that sig-nificant surface SOC accumulated in recent history, assum-ing SOC concentration throughout the 0-to-30-cm depth wasmore similar to that of the 30-cm depth itself. Consistentwith observation from the original report was an estimateddecline over time in basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth.Across all data, SOC base declined significantly ( p=.02),but when estimated for each forage utilization treatment sep-arately, the decline was significant only for high grazingpressure ( p=.005). Change in dry combustion instrumenta-tion for determining SOC concentration between the initialsampling and the later samplings cannot be ruled out as a 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Thesequestration rate of SOC over the 12-yr period of this exper-iment using the depth distribution method was calculated as0.98±0.13 Mg C ha–1yr–1(mean±SE among three nutri-ent sources and three replications) under unharvested manage-ment, 1.40 ±0.10 Mg C ha–1yr–1under low grazing pressure,1.39±0.14 Mg C ha–1yr–1under high grazing pressure, and0.47±0.11 Mg C ha–1yr–1under continuously hayed man-agement. Soil organic C sequestration values of the surface30 cm were reported as 0.80 ±0.38, 1.40 ±0.20, 0.92 ±0.16,and 0.19 ±0.19 Mg C ha–1yr–1for unharvested, low graz-ing pressure, high grazing pressure, and hayed treatments,respectively (mean ±standard deviation among three nutri-ent sources) (Franzluebbers & Stuedemann, 2009 ). Therefore,these two different estimation procedures yielded generallysimilar results relative to treatment effects.Calculated SOC sequestration with the depth distributionmethod increased with time (i.e., calculated SOC sequestra-tion was 1.21 ±0.01 times that of base SOC stock amongthe four forage utilization regimes at initiation) to 1.76 ±0.26times that of base SOC stock at 5 yr and to 2.21 ±0.37 timesthat of base SOC stock at 12 yr. This relatively quick and largechange in estimated SOC sequestration provides ample evi-dence that contemporary SOC sequestration can be indicatedwith this depth distribution approach and that the initiallylarge estimate of SOC sequestration in 1994 (at the beginningof the experiment) may have been attributable to managementduring 15–25 yr, based on projection of the rates of SOCsequestration during the 12-yr period of experimentation.Rampant erosion of unprotected soil during past decades tocenturies of agricultural production could have produced esti-mated basal SOC concentration of 3.6 ±0 . 3gk g–1throughoutthe entire 0-to-30-cm plow layer.Soil organic C stock, base SOC stock, and basal SOC con-centration at 30-cm depth were not significantly altered whenonly three depth increments (0–15, 15–30, and 30–60 cm)were used to estimate depth distribution parameters of SOCcompared with all six depth increments (0–15, 15–30, 30–60,60–90, 90–120, and 120–150 cm). However, SOC sequestra-tion was greater when estimated with six depth incrementsthan with three depth increments (36.4 vs. 35.9 Mg ha–1;p=.04). Estimated SOC concentration at 30-cm depth tendedto be slightly greater when restricting depth of sampling to60 cm than full sampling to 150 cm (3.6 vs. 3.4 g kg–1, respec-tively; p=.06).

This compar-ison suggests that this effect of depth limit was small and ofminor significance.3.2 Tillage and cover crop management(Study GA-2)Using the depth distribution method, SOC stock tended tobe greater under no tillage than under conventional tillage(p=.06) and was not different whether cover crops weregrazed or not (Table 2). Stock of SOC tended to be lowerwith any cropping system than under the reference conditionof long-term pasture ( p=.08). When calculating the assumedSOC base from that of the 30-cm depth, there were no dif-ferences among treatments. Lack of treatment difference inthe SOC base on the same soil type should be viewed as apositive assessment of the depth distribution method. BasalSOC concentration at 30-cm depth averaged 5.3 g kg–1amongtreatments. Calculated SOC sequestration as the difference instanding stock of SOC minus that of the SOC base was greaterunder no tillage than under conventional tillage ( p=.05), wasnot different whether cover crops were grazed or not, and wasnot different between cropping and reference grass condition.Calculated SOC sequestration from the difference in estimatesbetween no tillage and conventional tillage were 2.1–10.4 MgCh a–1. From traditional calculations, SOC sequestration withno tillage compared with conventional tillage was 4.3–6.8 MgCh a–1at 0-to-20-cm depth ( p=.04) and 3.7–3.9 Mg C ha–1at0-to-40-cm depth ( p=.17). Therefore, estimated SOC seques-tration and its statistical significance were similar betweenapproaches. 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Variation in calculated SOC sequestrationfrom depth distribution estimates was rather large in thisstudy, with a standard error of 3.1 Mg C ha–1. This variationmay have been a result of relatively large plots (0.2–0.5 haeach) over a total of 9 ha on a sloping landscape position.None of the SOC responses in Table 2was significantlyaltered when all six depth increments (0–20, 20–40, 40–60,60–90, 90–120, and 120–150 cm) were used to estimate depthdistribution parameters of SOC compared with only threedepth increments (0–20, 20–40, and 40–60 cm) (data notshown). Therefore, even more conclusive than the calcula-tion for Study GA-1, there was no difference in estimationsof SOC properties in the surface 30 cm when using differentdepth limits.Analysis of narrower depth increments within the surface30 cm (i.e., 0–3, 3–6, 6–12, 12–20, and 20–30 cm) resultedin greater sensitivity to depth stratification, especially withno tillage and with continuation of the perennial pasture.The standard error of calculated SOC sequestration estimatesamong the 4 yr was 1.0 Mg C ha–1(Table 3), compared with3 . 1M gCh a–1in the wider depth increments and deeper in theprofile (Table 2). Values of calculated SOC sequestration atthe end of 7 yr of management with narrow depth incrementswere reasonably similar to those at the end of 6 yr of manage-ment with wider depth increments. A significant differencein calculated SOC sequestration between tillage systems wasdetected in all years with narrower depth increments (Table 3),but no differences were detected whether cover crops weregrazed or not (data not shown), consistent with the originalresults. One difference between the two approaches was forgreater basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth (and resul-tant greater base SOC stock) with narrower than wider depthincrements. Basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth was5.3±0.4 g kg–1with wider depth increments, 8.0 ±1.2 g kg–1with narrower depth increments under conventional tillage,and 6.2±0 . 5gk g–1with narrower depth increments underno tillage. Greater basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depthwith conventional tillage was likely due to initial moldboardplowing that redistributed SOC to ∼25 cm depth and at leastinitially created an elevated baseline condition based on curvefitting. Estimated basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depthdeclined with time under conventional tillage. Restricting soilsampling to within the 0-to-30-cm profile did appear to ele-vate the estimate of basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depthbecause a lower SOC concentration was observed with deepersampling. This lower SOC concentration deeper in the profileappeared to have shifted estimated SOC concentration at 30-cm depth by ∼1gk g–1, so having a depth increment below30 cm may be beneficial to getting a more accurate estimateof the baseline condition.3.3 Biofuel crop management (Study NC-1)Stock of SOC in the upper 30 cm of this study was high inall management systems relative to Studies GA-1 and GA-2 (Table 4). This study followed termination of a long-termtall fescue hayfield, which could have had elevated surface-SOC concentration (Franzluebbers & Poore, 2020 ). This soilalso had high clay content that may have enhanced C reten-tion potential. Stock of SOC was greater in continuation ofthe traditional tall fescue hay system than in biofuel croppingsystems, which was likely due to the maturing status of thebiofuel crops after only 3 yr since establishment. Chemicaltermination of the original tall fescue sod and initially slowestablishment of the perennial biofuels of miscanthus andswitchgrass would have likely contributed to the small declinein SOC stock. In addition, the switchgrass stand was diskedafter initial stand failure to get better seed-to-soil contact.Calculated SOC sequestration was 28.2 ±2 . 1M gCh a–1(mean±standard deviation among all systems), which wasnearly equal to the SOC base of 29.7 ±4.1 Mg C ha–1(withbasal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth of 6.3 ±0 . 9gk g–1). 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Means within a column not sharing the same letter are significantly differentatp<.05.Therefore, calculated SOC sequestration was more likely dueto the decades of tall fescue management than the few yearsof biofuel grass management. Previous history of tall fes-cue management nearly doubled the SOC content of the sur-face 30 cm. If the time interval were set to 50 yr of tallfescue management (a rough estimate of when forage standwas established), then effective SOC sequestration rate wouldhave been 0.56 ±0.04 Mg C ha–1yr–1(0-to-30-cm depth).Across various grass management experiments in the south-eastern United States, SOC sequestration was estimated as0.84±0.11 Mg C ha–1yr–1(Franzluebbers, 2010 ). Accumu-lation of this large stock of SOC during recent history seemsreasonable with several decades of hay production, which wassupplemented with large inputs of poultry litter as fertilizerprior to the experiment. Having an estimate of basal SOC con-centration was vital in making these calculations.3.4 Switchgrass cultivars (Study NC-2)Stock of SOC to a depth of 30 cm was greater under Per-former than under Colony (Table 5). At first glance, thisresult appeared contradictory to the expected greater root pro-duction with Colony having high biomass production poten-tial than the more digestible and likely less productive Per-former. However, no data were collected on aboveground orbelowground production, so this is only an assumed expec-tation. Importantly, basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depthand base SOC stock were also greater under Performer thanunder Colony. This result highlights how soil type and histor-ical conditions are important in making calculations of SOCsequestration with this method. Calculated SOC sequestra-tion was the same between the two fields ( p=.12), averagingTABLE 5 Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-to-30-cm depth),SOC base calculation (based on SOC concentration [kg m–3] at 30-cmdepth projected throughout the 0-to-30-cm depth), SOC sequestrationas the difference between SOC stock and SOC base (0-to-30-cm depth),and basal SOC concentration at 30-cm depth as affected by long-termswitchgrass production on two nearby fields at Clayton, North CarolinaCultivarSOCstockSOCbaseSOCsequestrationBasalSOCMg C ha–1gk g–1Colony 30.8b 14.3b 16.6 2.9bPerformer 47.3a 26.4a 20.8 5.6aSE 1.9 1.2 1.1 0.3Note.

The ratio of sequestered SOC to that of baseSOC stock was 0.8–1.2.Depth distribution of these two switchgrass cultivars ontwo different fields can serve to illustrate a few key pointsabout SOC calculations (Figure 1). First, basal SOC con-centration was different between these fields, and this wasnot necessarily a limitation in comparing the effect of recentmanagement. This basal SOC concentration is an importantdeterminant of calculated SOC sequestration with the depthdistribution method. Although SOC concentration near thesurface was greater with Performer than with Colony, basalSOC concentration normalized the difference, resulting insimilar SOC sequestration.

Differ-ences among management systems were detected in total SOCstock to a depth of 30 cm, but differences were even moreprominent in calculated SOC sequestration above that of thebase SOC stock. In the original study, mean stock of SOC(0-to-20-cm depth) across five states and two physiographicregions was reported as 22.2, 27.9, and 38.9 Mg C ha–1under conventional tillage, no tillage, and pasture, respec-tively (Causarano et al., 2008 ). Soil organic C stock valuesacross physiographic regions in Table 6were ∼6.1 Mg C ha–1greater, which gave very reasonable agreement between thetwo approaches considering the differences in depth.Sequestration of SOC with the depth distribution methodwas 6.4 ±3.6 Mg C ha–1under conventional tillage(mean±standard deviation among 5 states ×2p h y s i o -graphic regions), 12.3 ±3.0 Mg C ha–1under no tillage, and21.2±6 . 9M gCh a–1under perennial pasture. The differencein calculated SOC sequestration between no tillage and con-ventional tillage was 5.8 ±4.3 Mg C ha–1. Although dura-tion of management was not clearly defined in this survey(5–40 yr), a reasonable assumption was for an average ageof 20 yr (for no tillage). With this assumption, the averagerate of SOC sequestration of no tillage over that of conven-tional tillage would have been 0.29 Mg C ha–1yr–1and wouldhave been in relatively good agreement with other estimatesof SOC sequestration following adoption of no-tillage man-agement of cropland (Lal, Kimble, Follett, & Cole, 1998 ).Assuming that calculated SOC sequestration derived fromthe depth distribution method was a function of the past40 yr of management, then SOC sequestration rates wouldhave been 0.16 ±0.11 Mg C ha–1yr–1under conventionaltillage, 0.31 ±0.13 Mg C ha–1yr–1under no tillage, and0.54±0.23 Mg C ha–1yr–1under perennial pasture. This tem-poral assumption was combined with the assumption that soilstarted from a highly degraded SOC base condition, whichseems reasonable with >200 yr of crop cultivation in theregion and numerous reports of widespread and intensive soilerosion (Endale et al., 2000 ; Galang et al., 2007 ; Langdale &Shrader, 1982 ; McGregor et al., 1975 ).This survey illustrated clearly the increasingly greaterpotential for SOC sequestration when transitioning fromconventional-tillage to no-tillage cropping to perennial pas-ture in the southeastern United States. The survey wasstructured so that all three land uses were in the same localvicinity but not necessarily from the same farm. These pair-ings were repeated within a state and physiographic regionand across the five states. Therefore, a diversity of man-agement choices within these broad categories would haveoccurred among observations. Despite such variations, therewas relatively low residual variation, with standard error of1 . 7M gCh a–1for calculated SOC sequestration. This levelof variation was similar to residual variation from other con-trolled studies on research stations (1.5 ±0 . 7M gCh a–1;Tables 1–5).3.6 Corn production in the southeasternUnited States (Study SE-2)From a survey of corn production fields in the Carolinasand Virginia, the base SOC stock varied considerably more 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

The Portsmouth loamhad calculated SOC sequestration of 4.9 Mg C ha–1, and the McColl loamhad calculated SOC sequestration of 39.1 Mg C ha–1. BD, bulk density;SD, soil depththan in other studies (i.e., 15.6–67.6 Mg C ha–1at 5thand95thpercentile limits). This variation was due to severalunique soil types in the Coastal Plain and Blue Ridge regionsthat had much greater residual basal SOC concentrations at30-cm depth than more typical upland soils of the region.These unique soil types were, however, useful in demonstrat-ing the value of the soil depth distribution method in cal-culating SOC sequestration (Figure 2). Despite having highSOC throughout the plow layer, the Portsmouth loam shownin Figure 2had muted SOC depth stratification due to man-agement with disk tillage for several years. The McColl loam,however, had low basal SOC concentration and reflected the∼20 yr of no-till management that led to significantly greaterSOC sequestration. Note the SOC concentration and BD dif-ferences between soil types in Figure 2.Despite large variation in base SOC stock due to drained-organic soils compared with upland-mineral soils, calculatedSOC sequestration was always greater with no-till cropping(26.1±1.1 Mg C ha–1; mean±SE) than with conventional-till cropping (10.3 ±2.3 Mg C ha–1) in all states and phys-iographic regions (Table 7). Therefore, using basal SOC con-centration at 30-cm depth (kg m–3) as a normalizing factor foreach soil type was critical in making a reasonable and reliableestimate of SOC sequestration in these fields across a diver-sity of soil types. The ratio of calculated SOC sequestrationto that of the baseline SOC stock was 0.38 ±0.13 under con-ventional tillage and 1.11 ±0.07 under no tillage.Most numerous field observations were in the North Car-olina Piedmont with no tillage, the North Carolina CoastalPlain with no tillage, and the Virginia Great Valley with notillage. There was no difference in calculated SOC sequestra-tion between the North Carolina Piedmont with no tillage andthe Virginia Great Valley with no tillage, but both of theseregions had greater SOC sequestration than the North Car-olina Coastal Plain with no tillage (28.2 vs. 19.6 Mg C ha–1,respectively; p=.001). Other regions had only a few siteseach, and estimates can only be considered preliminary. Thereis need for more observations in all regions.3.7 Overall assessmentsConsidering that most fields were privately managed in Stud-ies SE-1 and SE-2, they could be viewed as randomly dis-tributed observations across the region. Therefore, frequencydistributions of calculated SOC sequestration were plottedin Figure 3. Under both conventional-tillage and no-tillagemanagement, there was a relatively wide range of calcu-lated SOC sequestration (i.e., 0.3–14.5 Mg C ha–1underconventional tillage [range, 5–95% range] and 6.6–39.0 MgCh a–1under no tillage). However, it was clear that cal-culated SOC sequestration was much more likely greaterwith no tillage than with conventional tillage in the surface30 cm of soil, wherein the interquartile range (IQR) was3.7–8.2 Mg C ha–1under conventional tillage and 13.3–27.3 Mg C ha–1under no tillage. Additionally, calculated SOCsequestration was affected ( p<.05) by physiographic regionwhen cropland was under no tillage (i.e., 15.5 ±1.5 Mg C ha–1in the Coastal Plain <24.1±1.3 Mg C ha–1in thePiedmont =27.5±1.9 Mg C ha–1in the Great Val-ley=27.9±6.1 Mg C ha–1in the Blue Ridge). Underpastures, calculated SOC sequestration was greater in thePiedmont than the Coastal Plain (24.1 vs. 18.1 Mg C ha–1,respectively; p=.04). No difference in calculated SOCsequestration occurred among regions when cropland wasunder conventional tillage.Although SOC sequestration could theoretically occurbelow 30 cm depth in the southeastern United States, theeffect would appear to be extremely small and likely takedecades to centuries of conservation management to pro-duce statistically significant changes. Soils of the southeasternUnited States simply have little propensity for sequestration ofSOC deeper in the profile (Franzluebbers, 2010 ; Franzlueb-bers & Stuedemann, 2009 ; Garten & Wullschleger, 1999 ;M aet al., 2000 ), and repeated claims to sample deeper in the pro-file than the surface 30 cm need to be tempered with real-istic expectations. These results indicate that SOC concen-tration at 30-cm depth varies relatively little among soils of 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Data are based on SOC depth distribution calculations reported in Causarano et al.(2008), Franzluebbers ( 2018 ), and Franzluebbers ( 2020 ). Soil organic C sequestration was 4.2, 5.7, and 9.4 Mg C ha–1at 25, 50, and 75thpercentiles,respectively, for conventional tillage (CT); 13.6, 20.8, and 29.7 Mg C ha–1at 25, 50, and 75thpercentiles, respectively, for no tillage (NT); and 15.9,19.3, and 26.1 Mg C ha–1at 25, 50, and 75thpercentiles, respectively, for pasturesimilar nature, such as Ultisols that dominate throughout thesoutheastern United States. Some unique soil types may havegreater or lower SOC concentrations, but the IQR of SOC at30-cm depth was 3.7–6.5 g kg–1(Figure 3).Although management-induced SOC sequestration may belimited to the surface 30 cm in the southeastern United States,this study demonstrated there is large accumulation potentialthat has been realized on many farms using conservation man-agement approaches. If a 50-yr period were to be used as thetime period of SOC sequestration, then interquartile estimatesfrom Figure 3would have been 0.08–0.19 Mg C ha–1yr–1for conventional tillage and 0.2– 0.59 Mg C ha–1yr–1for notillage.

The more robust estimation from this evaluation is theabsolute estimate of SOC sequestration independent of time.A reasonable target of calculated SOC sequestration should beto achieve at least the quantity in the base SOC stock, whichseemed plausible in many of the studies reported here (i.e.,50% base SOC stock and 50% calculated SOC sequestration).However, a more aggressive approach to SOC sequestrationmay be to double that of the base SOC stock (i.e., 33% baseSOC stock and 67% calculated SOC sequestration), which wasachieved in only 6% of the cases in these studies. In this man-ner, targets for SOC sequestration in different soil types andregions could be set not by an absolute rate of SOC accumula-tion but by a proportion of that determined by the basal SOCcondition. This would allow each soil type to meet its poten-tial based more on inherent capacities rather than on arbitrarylevels that may be easy or difficult to achieve. However, thisidea needs to be validated with further testing.Although this evaluation had some estimations of SOCsequestration from pastures on research station experimentsand from private farms (Study SE-1), it is clear that additionalfield investigations of pastures on private farms is needed toget good estimates of SOC sequestration, especially using top-tier management. Estimated SOC sequestration from pastureson research stations reported here was 23.1–34.2 Mg C ha–1in the IQR ( n=132), which was greater than the IQR for the29 fields mostly in the land use comparison of SE-1. Signif-icant SOC sequestration appears to be possible with pasturemanagement. In Study SE-1, pastures were selected only asnearby fields to the target field of no-tillage cropland; specificpasture management was not documented. Results of StudyGA-1 with 12 yr of different forage utilization of pasture illus-trates that variations in SOC sequestration will be importantby management style. Therefore, more research is needed onprivate farms to determine what these levels might be and howthey vary with management style and among farms.In this calculation of SOC sequestration among land usesin the southeastern United States, simulated BD was from apedotransfer function derived from long-term management ata research station in the middle of the region. Direct com-parison of predicted soil BD with measured BD showed gen-eral agreement between the two approaches (Figure 4). Rootmean square error associated with the 1:1 association was0.15 Mg m–3. However, if 10 and 25% of observations withthe most deviation were trimmed from each of the three datasources, then RMSE would have been 0.12 and 0.10 Mg m–3,respectively. This seemed like acceptable variation in BDalong the entire range of normal BD levels of 0.7–1.7 Mg m–3for the wide diversity soils in the southeastern United States.FIGURE 4 Comparison of bulk density predicted from the pedo-transfer function (Equation 4; Franzluebbers ( 2010 )] against that mea-sured in the field with the core method. Data were from Study GA-2with five depth increments within the 0-to-30-cm depth, from Study SE-1 from three depth increments within 0-to-20-cm depth, and from StudySE-2 from three depth increments within the 0-to-30-cm depth. Therewere 177 observations for conventional tillage, 259 observations for notillage, and 110 observations for pasture. Dashed line is 1:1, and RMSEis deviation from this associationWith this reasonable accuracy and need to estimate BD in 5-cm increments to make SOC sequestration calculations, sim-ulated BD was considered the better choice for these calcu-lations. Measured BD could also be used, but separation intosmaller depth increments would be necessary, either directlythrough a series of 5-cm increments or indirectly with regres-sion analysis over several depth increments covering the rangeof conditions.It should be emphasized that this calculation procedurewas intended to make reasonable estimates of SOC sequestra-tion within a field from single-point-in-time measurements ofSOC depth distribution, which until now has not been consid-ered. This procedure would not reduce the need to continuelong-term studies to better estimate SOC sequestration withhigh accuracy, nor would it preclude initiating new field stud-ies to obtain spatial and temporal estimates of SOC sequestra-tion. However, adopting this procedure would facilitate manymore estimates of SOC sequestration among a diversity ofagricultural conditions throughout the region with the intentto build consensus around sound conservation agriculturalmanagement approaches. This procedure could be viewed asa validation and widespread low-cost survey supplement toresource-intensive field studies. The need to characterize awider diversity of management approaches remains a high pri-ority, and this SOC sequestration calculation method couldhelp meet this need. 14350661, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/saj2.20176 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

This calculation method assumesthat soils have undergone historic degradation, which is rea-sonable throughout much of the southeastern United States.Sequestration of SOC can then be implied from the accumu-lation of SOC greater than that of the baseline condition, setin this approach as the SOC concentration at 30-cm depth(kg m–3) expressed throughout the 0-to-30-cm profile. Cal-culations of SOC sequestration matched those reported fromtraditional approaches using randomized and spatially repli-cated plot experiments repeated over time. Conservation agri-cultural management treatments could be easily distinguishedin SOC sequestration potential from those of conventionaltillage cropland, which typically had smaller SOC seques-tration but significant values in some cases. This calculationmethod avoids the need for a paired plot or repeated measuresover time. This depth distribution method of SOC sequestra-tion illustrated that deficits of SOC could be as low as 33% ofpotential SOC storage and that this deficit can be filled withconservation agricultural management (e.g., 9–26 Mg C ha–1sequestered from the IQR of studies evaluated). This methodgives promise to estimating SOC sequestration from a widediversity of soil types and management systems throughoutthe southeastern United States and possibly beyond.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSErin Silva, Ellen Leonard, and Steven Knapp provided soundtechnical support over years of investigation that led to thissummary interpretation, and they are gratefully acknowl-edged.
