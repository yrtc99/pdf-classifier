This increase is due largely to two factors: the combustion of fossil fueland deforestation to create croplands and pastures. Deforestation results in anet ﬂux of carbon to the atmosphere because forests contain 20–50 times morecarbon per unit area than agricultural lands. In recent decades, the tropics havebeen the primary region of deforestation. The annual rate of CO2released dueto tropical deforestation during the early 1990s has been estimated at between1.2 and 2.3 gigatons C. The range represents uncertainties about both the ratesof deforestation and the amounts of carbon stored in different types of tropicalforests at the time of cutting. An evaluation of the role of tropical regions in theglobal carbon budget must include both the carbon ﬂux to the atmosphere dueto deforestation and carbon accumulation, if any, in intact forests.

This increase is duelargelytotwofactors: thecombustionoffossilfuelanddeforestationtocreatecroplands and pastures. Deforestation results in a net ﬂux of carbon to theatmosphere because forests contain 20–50 times more carbon per unit areathan agricultural lands. The importance of deforestation relative to fossil-fuelcombustion for the atmospheric CO2increase has changed over the past 200years. Prior to 1900, the emissions of carbon resulting from deforestationwere greater than those from fossil-fuel burning (1, 2, 3). Today, fossil-fueluse releases several times as much CO2into the atmosphere as deforestation(3). The regions undergoing deforestation have also changed over time. Intheeighteenthandnineteenthcenturies,theexpansionofcroplandsinEurope,Russia, and North America was the major cause of deforestation. Early inthe twentieth century, however, deforestation in these areas slowed; later inthe century, particularly after the end of World War II, deforestation in thetropical areas of Latin America, Africa, and Asia accelerated (4). By 1980,almost the entire ﬂux of CO2to the atmosphere resulting from deforestationwasfromthetropics(5);thereleaseofcarbonfromdeforestationintemperateand boreal regions was extremely small at that time (6).

Theﬁrsttwosurveysofpan-tropicaldeforestationwerethoseofMyers(7)andFAO/UNEP(9). Theyreporteddeforestationratesfor the late 1970s, and both considered closed forests. In the FAO/UNEP sur-vey, closed forests were deﬁned as dense forests that do not allow sufﬁcientpenetrationoflightforgrassestogrowontheforestﬂoor. TheMyersestimateofdeforestationforclosedforestsfortheentiretropicswas7.6 106hectares(ha) year−1, a rate only slightly higher than the 7.3 106ha year−1reportedby FAO/UNEP (Table 1). At the regional level, the estimates were the samefor Africa, but Myers’ estimate was 10% lower than FAO/UNEP’s for LatinAmerica and about 45% higher for Asia (Table 1).The FAO/UNEP survey also considered open forests, whereas the Myerssurveydidnot. Openforests,alsocalledwoodlandsandsavannas,havegrassespresent between trees or clumps of trees. According to the FAO/UNEP study,deforestationofopentropicalforestswasabout4 :0106hayear−1inthelate1970s. TheFAO/UNEPestimateforthetotalannualrateoftropicaldeforesta-tion, open plus closed, for the late 1970s was thus 11.3 106ha (Table 1).For the decade since the late 1970s, estimates of the rate of deforestation inthe tropics have increased substantially (Table 1). Myers (8) reported that theannual loss of closed forests had almost doubled, from 7.6 106ha year−1in1979to13.9106hayear−1in1989.

If these recently reported deforestation data for Brazil are betterestimates than the one used by Myers, the pan-tropical deforestation rate mayhave increased during the decade of the 1980s by about 41% rather than byMyers’ original estimate of just over 83% (Table 1).Carbon per Unit AreaForestsholdmorecarbonperunitareainvegetationandsoilsthantheecosys-tems that replace them. Carbon is released to the atmosphere through burningatthetimeofdeforestationandthroughdecayofplantmaterialandsoilorganicmatter in the years following. The amount of carbon released per unit areadepends on the amount of carbon held in forests and in the ecosystems thatreplace them; cleared lands may hold 20–50 times less carbon per unit areathan forests.VEGETATION Estimatesoftheamountofcarbonheldinthevegetationoftheclosed tropical forests of Latin America, Africa, and Asia differ by a factorof almost two (Table 3). The high estimates are based on direct, destructivesampling that involves cutting and weighing trees and other vegetation to de-termine plant carbon stocks. The low estimates are based on the volumes ofgrowing stocks of wood that are then converted to stocks of carbon (20–22).A comparison of the estimates of carbon stocks (Table 3) shows that thosebased on direct measurements (23–25) are generally similar to each other butare about twice the value of those derived from wood volumes (20). Recentwork by Brown et al (26) has revised the lower estimates upwards slightly forundisturbed closed forests (Table 3), but large differences remain between theestimates from the two approaches. In addition, Brown et al (26) note (Table3) that many areas that are being deforested today have already been partiallylogged, so the carbon stocks at the time of deforestation might even be lowerthan those estimated earlier by Brown & Lugo (20).Annu.

September 12, 1996 16:44 Annual Reviews MELLDUN.TXT AR016-11TROPICAL DEFORESTATION 299At least two factors have been identiﬁed that singly or in combination maycontribute to the differences between estimates from the two approaches (27).The ﬁrst is the representativeness of the two estimates. The direct biomassestimates have been based on vegetation sampled in fewer than 30 ha world-wide (26), whereas the volume-derived estimates of biomass have been basedon surveys of thousands of ha of closed tropical forest. Thus, the volume-basedestimatesmaybemorerepresentative,buttheyarenotwithoutproblems.Second, errors may still be present in the factors used to convert volumes ofmerchantable wood to total carbon stocks.Which set of estimates is more accurate is not clear (20, 27–29). Becauseof this, a number of studies that estimate carbon losses from land due to trop-ical deforestation have used both sets of estimates in a sensitivity-analysismode.SOILSSeveralestimateshavebeenmadeoftheamountoforganiccarboninthetopmeterofsoilintropicalforests.

Inaddition,someoftheanalysesalsoconsidertheabandonmentof croplands and pastures, the harvest of timber, and the establishment of treeplantations.Asforestsandwoodlandsareclearedforcroplands,shifting-cultivationplots,or pastures, some of the wood may be harvested for products that oxidizeat varying rates. Most of the above-ground biomass is burned and releasedimmediately to the atmosphere as CO2. The remainder of the above-groundandbelow-groundmaterialdecays. Theratesofdecayvarywithclimateandthechemicalcompositionoftheplantmaterial(34–36),butinthemoisttropicsmostmaterial decomposes within 10 years. A small fraction of the plant materialburned is converted to black carbon, which is resistant to decay (29, 37–41).Whencroplandsandpasturesareabandoned,theseareasmayreturntoforestsat rates determined by the intensity of disturbance and climatic factors (24,42).

September 12, 1996 16:44 Annual Reviews MELLDUN.TXT AR016-11TROPICAL DEFORESTATION 301The effect on soil carbon stocks of the conversion of forests to pastures ishighly variable. Some studies show a loss of carbon (29, 43, 45–53). On theother hand, under some conditions there appears to be no loss of soil carbon(54, 55), and there may even be an increase (49, 53, 56–60). Buschbacher etal (61) have suggested that these differences in pasture soil carbon are largelyrelated to the time since clearing and the intensity of use.Shifting cultivation is common in the tropics. It involves short periods ofcropping and long fallow periods, during which forests regrow. Because ofthe partial recovery of forests during the fallow period, deforestation for shift-ing cultivation releases less carbon to the atmosphere than deforestation forpermanent croplands or pastures. The length of the fallow period varies con-siderablyamongregions,owingtobothecologicalandculturaldifferences(62,63). The decay rates of plant debris resulting from the cutting, as well as theaccumulation rates for regrowing vegetation during the fallow periods, havebeen determined for a variety of ecosystems, especially in Latin America (24,64–66). Shifting cultivation results in less soil carbon loss through oxidationthan does continuous cultivation (43, 44).CALCULATING CARBON FLUX TO THE ATMOSPHEREFROM DEFORESTATIONSeveral accounting-type models, all with similar structures, have been used tocalculate the annual net ﬂux of carbon between the land and atmosphere thatresultfromdeforestation(67–69). Theﬁrstofthesetobedeveloped,theMarineBiological Laboratory/Terrestrial Carbon Model (MBL/TCM), has been usedsince the early 1980s (see e.g. 2, 4–6, 67, 70, 71). The MBL/TCM considersthe changes in terrestrial carbon stocks associated with clearing of forests foragriculture, and the changes associated with subsequent abandonment of theagriculturalplotsandtheregrowthofforests(Figure1). Intheyearofdeforesta-tion, a large amount of carbon is released through burning. Afterwards, decayofsoilorganicmatter,loggingdebris(slash),andwoodproductsreleasecarbonto the atmosphere. If the agricultural plots are abandoned, regrowth of livevegetationandredevelopmentofsoilorganicmatterwithdrawcarbonfromtheatmosphere and accumulate it on land. In the MBL/TCM, these changes havebeen deﬁned for various types of land use and ecosystems in various regionsof the tropics and other regions. Annual changes in the various reservoirs ofcarbon (live vegetation, soils, slash, and wood products) determine the annualnetﬂuxofcarbonbetweenthelandandatmosphere.

September 12, 1996 16:44 Annual Reviews MELLDUN.TXT AR016-11306 MELILLO ET ALdifference of about 3.9 Gt C in 1990 is presumed to be distributed among theoceans and terrestrial ecosystems. Ocean uptake has been estimated at about2.0GtC,withterrestrialecosystemsstoringtheremainderofthecarbon,about1.9 Gt. Are undisturbed tropical forests storing any of this carbon, and if so,what factor or set of factors is responsible for this storage?Recentreviewsoftheglobalcarbonbudgetsuggestthatthreefactorsleadtoincreased carbon storage: forest regrowth following harvest; nitrogen deposi-tion, especially downwind of the industrial and agricultural regions; and CO2fertilization(3,76,77). Theﬁrsttwofactorsarethoughttobeoperatingprimar-ily in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, whereas CO2fertilizationis considered to be operating globally, including in tropical forests.Both ﬁeld studies and theoretical models support the idea that CO 2fertil-ization of undisturbed tropical forests can result in enhanced carbon storagein terrestrial biomass. Two gas-ﬂux studies in undisturbed tropical forests ofBrazil’s Amazon Basin have shown that photosynthetic gains of carbon diox-ideexceededrespiratorylossesduringthemeasurementperiods. Fanetal(78)reported a net carbon uptake of about 0.06 g m−2day−1over a 50-day periodduring 1987 by an undisturbed forest near Manaus in the central Amazon.Graceetal(79)mademeasurementsofcarbondioxideﬂuxoverundisturbedtropical rain forest at Reserva Jaru, Rondonia, in the western Amazon Basinof Brazil, for 55 days spanning the wet and dry seasons of 1992–1993. In thedry season, the mean accumulation rate was 1. 1gCm−2day−1; in the wetseason the rate was 0. 6gCm−1day−1. They then developed a model thatrelated net carbon ﬂux to daily changes in light, humidity, and temperature(80). They used site-speciﬁc climatological data to run the model for 1 year(July1,1992—June30,1993). Overthisperiod,themodelestimatedacarbonaccumulationof102 24gCm−2year−1. IfalltherainforestsoftheBrazilianAmazon (400106ha) were behaving in the same way as Reserva Jaru, thecarbon accumulation in this region would be 0.41 Gt C year−1.Theoretical models also predict an accumulation of carbon in the world’stropical forests as a result of increased CO 2concentrations. Both Polglase &Wang (81) and Taylor & Lloyd (82) predict a net absorption by all tropicalforests worldwide of about 1 Gt C year−1at contemporary levels of atmo-spheric CO 2concentration. Melillo et al (77), using the Terrestrial EcosystemModel (TEM), have estimated that the observed increase in CO 2concentra-tion has lead to a net uptake of carbon in the tropics of about 0.5 Gt C year−1for 1990. Net carbon uptake results from an imbalance between net primaryproduction and heterotrophic, largely microbial, respiration. Simulations us-ingTEMsuggestthatsoonaftertheatmosphericCO2concentrationstabilizes,heterotrophic respiration comes into balance with net primary production andthe CO2-stimulated terrestrial carbon sink disappears.Annu.

When these estimates are combined, the tropical regions of the globeare estimated to be functioning as a net source of carbon to the atmosphere ofbetween 0.2 and 1.8 Gt C.Thisrangemustberegardedasverytentative.
