The response of SOC, greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-sions and economic income to different straw management methods in intensivewheat-maize double cropping systems still need systematical study. An 8-year fieldexperiment was conducted in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain to investigate the impacts ofoptimal straw management (wheat straw was all crushed and spread on the soil surface,maize straw was all crushed and returned t into 0-15 cm soil layer) and optimal strawmanagement (wheat straw was all crushed and spread on the soil surface , while maizestraw was all harvested for feed) on SOC sequestrations, carbon economy and eco-nomic income. The results showed that only returning wheat straw into the fieldcould maintain a similar crop yield (15.0 Mg ha/C01) and SOC sequestration amount(9.06 Mg C ha/C01) to the conventional straw management method. While this optimalstraw management method kept a stable SOC sequestration rate of1.24 Mg ha/C01yr/C01when the SOC sequestration rate decreased from 1.76 to1.20 Mg ha/C01yr/C01in the conventional method. The optimal management methodalso further reduced GHG emissions by 85.4% and using maize straw as stock feedincreased net income by 28.3%. Only returning wheat straw could realize economicand environmental benefits win-win in the wheat-maize double cropping systems,which provides important background knowledge about safe and sustainableagriculture.KEYWORDSfarming system, greenhouse gas emission, soil carbon sequestration, straw return, wheat-maizedouble cropping system1|INTRODUCTIONCrop straw is one of the important by-products of agricultural produc-tion, and has attracted increased attention in recent years. Strawreturn, as an important source of carbon to supplement the soil car-bon pool, is beneficial to soil quality and crop grain yield (Poeplauet al.,2015 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ). Since the early 2000 s, crop strawshave been returned to the field in China for these benefits facilitatedby the policy to prohibit straw burning (Liu et al., 2022 ). However,long-term excessive straw return into the field can cause poor soilconditions that are also prone to diseases, leading to decreased grainyield. This is particularly the case in the intensive cropping systems ofChina, where the total straw production can reach 1.04 billion tons (Liet al.,2017 ). This indicates an urgent need to optimize strawReceived: 9 October 2022 Revised: 27 December 2022 Accepted: 5 January 2023DOI: 10.1002/ldr.4610Land Degrad Dev. 2023;1 –12. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ldr © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 1management and develop a long-term strategy to achieve SOCsequestration while mitigating the adverse effects of crop strawreturn.Organic matter is the basis and core of soil fertility, which playsan important role in maintaining crop yield and agricultural environ-mental sustainability. SOC accounts for about 58% of the soil organicmatter mass, which can only be maintained through the input of car-bon and nutrients to avoid loss of soil quality. Straw return is a viableway of increasing SOC storage in most agricultural systems. In China,a meta-analysis revealed that crop straw return increased SOC by12% (Zhao et al.,2015 ). Straw retention and incorporation greatlyimproved soil fertility (Bu et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2018 ), which in turnincreased crop grain yield by 6.8 –12.3% (Han et al., 2018 ;Q iet al., 2019 ). Simultaneously, the SOC sequestration rate may declinewith time (Luo et al., 2014 ) and fresh carbon input may stimulate thedecomposition of existing SOC due to priming effects (Luoet al., 2015 ; Luo et al., 2016 ). A meta-analysis based on 176 field stud-ies found that continuous straws return increased SOC concentrationby about 12.8%, leading to much smaller or no additional SOC seques-tration after 12 years (Liu et al.,2014 ). In addition, excessive strawreturn damages soil carbon and nitrogen balance and reduces nitrogenuse efficiency and crop yield (Buysse et al.,2013 ; Fang, Nazaries,et al., 2018 ). In such cases, the use of part of the crop straw for otherpurposes like stock feed would result in a better economic return. InChina, the demand for straw feed is more than 15 million tons a year,and maize straw stalk feed has extensive development space andprospects. The straw harvest has been mechanized, which furtherimproved the efficiency of straw harvest.Straw management plays an important role in balancing SOCsequestration and environmental outcomes. Over the last decades,the amount of straw return increased continuously, which also pro-moted the increase of N2O emissions from farmland (Abalos, Recous,et al., 2022 ). The global N 2O emission contributed by straw return isover 0.87 million tons (FAO, 2021 ). On the positive side, the SOCsequestration by straw return can regulate atmospheric GHG concen-trations, by offsetting part of the GHG emissions from farmland(Muhammad et al.,2019 ). In addition, improving crop straw utilizationefficiency can directly reduce CO 2emissions. A large portion of strawcarbon is re-released back into the atmosphere after being returnedto the field. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of SOC sequestra-tion, GHG emission, and farmland income is greatly significant to con-struct sustainable and low-carbon production models.Coordinating straw return and feeding rate may be a useful wayto maintain the crop yield and the SOC sequestration while reducingfarmland GHG emissions. Here we present data from an 8-year fieldexperiment on the effects of straw management on grain yield andSOC of the intensive winter wheat-summer maize double croppingsystem. Our objectives were to; (1) investigate how retention of cropstraw from one or both crops impacts the crop productivity andSOC (2) analyze the carbon economy by GHG emissions produced perunit amount of crop yield or economic return; and (3) discuss long-term straw management strategies that increase economic return,maintain crop productivity and increase SOC sequestration. This studychallenges the general view that more straw return leads to more car-bon sequestration, and can be used as a reference for improving strawmanagement that optimizes soil carbon sequestration and carboneconomy.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Site descriptionThe study was started in October 2012, to investigate the impacts ofdifferent tillage methods. The study site is located at Longshan Experi-mental Base of Maize Research Institute, Shandong Academy of Agri-cultural Sciences, China (117/C14320E, 36/C14430N), which is close to themiddle of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, characterized by a temperatecontinental monsoon climate. The experiment was conducted fromOctober 2012 to 2020, and the average annual rainfall and tempera-ture were 600.8 mm and 12.8/C14C. The sunshine duration and frost-freeseason were over 2500 hr and 200 d. The soil type of the study site isEutrochrepts, with 1.48% organic carbon, 0.85 g kg/C01total nitrogen,19.3 g kg/C01available phosphorus, 46.4 g kg/C01available potassium,and pH in the 0 –20 cm soil of 7.6 at the start of the experiment in2012. The winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system is thedomain cropping system in the study region.2.2 |Experimental designTwo straw management methods were carried out in the experiment,that is, conventional and optimal methods. In the conventional strawmanagement method, both wheat and maize were harvested with acombine harvester, while crop straw was crushed and spread on thesoil surface. In the optimal method, wheat straw was crashed andspread on the surface at harvest, while maize straw was sold as fodderafter harvest. For both straw management methods, maize stubblewas pulverized and rotary tillage was carried out before wheat sow-ing. Maize was planted directly without ploughing after the wheatharvest. The field operation process is shown in Figure1.Each straw management method had three replicates, and eachreplicate had a plot area of 18 /C245 m2. Winter wheat variety “Jimai22”was sown from October 15 to October 18 with row spacing ofabout 24 cm (the width of the planting row is 8 cm) and with a seedrate of about 173 kg ha/C01. The winter wheat was harvested from June8 to June 12 in the next year. Summer maize variety “Ludan 9066 ”was sown from June 15 to 18 June with an average row spacing of60 cm and plant density of 75,000 plants ha/C01. The maize was har-vested from October 8 to 12 October. Both the wheat and maizewere mechanically sown and harvested.The irrigation and fertilizer management in both treatments wereconsistent with the local traditional management methods. Wheatwas irrigated at the sowing, jointing, and flowering stages, each with60 mm of water. Maize was irrigated (60 mm) after sowing to ensurethe emergence of seedlings. A water meter was used to accurately2 WANG ET AL. 1099145x, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4610 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2023].

The basal fertilizer for both wheatand maize was compound fertilizer of 600 kg ha/C01(N, P 2O5, and K 2Ocontent were 102 kg ha/C01, respectively). And topdressing is225 kg ha/C01of urea for both wheat and maize (at the jointing stage ofwinter wheat and the twelve-leaf stage of summer maize). A mechani-cal ditch was used for base fertilizer at sowing. Fertilizers were top-dressed manually before irrigation or rainfall to reduce fertilizer lossvia volatilization. Pests, diseases, and weeds during crop growth wereproperly controlled.2.3 |Field measurements2.3.1 | Crop biomass and grain yieldDuring the wheat harvest period, three 1-m2plots were randomlysampled in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured afteroven-dried at 80/C14C. In each treatment, wheat ears from three 1 m2plots of the undisturbed area were harvested to measure wheat grainyield. During the maize harvest period, 3 rows, each with two plantswas randomly sampled and oven-dried at 80/C14C for biomass measure-ments. The number of ears per ha, the percentage of empty stalks,and the percentage of double ears were counted. Three 12-m2ears ofmaize from the undisturbed area were harvested to determine thegrain number per ear, the water content of grains, the weight of500 grains, and the yield of maize grains was calculated.2.3.2 | SOC and bulk densitySoil samples from 0 –20, 20 –40, 40 –60, 60 –80, and 80 –100 cm layerswere collected after maize harvest each year. A soil auger with a diam-eter of 30 mm was used to collect 5 random points in each plot. Afternatural air drying, soil samples were cleared of crop residues and othersundries, then ground and put through a 2 mm screen for later use.The SOC content was determined using a Vario TOC analyzer(Elementar, Germany).Soil bulk density (BD, g cm/C03) was measured after the maize har-vest, in undisturbed soil layers taken from each plot with borers(50 mm long, 50.5 mm radius) (Zhang et al.,2022 ). The BD of each soillayer was measured with the ring knife method with borers (100 cm3volume and 50 mm diameter).2.4 |Calculations2.4.1 | Crop C inputCrop C input ( Cinput,M gh a/C01) comes from crop straw, stubble, roots,root exudates, and seeds.

The C inputs from thewheat and maize root exudates were considered to be equal to thatof their roots (Bolinder et al.,1999 ).2.4.2 | SOC stock and sequestration rateThe SOC stock ( Cstock,M gCh a/C01) and the SOC sequestration rate(Crate,M gCh a/C01yr/C01) were calculated by the following equation:Cstock¼C/C2BD/C2H/C20:1/C1/C1/C1 ð 6ÞCsequestration ¼Cstock/C0C0stock/C1/C1/C1 ð 7ÞCrate¼Cstock/C0Cinitial ðÞn/C1/C1/C1 ð 8ÞWhere: C( gCk g/C01) was SOC content and BD (g cm/C03) was bulk den-sity.

In this study, indirect C losses such as leachingand runoff are not considered due to the smaller contribution to thetotal C loss.

Cgrainis the C content ofcrop grains, the average grain C content of wheat and maize was 0.48and 0.47 Mg Mg/C01, respectively, measured using the K 2Cr2O7–H2SO4oxidation method (Nelson & Sommers, 1982 ).To calculate the C loss (C loss,M gCh a/C01yr/C01), as follows:Closs¼Cinput/C0Csequestration /C0Charvest /C1/C1/C1 ð 10ÞWhere: C input (Mg C ha/C01yr/C01) is the total C from crops put into thesoil.

The average annual Cinput in optimal and conventional straw management methods was6.07 Mg C ha/C01and 9.31 Mg C ha/C01, respectively (Figure 2a,b). Thecarbon inputs into the wheat-maize double cropping system weremainly from carbon fixation by the photosynthesis of wheat andmaize. The number of carbon inputs by seeds was very minimal com-pared to the carbon fixed by the crop (Figure2c).For both straw management, the average annual C input fromroots, stubble root exudates, and seeds were estimated as 3.04 –3.09,2.14–2.21, 3.04 –3.09, and 0.10 Mg ha/C01, respectively, with no signifi-cant difference between the two straw management methods(Figure2c). The difference mainly attributed to different amounts ofstraw input. This also resulted in the difference in C input betweenthe optimal and conventional straw management, with the annualaverage input of 2.31 and 5.90 Mg C ha/C01, respectively (Figure 2d).3.2 |Grain carbon harvestThe average total crop grain yields over 8 years in optimal and con-ventional straw management were 14.95 Mg ha/C01and14.98 Mg ha/C01, respectively, with no statistically significant difference(p> 0.1) (Figure 3). Maize yield in the optimal method is 4.08% lowerthan conventional, but wheat yield in the optimal method is 5.99%higher than conventional. There was no significant difference in theannual grain C harvest between the optimal and conventional strawmanagement, which were 6.25 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01and 6.27 Mg Cha/C01yr/C01, respectively (Figure 3). Compared with conventional strawmanagement, the grain C harvest of wheat in optimal straw manage-ment increased by 5.99%, while that of maize decreased by 5.20%, asa result of the relative change in grain yields.3.3 |Soil carbon sequestrationBoth optimal and conventional straw management led to an increasein SOC stocks in the 8 years of the experimental period (Figure 4). Atthe end of the 8-year experiment, SOC amounts in the whole soil pro-file (0 –100 cm) increased by 9.06 and 9.57 Mg C ha/C01in optimal andconventional straw managements, respectively (Figure 4c). Thisimplies that a more than doubled amount of straw return in conven-tional straw management (108 Mg ha/C01) only led to 5% more SOCsequestration after 8 years. The C sequestration rate in conventionalstraw management decreased from 1.76 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01in 2014 to1.20 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01in 2020, while the SOC sequestration rate inoptimal straw management remained nearly constant (Figure 4).20122013 2014 20152016 20172018 20192020 202101020304050607080Cumulative crop C input (Mg C ha-1)Years Conventional Optimal(a)* ** * * * * *Conventional Optimal3456789101112131415TreatmentsAverage crop C input (Mg C ha-1 yr-1)(b)Mean: 9.31bMean: 6.07aConventional Optimal0246810Average crop C input (Mg C ha-1 yr-1)Treatments Seeds Secretion Residual Root Straw(c)ab20132014201520162017201820192020.2013201420152016201720182019202002468Straw C input (Mg C ha-1)Years Maize Wheat(d)Converntional Optimal********FIGURE 2 Cumulative crop carbon input (a), average crop carbon input (b), composition of crop carbon input (c), and crop straw carbon input(d) in two different straw return treatments.

The average annual C loss inconventional straw management was 1.86 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01, and thetotal C loss increased with the increase of duration, reaching 14.9 MgCh a/C01after 8 years. These results demonstrate that the total SOCsequestration and C harvest in grain were much less than the totalcarbon inputs. However, in the optimal straw management, the C losswas negative, implying the total SOC sequestration and C harvest ingrain was more than the total C inputs. The average annual gain ofcarbon in optimal straw management was 1.34 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01, witha total grain C of 10.7 Mg C ha/C01after 8 years.3.5 |Carbon use efficiencyThe SOC sequestration per unit C input was 54.2% higher in optimalstraw management than that in conventional straw management, andboth of them decreased with time (Figure 7a,b). The average grainyield produced per unit C input in optimal straw management was1.04 Mg Mg/C01, 54.8% higher than that in conventional straw manage-ment due to the removal of maize straw in optimal straw managementnot being considered as carbon input into the system (Figure 7).3.6 |Economic and environmental benefitsThe net income of optimal straw management was 3299 USD ha/C01,which was 727 USD ha/C01(28.3%) higher than that in conventionalstraw management (Figure 8a). The difference was mainly due to theincome of maize straw as feed in optimal straw management, andreduced labor and machine costs of crushing maize straw and return-ing it to the field. The total GHG emission in the optimal straw man-agement was 3.27 Mg CO2-eq ha/C01yr/C01, which was only 22.2% ofthe 14.7 Mg CO 2-eq ha/C01yr/C01in conventional straw management(Figure 8b).The GHG emission to produce unit grain yield in optimal strawmanagement was 0.23 CO 2-eq Mg/C01, which was only 22% of that in1008060402002468 1 0 1 210080604020- 2 - 1 01234567SOC content (g kg-1)Soil depth (cm) Conventional (2013) Optimal (2013) Conventional (2020) Optimal (2020)(a)SOC sequestration (Mg ha-1)Soil depth (cm) Conventional Optimal(b)FIGURE 5 Soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in 2012 and 2020 (a) and SOC sequestration (b) during 8 years of treatments.

Sim-ilarly, the GHG emissions per net income in optimal straw manage-ment were reduced by a factor of 5.54 as compared to that inconventional straw management (Figure8d).4|DISCUSSION4.1 |Soil carbon sequestrationEight years of straw management experiments in this study indicatedthat soil carbon sequestration did not respond linearly to C input, forexample, more C input resulted in little change in SOC (Figure4a–c).The average annual C input in the conventional straw managementmethod (wheat +maize straw) was 3.24 Mg C ha/C01more than that inthe optimal management (wheat straw), while only resulted in0.07 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01more SOC sequestration. The quantity and qual-ity of carbon input as well as energy availability in the soil determinesthe substrate utilization by microorganisms therefore on long-termSOC sequestration (Wang et al.,2022 ). Compared with wheat straw,maize straw has higher C:N and lignin content, which was harder todecompose. After harvesting maize, the maize straw was retained andincorporated into the soil during a winter season with lowtemperatures and rainfall, which was not conducive to microbial activ-ity and straw decomposition (Buranov & Mazza,2008 ; Tharayilet al., 2011 ). In addition, as the annual straw production could reach20 Mg ha/C01(/C2410 Mg C ha/C01) in the wheat-maize double croppingsystems, conventional straw management (wheat +maize straw) mayexceed the soil humification capacity as a result of the imbalancebetween C and nutrient inputs (Cui et al., 2020 ; Kirkby et al., 2013 ).Adding more carbon-rich but nutrient-poor (N, P, S) maize straws maylimit microbial carbon use efficiency (Fang, Singh, et al.,2018 ; Kirkbyet al., 2014 ).In this study, the SOC sequestration rate of conventional strawmanagement decreased from 1.76 Mg ha/C01yr/C01in 2012 to1.20 Mg ha/C01yr/C01in 2020, while the rate in optimal straw manage-ment was relatively stable (1.24 Mg ha/C01yr/C01). This indicated that theSOC under the conventional straw management method was going toreach SOC equilibrium more quickly. SOC in optimal straw manage-ment may take more time to reach SOC equilibrium and get a largerequilibrated SOC eventually. Previous studies also showed that theannual sequestration rate reached a peak at about 10 years and con-tinued at lesser rates over another 16 years (West & Six,2007 ), whilethe sequestration rates and durations can differ greatly between indi-vidual sites and management practices (Berhane et al.,2020 ;Kechavarzi et al., 2010 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ).2012 201320142015 2016201720182019202020210.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.402012 201320142015 2016201720182019202020210.40.60.81.01.21.4 Conventional OptimalSoil C sequestration per unit C input (Mg Mg-1)Years(a)* * * * * * * *Conventional Optimal0.050.100.150.200.250.300.35TreatmentsSoil C sequestration per unit C input (Mg Mg-1)(c)(b)aMean: 0.13bMean: 0.20 Conventional OptimalGrain yield per unit C input (Mg Mg-1)Years(c)* * * * * * * *Conventional Optimal0.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.01.11.21.31.4TreatmentsGrain yield per unit C input (Mg Mg-1)(d)bMean: 0.67aMean: 1.04FIGURE 7 Soil C sequestration (a-b) and grain yield (c-d) per unit C input in two straw return treatments.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License4.2 |Carbon loss and GHG emissionThe carbon loss and GHG emission in conventional straw manage-ment were 11.43 Mg CO 2-eq ha/C01yr/C01more than that in optimalstraw management (Figures 2and6). Higher carbon input resulted inlittle change in SOC sequestration, yet leading to more CO 2and N 2Oemissions from crop residue (Abalos, Rittl, et al., 2022 ;W uet al., 2022 ). SOC sequestration in conventional straw management(more carbon input) could not offset more GHG emissions, whichshowed less carbon neutralization potential (Luo et al.,2017 ; Wanget al., 2018 ).In our study, N 2O emissions were calculated according to thedefault nitrogen input (chemical nitrogen and straw nitrogen) emissioncoefficients of IPCC 2019. This is widely recognized by relevantresearch around the world. Other factors including soil type, tempera-ture, water content, and farmland management, also affect N2O emis-sions (Zhou et al., 2017 ), which was not considered here.4.3 |Opportunities for improving strawmanagement of intensive farming systemsBased on analysis of the data from the 8-year straw managementexperiment, our results clearly showed that retention of wheat strawwas a much better option than retention of both wheat and maizestraw in the wheat-maize double cropping systems in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Single (wheat) straw retention led to similar crop grainyield and total soil C sequestration after 8 years, with much greaternet income and less total GHG emissions. This provides the scientificbasis for optimizing long-term straw management in these highly pro-ductive agroecosystems to maximize both economic and environmen-tal benefits, and maintain crop productivity while increasing systemssustainability. Our results demonstrate that in the wheat-maize sys-tem, maize straw should be better used for stock feed for economicpurposes, rather than returned to the field for soil carbonsequestration.In this study, we used empirical values to calculate crop carboninputs in the forms of crop residue (not straw), roots, and root exu-dates (Fan et al.,2014 ; Liu et al., 2019 ) as well as the indirect emis-sions, which may over-or underestimate these carbon terms,however, such uncertainty is unlikely to change the general conclu-sions as the difference in the amount of straw return between thetwo straw management dominated the SOC inputs. We assumed thatthe maize straw in conventional straw management was used and soldfor stock feed. This is a reasonable assumption because maize straw issuitable for fodder, and it has been increasingly used in that way toobtain additional economic income due to the increased emphasis onmeat production.

Return of the straw from both crops is likely toexceed the humification capacity of the soil, leading to no benefit interms of productivity and soil C sequestration in the long term. Onlyreturning wheat straw into the field, and using maize straw as stockfeed, led to increased net income and reduced field GHG emissions,while maintaining crop productivity and soil carbon sequestration,realizing economic and environmental benefits a win-win result.AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTIONSLiang Wang: conceptualization, investigation, methodology, data cura-tion, writing-original draft, writing-review and editing.
