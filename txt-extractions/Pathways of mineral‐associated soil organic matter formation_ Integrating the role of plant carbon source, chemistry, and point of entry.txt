However, much debate and contradictory evidencepersist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primar-ily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether Csubstrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformationprior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparateviews on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processesthat link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, becausebelowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions ofthe mineral soil, we propose that fine ‐scale differences in microbial abundanceshould determine the probability of substrate –microbe vs. substrate –mineral interac-tion. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizo-sphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivomicrobial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized withhigh microbial carbon ‐use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. Incontrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil),MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact orpartially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing theimportance of carbon ‐use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong “sorptiveaffinity. ”Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs.abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatiallydictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soilorganic matter dynamics across different spatial scales.KEYWORDSmineral ‐associated organic matter, rhizodeposition, root carbon, shoot carbon, soil carbon,sorptive affinity, substrate use efficiency, terrestrial carbon cycleReceived: 15 January 2018 |Accepted: 6 August 2018DOI: 10.1111/gcb.1448212|©2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/gcb Glob Change Biol. 2019;25:12 –24.1|INTRODUCTIONSoil organic matter (SOM), the largest terrestrial carbon (C) pool,accumulates through the continual deposition of plant C inputs intosoil. While the majority of that C is mineralized by soil microorgan-isms and respired into the atmosphere over short timescales, a por-tion cycles through the soil slowly, persisting for centuries tomillennia before turnover (Dungait, Hopkins, Gregory, & Whitmore,2012). Much attention has been directed toward understanding howplant C inputs form this slow ‐cycling SOM, and how it will respondto environmental changes, including soil warming, the spread of inva-sive species, and land use changes (Crowther et al., 2016; Sander-man, Hengl, & Fiske, 2017; Tamura, Suseela, Simpson, Powell, &Tharayil, 2015). Indeed, the behavior of this slow ‐cycling SOM poolover the course of this century will help determine whether the soilacts as a C sink, or instead acts as a C source to the atmosphere,further accelerating climate change (Bradford et al., 2016).Over the last two decades, substantial progress has been madein understanding how plant C inputs are transformed to slow ‐cyclingSOM. These advancements, which have been collectively describedas the “emerging view ”(sensu Lehmann & Kleber, 2015), havehelped displace long ‐held hypotheses around SOM formation andloss. Most notably, the current understanding is that the slowestcycling fraction of the SOM pool primarily consists of relatively smalland recognizable biomolecules which interact with the surfaces ofmineral particles, forming “mineral ‐associated organic matter ”(MAOM) (Kelleher & Simpson, 2006; Piccolo, 2002; Sutton & Spos-ito, 2005). While not all MAOM persists in the soil over long ‐termtimescales (e.g., Keiluweit et al., 2015), a subset of organic C com-pounds within the MAOM pool can persist for hundreds or thou-sands of years before turning over. The organic compounds withinthis slow ‐cycling MAOM pool generally exhibit both strong physio-chemical sorption to the solid phase (e.g., through strong ligandexchange interactions) and spatial separation from soil microorgan-isms (e.g., via occlusion within microaggregates) (Dungait et al.,2012; Lützow et al., 2006; Mikutta & Kaiser, 2011).Despite significant progress toward a synthetic understanding ofthe emerging view of slow ‐cycling MAOM formation (Cotrufo, Wallen-stein, Boot, Denef, & Paul, 2013), there are still critical conceptual gaps.Together, these gaps impede a unified conceptual model of how differ-ent plant C inputs form MAOM. Here, we address two main unrecon-ciled ideas, as they specifically relate to the formation of MAOM fromrelatively low molecular weight (LMW) C substrates —defined here asapproximately <600 Da —as these are posited to be the dominant con-stituent of the slow ‐cycling MAOM pool (Lehmann & Kleber, 2015).First, there are contrasting accounts around the importance ofaboveground vs. belowground plant inputs as the primary source ofC to the mineral soil. Several recent studies have shown the primacyof the root pathway in forming MAOM (Austin, Wickings, McDaniel,Robertson, & Grandy, 2017; Sokol, Kuebbing, Karlsen ‐Ayala, & Brad-ford, 2018), whereas others have demonstrated that abovegroundinputs —especially dissolved organic matter from leaf litter leachatein high ‐leaching systems —can also significantly contribute to mineralsoil C stocks (Michalzik, Tipping, & Mulder, 2003; Kalbitz & Kaiser,2008). Second, once plant C reaches the mineral soil and is of suffi-ciently small size, there is conflicting evidence around the primarypathway by which these LMW C substrates are incorporated intothe slow ‐cycling MAOM pool. Some authors assert that the majorityof LMW C in MAOM is microbial ‐derived, because C inputs haveundergone microbial assimilation, biosynthesis, and turnover prior toincorporation into MAOM —referred to as the “in vivo microbialturnover pathway ”(sensu Liang, Schimel, & Jastrow, 2017) (Bradford,Keiser, Davies, Mersmann, & Strickland, 2013; Cotrufo et al., 2013;Gleixner, 2013; Kallenbach, Frey, & Grandy, 2016). Others, however,have shown that MAOM can be primarily composed of directlysorbed plant compounds —referred to as “the direct sorption path-way ”(Kramer, Sanderman, Chadwick, Chorover, & Vitousek, 2012;Sanderman, Maddern, & Baldock, 2014). Even though these directlysorbed plant compounds are often partially oxidized and mobilizedby the action of microbial extracellular enzymes prior to mineral ‐sorption, they do not pass through a microbial body and thus showa clear plant ‐derived signature within the MAOM pool (Sandermanet al., 2014).It is critical to understand the relative importance of in vivomicrobial turnover vs. direct sorption, because these two pathwaysare primarily governed by biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOMdynamics, respectively. By extension, they should favor different bio-chemical and physicochemical properties of LMW C substrates forefficient incorporation into the MAOM pool. Specifically, throughthe in vivo microbial turnover pathway, microbial ecophysiology, aswell as the biochemical quality of a C substrate, should act as thefirst set of controls on the efficiencey of MAOM formation, as theyinfluence the efficiency by which the microbial community convertsthat C to microbial biomass and other metabolites vs. the amountthat it respires as CO2(termed “carbon ‐use efficiency ”) (Bradfordet al., 2013; Kallenbach et al., 2016). The greater production ofmicrobial residues should translate to more C compounds that aresubsequently available for mineral ‐sorption (Cotrufo et al., 2013). Incontrast, through the direct sorption pathway, carbon ‐use efficiencydoes not play a key role. Rather, the mineralogy of the soil, as wellas the “sorptive affinity ”of a particular LMW plant C substrate tothe solid phase, should determine whether a C compound will beretained as MAOM or leached from the mineral soil (Torn, Trumbore,Chadwick, & Vitousek, 2015).Here, we aim to reconcile the divergent ideas around MAOMformation that arise from the in vivo microbial turnover vs. directsorption pathways. We integrate and build upon prior conceptualframeworks (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Kaiser & Kalbitz, 2012; Guggen-berger & Kaiser, 2003) to propose that biotic and abiotic controls onMAOM are not mutually exclusive, but rather operate in spatiallydistinct microregions of the upper mineral soil (i.e., in “horizontal soilspace ”), which are supplied by different sources of plant C input. Asthe main focus of this framework is on how LMW C substratesmove from plant C source to the MAOM pool —primarily as dis-solved organic matter (Cotrufo et al., 2015) —we do not extensivelydiscuss the decomposition process that produces these LMW CSOKOL ET AL. |13 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Furthermore, we specifically discuss MAOM formation in mod-erately to well ‐drained mesic soils and hence under primarily oxicconditions, and thus do not examine other contexts of persistentSOM formation, such as slow ‐cycling SOC within anaerobic micro-sites (Keiluweit et al., 2017) or in environments where decomposi-tion is temperature ‐limited (e.g., permafrost soils).2|OVERVIEWOur framework is premised on the idea that once a LMW plant Csubstrate is in the upper mineral soil as dissolved organic matter, itcan form MAOM through one of two pathways: the in vivo microbialturnover pathway or the direct sorption pathway (Figure 1). TheseLMW C substrates include a range of assimilable compounds likesugars, amino acids, certain phenolic acids, and other aromatic com-pounds. Many of these compounds can enter the mineral soil fromboth aboveground and belowground plant C sources, such as foliarlitter leachate and root exudates (Kuiters & Sarink, 1986; McDowell& Likens, 1988; Zhalnina et al., 2018). We argue that which MAOMformation pathway a LMW C substrate will encounter, and whetherthat substrate 's eventual fate will be as MAOM, leached C, orrespired CO2is based on three inter ‐related hypotheses. We firstintroduce these hypotheses and then elaborate on them in the sub-sequent sections below.(Hypothesis I) The probability that a LMW plant Csubstrate will be incorporated into MAOM via thein vivo microbial turnover pathways vs. the directsorption pathway is determined by the extent ofmicrobial colonization on mineral surfaces at the sub-strate 's point of entry to the mineral soil.As a general rule, if a LMW substrate in the mineral soil is micro-bially accessible and assimilable, it will be accessed and assimilatedby the microbial community (Hedges & Oades, 1997; Weiss et al.,2004). Hence, greater microbial colonization of mineral surfaces at aC compound 's point of entry to the mineral soil should increase theprobability of microbial assimilation and anabolism. Throughout thesoil, microbial density is patchy and variable, with most surfacesuncolonized (Vos, Wolf, Jennings, & Kowalchuk, 1991). Thus, inareas of higher microbial abundance and density, microbial coloniza-tion of mineral surfaces should be more extensive. The in vivomicrobial turnover pathway should therefore dominate in regions ofhigh microbial colonization (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial“hotspots ”in the bulk soil), whereas the direct sorption pathwayshould dominate in areas of the bulk soil with lower microbial colo-nization (Guggenberger & Kaiser, 2003). By extension, differentmicroregions of the soil are primarily supplied by different sourcesof plant C input. The in vivo microbial turnover pathway should belargely supplied by belowground root inputs that enter the rhizo-sphere (Bais, Weir, Perry, Gilroy, & Vivanco, 2006; Farrar, Hawes,Jones, & Lindow, 2003), as well as dissolved organic matter fromdecaying roots (Figure 2). The direct sorption pathway should mostlybe supplied by aboveground plant inputs that are mobilized andtranslocated to the bulk mineral soil as dissolved organic matter, andhave greater chance of interacting with an uncolonized mineral sur-face (Kalbitz et al., 2005; Guggenberger & Kaiser, 2003). Above-ground and belowground structural residues are not as significantfor MAOM formation, as they primarily supply the faster ‐cycling,particulate organic matter pool (Cotrufo et al., 2015), or may formmacroaggregates (Rasse, Rumpel, & Dignac, 2005).(Hypothesis II) The in vivo microbial turnover pathwayand the direct sorption pathway select for differentand opposing biochemical and physicochemical sub-strate properties .The optimal LMW C substrates to be transformed to MAOM viathe in vivo microbial turnover pathway are those which must first bebiosynthesized with high microbial carbon ‐use efficiency prior tomineral ‐sorption (Figure 3) (Cotrufo et al., 2013). The LMW C sub-strates which are efficiently biosynthesized by the microbial commu-nity lose a proportionally small amount of C as CO2duringFIGURE 1 Low molecular weight plant C substrates (defined as<600 Da, see Lehmann & Kleber, 2015), which enter the soil eitherintact or through the partial oxidation and mobilization of morecomplex C compounds, are posited to be the dominant precursors tothe slow ‐cycling mineral ‐associated soil organic matter (MAOM)pool. In our framework, once a LMW C substrate is present in themineral soil as dissolved organic matter, it can form MAOM throughone of two main pathways, based on microbial density at its point ofentry to the mineral soil: the in vivo microbial turnover pathway(left) or the direct sorption pathway (right) [Colour figure can beviewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]14| SOKOL ET AL. 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Of course, we stress that the carbon ‐use efficiency by whicha LMW C substrate is biosynthesized is not a fixed value, but varieswith several factors (e.g., microbial community composition, sub-strate concentration, pH, and temperature) (Manzoni, Taylor, Richter,Porporato, & Ågren, 2012). Despite this variation, there is evidencethat certain LMW C substrates, such as simple sugars and certainamino acids, are generally associated with higher carbon ‐use effi-ciency values (i.e., ~40% –80%), while other LMW substrates, such ascertain phenolic acids (e.g., salicylic acid and p‐hydroxybenzoic acid)and certain polyvalent organic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), are generallyassociated with lower CUE values (i.e., 0% –30%) (Brant, Sulzman, &Myrold, 2006; Frey, Lee, Melillo, & Six, 2013; Sugai & Schimel,2005).In contrast, for the direct sorption pathway, LMW C substratescircumvent microbial assimilation; thus, this pathway favors physio-chemical properties which promote the strongest direct associationwith mineral surfaces. LMW substrates that are more polar shoulddemonstrate high “sorptive affinity ”for mineral surfaces (defined bythe strength and extent of mineral ‐sorption). LMW compounds withlow polarity should demonstrate poor sorptive affinity, as theyweakly bind to mineral surfaces, and are thus prone to leach downthe soil profile if they are not first assimilated by microbes (Kaiser &Kalbitz, 2012; (Figure 4). Certain LMW substrates generally exhibitstronger and more extensive sorption (e.g., certain phenolic andorganic acids) due to the identity and polarity of their functionalgroups (e.g., bonding through ligand exchange interactions), whereasother LMW substrates demonstrate weaker sorption (e.g., simplesugars and monocarboxylic acids), as they sorb through weaker asso-ciations (e.g., hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces). SorptiveFIGURE 2 The microbial density in the mineral soil at a LWM C substrate's point of entry to the upper mineral soil should influence thepathway to mineral ‐associated organic matter (MAOM) formation. (a) Belowground plant inputs (like root exudates and dissolved organicmatter (DOM) from dead roots) enter into a region of high microbial density. Therefore, these C inputs are posited to predominantly formMAOM via the in vivo microbial pathway. (b) DOM of aboveground plant inputs (i.e., leaf litter leachate) often enters into low microbialdensity regions of the bulk mineral soil. This soil environment is posited to primarily promote direct sorption of incoming plant C compoundson mineral surfaces. Due to these differences in horizontal soil space at a µm to mm scale, we propose that microbial ecophysiological controlson MAOM formation should be the dominant first set of controls in the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots, whereas abiotic controlsshould be dominant in low ‐density regions of the adjacent bulk soil [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]SOKOL ET AL. |15 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

For example,glucose is generally biosynthesized with high carbon ‐use efficiencybut shows low sorptive affinity (Brant et al., 2006; Jagadamma,Mayes, & Phillips, 2012), whereas certain phenolic acids (e.g., salicylicacid and p‐hydroxybenzoic acid) demonstrate high sorptive affinity,but are biosynthesized with low carbon ‐use efficiency (Cecchi, Koski-nen, Cheng, & Haider, 2004; Sugai & Schimel, 2005). Importantly,this relationship is not a ubiquitous trade ‐off among all LMW sub-strates: There are several LMW substrates in soil that are commonmetabolic intermediates and enter directly into metabolic pathways(e.g., citric acid into the citric acid cycle), and which demonstrateboth relatively high sorptive affinity and are biosynthesized with rel-atively high carbon ‐use efficiency (Jones & Edwards, 1998; Manzoniet al., 2012). Moreover, this relationship can be influenced by arange of factors and contexts; for example, some microbes maybiosynthesize certain phenolic acids with high CUE.Despite this complexity, we posit that for many LMW C sub-strates, incorporation into the MAOM pool can be efficient for a sin-gle compound at one point of entry to the mineral soil (e.g., glucosein a microbially dense region, like the rhizosphere), but inefficient forthat same compound entering through a different point of entry(e.g., glucose into a region of low microbial density in the bulk soil).Therefore, there is not necessarily a single optimal substrate prop-erty that promotes efficient incorporation into the MAOM, rather itis contingent on a substrate 's point of entry to the mineral soil (Fig-ure 4).We elaborate on the framework by exploring, in sequence, itsfour essential components: (a) aboveground vs. belowground C sub-strates; (b) their different point of entry to the mineral soil; (c) theirincorporation into MAOM through either the direct sorption path-way or the in vivo microbial turnover pathway; and (d) the carbon ‐use efficiency vs. sorptive affinity of different LMW C substrates.2.1 |The relative importance of aboveground vs.belowground carbon sourcesMuch discussion has focused on whether aboveground vs. below-ground inputs are the dominant supply of C to the mineral soil. Asuite of studies over the past two decades have found that SOMformation from belowground C inputs can rival and even exceedthose of aboveground inputs (reviewed in Jackson, Lajtha, Crow,Hugelius, & Kramer, 2017). This has been attributed to both greateroverall C supply from the belowground vs. aboveground and moreefficient retention of belowground C (Austin et al., 2017; Katterer,Bolinder, Andren, Kirchmann, & Menichetti, 2011; Kong & Six,2010). Recently, these observations have prompted characterizationof the belowground pathway as the dominant source of soil C (Pett ‐Ridge & Firestone, 2017; Poeplau, 2016; Rasse et al., 2005; Schmidt,Torn, & Abiven, 2011).This assertion, however, may be premature. As Jackson et al.(2017) highlight, the majority of studies showing the primacy ofbelowground inputs have been conducted in annual row ‐crop sys-tems. Certainly, in grassland ecosystems, root ‐derived inputs arelikely the dominant C supply, as the majority of photosynthate isallocated belowground (i.e., >80% in temperate grasslands, Swift,Heal, & Anderson, 2017). Moreover, the majority of surface mineralsoil in grasslands may be current or very recent rhizosphere, as rootsgenerally turnover quite quickly, with complete turnover every 2 –3 years (Fiala, 2010). However, the evidence has been more variedin forest ecosystems, including support for the primacy ofFIGURE 3 Depending on whether a low molecular weight (LMW)C substrate is incorporated into the mineral ‐associated organicmatter (MAOM) pool via the in vivo microbial turnover pathway orthe direct sorption pathway, we posit that different biochemical vs.physicochemical properties should promote that substrate's efficientincorporation into MAOM. (a) LMW C substrates that are firstbiosynthesized with high carbon ‐use efficiency prior to mineral ‐sorption are most efficiently incorporated into MAOM via thein vivo microbial turnover pathway. (b) LMW C substrates with highpolarity and high “sorptive affinity ”(defined as the strength andextent of mineral ‐sorption) are most efficiently incorporated intoMAOM via the direct sorption pathway. Notably, among severalcommon LMW compounds, as shown in the gradient below and inTable , there is a negative relationship between their carbon ‐useefficiency and their polarity/sorptive affinity. While we posit theserelationships should generally be observed across different contexts,but they can be modulated by the mineral type, as well as otherfeatures of the soil environment (e.g., soil pH and the soil microbialcommunity) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]16| SOKOL ET AL. 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Aboveground structuralinputs are a less quantitatively significant source of C to the MAOMthan previously thought (see Rasse et al., 2005), and evidence sug-gests that they primarily supply the fast ‐cycling particulate organicmatter pool (Cotrufo et al., 2015). But dissolved organic matter fromaboveground litter leachate can be a major source of C to mineral Cstocks, especially in high ‐leaching forest ecosystems, where DOCcan contribute up to 89% of C in mineral C stocks (Kaiser & Kalbitz,2012; Michalzik et al., 2003; Sanderman & Amundson, 2008).It then appears that both aboveground and belowground sourcesof C can be quantitatively significant contributors to the MAOMpool, with their importance varying across different ecosystem con-texts. In our framework, we expect their importance to also vary atthe fine spatial scales that characterize the soil matrix. The relativeimportance of aboveground vs. belowground inputs should be influ-enced not only by spatial location, but also by the unique patternsby which these different C inputs enter into the mineral soil (Rasseet al., 2005). For example, rhizodeposits (e.g., root exudates), as wellas dissolved organic matter from dead roots, enter directly into themineral soil. While the rate of rhizodeposit C input can demonstratewide seasonal variation (Phillips, Erlitz, Bier, & Bernhardt, 2008), rhi-zodeposition generally enters more continuously throughout thegrowing season relative to the less frequent entry of abovegroundDOC leachate (discussed below). Furthermore, rhizodeposition entersinto a spatially constrained area of the soil (i.e., the ~2 mm aroundFIGURE 4 The optimal substrate property which promotes efficient incorporation into the mineral ‐associated organic matter (MAOM) poolis contingent on a substrate's point of entry to the mineral soil. (a) In microbially dense areas of the soil (e.g., the rhizosphere), low molecularweight (LMW) C substrates that are biosynthesized with high carbon ‐use efficiency ( “CUE ”) are most efficiently converted to microbial ‐derivedMAOM (shown as pentagons), whereas LMW substrates biosynthesized with low CUE are largely lost via respiration (shown as triangles). (b) Inthe bulk soil with low microbial density, compounds with high sorptive affinity ( “SA”) exhibit strong physicochemical sorption via the directsorption pathway, whereas substrates with low SA are largely lost via leaching through physicochemical stripping.

Because of this pattern of entry, a verydense and active microbial rhizosphere community can develop inthe rhizosphere (Kuzyakov & Blagodatskaya, 2015). This high micro-bial abundance should increase the chance of microbial uptake andbiosynthesis of incoming root C, prior to incorporation into theMAOM pool via the in vivo microbial turnover pathway (Sokol &Bradford, 2018; Figure 2).In contrast to root inputs, dissolved organic matter of above-ground litter leachate (both fresh and decaying litter) moves downthe soil profile during precipitation events (Kaiser, Guggenberger,Haumaier, & Zech, 2001) and thus enters the mineral soil as less fre-quent, more irregular, and more widely distributed pulses of C. Incontrast to rhizodeposit C, dissolved organic matter from litter lea-chate can spread more diffusely throughout a greater soil volume(i.e., the bulk soil). This is because leachate can move down the soilprofile through multiple flow regimes, that is, through both advectiveand diffusive flow. Specifically, Sanderman and Amundson (2008)described an initial flush of dissolved organic matter occurring aftera precipitation event that moved through more defined pore net-works (i.e., preferential flow pathways). But after initial draining, dif-fusive flow should carry dissolved organic matter into most porespaces (Sanderman & Amundson, 2008).It is important to note that, in forest ecosystems, preferentialflow paths can persist for decades, becoming coated with biofilmsand accumulating large microbial communities (Hagedorn & Bundt,2002; Hagedorn, Mohn, Schleppi, & Fluhler, 1999). However, manyflow pathways can also be much more dynamic and transient.Indeed, Bundt, Widmer, Pesaro, Zeyer, and Blaser (2001) found widevariability in the abundance of microbial biomass between flow pathsand the adjacent soil matrix. Thus, while some flow paths may exhi-bit a high degree of microbial colonization (i.e., areas where thein vivo microbial turnover pathway may dominate), other areas ofthe bulk mineral soil should have much lower colonization of mineralsurfaces, thus increasing the chance for incoming dissolved organicmatter C substrates to directly encounter an uncolonized mineralsurface.2.2 |Probability of substrate –microbe vs.substrate –mineral interactionsThe predominant lifestyle of microbes in the soil is as sessile, sur-face‐attached organisms to mineral particles, and not as planktonicor“free‐floating ”microbes (Or, Smets, Wraith, Dechesne, & Fried-man, 2007). The physical and chemical features of mineral surfacesprovide a suite of conditions for microbial growth (i.e., the establish-ment of microcolonies or biofilms), as well as a location to accessresources in the surrounding soil matrix (Uroz, Kelly, Turpault,Lepleux, & Frey ‐Klett, 2005). Notably, while the abundance ofmicrobes per gram of soil can be massive (e.g., up to 10^10 bacterialcells), the distribution of those microbes within the mineral soil ishighly patchy and variable (Raynaud & Nunan, 2014; Vos et al.,1991). The majority of soil surfaces lack any microbial colonization —the total colonized surface area in mineral soil may be as low as10^‐6% (Young & Crawford, 2018). Thus, even in areas of highmicrobial abundance, the majority of mineral surface area is stilluncolonized.The greater abundance of soil microbes in the rhizosphere rela-tive to the bulk soil —with estimates ranging from 10:1 to 100:1(Prashar, Kapoor, & Sachdeva, 2013; Raynaud & Nunan, 2014) —sug-gests far greater colonization of mineral surfaces in the rhizospherevs. the bulk soil (Figure 1). The difference between rhizosphere andbulk soil is, as discussed above, not binary: A continuum of microbialactivity exists in the bulk soil (Richter, Oh, Fimmen, & Jackson,2007). While there are regions of very low microbial biomass andactivity, there are also microbial hotspots in the bulk mineral soil,including detritus ( “the detritusphere ”), biopores (such as earthwormburrows), and the surfaces of aggregates (Bundt et al., 2001; Kuzya-kov & Blagodatskaya, 2015). The probability of substrate –microbevs. substrate –mineral encounter will partially depend on the precisespatial distribution of these “hotspots. ”The relative importance ofdirect sorption vs. the in vivo microbial turnover will reflect this con-tinuum of microbial abundance throughout different microregions ofthe mineral soil. In Figure 2, we thus portray: (a) the rhizosphere soil,(b) a high ‐density region of the bulk soil (i.e., a “hotspot ”around adecaying root), and (c) a low ‐density region of the bulk soil (e.g., anarea of the bulk soil matrix adjacent to such a flow path). Overall,there is a higher probability for a LMW substrate exiting the root toenter the in vivo microbial turnover pathway while en route to min-eral‐sorption, relative to those substrates which enter into regions ofthe bulk soil with low colonization of mineral surfaces.2.3 |MAOM formation pathway: in vivo microbialturnover vs. direct sorptionIf a LMW compound in the mineral soil is accessible and microbiallyassimilable, it will be assimilated by the soil microbial community,providing it is not metabolically toxic, and there are no severe con-straints on microbial activity, such as temperature limitation or oxy-gen availability. Microbial uptake of LMW substrates canoutcompete mineral ‐sorption (Fischer, Ingwersen, & Kuzyakov,2010), but only when soil microbes are able to access a C substrate.Because soil microbes are mostly sessile, they therefore must waitfor substrate to enter their habitat to be accessible (Hedges &Oades, 1997; Or et al., 2007). Following substrate assimilation, thenmicrobial biosynthesis, growth, death, and turnover, soil microbescan directly contribute to the MAOM pool through the deposition oftheir senesced microbial biomass (necromass), exudates (e.g., extra-cellular polymeric substances), and other byproducts (e.g., stresscompounds, such as osmolytes) (Schimel & Schaeffer, 2012). Thesemicrobial residues are prime targets for mineral ‐sorption due to theclose spatial association that exists between minerals and microbes(Or et al., 2007; Pett ‐Ridge & Firestone, 2017). (For a discussion onthe interactions between different microbial components and mineralsurfaces, see Kögel ‐Knabner 2002, Kögel ‐Knabner, 2017.).Overall, empirical support for the in vivo microbial turnover path-way has increased in recent years (Bradford et al., 2013; Kallenbach18| SOKOL ET AL. 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Specifically, LMW compounds can betranslocated as dissolved organic matter from a plant source to amineral surface (Kalbitz & Kaiser, 2008; Michalzik et al., 2003; Neff& Asner, 2001; Sanderman & Amundson, 2008). The substrate caneither enter the mineral soil intact, or —for more complex C com-pounds (e.g., lignin) —the substrate may first undergo partial oxida-tion by extracellular enzymes (e.g., laccases, peroxidases) beforeentry. This extracellular modification often occurs in the leaf litterlayer, organic horizon, or upper soil horizon (e.g., in a grasslandecosystem or forest ecosystem with no organic horizon), beforethose LMW compounds are mobilized as dissolved organic matter(Kalbitz & Kaiser, 2008; Neff & Asner, 2001). Admittedly, only a pro-portion of the liberated LMW compounds will be available for trans-port, because the microbes performing litter degradation mustassimilate at least some of them to maintain themselves and grow,hence reducing their transport to other areas of the soil (Schimel &Schaeffer, 2012).The prevalence of direct sorption can vary widely, based on sev-eral factors including soil mineralogy (Sollins, Kramer, & Swanston,2014), soil pH (Kothawala, Moore, & Hendershot, 2009; Mayes,Heal, Brandt, Phillips, & Jardine, 2012), vegetation type (forest vs.grassland) (Sanderman & Amundson, 2008), climate (Kramer et al.,2012 ), as well as the abundance and composition of the microbialcommunity. Sanderman et al. (2014) suggested that while the in vivomicrobial turnover pathway may be common in many soil types, onekey context where direct sorption of plant compounds should domi-nate is in high ‐leaching forest soils with large proportions of reactivesecondary minerals (e.g., oxyhydroxides or poorly crystalline short ‐range order minerals, like allophane), which can strongly bind a rangeof C substrates. In contrast, we posit that in grasslands that are gen-erally drier, lower leaching environments, and have lower proportionsof reactive secondary minerals, direct sorption of dissolved organicmatter should be a less significant C source to mineral C stocks inthese ecosystems (Sanderman & Amundson, 2008).2.4 |Physiochemical vs. biochemical properties ofplant carbon substratesThrough the in vivo microbial turnover pathway, the soil microbialcommunity acts as a “pump ”(sensu Liang et al., 2017), regulating theflow of LMW C substrates en route to the MAOM pool. The effi-ciency by which a substrate is biosynthesized by the microbial com-munity is determined by several factors (Manzoni et al., 2012), butwe focus here on the biochemical properties of the substrate thatare associated with high carbon ‐use efficiency at the microbial com-munity scale (Geyer et al., 2016). In this framework, we explicitlydeal with LMW substrates that are already microbially assimilable.As such, we do not discuss how carbon ‐use efficiency is affected bythe number of enzymatic steps required to decompose a complexsubstrate until it is assimilable (often discussed in terms of activationenergy, or Ea). Rather, we focus on the efficiency of microbialbiomass synthesis from a particular LMW C substrate, based on thespecific metabolic pathway it enters and the degree of reduction ofC within the substrate (Manzoni et al., 2012; van Hees, Jones, Finlay,& Godbold, 2013). Higher respiration arises from the bioenergeticcosts to metabolize compounds like certain phenolic acids vs. com-pounds like simple sugars and amino acids. The biochemical differ-ences between these LMW substrates are reflected in a wide rangeof carbon ‐use efficiencies, several of which we show in Table 1.Similar to carbon ‐use efficiency, sorptive affinity is not only afunction of the substrate itself, but also a property of several fea-tures of the environment, including soil mineralogy, base saturation,and pH (Sollins, Homann, & Caldwell, 2009). However, we primarilyfocus on the properties of the LMW C substrate (i.e., “the sorbate ”).Sorption to the mineral soil matrix can occur via a range of coulom-bic and non ‐coulombic associations, spanning weak to very stronginteractions (Mikutta et al., 2007). Ligand exchange interactions formthe strongest and most stable organo ‐mineral bonds, followed bycation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces (Gu,Schmitt, Chen, Liang, & McCarthy, 1994; Mikutta, Kleber, Torn, &Jahn, 2006). Other forms of bonding may also be important: Nonpo-lar aromatic rings can also form very strong bonds with mineral sur-faces via aromatic cation –pi and pi –pi electron donor –acceptorinteractions (Keiluweit & Kleber, 2009).Polyvalent carboxylic acids (e.g., citric acid and oxalic acid) andmany phenolic acids and lignin monomers (e.g., vanillin, salicylic acid,and p‐coumaric acid) show the strongest sorption across a range ofmineral types (e.g., Jagadamma et al., 2012). Sustrates like simplesugars (e.g., glucose), certain amino acids (e.g., alanine), and monocar-boxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid) consistently demonstrate low sorptiveaffinity, due to the relatively weak substrate –mineral associationsthey form (Jagadamma et al., 2012; Jagadamma, Mayes, Zinn, Gísla-dóttir, & Russell, 2014; Jones & Edwards, 1998; Kuzyakov & Jones,2006). Sorption isotherm studies can be used to quantify sorptiveaffinity, through variables that include maximum sorption capacity(Qmax) and the binding coefficient (k d). As these values are difficultto compare across studies due to the wide range of conditions used(e.g., substrate concentration and mineral type), we show values inTable 1 from a single study with standardized conditions, to specifi-cally compare the Q maxvalues of a suite of LMW C substrates.From Table 1, it is apparent that several LMW C substrates thatare biosynthesized with high carbon ‐use efficiency also show weaksorption with the mineral soil matrix (Jagadamma et al., 2012; Jones& Brassington, 1998; Jones, Dennis, Owen, & Hees, 2003). Sugars,amino acids, and acetic acid should then be optimal compounds forMAOM formation in areas of the soil with high microbial density,but these same compounds should also readily undergo physico-chemical stripping from the soil matrix and hence leach down thesoil profile in areas of low microbial density (Kaiser & Kalbitz, 2012).Similarly, several polar phenolic compounds exhibit strong mineral ‐sorption (Cecchi et al., 2004), but are generally inefficiently biosyn-thesized by microbial communities (Frey et al., 2013; Sugai & Schi-mel, 2005). As mentioned previously, this is not a universal trade ‐off.There are common metabolic intermediates in soil, such as citricSOKOL ET AL. |19 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseacid, which are efficiently biosynthesized and have high polarity,causing strong sorption to the mineral phase (Jones & Hodge, 1999).Regardless, we stress the key point that there is generally not a sin-gle optimal substrate property that can be identified for efficientMAOM formation, but rather its point of entry to the mineral soilmust be explicitly considered.3|SYNTHESIS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSBased on the hypothesized prevalence of the in vivo microbial turn-over pathway vs. the direct sorption pathway in different microre-gions of soil space, we put forward several ideas for futureexperimentation, with the aim of better understanding how proper-ties of different plant C inputs impact their fate in the mineral soil./C15Few studies have directly looked at how a suite of differentLMW C substrates —which range in their sorptive affinity vs.their carbon ‐use efficiency (e.g., Table 1) —are incorporated intothe MAOM pool across a range of relevant biotic conditions (e.g.,different microbial densities) and abiotic conditions (e.g., mineral-ogy). We hypothesize that LMW C substrates with high carbon ‐use efficiency but low sorptive affinity should be efficiently incor-porated into MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., therhizosphere), but poorly in areas of low microbial density, andvice versa. To address this hypothesis, one approach would be touse controlled laboratory ‐based experiments that manipulatemicrobial density in soil microcosms, and track the fate of isotopi-cally labeled substrates which span a range in carbon ‐use effi-ciency vs. sorptive affinity./C15It is unclear how the interaction between C chemistry and pointof entry in the mineral soil will influence the fate of a C com-pound in the MAOM pool, and how this interaction should berepresented in SOM models (Mazzilli, Kemanian, Ernst, Jackson,& Piñeiro, 2015). Our framework puts forward hypotheses forhow C chemistry can differentially impact MAOM formationbased on whether it enters as dissolved organic matter frombelowground vs. aboveground sources. Such hypotheses need tobe tested to determine whether confidence in SOM model pro-jections might be improved through the incorporation of inputpathway (i.e., point of entry) as an important process ‐level controlon MAOM formation./C15We posit that there should be different chemical signatures ofnewly formed MAOM in the rhizosphere vs. in low ‐densityregions of the bulk soil. MAOM that is newly formed in the rhi-zosphere should have a more microbial ‐derived signature, domi-nated by microbial proteins, lipids, and amino sugars (Keiluweitet al., 2015). The MAOM in the bulk mineral soil, in contrast,should have a more plant ‐derived signature, dominated by pheno-lics and other aromatic lignin derivatives (e.g., Kaiser & Kalbitz,2012)./C15It is important to note that some authors have considered howthe formation and chemical composition of MAOM can vary invertical soil space. For example, Kaiser and Kalbitz (2012) putforward a conceptual framework on the vertical flow of dissolvedorganic matter in forest ecosystems and described direct sorptionof lignin derivatives generally occurring in upper mineral horizonsof forest soils. They posited that highly sorptive lignin derivativespreferentially accumulate in the surface horizon, and less sorptivemicrobial compounds (e.g., microbial sugars) accumulate in thesubsurface, as they are repeatedly microbially processed and “cy-cled downwards ”(Kaiser & Kalbitz, 2012). Here, we argue that —while differences between direct sorption are certainly present atthese scales —they should also operate at much finer, millimeteror micrometer ‐size scales within the same horizon or depth incre-ment (i.e., “horizontal soil space ”). That is, there should be fine ‐scale variation in microbial hotpots and uncolonized mineral sur-faces that favor different chemical properties of incoming LMWC substrates for MAOM formation. Only a few field studies thusfar have looked at how the chemical composition of SOM alsovaries “horizontally ”within soil space, based on proximity to ashoot or root (Angst, John, Mueller, Kögel ‐Knabner, & Rethe-meyer, 2016; Angst, Kögel ‐Knabner, Kirfel, Hertel, & Mueller,2016; Spielvogel et al., 1993). While some vertical differences inSOM content (i.e., topsoil vs. subsoil) have been observed basedon shoot vs. root plant C source, no horizontal differences (e.g.,rhizosphere vs. non ‐rhizosphere soil) in MAOM stock or composi-tion have yet been observed in the few ecosystem contexts stud-ied, and with the techniques employed (i.e., lipid biomarkers) (e.g.,Angst, Kögel ‐Knabner, et al., 2016; Angst, John, et al., 2016). Thisis a key area of investigation, especially using finer scales of reso-lution (i.e., micrometer to millimeter scale) and different tracertechniques (e.g.,13C‐labeled carbon compounds). Depending onthe findings, there may be a need to integrate these fine ‐scalehorizontal dynamics with vertical models of SOM formation andloss (e.g., Kaiser & Kalbitz, 2012)./C15We posit that a different set of primary controls should operateon the rate of MAOM formation across horizontal soil space, thatis, in areas of high microbial colonization (e.g., the rhizosphere)vs. low microbial colonization (e.g., certain areas of the bulk soil).Microbial vs. mineral control of soil C stabilization is known tovary across different ecosystems (Sollins et al., 2014), and wesuggest that such controls operate at much finer scales in soilspace. Indeed, microbial community structure and compositionhave been shown to be important for soil C dynamics in thehigh‐activity rhizosphere, but are not significant factors in thebulk mineral soil with low microbial density (Nunan, Leloup,Ruamps, Pouteau, & Chenu, 2017). However, this binary catego-rization is likely an oversimplification, because biotic and abioticcontrols are important for both MAOM formation pathways. Forexample, soil matrix interactions of microbial products are a keypart of the in vivo microbial turnover pathway (see the “MicrobialEfficiency Matrix Stabilization ”framework by Cotrufo et al.,2013), and key questions thus surround which microbial residuesare preferentially sorbed on mineral surfaces (Kögel ‐Knabner,2017; Pett ‐Ridge & Firestone, 2017; Throckmorton et al., 2015).Similarly, the partial oxidation and mobilization of complex C20| SOKOL ET AL. 13652486, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14482 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/04/2023].

Resolving the relative importance of biotic vs.abiotic controls in these two pathways is thus a key priority.In conclusion, there is still a lack of empirical and conceptualunderstanding for how different plant C inputs are connected to pat-terns of MAOM formation and loss. Our framework advances spa-tially explicit hypotheses that connect plant C source and chemistrywith pathways of MAOM formation. Building up a fine ‐scale under-standing of MAOM dynamics is necessary to develop a robust con-ceptual model of how C flows through soil space and to understandhow C substrates with different chemistries may be efficiently orinefficiently incorporated into MAOM based on their point of entryto the mineral soil. This understanding can then be scaled up todevelop a more accurate understanding of soil C flows acrossecosystem and landscape scales, and to understand and predict howenvironmental changes to plant and microbial communities mayimpact mineral SOM stocks through time.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors thank Elisa Iturbe for assistance with the illustrations,Marco Keiluweit for useful discussions surrounding carbon ‐use effi-ciency vs. polarity, and Sara Kuebbing, Emily Oldfield, StephenWood, Os Schmitz, and Rich Phillips for comments on the initial ver-sion of the manuscript.
