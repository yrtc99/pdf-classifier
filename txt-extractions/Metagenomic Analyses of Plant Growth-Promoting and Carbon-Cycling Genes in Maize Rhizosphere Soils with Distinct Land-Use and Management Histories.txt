Analyzing microbialgenes in the rhizosphere of plants, especially those associated with plant growth promotion andcarbon cycling, is important for improving soil fertility and crop productivity. Here, we providea comparative analysis of microbial genes present in the rhizosphere samples of two maize Ô¨Åeldswith different agricultural histories using shotgun metagenomics. Genes involved in the nutrientmobilization, including nifA,Ô¨ÅxJ,norB,pstA,kefA and B, and ktrB were signiÔ¨Åcantly more abundant(= 0.05) in former grassland (F1) rhizosphere soils. Among the carbon-cycling genes, the abundanceof 12 genes, including all those involved in the degradation of methane were more signiÔ¨Åcant(= 0.05) in the F1 soils, whereas only Ô¨Åve genes were signiÔ¨Åcantly more abundant in the F2 soils.-diversity indices were different across the samples and signiÔ¨Åcant differences were observed inthediversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes between the Ô¨Åelds (ANOSIM,p= 0.01 and R= 0.52). Nitrate-nitrogen (N-NO 3) was the most inÔ¨Çuential physicochemical parameter(p =0.05 and contribution = 31.3%) that affected the distribution of the functional genes acrossthe samples. The results indicate that land-use and management histories impact the compositionand diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes in the plant rhizosphere. Thestudy widens our understanding of the effects of anthropogenic activities on plant health and majorbiogeochemical processes in soils.Keywords: agricultural management practices; biogeochemical processes; crop productivity; nutrientmobilization; soil ecosystem functioning; soil fertility1. IntroductionThe plant rhizomicrobiome, comprising different microbial communities, plays im-mense roles in many processes of ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient recycling,suppressing disease pathogens, secreting plant growth-promoting enzymes, and min-eralization of organic matter, which ultimately lead to increased soil fertility and cropproductivity [ 1,2]. The rich nutrients provided by plants attract several microbes aroundthe roots, which are recruited from the surrounding soils [ 3,4] by the metabolic compat-ibility and signaling events of exudates secreted by the plant roots into the rhizosphereenvironment, the host-plant immune system, and interactions among different microbeswithin the plant rhizosphere [5,6].Soil ecosystem functioning is mostly determined by the activity and complexity ofthe inhabiting microbes. These microbes are inÔ¨Çuenced by several biological, chemical,and physical properties of the soil environment [ 1,7]. The microbial community com-position in soils can be altered by different land-use and management practices, whichconsequently affect certain ecosystem functioning in soils [ 8,9]. Agricultural managementGenes 2021 ,12, 1431. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12091431 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genesGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 2 of 18practices impact microbial community structure and functions, thereby complexing thecontributions of microbial communities towards important ecosystem functions such asnutrient and carbon cycling [ 10,11]. Most studies on the effects of land-use practices on thesoil ecosystem functions focused mainly on the composition and structure of soil microbialcommunities [ 12,13]. Microbial community composition in different ecosystems and itseffects on ecosystem functioning has been studied [ 14,15]. The literature has shown thatthe information obtained from the taxonomic composition and abundance of soil microbialcommunities alone is insufÔ¨Åcient to predict their functional potentials [ 16,17]. Therefore,quantifying the knowledge of the functional capabilities of microbial communities in soilswill help identify their roles in the ecosystems, how they are impacted by land-use and man-agement practices, and their inÔ¨Çuence on soil ecosystem functions. such as organic mattermineralization, nutrient cycling, degradation of organic pollutants, and plant‚Äìmicrobeinteractions [9,18,19].Recent studies have suggested that the functions of soil microbial communities canbe better predicted by studying their functional genes [ 20‚Äì23]. Knowledge of microbialfunctional gene composition and diversity in the rhizosphere of agricultural soils, insteadof mere taxonomic insight, is important for understanding the dynamics of vital processes,such as nutrient and carbon cycling, and how they are inÔ¨Çuenced by agricultural man-agement practices [ 23]. The whole metagenomic sequencing of rhizosphere soil sampleshas been tested to provide information on the diversity of microbial functional genes inthe plant rhizosphere [ 24,25]. Metagenomics provides information on a wide variety offunctional genes present in a sample, which may assist in the acquisition of information onthe functional potentials of microbial communities in soils. Through this method, infor-mation on functional genes that play important roles in the rhizosphere soil ecosystem isobtained [ 26]. These functional genes may include speciÔ¨Åc ones, such as the phloroglucinol(phl) synthesis and nitrogen Ô¨Åxation ( nif) genes that can directly confer beneÔ¨Åcial traits toplants, and the pyrroloquinoline quinone ( pqq) biosynthesis genes, which contribute tomany indirect functions in plant cells. Together, these genes enhance plant growth andhealth [27].Studies have reported the inÔ¨Çuence of land-use practices on the diversity of functionalgenes in agricultural soils [ 1,28]. However, studies on microbial functional gene diversity inthe rhizosphere of plants in African soils as inÔ¨Çuenced by their land-use and managementhistories are rare. Moreover, the speciÔ¨Åc functional genes responsible for performingvarious important functions, such as the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and plant-growth promotion in the maize rhizosphere, are understudied. This study provides aprincipal report on the effects of land-use history (conversion from grassland to cultivatedland) and management practices (tillage and no tillage) on the diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes in maize rhizospheric soils.To gain deeper knowledge on the diversity of genes concerned with plant growthpromotion and carbon cycling, we analyzed the metagenomes of rhizospheric soil samplesfrom former grassland soil and intensively cultivated agricultural land using shotgunmetagenomic sequencing. We compared the composition and diversity of functionalgenes involved in plant growth promotion and carbon cycling in the rhizospheric soils ofthe former grassland with those from the intensively cultivated land. Furthermore, wecompared the taxonomic proÔ¨Åles of one Ô¨Åeld with the other. Based on our previous study,we formulated two hypotheses. First, we assumed that although the maize rhizosphereharbored important beneÔ¨Åcial microbes, this environment must also be characterizedby diverse microbial functional genes that contribute to important functions in the soilecosystem. Second, we expected the diversity of the genes that contribute to plant growthand carbon cycling in the two Ô¨Åelds to differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from one another due to theirland-use and management histories.Genes 2021 ,12, 1431 3 of 182. Materials and Methods2.1. Soil Sampling and Sites DescriptionSoil samples were collected in March 2019 from two maize plantations in Venters-dorp (F1) and MaÔ¨Åkeng (F2), South Africa (located in the semi-arid regions of the NorthWest province). The choice of our sample collection was inÔ¨Çuenced by the agriculturalhistories of the two plantations. The Ô¨Åeld at Ventersdorp (approximately 130 hectares) hasexisted since 1962, initially as grassland for animal grazing, and subsequently convertedto cultivable land in 2015, with no tilling system and fertilizer application (N = 90, P = 60,and K = 60 kg ha 1). On the other hand, the MaÔ¨Åkeng Ô¨Åeld has existed since 1989 asa continuously cultivated land, with a mechanized tilling system and fertilizer appliedat the rates of N = 140, P = 80, and K = 80 kg ha 1. The average winter and summertemperatures at Ventersdorp are 10.6 and 22.9C, respectively, with an annual averagerainfall of 585 mm, an average precipitation of 4 mm (in winter) and 105 mm (in summer),an altitude of 1339 m, and average humidity of 47% (in winter) and 45% (in summer).On the other hand, the mean temperatures in MaÔ¨Åkeng are 11 and 23.1C in winter andsummer, respectively, with an annual rainfall of 571 mm, average precipitation of 3 mm inwinter and 96 mm in summer, an altitude of 1290 m, and mean humidity of 46% and 44% inwinter and summer, respectively. Soil samples were collected from the following locations:261903800S and 265301800E for F1, and 254800000S and 253802100E for F2. Rhizospheresoils were collected by deliberately uprooting maize plants and agitating the uprootedplant to remove loosely attached soils; meanwhile, soils attached to the root crowns, whererooting was so dense, were collected together with the roots in sterile plastic bags. Beforesample collection, each Ô¨Åeld was split into four parts (representing north, south, east, andwest), and each part was called a site. In each site, rhizospheric soil samples were collectedfrom six different maize plants, later pooled to form a composite sample. Therefore, forF1, rhizospheric soil samples were collected from sites GZ1, GZ2, GZ3, and GZ4, and forF2, we collected samples from sites AG1, AG2, AG3, and AG4. A total of 8 composite soilsamples were collected from the rhizosphere of maize plants in the two Ô¨Åelds (4 from eachÔ¨Åeld). Samples were collected at the Ô¨Çowering stage, and soils from both Ô¨Åelds were typicalof loamy sand. These samples were stored in a cooler containing ice and transported to thelaboratory. At the laboratory, each sample was divided into two, one for physicochemicalanalysis and the other for whole DNA extraction. Samples were kept at  20C until theywere needed for analyses.2.2. Physicochemical Analyses of Soil SamplesThe chemical properties of soil samples were determined using 20 g of dried andsieved soils that were kept speciÔ¨Åcally for this purpose. The pH of samples was determinedusing a pH meter at a soil-to-water ratio of 1:2.5. The Kjeldahl method was used todetermine the amount of nitrogen in the samples [ 29], while the procedure of Bray andKurtz [ 30] was employed to determine the extractable phosphorus content of the samples.Organic carbon (OC) content was measured using the method of Walkley and Black [ 31]and Shi et al. [ 32]. Exchangeable potassium, N-NO 3, and N-NH 4content, and the availablesulfur in samples were determined after extraction with 1 M ammonium acetate, 2 Mpotassium chloride (KCl), and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), respectively, while theamount of organic matter was estimated by the loss-on-ignition (LOI) method [33].2.3. Metagenomic DNA Extraction and SequencingA DNeasy PowerMax Soil Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was used to extractwhole microbial DNA from 5 g of soil samples according to the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines.The initial DNA concentration of the samples was conÔ¨Årmed using Qubit¬ÆdsDNA HSAssay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and samples were subjected to furthercleaning using the DNEasy PowerClean Pro Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD,USA). Whole metagenome sequencing of samples through the shotgun approach, whichgenerated the complete datasets for the study, was performed at the Molecular ResearchGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 4 of 18Laboratories (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). Adhering to user instructions step-by-step,metagenomic DNA libraries were developed with 20‚Äì25 ng of DNA using a Nextera DNAFlex library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After sample cleanup, thequality of the DNA in samples was again checked using the Qubit¬ÆdsDNA HS Assay Kit(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The quality DNA samples were made to undergosimultaneous fragmentation with the subsequent addition of adapter sequences. A limited-cycle PCR was run on the samples and unique indices were added. The Qubit¬ÆdsDNAHS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was reused to check the Ô¨Ånal libraryconcentration, while the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,USA) was used to deduce the average size of the developed libraries. The libraries werepooled and diluted to 0.6 nM. Afterward, 300-cycle pair-end sequencing was performed onthe libraries using the NovaSeq system on Illumina.2.4. Metagenome Sequence Processing and Analysis of DataThe raw sequences of each metagenome were uploaded to the metagenomics rapid an-notation pipeline (MG-RAST) version 4.0.3 server [ 34], and quality control was performedon the sequences. The preprocessing steps (quality control and trimming) involved theelimination of artiÔ¨Åcial sequences, which were products of sequence artifacts, the removalof sequences with over 5 ambiguous base pairs (bp) and a 15 phred cutoff score, removalof host species-speciÔ¨Åc sequences, and the removal of sequences whose mean lengths weremore signiÔ¨Åcant than 2 standard deviations from the mean. Afterward, sequences wereannotated using the BLAST-like alignment (BLAT) algorithm [ 35] on the M5NR database,which provides a nonredundant combination of different databases [ 36]. Taxonomic group-ings were performed using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP), while the assignmentof protein-coding genes (at the level of functions) were performed on the SEED subsys-tems database. The SEED subsystems database on the MG-RAST server is a continuouslyupdated genome database, application programming interface (API), web front end, andserver scripts consisting of integrated genomic data and collections of functionally relatedprotein families that are used to predict gene functions and new pathways [ 37]. BlastX wasused to detect hits that have maximum lengths of 15 bp, an E-value cutoff of 110 5, anda 60% minimum identity. Sequences with failed annotation did not receive any further anal-ysis. We were interested in the entire microbiome comprising archaea, bacteria, and fungi.However, data from protists and other micro-eukaryotes were excluded from the analysis.The effect of experimental noise or error was minimized by applying the ‚Äúnormalized data‚Äùoption on the MG-RAST server. We manually selected and arranged the genes impartingplant-beneÔ¨Åcial functions from the data we obtained for the microbial functions in theSEED subsystems database. The 8 sequences of this study were individually evaluated onthe MG-RAST server, and data analyses were performed on all the metagenome samples(GZ1‚ÄìGZ4 and AG1‚ÄìAG4). The metagenomic sequences of the study samples are availablein the NCBI SRA dataset, with the BioProject accession number PRJNA649682.Shannon, Evenness, and Simpsons were used as parameters to determine the di-versity indices of all the samples. These indices were used to compare habitats using theKruskal‚ÄìWallis test. SigniÔ¨Åcantly abundant microbial genes were identiÔ¨Åed as biomarkersof the microbial communities, and the samples were determined using the linear discrim-inant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) version 1.0. Here, the logarithmic LDA cutoffscore was set to 2.0, and the parameter signiÔ¨Åcance threshold for the Kruskal‚ÄìWallistest performed among classes was set to 0.05. To determine the diversity of the plantgrowth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes, we used the principal coordinate analysis(PCoA) centered on the Euclidean distance matrix. To identify signiÔ¨Åcantly differentmetagenomes among the samples, we used the one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)through 9999 permutations. The percentage (%) contribution of each functional gene tothe dissimilarities in gene abundance between and within the sample groups was assessedusing the similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis. The canonical correspondence analysis(CCA), through the forward selection option, was used to determine the physicochemicalGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 5 of 18parameters that best described the functional genes, while the Monte Carlo permutationtest with 9999 random permutations was used to measure the signiÔ¨Åcance. All the physico-chemical parameters of the soils were incorporated into the CCA analysis as descriptivevariables.The rarefaction curve was obtained after the normalization of the datasets using theanalysis tools in MG-RAST v. 4.0.3 [ 34] (Figure 1). Heatmaps showing the abundances ofmicrobial families, plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes, and an extendederror bar plot used to identify the signiÔ¨Åcant microbial communities in the samples, wereobtained using the statistical analysis of taxonomic and functional proÔ¨Åles (STAMP),version 2.1.3 [ 38]. The diversity, ANOSIM, and SIMPER analyses were performed usingthe PAST version 3.20 software, developed by Hammer et al. [ 39], while the PCoA and CCAwere performed in CANOCO 5 (Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, 148 NY, USA). The Galaxysoftware on https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/ (accessed December 2020) wasused to plot the bar chart showing the statistically differential and biologically consistentdifferences in the abundance of functional genes involved in plant growth promotion andcarbon cycling in the samples [40].Genes 2021 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW  6 of 20     Figure 1. Rarefaction curve depicting sample richness and the sample sites from which rhizospheric samples were col-lected . 3.3. The Distribution of Microbes across the Maize Rhizosphere Soils  Metagenomic analysis using the RDP database revealed the dominance of 14 bacte-rial families as the most abundant microbial families observed in the former grassland and the intensively cultivated soils (Figure S1). Among these families, the abundance of eight bacterial families, including Micromonos poraceae (GZ1), Nocardioidaceae (GZ4), Gem-matimonadaceae (GZ1), Microbacteriaceae (GZ3), Frankiaceae (GZ3), and others were highest in the F1 soils, while the abundance of six bacterial families, including Ge-odermatophilaceae (AG3), Pseudonocardiaceae (AG4 ), Micrococcaceae (AG2), and others was predominant in  the F2 soils (Figure S1). Among the archaeal families, Methanobacte-riaceae was found in GZ3, AG1, and AG2, Methanomicrobiaceae in GZ2 and GZ4, and Thermofilaceae in the AG2 samples, whereas Ustilaginac eae (the only fungi found) was observed in all samples except AG2 and AG3. We used the STAMP software to identify significantly abundant microbial communities in the samples, represented by the ex-tended error bar plot (Figure 2). The analysis showed that o ut of 18 microbial families, seven of them were significantly more abundant ( p < 0.05) in the F1 samples, whereas five others were significantly more abundant ( p < 0.05) in the F2 rhizosphere (Figure 2). How-ever, no significant difference (Kruskal ‚ÄìWallis, p = 0.98) was observed in the Œ± diversity of the microbial communities between the F1 and the F2 soils.  Figure 1.

Soil Chemical AnalysisThe results of the soil chemical analyses of this study have been previously describedin Chukwuneme et al. [ 41]. BrieÔ¨Çy, the pH of the GZ samples was between 6.45 and 7.04(neutral), while that of the AG samples ranged between 4.84 and 5.49 (acidic). The sulfurcontent of both soils was low and observed only in the GZ1, GZ3, and AG2 samples, whilethe phosphorus contents of the GZ and AG samples ranged from 19.75 (GZ2) to 40.39(GZ3) mg/kg and from 16.25 (AG4) to 56.88 (AG2) mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, totalC, organic C, organic matter, and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3-N) contents were higher in theGZ samples compared to the ammonium (N-NH 4) content, which was higher in the AGsamples (Table S1).3.2. Assembly and Analysis of Shotgun Metagenomic Sequence DataFrom the rarefaction curve in Figure 1, most of the sample reads reached saturationpoints, thereby indicating a full coverage of the sampling efforts. After quality controlGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 6 of 18on the MG-RAST server, the output file obtained contained sequences in the range of5,255,550‚Äì9,039,015 and 2,627,486‚Äì8,287,108 for the GZ1‚ÄìGZ4 and the AG1‚ÄìAG4 rhizospheresamples, respectively. Out of the quality sequences obtained, 39.63‚Äì40.98% of the sequencesin the GZ samples contained proteins whose functions are known, while for the AG samples,the proteins with known functions ranged from 41.39 to 43.42%. Furthermore, the qualitysequences obtained contained 2,732,830‚Äì4,759,994 and 1,306,964‚Äì4,262,335 proteins for theGZ (GZ1‚ÄìGZ4) and AG (AG1‚ÄìAG4) samples, respectively, with unknown functions.3.3. The Distribution of Microbes across the Maize Rhizosphere SoilsMetagenomic analysis using the RDP database revealed the dominance of 14 bacte-rial families as the most abundant microbial families observed in the former grasslandand the intensively cultivated soils (Figure S1). Among these families, the abundance ofeight bacterial families, including Micromonosporaceae (GZ1), Nocardioidaceae (GZ4),Gemmatimonadaceae (GZ1), Microbacteriaceae (GZ3), Frankiaceae (GZ3), and others werehighest in the F1 soils, while the abundance of six bacterial families, including Geoder-matophilaceae (AG3), Pseudonocardiaceae (AG4), Micrococcaceae (AG2), and others waspredominant in the F2 soils (Figure S1).

Microbial Genes That Enhance Plant Growth and Fitness Observed in the Maize Fields  The SEED subsystem database used in the functional classification of the meta-genomic dataset revealed the abundance of several genes involved in plant growth pro-motion and carbon cycling in the agricultural soils (Tables S2 and S3).  3.4.1. Genes that Facilitate Nutrient Mobilization and Plant Growth  The metagenomic analysis of microbial functional genes in our samples using the SEED subsystems revealed a  total of 8091 functional genes , of which several involved in the cycling of major nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) that promote soil fertility were identified (Table S2). The plant growth -promoting genes assessed in our study were those inv olved in nitrogen fixation ( nifA, nifH, and fixJ), nitrification ( amoA), denitrification ( nirK, nirS, and norB), phosphorus cycling ( gdh, ppX, ppK, and  pstA,), po-tassium cycling ( kefA, kefB, kup, ktrA, and ktrB), ACC deaminase activity ( acdS and dcyD), IAA  biosynthesis ( ipdC), tryptophan biosynthesis ( trpA and trpB), sulfur metabolism (cysC, cysD, cysH, cysI, cysJ, and cysN), pyoverdine siderophore biosynthesis ( pvdD, pvdI, pvdJ, pvdL, pvdQ, and mbtH), acetoin and 2,3 -butanediol biosynthesis ( alS, budA, budB, and budC), phenazine biosynthesis ( phzF), oxidative stress ( GST , sodB, and cat), quorum sens-ing ( ribB), arsenate and atrazine degradation ( arsC, gabT, and ureC), and 4 -hydroxybenzo-ate biosynthesis ( ubiC) (Table S2). The highest abundances of the genes i nvolved in nitro-gen cycling ‚ÄînifA, fixJ, amoA, nirK, nirS, and norB‚Äîwere observed in the F1 rhizosphere (GZ2, GZ3, GZ2, GZ3, GZ3, and GZ3, respectively) (Figure 3a and Table S2). Notably, the highest abundances of the genes concerned with phosphorus  cycling, including glucose dehydrogenase ( gdh), polyphosphate kinase ( ppk), exopolyphosphatase (PPX), and the phosphate transport system ( pstA) were observed in GZ3. Among the genes involved in potassium cycling, we observed the highest abundances of the potassium efflux ( kefA and B) and the potassium uptake ( kup) genes in GZ3 , while the highest abundance of the po-tassium transport ( ktrA) gene was observed in AG1 (Figure 3a and Table S2).  The analysis also revealed the abundance of various genes involved i n both the direct and indirect enhancement of plant growth and health. The abundances of  the ipdC, trpA, Figure 2.

Genes That Facilitate Nutrient Mobilization and Plant GrowthThe metagenomic analysis of microbial functional genes in our samples using theSEED subsystems revealed a total of 8091 functional genes, of which several involved in thecycling of major nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) that promote soil fertilitywere identiÔ¨Åed (Table S2). The plant growth-promoting genes assessed in our study werethose involved in nitrogen Ô¨Åxation ( nifA,nifH, and Ô¨ÅxJ), nitriÔ¨Åcation ( amoA), denitriÔ¨Åcation(nirK,nirS, and norB), phosphorus cycling ( gdh,ppX,ppK, and pstA,), potassium cycling(kefA,kefB,kup,ktrA, and ktrB), ACC deaminase activity ( acdS and dcyD), IAA biosynthesis(ipdC), tryptophan biosynthesis ( trpA and trpB), sulfur metabolism ( cysC,cysD,cysH,cysI,cysJ, and cysN), pyoverdine siderophore biosynthesis ( pvdD,pvdI,pvdJ,pvdL,pvdQ, andmbtH), acetoin and 2,3-butanediol biosynthesis ( alS,budA,budB, and budC), phenazinebiosynthesis ( phzF), oxidative stress ( GST ,sodB, and cat), quorum sensing ( ribB), arsenateand atrazine degradation ( arsC,gabT, and ureC), and 4-hydroxybenzoate biosynthesis ( ubiC)(Table S2). The highest abundances of the genes involved in nitrogen cycling‚Äî nifA,Ô¨ÅxJ,amoA,nirK,nirS, and norB‚Äîwere observed in the F1 rhizosphere (GZ2, GZ3, GZ2, GZ3,GZ3, and GZ3, respectively) (Figure 3a and Table S2). Notably, the highest abundancesof the genes concerned with phosphorus cycling, including glucose dehydrogenase ( gdh),polyphosphate kinase ( ppk), exopolyphosphatase (PPX), and the phosphate transportsystem ( pstA) were observed in GZ3. Among the genes involved in potassium cycling, weobserved the highest abundances of the potassium efÔ¨Çux ( kefA and B) and the potassiumuptake ( kup) genes in GZ3, while the highest abundance of the potassium transport ( ktrA)gene was observed in AG1 (Figure 3a and Table S2).Genes 2021 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW  8 of 20   trpB, budA, budB, and alS genes were highest in AG1 compared to dcyD, budC, phzF, arsC, sodB, and GST , whose highest abundances were observed in GZ3 (F igure 3a and Table S2). Further analysis of genes involved in plant growth promotion using the linear discrimi-nant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) on the galaxy server revealed the differences in the composition of these genes between the fields by desc ribing their effect sizes. While per-forming the analysis, we used the strict (all classes differential) version, which identified 19 of the 46 plant growth -promoting genes , showing statistically differential and biologi-cally consistent differences ( Œ± = 0.05) in the GZ samples (Figure 3b). In the AG samples, 11 plant growth -promoting genes with statistically differential abundance were observed (Figure 3b). The results revealed that the genes GST  and kup (with  an LDA score nearly 4 orders of magnitude)  were the most differentially abundant ( Œ± = 0.05) plant growth -pro-moting genes observed in the GZ samples, whereas  the cysN and cat (with  an LDA score over 3.5 orders of magnitude) were the most differentially abundant ( Œ± = 0.05) in the AG samples (Figure 3b). The differences observed in the abundance of these genes among the samples reached a threshold of 2.75 for the GZ samples and 2.85 for the AG samples (Fig-ure 3b).   Figure 3.

GZ and AG stand for rhizosphere samples from the former grasslandand the intensively cultivated soils, respectively.Genes 2021 ,12, 1431 8 of 18The analysis also revealed the abundance of various genes involved in both the di-rect and indirect enhancement of plant growth and health. The abundances of the ipdC,trpA,trpB,budA,budB, and alS genes were highest in AG1 compared to dcyD,budC,phzF,arsC,sodB, and GST , whose highest abundances were observed in GZ3 ( Figure 3a andTable S2). Further analysis of genes involved in plant growth promotion using the lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) on the galaxy server revealed the differ-ences in the composition of these genes between the Ô¨Åelds by describing their effect sizes.While performing the analysis, we used the strict (all classes differential) version, whichidentiÔ¨Åed 19 of the 46 plant growth-promoting genes, showing statistically differentialand biologically consistent differences ( = 0.05) in the GZ samples (Figure 3b). In theAG samples, 11 plant growth-promoting genes with statistically differential abundancewere observed ( Figure 3b ). The results revealed that the genes GST and kup(with an LDAscore nearly 4 orders of magnitude) were the most differentially abundant ( = 0.05) plantgrowth-promoting genes observed in the GZ samples, whereas the cysN and cat(with anLDA score over 3.5 orders of magnitude) were the most differentially abundant ( = 0.05)in the AG samples (Figure 3b). The differences observed in the abundance of these genesamong the samples reached a threshold of 2.75 for the GZ samples and 2.85 for the AGsamples (Figure 3b).To evaluate the diversity of plant growth-promoting genes in the samples, we usedthe Simpson, Shannon, and Evenness indices. The diversity analysis indicated that therewas no signiÔ¨Åcant difference (Kruskal‚ÄìWallis, p= 0.94) in the diversity of genes involved inplant growth promotion between the samples. From the diversity analyses, the Simpsonindex was the same (0.95) in all samples. However, the Shannon and Evenness indiceswere higher in the GZ than in the AG samples (Figure S2). The diversity (the diversitybetween the GZ and AG samples), which was determined using the analysis of similarity(ANOSIM), revealed that there was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference ( p= 0.01 and R= 0.52) in thediversity of these genes among the samples, thereby conÔ¨Årming the result obtained fromthe principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), which displayed a distinct separation betweenthe GZ and AG samples and a close clustering of the GZ samples (Figure 4). The similaritypercentage (SIMPER) analysis showed an overall average dissimilarity of 28 in the plantgrowth-promoting genes between all GZ and AG samples, with the kupgene contributingthe most (8.70%) to the dissimilarity (Table 1). On the other hand, within the GZ samples(GZ1‚ÄìGZ4), we observed the highest overall average dissimilarity of 24.20 between the GZ3and GZ4 samples, whereas among the AG samples (AG1‚ÄìAG4), the highest overall averagedissimilarity of 48.0 was observed between the sample pair AG1 and AG3 (Table 1).3.4.2. Microbial Genes Involved in Carbon CyclingGenes that were considered to be associated with carbon cycling were identiÔ¨Åedusing the functional category of the SEED subsystems (Table S3). From our analysis ofthe metagenomes in the maize rhizosphere soils, we found 34 important genes that werelinked with carbon cycling in all samples. These genes include those concerned withthe metabolism of carbohydrate ( galK,glcD,manA,manC,melA, and lacZ), the Ô¨Åxing ofcarbon ( codH,cbbL,cbbR,cbbO,cbbQ,cbbX,cbbS,gap2, and rpe), and the degrading ofstarch ( amyA,glgB,glgC,bglX,malZ,malQ,abfA,treA, and treC), methane ( glpX,fbaA,fbaB,mxaF, and mmo X), hemicellulose ( araB,xylA, and xynA), and xenobiotics ( vanB and uidA).With respect to carbon Ô¨Åxation, the abundance of the cbbR,cbbS,cbbX, and codH geneswere highest in the AG rhizosphere compared to the gap2,rpe,cbbL,cbbO, and cbbQ geneswhose abundances were observed to be highest in the GZ rhizosphere. Interestingly, allthe methane-degrading genes ( mxaF,mmo X,fbaA,fbaB, and glpX) were more abundant inthe GZ than in the AG rhizosphere (Figure 5a and Table S3). The abundance of severalgenes involved in starch degradation, including amyA,glgB,glgC,malZ,malQ,abfA, andtreA, was highest in the GZ samples. Furthermore, the highest abundances of several genesinvolved in hemicellulose degradation ( araB,xylA, and xynA), carbohydrate metabolism(lacZ,melA, and glcD), and xenobiotics degradation ( vanB) were observed in the GZ samplesGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 9 of 18(Figure 5a and Table S3 ). By employing the strict (all classes differential) version of thelinear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe), we determined the effect sizes ofdifferences in the abundance and distribution of carbon-cycling genes between the Ô¨Åelds(GZ = GZ1‚ÄìGZ4 and AG = AG1‚ÄìAG4). The output revealed 12 and 6 carbon-cycling genes(out of the 34 genes), showing statistically differential and biologically consistent differencesin the GZ and AG samples (Figure 5b). From the analysis, the most differentially abundant(= 0.05) carbon-cycling genes in GZ were those concerned with methane degradation(mxaF,fbaB,rpe, and mmo X), with high LDA scores (over 3 orders of magnitude), reaching athreshold of 4.3 ( Figure 5b ). On the other hand, the most differentially abundant ( = 0.05)carbon-cycling genes observed in the AG samples were the codH and bglX genes, involvedin carbon Ô¨Åxation and starch degradation, with high LDA scores of 4.3 (Figure 5b).Genes 2021 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW  9 of 20   in plant growth promotion between the samples. From the Œ± diversity analyses, the Simp-son index was the same (0.95) in all samples. However,  the Shannon and Evenness indices were higher in the GZ than in the AG samples (Figure S2). The Œ≤ diversity (the diversity between the GZ and AG samples), which was determined using the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), revealed that there was a significant difference ( p = 0.01 and R = 0.52) in the diversity o f these genes among the samples , thereby confirming the result obtained from the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), which displayed a distinct separation between the GZ and AG samples and a close clustering of the GZ samples (Figure 4). The similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis showed an overall average dissimilarity of 28 in the plant growth -promoting genes between all GZ and AG samples , with the kup gene contributing the most (8.70%) to the dissimilarity (Table 1).  On the other hand, within the GZ sa mples (GZ1‚ÄìGZ4), we observed the highest overall average dissimilarity of 24.20 between the GZ3 and GZ4 samples, whereas among the AG samples (AG1 ‚ÄìAG4), the highest overall average dissimilarity of 48.0 was observed between the sample pair AG1 and AG3 (Tab le 1).

Influence of Soil Physicochemical Properties on the Diversity of Carbon -Cycling and Plant Growth -Promoting Genes  In this study, we employed the canoni cal correspondence analysis (CCA) to assess the correlation between the microbial functional genes in the study and the soils‚Äô physi-cochemical parameters. We computed the CCA plot with all the environmental variables , as presented in Figure 7 , and observed a CCA permutation test of 0.015, indicating that the composition of the carbon -cycling and plant growth -promoting genes were affected by the physicochemical properties of the soils (Figure 7). A correlation analysis showed that cysC, cysJ, dcyD, ipdC, pvdQ, pvd L, cbbL, cbbQ, rpe, treC, gap2, mxaF, mmo X, and uidA negatively correlated with N -NH4 and positively correlated with N -NO 3, N-NH 4, pH, OC, and OM. On the other hand, cbbX, ureC, and manC positively correlated with N -NH 4 and negatively co rrelated with N -NO 3, N-NH 4, pH, OC, and OM. However, abfA, cbbR, and cbbS positively correlated with all the tested variables (N -NO 3, N-NH 4, pH, OC, and OM). The forward selection option through the Monte Carlo permutation test , with 9999 ran-dom permutatio ns, was used to study which soil chemical parameter was the most influ-ential in the differences observed in the microbial functional genes across the samples (Table S 4). From the analysis, we found that N -NO 3 contributed the most (31.3%) to the variation, with a p-value of 0.05 (Table S4).  Figure 6.

Discussion  The practice of land -use conversion has become common over the years , with studies reporting its impacts on soil microbial communities and the environment ; however, the effects of land -use history on microbial functional gene potential in the rhizosphere of plants remain understudied.

DiscussionThe practice of land-use conversion has become common over the years, with studiesreporting its impacts on soil microbial communities and the environment; however, the ef-fects of land-use history on microbial functional gene potential in the rhizosphere of plantsremain understudied. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, this study revealed thedifferences in microbial functional genes, particularly those involved in nutrient mobiliza-tion, plant growth promotion, and carbon cycling of land previously used as pasture (witha lower N fertilizer application rate and a no-tillage system), and of land that had beenunder intensive cultivation (with a higher N fertilizer application rate and a conventionaltillage system) for several years. We showed that the abundance and diversity of the genesinvolved in plant growth-promotion and carbon cycling within these Ô¨Åelds are distinctfrom one another, thereby representing the land-use and management histories of the Ô¨Åelds.The soils also differed in their physicochemical properties, which also contributed to thedifferences in the diversity of the genes. This study highlighted the effects of land-use andmanagement histories as well as soil chemical properties on the functioning and mainte-nance of the soil ecosystem, especially in nitrogen and carbon cycling, in order to presentthe long-term effects of cultivation on these functional genes in the plants‚Äô rhizosphere.Understanding the long-term effects of land-use and management practices on the diversityof microbial functional genes helps to explain how the soil ecosystem copes with currentand future agricultural management practices.Although the rhizosphere metagenomes contained sequences that originate from thearchaeal and fungal groups, sequences from the bacterial families were more predominantas they represented more than 99% of the sequences. The analysis of microbial familiesin the study revealed that some bacterial communities were more predominant in oneÔ¨Åeld than the other, thereby indicating the possible effects of land use on microbial com-munity composition and diversity. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the Ô¨Åelds weredominated by important microbial communities known to improve plant growth anddegrade complex polysaccharides, including chitin, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose,and plant residues in soils [ 42]. Micromonosporaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Nocardioidaceae,and Bradyrhizobiaceae (signiÔ¨Åcantly more abundant in the F1 rhizosphere samples) areimportant plant colonizers and have been implicated in plant growth promotion in var-ious agricultural soils [ 43]. Their contributions toward plant growth and developmentinclude the production, regulation, and degradation of phytohormones, the productionof siderophores, mineralization and mobilization of soil nutrients, production of vitaminsfor plant growth, antagonism against various phytopathogens, among other importantfunctions in the soil [ 43‚Äì45]. The abundance of these communities in the Ô¨Åelds indicatetheir relevance in maintaining soil fertility and plant health in the soils. We also suggestedthat the differentially abundant microbial families (Figure 2) might likely be important,particularly in the functioning of the host plants, and contribute immensely towards theplants‚Äô health and Ô¨Åtness as proposed by Hartman et al. [ 46] and P √©rez-Jaramillo et al. [ 47].The composition of microbial functional genes involved in plant growth promotionin the rhizosphere soils was signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by the soils‚Äô management regimes. TheGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 13 of 18composition of genes involved in plant growth promotion in the former grassland (GZ)soils differed from those of the intensively cultivated land (AG). From the analyses, thehigher abundance of genes involved in nitrogen cycling in the GZ (F1 rhizosphere) samplesindicates that management practices impact the abundance of these genes in the plant rhi-zosphere. The differences observed in the abundance of genes concerned with nitrogen Ô¨Åxa-tion ( nifA and Ô¨ÅxJ) in the soils further suggest that reduced fertilizer application rates mightincrease biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation in agricultural soils. Yu et al. [ 48] also reported a higherabundance of the nitrogen Ô¨Åxation gene, nifH, in a reduced fertilizer-treated soil. Our re-sults on the abundance of nitrogen Ô¨Åxation genes is also evidenced by the higher abundanceof the nitrogen-Ô¨Åxing microbial communities‚Äîthe Micromonosporaceae, Frankiaceae, andBradyrhizobiaceae families [ 49,50]‚Äîobserved in GZ soils ( Figures 2 and S1 ). The dataconcurs with previous studies that suggest that the amount of biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxationin lower N-fertilized soils is higher compared to higher N-fertilized soils [ 48,51]. Moreover,land tilling also affects the abundance of genes involved in several stages of nitrogenÔ¨Åxation [ 52]. Under low N fertilization (67 kg ha 1), Hu et al. [ 53] reported that the relativeabundance of the nifH transcript was higher in no-till soils than in conventionally tilledsoils. Furthermore, the inÔ¨Çuence of soil management was also observed in the abundance ofgenes involved in nitriÔ¨Åcation ( amoA) and denitriÔ¨Åcation ( norB,nirK, and nirS) in the soils.Hu, Jin, Konkel, Schaeffer, Schneider and DeBruyn [ 53] studied the effects of agriculturalmanagement on the abundance of genes involved in nitrogen cycling. They observed thatunder N fertilizer treatment (67 kg ha 1), both the relative abundance and transcript of theamoA gene was increased in no-till soils. However, for the denitriÔ¨Åcation genes, the relativeabundance of nirK increased in no-till plots, whereas the nirS gene was higher in conven-tionally tilled plots. These results conÔ¨Årm that N fertilization promotes denitriÔ¨Åcationand nitriÔ¨Åcation in agricultural soils, and that reduced fertilization management enhancesthese processes [ 54]. Therefore, our results suggest that management practices altered theenvironmental conditions of the soils, which subsequently impacted the abundance ofnutrient-cycling genes in the soils.Many soil microbes act as biocontrol agents by producing and secreting bioactivesubstances (secondary metabolites) known as siderophores [ 55]. The production andsecretion of siderophores are one of the various modes of biocontrol activity used bymicrobes to acquire the nutrient element, iron [ 56]. The analysis of microbial functionalgenes involved in plant growth promotion revealed higher abundances of the pvdD,pvdJ,pvdI, and mbtH genes that are linked with the production and utilization of pyoverdinesiderophore in the former grassland rhizosphere samples, thereby indicating that microbialcommunities in these soils might have high disease-suppressive capabilities. Our resultsrevealed distinct dissimilarities in the diversity (ANOSIM, p= 0.01 and R= 0.52) of microbialfunctional genes responsible for plant growth promotion, as observed in the principalcoordinate analysis (PCoA) (Figure 4) and the similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis(Table 1). We attribute these dissimilarities to the different management practices involvedin the Ô¨Åelds, which have subsequently impacted the functional attributes of the soils.Although the diversity for these genes was not signiÔ¨Åcant between both Ô¨Åelds, weobserved higher diversity indices in the F1 soils than in the F2 soils. Likewise, the PCoAplot displayed a close clustering of samples from the same Ô¨Åeld, with samples from adistinct Ô¨Åeld widely separated, pointing toward land-use and management differences(Figure 4). These results, in collaboration with the similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER)of the plant growth-promoting genes observed in the samples, are in agreement with ourhypothesis that the diversity of microbial functional genes in F1 will differ from those of F2due to land-use and management histories.Microbial communities in soils contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly towards soil organic carboncycling and Ô¨Åxation, while changes and the pattern of changes in the soil organic carbonpool are regulated by the soil microbial community structure [ 57,58]. The impact of land-use and management histories on the distribution of carbon-cycling functional genes asassessed by our study revealed that speciÔ¨Åc gene families concerned with carbon cyclingGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 14 of 18were preferentially associated with a particular soil. For example, the carbon Ô¨Åxation genes,cbbL (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain), cbbQ (RuBisCo activation protein),cbbO (RuBisCo activation protein), and rpe(Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase), were statisti-cally differentially abundant ( = 0.05) in the F1 rhizosphere (GZ) soils compared to codH(carbon monoxide dehydrogenase large chain) and cbbX (probable RuBisCo-expressionprotein) that were statistically differentially abundant ( = 0.05) in the F2 rhizosphere (AG)soils (Figure 5b). Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) is the principal enzymein the Calvin‚ÄìBenson cycle, which initiates the process of carbon Ô¨Åxation [ 28]. Theseresults indicate that the agricultural management history of each Ô¨Åeld (grassland withno tilling and lower N fertilization, and continuous cultivation with tilling and higherN fertilization) might have provided similar conditions that favored broad colonizationby microbial communities with the same functional groups in each Ô¨Åeld. Furthermore,the genes associated with methane degradation, mxaF,fbaB, and mmo X, were signiÔ¨Åcantlymore abundant in the F1 rhizosphere soils than in the F2 rhizosphere soils. We suggestthat higher and prolonged fertilizer use in the intensively cultivated soils (F2) may haveinÔ¨Çuenced the lower abundance of the genes involved in methane degradation in thesesoils. Manoharan, Kushwaha, Ahr √©n, and Hedlund [ 1] also reported a higher abundance ofgenes in grassland soils than in cultivated soils. They further indicated that the continuousapplication of fertilizers in agricultural soils can inhibit methane breakdown in these soils.In our study, the higher abundance of genes involved in the degradation of methane in F1soils is a conÔ¨Årmation of the results observed in the physicochemical components of thesoils, which revealed higher OC, TC, and OM contents in the former grassland soils. Theseresults, along with those of the microbial composition of the soils, conÔ¨Årm that the F1 soilenvironment is colonized by active methanotrophic microbial communities that metabolizeand use methane as sources of energy and carbon, thereby helping to regulate methaneÔ¨Çux in the environment.The similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) further revealed the extent of dissimilar-ity in the diversity of carbon-cycling genes between the GZ and AG soils, whereas the PCoAplot demonstrated that there were obvious differences in the abundance and distribution ofcarbon-cycling genes across the Ô¨Åelds. Taken together, these results conÔ¨Årmed our secondassumption in which we hypothesized that land-use and management histories wouldimpact the diversity of the genes observed in the rhizosphere of the former grassland andthe intensively cultivated land. Gaining insights into how the composition and diversity ofmicrobial carbon-cycling genes in the rhizosphere are impacted by land use may furtherincrease our knowledge of the effects of anthropogenic activities on carbon Ô¨Çux in theagricultural soil environment.In our study, differences were observed in the chemical properties of both Ô¨Åelds.The amounts of N-NO 3, K, OM, TC, and OC were higher in the F1 soils than in the F2soils, while N-NH 4content was higher in the F2 than in the F1 rhizosphere samples(Table S1). Land disturbances arising from long-term agricultural practices may impactthe physicochemical properties of soils and alter the composition and properties of thesoils‚Äô biogeochemical interfaces [ 59]. Moreover, the soil microbial community structureand function may be impacted by land-use practices, resulting in an alteration of thesoils‚Äô chemical properties [ 8,60]. Long-term continuous agricultural practices, such asfertilization and tillage reduce soil quality and cause land degradation [ 61]. Based onour study, we suggest that the lower levels of OM, TC, OC, and N-NO 3observed in theF2 soils were due to intensive cultivation practices in the Ô¨Åeld, as continuous cultivationdegrades the physicochemical properties of soils. These results coincide with those ofFujisao et al. [ 62], who indicated that continuous cultivation under conventional tillingreduces the contents of TC, TN, and exchangeable K in maize soils. The lower OC in F2soils may also explain the reason for the lower OM in the soils. Long-term cultivationreduces OC, which contains about 58% of OM [ 63]. Therefore, land cultivation with heavypieces of machinery and the persistent application of fertilizers over a long period increasesthe mineralization and degradation of OM and OC in soils [ 64]. Additionally, lower levelsGenes 2021 ,12, 1431 15 of 18of soil organic matter (SOM) due to intensive cropping reduces soil fertility over time bydepleting the stocks of important soil elements, such as N, P , and S [ 65]. This may be thecase in our study, with the lowest levels of S observed in AG2 and completely absent inother F2 (AG1, AG3, and AG4) samples. Furthermore, conventional agricultural practicescause the acidiÔ¨Åcation of soils. The literature has indicated that the extremely long use andheavy application of N fertilizer reduce soil pH [ 66,67]. As observed in our study, lower pHvalues were detected in F2 soils, indicating the inÔ¨Çuence of long-term intensive agricultureon the soils‚Äô pH. This result is also consistent with the amounts of N-NO 3and N-NH 4found in the soils, as N in the form of nitrate (NO 3) increases the pH in the rhizosphere,while N in ammonium (NH 4) results in the acidiÔ¨Åcation of the rhizosphere [ 68]. On theother hand, Sengupta et al. [ 69] reported lower pH in plow-till soils and higher pH in no-tillsoils, in line with the results of this study. Furthermore, the canonical correspondenceanalysis (CCA) showed that N-NO 3, with a signiÔ¨Åcance level of 0.05, contributed themost (31%) to the differences observed in the diversity and abundance of carbon-cyclingand plant growth-promoting genes in the samples (Figure 7 and Table S4). Apart fromN-NO 3, our results also showed that other soil properties, including N-NH4, pH, OC, andOM, also contributed to the observed differences, as shown in the length of their vectorarrows in Figure 7. These results agree with Li et al. [ 70], who reported that NO 3, pH,NH 4, and OC were inÔ¨Çuential factors that determined the abundance and distribution offunctional genes in heavy metal-contaminated soils. The results of this study indicate thatsoil physicochemical properties also impact microbial functional gene composition anddiversity in soils.5. ConclusionsShotgun metagenomic sequencing was applied on maize rhizosphere soils to elucidatethe effects of land-use and management histories on the diversity and composition ofmicrobial functional genes involved in plant growth promotion and carbon cycling. Thedifferences in the abundance of functional genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism,carbon Ô¨Åxation, methane degradation, plant growth promotion, and nutrient mobiliza-tion are evidence that land-use and management histories impact microbial functions inagricultural soils. Moreover, among the soil properties, N-NO 3was the most inÔ¨Çuentialin determining the composition and diversity of these genes across the samples; this in-dicates that soil chemical properties, which are also highly inÔ¨Çuenced by anthropogenicactivities [ 59], are strong factors that affect microbial functions in soils. The taxonomicdiversity revealed the abundance of microorganisms linked with important functions in theplant rhizosphere, with a majority more abundant in the former grassland rhizosphere; inaddition, it reÔ¨Çected the effects of agricultural practices on the rhizosphere microbiota. Thestudy increased our understanding of the relationship between plant health, biogeochemi-cal nutrient cycling, the rhizosphere microbiome, and anthropogenic activities, all of whichhave direct or indirect effects on food production as the increasing human populationexerts more pressure on crop yield. Future studies that target the genes expressed in thesesoils may help divulge the different microbial functional genes truly active in the rhizo-sphere soils and enhance our understanding of the functioning of microbial communitiesin the plant rhizosphere. In conclusion, this study conÔ¨Årmed that land-use history andmanagement practices could impact the environmental conditions of soils, which maysubsequently inÔ¨Çuence the ecosystem services (functions) of the microbial communities inthe rhizosphere of agricultural soils.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/genes12091431/s1.
