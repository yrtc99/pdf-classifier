Plant inputs, the dominant organic constituent of SOC, enter the soil as either aboveground or belowground C, and include both structural litter inputs (root and shoot detritus) and dissolved organic car-bon (DOC; for example, rhizodeposition and leaf litter leachate). Historically, aboveground structural residues were assumed to be the dominant source of C to the soil and a primary control on the rate of SOC accumulation3,4. However, there is growing recognition that the contributions from belowground C inputs have been vastly underestimated3,5. Specifically, labile DOC inputs from rhizodepo -sition (for example, root exudates) are now appreciated as impor -tant sources of C to the soil6 and key precursors of slow-cycling SOC (hereafter, ‘stable SOC’)7–9. At the same time, recalcitrant aboveg -round litter C is increasingly regarded as a comparatively inefficient C source to form stable SOC10–12.A suite of recent studies have found that the C contributions from belowground inputs can exceed those of aboveground inputs4,10–13. In sharp contrast to the traditional paradigm, these findings have prompted many to start categorizing the belowground pathway as the dominant C source of stable SOC3,5,14,15. This view has grown more widespread, even as research on leaf litter leachate DOC shows that this aboveground source can also deliver substantial amounts of C to the soil16–18. Support for the belowground pathway has gained traction because its primacy is theorized to be more than simply a function of the quantity and quality of C flowing through it. Namely, unique features of the belowground pathway itself, which promote direct and intimate association between C inputs and the mineral soil, are posited to confer more efficient stabilization per unit of C relative to aboveground inputs4,19.Although the features proposed to lead to more efficient sta -bilization via the belowground pathway are compelling, they lack definitive empirical support and have not been well-quantified20—especially when controlling for the confounding roles of C qual -ity and quantity. Here, we address three pathway effects that have been posited as key mechanisms in the specific context of the ‘DOC-microbial route’ to mineral stabilization21. That is, the route by which labile DOC compounds (for example, glucose) from aboveground and belowground plant sources are anabolized by the soil microbial community before their stabilization in the mineral-associated SOC (MASOC) pool7,8,22 (as opposed to other routes such as direct sorption onto soil metals/minerals23 or aggregate forma -tion19). Resolving the mechanisms underlying the stabilization of aboveground versus belowground inputs via the DOC-microbial route is critical because as much as 50–80% of stable SOC may be microbially derived24,25.First, aboveground DOC (for example, leaf litter leachate) must travel a longer and more circuitous route to the mineral soil than belowground root inputs, including passage through the organic horizon26—where DOC may be absorbed or released back into the atmosphere via microbial respiration16,27 (Fig. 1a, mechanism 1).  Second, while aboveground leachate DOC spreads diffusely across a region of relatively low microbial abundance and activity (that is, the bulk soil), belowground root DOC inputs enter directly into a spatially constrained, microbially dense area of the mineral soil (that is, the rhizosphere)10. Since microbial residues are the dominant source of C to the MASOC pool via the DOC-microbial route to stabilization (for example, microbial necromass and other byproducts)8,23,28, the higher microbial abundance in the rhizosphere should increase the chance that C inputs are assimilated, anabolized and then transformed to microbial products before their incorpo -ration in the stable MASOC pool (Fig. 1a, mechanism 2)14. Third, belowground rhizosphere DOC inputs generally enter the soil as a continuous, low-volume ‘drip’ throughout the growing season29, which should promote steady microbial anabolism and turnover. In contrast, aboveground DOC inputs leach down the soil profile Microbial formation of stable soil carbon is more efficient from belowground than aboveground inputNoah W. Sokol   1,2* and Mark A. Bradford   1The relative contributions of aboveground versus belowground plant carbon inputs to the stable soil organic carbon pool are the subject of much debate—with direct implications for how the carbon cycle is modelled and managed. The belowground rhizosphere pathway (that is, carbon exiting the living root) is theorized to form stable soil carbon more efficiently than the aboveground pathway. However, while several mechanisms have been invoked to explain this efficiency, few have been empiri-cally tested or quantified. Here, we use soil microcosms with standardized carbon inputs to investigate three posited mecha-nisms that differentiate aboveground from belowground input pathways of dissolved organic carbon—through the microbial biomass—to the mineral-stabilized soil organic carbon pool: (1) the physical distance travelled, (2) the microbial abundance in the region in which a carbon compound enters (that is, rhizosphere versus bulk soil) and (3) the frequency and volume of car -bon delivery (that is, infrequent ‘pulse’ versus frequent ‘drip’). We demonstrate that through the microbial formation pathway, belowground inputs form mineral-stabilized soil carbon more efficiently than aboveground inputs, partly due to the greater efficiency of formation by the rhizosphere microbial community relative to the bulk soil community. However, we show that because the bulk soil has greater capacity to form mineral-stabilized soil carbon due to its greater overall volume, the relative contributions of aboveground versus belowground carbon inputs depend strongly on the ratio of rhizosphere to bulk soil.NAture Geo ScieNce | VOL 12 | JANUARY 2019 | 46–53 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 46Articles NaTure GeoscieNceas infrequent ‘pulses’ during precipitation events26. Although pulses may transiently spike microbial biomass and activity28, a temporar -ily enlarged community may also co-metabolize a large proportion of the newly formed MASOC (Fig. 1a, mechanism 3).These three mechanistic features of the belowground root path -way may substantively influence SOC dynamics, helping to explain why belowground inputs are retained in the mineral soil between two to five times more efficiently than aboveground inputs4,19. If such pathway differences broadly apply across space and time, their inclusion is probably necessary for accurate portrayals and predic-tions of the terrestrial C cycle12. Indeed, it has been argued that the stabilization of belowground C inputs cannot simply be modelled as a function of their quantity and quality, but must be addition-ally represented by a coefficient that accounts for their more effi -cient stabilization11,12,30. However, although most conventional soil organic matter models include coefficients that distinguish the quality of plant material, they do not model processes that differen -tiate the efficiency of the aboveground versus belowground C-input pathways for stable SOC formation12,20. Further, most experiments that have explored aboveground versus belowground contributions to the stable SOC pool have typically used C compounds or shoot and root biomarkers (for example, cutin and suberin, respectively) that do not uncouple the role of C quality and quantity from spe-cific pathway effects10,11,31–33. Thus, on the basis of current empirical knowledge, it remains an open and pressing question as to whether the belowground DOC pathway should be characterized as a more efficient conduit to stable SOC formation—and if so, what specific mechanistic features underlie it.Doc entry simulationTo specifically target potential belowground versus aboveground pathway effects, we used soil microcosms with a recreated organic Organic horizonOrganic horizonMineral soilMineral soilAboveground inputsBelowground inputsBulk soil Bulk soil RhizosphereInfrequent DOC pulseFrequent DOC dripMicrobeMineral particleMicrobial residue 8 761 23 45Aboveground inputs Belowground inputsMechanismsab Experimental designMechanism 1: Distance of travel(aboveground versus belowground)Mechanism 2: Region of entry(rhizosphere versus bulk soil)Mechanism 3: Frequency of entry(infrequent pulse versus frequent drip)Rhizosphere Bulk soilP ulse DripFig. 1 | Proposed mechanisms favouring the efficiency of the belowground versus aboveground pathway in the Doc -microbial route to mineral stabilization. a, The tested mechanisms include (1) a shorter distance of travel to the mineral soil, (2) direct entry into the microbially dense rhizosphere and (3) entry as a frequent, low-volume drip versus an infrequent, high-volume pulse, promoting steady microbial anabolism and turnover. b, Fully crossed experimental design testing the interaction of all proposed mechanisms (a fixed quantity of 13C-glucose was inserted into one of the eight location ×  frequency combinations).NAture Geo ScieNce | VOL 12 | JANUARY 2019 | 46–53 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 47Articles NaTure GeoscieNcehorizon, mineral horizon, bulk soil region and rhizosphere, which surrounded a microporous plastic ‘root’34 (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 1). We tested the three different mechanisms as they specifically relate to the DOC-microbial route to mineral stabilization (Fig. 1a). Although belowground root DOC typically enters as a frequent drip into the rhizosphere via rhizodeposition, and aboveground DOC litter leachate inputs are typically pulsed into the bulk soil via pre-cipitation events, we used a fully crossed experimental design to discern any interactions between the proposed three mechanisms. Thus, we employed eight different location ×  frequency combina-tions (four locations, two frequencies), in which the same quality and quantity of DOC was inserted: (1) aboveground and below-ground, (2) proximally and distally to the rhizosphere and (3) as a drip and a pulse. Over the course of the experimental period, we inserted a solution containing a fixed amount of 13C-labelled glu -cose (99 atom% 13C) into one of these location ×  frequency combi -nations per treatment (see treatments 1–8 in Fig. 1b). Unlabelled glucose was simultaneously inserted into the other seven locations, ensuring all microcosms experienced exactly the same conditions. We selected glucose as a model DOC compound to test the posited pathway effects because monomeric carbohydrates are a common constituent of both belowground root exudates35 and aboveground leaf litter leachate36 and are typically rapidly and efficiently anabo -lized by soil microbes8.An artificial rhizosphere environment (hereafter, ‘the rhizo -sphere’) was successfully generated around the plastic root. On average, the concentration of total microbial biomass (12C +  13C) in the rhizosphere was ~25% larger than the bulk soil—well within the range of values observed in the field37 (Supplementary Table 3). Our design emulated a high-leaching temperate forest ecosystem context during the first months of the growing season (a ten-week experimental period), when both root exudation and litter leachate flux (via precipitation events) are high16,38. SOC formation via the DOC-microbial route primarily occurs on these short timescales21.We tracked the recovery of 13C-glucose in several different soil C pools, including MASOC, particulate organic C, microbial biomass C (MBC) and C remaining in soil solution as DOC. We focused pri-marily on the formation of MASOC because this pool contains the subset of stable SOC that is considered to have the longest turnover times (centuries to millennia). ‘Stable 13C-MASOC’ was identified by exposing the MASOC pool (total 13C-MASOC)—isolated via physical fractionation—to a chemical stabilization assay (reflux -ing the <  53 µ m fraction with 6 M hydrogen chloride)39. There are several different methods of determining SOC stability; we selected this particular two-step approach because (1) the DOC-microbial route is predominantly associated with the organo-mineral frac-tion21 and (2) the chemical stability of organo-mineral sorption is an important determinant of its persistence in the soil and is generally correlated with other metrics of stability (for example, long-term incubation ‘biological stabilization’ assays)40.Pathway of entryThe belowground pathway, entering directly into the mineral soil, was the more efficient conduit of C to the stable 13C-MASOC pool. Across treatments, ~9% of belowground 13C-glucose inputs were transformed to stable 13C-MASOC, compared with ~5% of aboveground inputs (Supplementary Table 2). This nearly twofold difference was due, in part, to the fact that belowground inputs cir-cumvented passage through the organic horizon (Supplementary Fig. 2). A far greater proportion of total aboveground glucose supply (~36 times) was retained in the organic horizon relative to below-ground glucose inputs, reducing the amount of aboveground C ulti -mately delivered to the mineral horizon (Fig. 1a, mechanism 1).Once glucose did enter the mineral soil—whether as an aboveg -round or a belowground input—a key determinant of its mineral stabilization was the proportion assimilated and transformed by the soil microbial biomass. First, to test the strength of the direct interaction between glucose and mineral surfaces in our specific forest soil, we conducted an adsorption assay on sterilized samples of sieved mineral soil. Specifically, soil samples were shaken with a 13C-glucose solution for 24 h, which was added at the same concen -tration of 13C-glucose per dry gram of soil as was added to the rhi -zosphere of each microcosm. We then exposed the isolated MASOC fraction to a chemical stabilization assay (described above) and found that, in the absence of a microbial community, only ~0.3% of added 13C-glucose was recovered as stable 13C-MASOC (Supplementary Table 2)—consistent with previous studies that showed low reac -tivity of glucose with the mineral phase41. In contrast, ~3–13% of added 13C-glucose was recovered as stable 13C-MASOC when a microbial community was present (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 2).  Moreover, the values within this range were positively associated with the total amount of 13C-glucose anabolized by the microbial community. That is, when considering the 13C budget of the whole microcosm, we found a strong, linear relationship between the total amount of 13C recovered in the MBC pool and the total amount of 13C in the stable MASOC pool (Fig. 2b; coefficient of determination r2 =  0.70). Viewed together, these observations confirm that micro -bial uptake and transformation of 13C-glucose was an important precursor for its efficient mineral stabilization.Overall, the bulk soil stabilized 170% more 13C-glucose than the rhizosphere (Fig. 2a), even though the rhizosphere soil formed a significantly higher concentration of stable 13C-MASOC per gram Bulk soil entry Rhizosphere entryDrip DripPulse PulseDrip DripPulse Pulse051015AbovegroundBelowground05,00010,0000 2,000 4,000 6,00013C-MBC ( /uni03BCg 13C-MBC per microcosm)Stable 13C-MASOC(/uni03BCg 13C-MASOC per microcosm) Stable 13C-MASOC(/uni03BCg 13C-MASOC per microcosm) Aboveground BelowgroundRhizosphere dripRhizosphere pulseBulk dripBulk pulseRhizosphere dripRhizosphere pulseBulk dripBulk pulsePercentage 13C-glucose stabilizedy = 1.29x + 2,152.80r2 = 0.7002,5005,0007,50010,00012,500abFig. 2 | t he formation of stable 13c-MAS oc in a whole microcosm. a, Bars represent the mean mass (error bars are s.e.m.) of stable 13C-MASOC formed in a whole microcosm for each experimental treatment (n =  6).

The positive linear relationship suggests that greater microbial anabolism of 13C-glucose led to greater formation of stable 13C-MASOC.NAture Geo ScieNce | VOL 12 | JANUARY 2019 | 46–53 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 48Articles NaTure GeoscieNceof soil (Fig. 3a). Because the same amount of 13C-glucose was inserted into the bulk and rhizosphere regions—and their soil mass differed by one order of magnitude (ratio of rhizosphere to bulk soil =  1/10)—the lower total amount of 13C-glucose stabilized in the rhizosphere suggests that the amount of 13C-glucose added per gram of soil exceeded the rhizosphere’s stabilization potential in the experimental period. Such an exceedance of the rhizosphere’s stabilization capacity is consistent with the saturating relationship that we observed between the total amount of 13C recovered in the MBC pool and the amount of 13C per gram of soil in the stable 13C-MASOC pool (Fig. 3b; r2 =  0.63).This saturating effect may be evidence for a maximal organic C loading rate onto available mineral surfaces in our soil (‘C satura -tion’) and/or a finite capacity of the active microbial community to metabolize incoming C substrate. Regardless, this observation points to one potential benefit for DOC to enter as low-concentration inputs into the bulk soil region (for example, litter leachate DOC via spring throughfall26). Namely, the more widely distributed coverage of the DOC throughout the bulk mineral soil may help to avoid a potential maximum stabilization rate encountered in the more spa-tially constrained rhizosphere soil.region of entryAlthough the rhizosphere formed less stable MASOC than the bulk soil overall, we found that ~59% of the 13C-MASOC that formed per gram of rhizosphere soil was stable compared with only ~50% in each gram of bulk soil (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4). This differ-ence in the proportion of 13C-MASOC that was stable suggests that the rhizosphere microbial community may form stable 13C-MASOC more efficiently than the bulk soil community. Specifically, we found that the amount of stable 13C-MASOC formed per unit of 13C-MBC was 83% higher in the rhizosphere than the bulk soil.

Admittedly, our design cannot uncouple C concentration effects from community effects: each gram of rhizosphere soil received 10 times more glu-cose than each gram of bulk soil and contained 1.25 times more microbial biomass. To separate these potential community versus concentration effects, we performed a follow-up assay (see ‘Substrate concentration versus microbial community effects’ below).Frequency of entryIn our microcosm soils, the greatest percentage of total 13C-MASOC per gram of soil was stable when rhizosphere inputs entered as a frequent, low-volume drip (two-way interaction, P =  0.02, 0.00.51.01.52.02.5100 200 3000120 100 200 300Active microbial biomass (/uni03BCg CO2-C h–1)0200400600800100 200 300ab02004006008000 100 200 300Rhizosphere 13C-MBC ( /uni03BCg 13C-MBC per g soil) Bulk 13C-MBC ( /uni03BCg 13C-MBC per g soil) Stable 13C-MASOC (/uni03BCg 13C per g soil) y = 2.05x + 114.27r2 = 0.74y = 0.17x + 165.13r2 = 0.15y = 0.01x – 0.22r2 = 0.77y = 0.0005x + 0.19r2 = 0.15Fig. 4 | Follow-up assay with field-isolated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities. a, Relationship between stable 13C-MASOC formation and 13C-MBC in field-isolated rhizosphere versus bulk soil communities (n =  12). b, Relationship between active microbial biomass (measured through substrate-induced respiration, which captures average microbial respiration rate in units of μ g of CO2-carbon respired per gram of soil per hour) and 13C-MBC in field-isolated rhizosphere versus bulk soil communities.

Although pulsed rhizosphere inputs stim -ulated greater microbial anabolism of 13C per gram of soil than rhi -zosphere drip inputs (Supplementary Fig. 3)—and were associated with the formation of more 13C-MASOC per gram of soil—a smaller proportion of the 13C-MASOC that formed was stable (Fig. 3a,b). Specifically, we found that the positive relationship between 13C-MBC per gram of soil and stable 13C-MASOC per gram of soil was nonlinear. At the higher end of 13C-MBC values (>  70 µ g 13C-MBC per g soil)—which represent those from pulsed rhizosphere inputs, greater microbial anabolism of 13C-glucose per gram of soil did not generate the same concomitant gains in stable 13C-MASOC per gram of soil as it did at lower 13C-MBC values. That is, the forma -tion of stable 13C-MASOC per unit of 13C-MBC was highest when belowground rhizosphere C entry occurred as a drip rather than as a pulse (Fig. 3b).Previous research reveals that frequent, low-volume inputs of glucose promote more steady assimilation and turnover of the microbial biomass, as well as lower respiration, compared with infrequent, pulsed glucose inputs28 (mechanism 3). Our results suggest a similar dynamic, whereby frequent belowground rhizo -sphere inputs may promote a more continual stream of assimilated 13C-glucose into the stable MASOC pool.Substrate concentration vs. microbial community effectsWe attempted to emulate representative concentrations of rhizo -sphere versus bulk soil DOC inputs. As such, we could not disen -tangle potential effects of C concentration (per unit soil) from the possibility that our results might also, at least in part, be a prod-uct of differential efficiencies of rhizosphere versus bulk microbial communities. We therefore conducted a follow-up assay to inves-tigate whether rhizosphere versus bulk communities might differ -entially stabilize glucose when all other conditions (for example, concentration of C inputs) were equal. For this assay, we isolated a rhizosphere and bulk microbial community from the same location where we collected our mineral soil (hereafter, ‘field-isolated com-munities’ to distinguish them from the main microcosm experi -ment reported above). We separately added each type of microbial inoculum to sterile, artificial soil microcosms (clay +  quartz sand), which contained minimal background C (removed via repeated washing with sodium hypochlorite, adjusted to 8 M)42,43. This soil treatment was used to ensure the microbial community was pri -marily consuming 13C-glucose, limiting potential substrate-identity effects arising from the use of other compounds contained in the soil organic matter.To determine the relationship between 13C-MBC and 13C-MASOC, we generated a range in the density of the field-iso -lated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities by using four different volumes of starting inoculum, each replicated in triplicate (giving n =  12 replicates per community). The two field-isolated microbial communities showed a similar range in the amount of 13C-MBC across microcosms (Fig. 4). However, we found that—in line with our results from the main study—the rhizosphere community formed ~121% more stable 13C-MASOC per unit of 13C-MBC rela -tive to the bulk community (Supplementary Table 9). Furthermore, the rhizosphere community demonstrated a strong, positive rela -tionship between 13C-MBC and stable 13C-MASOC (Fig. 4a, left panel), whereas no relationship was apparent for the bulk com -munity (Fig. 4a, right panel). We observed a similar relationship when we regressed 13C-MBC against active microbial biomass (as measured through substrate-induced respiration44), indicating that, per unit increase in 13C-MBC, the rhizosphere community showed a significantly greater increase in microbial activity relative to the bulk community (Fig. 4b). These findings suggest that future research into the importance of the rhizosphere for stable SOC formation should include a consideration that differences among microbial communities may operate as an additional mechanism driving the efficiency of aboveground versus belowground pathways.implications for the carbon cycleBy focusing on proposed mechanisms specifically involved in the DOC-microbial route to mineral stabilization, we demonstrate sev-eral features that enhance the efficiency of the belowground rhizo -sphere DOC pathway to the stable MASOC pool (Table 1). Overall, belowground entry was 190% more efficient than aboveground entry, due to direct entry into the mineral soil (mechanism 1). Entry into the rhizosphere led to 340% more stabilized C per gram of soil than entry into the bulk soil, due to the greater efficiency and activity of the rhizosphere community (mechanism 2), although the bulk soil stabilized more C overall due to the saturating rate of sta-bilization observed in the rhizosphere. Finally, in the rhizosphere, the proportion of stable MASOC formed was highest when below-ground inputs entered as a frequent drip versus an infrequent pulse (mechanism 3; regression coefficient =  − 10.8, P =  0.02 for two-way interaction, Supplementary Table 8).It is notable, however, that within the 13C budget of the whole microcosm, more total 13C was mineral-stabilized when 13C-glucose entered as an aboveground pulse into the bulk soil (for example, leaf litter leachate) than as a belowground drip into the rhizosphere (for example, root exudates), due to spatial constraints of the rhi-zosphere (Table 1). The quantitative significance of aboveground versus belowground DOC was determined by the ratio of rhizo -sphere to bulk soil (1/10) in the microcosm, as the greater total soil volume in the bulk soil promoted greater total mineral stabiliza -tion. To broadly illustrate how the rhizosphere-to-bulk ratio affects the importance of each input pathway, as well as the total amount of 13C stabilized, we used our measured bulk and rhizosphere 13C concentrations from the main experiment to generate back-of-the-envelope projections across a range of representative rhizosphere-to-bulk ratios37.

As the rhizosphere-to-bulk ratio narrows (left side of graph), there should be greater formation of stable MASOC, because a greater proportion of C inputs are contributed from efficient belowground root exudate inputs.NAture Geo ScieNce | VOL 12 | JANUARY 2019 | 46–53 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 51Articles NaTure GeoscieNcenarrows (for example, to 1/4, such as the upper mineral soil of a grassland), the ‘root exudate’ simulated pathway contributes ~20% more C to the stable SOC pool than the ‘leaf litter leachate’ sim-ulated pathway, and the total amount of C stabilized increases by ~25% relative to the measured 1/10 ratio. However, as the rhizo-sphere-to-bulk ratio widens (for example, to 1/25, such as in certain forest ecosystems), the relative importance of aboveground inputs increases, but the total amount of stable MASOC formed decreases by ~15% relative to the measured 1/10 ratio (Fig. 5 ).There have been increasing calls to better incorporate into sim-ulation models the differential stabilization of aboveground and belowground plant C inputs3,12,20,45, especially from DOC inputs sta -bilized via the microbial formation pathway21. Our study sought to identify specific mechanisms purported to underlie the efficiency of the belowground rhizosphere DOC pathway to the stable MASOC pool, independent of C quality and quantity. Our work shows the potential for multiple specific features of aboveground versus belowground C input pathways to influence formation rates of sta-ble MASOC, including potentially the composition of bulk versus rhizosphere soil microbial communities. Importantly, because our study was conducted in lab-based microcosms to precisely target the posited mechanisms, such a design simplifies key aspects of a natural soil system. A critical next step is therefore to discern the relative importance of the tested pathway features in studies that incorporate the multitude of factors that may influence the for-mation of stable MASOC in the field. For example, C compound identity, mycorrhizal status, microbial community structure, soil nutrient availability, soil depth and different temporal scales all probably shape the formation, size and persistence of the stable MASOC pool4,20,39,46–48. Such work that considers the broad array of factors that ultimately govern SOC stocks seems essential if we are to accurately understand and project terrestrial C-cycle processes under a changing environment.online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of data availability and asso -ciated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0258-6.Received: 2 April 2018; Accepted: 15 October 2018;  Published online: 19 November 2018references 1.

Mineral soil and organic horizon material were collected from a temperate, mixed hardwood forest in southern Connecticut (41° 19′  57.6″  N 72° 54′  36.9″  W), where the dominant tree species include Acer  spp., Carya  spp., Liriodendron tulipifera  and Quercus spp. Soils are Inceptisols, predominantly in the Holyoke series, classified as loamy, mesic Lithic Dystrudepts. Mineral soil was collected from the top 15 cm of the A horizon and sieved to 2 mm (clay =  13.0%, sand =  63.8%, silt =  23.2%, pH =  5.7, C =  4.1%, N =  0.2%). Organic horizon material was collected from directly below the litter layer, sieved to 4 mm, then repeatedly rinsed with de-ionized water in a 53 µ m sieve to remove any mineral content, and then air dried at room temperature. All soil material was stored at 4 °C until further use.Rectangular, acrylic soil microcosms were modelled after the design by Keiluweit et al.34, built at a height of 20 cm, a width of 25 cm and a depth of 1 cm (see Supplementary Fig. 1). An artificial root (Micro Rhizon Sampler, length =  10 cm, diameter =  2.5 mm, Soilmoisture Equipment) was placed in the centre of each microcosm, and mineral soil was then packed into the microcosm frame, surrounding the artificial root, at field bulk density (0.92 g cm−3) and to a depth of 12 cm (slightly longer than the microporous section of the root, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). Organic horizon material was packed on top of the mineral horizon at a density of 0.25 g cm−3 and to a depth of 5 cm (total soil depth of mineral +  organic soil =  17 cm). Following soil packing, microcosms were pre-incubated in the dark at 20 °C for one week, during which an inorganic nutrient solution (330 μ M KCl, 70 μ M KH2PO4 and 70 μ M MgSO4) was inserted daily into the artificial root (0.5 mL per day) via a syringe pump. Throughout the experiment, added glucose was dissolved in this same nutrient solution.The rhizosphere soil was designated as the area with a radius of 8 mm from the root (total of 21 dry g equivalent). Even though the designated rhizosphere area was slightly larger than the typical area in which it is classically defined (~2 mm), it is well within the range of the observed distances in which root exudates can diffuse from the root37, and was selected to allow for a sufficient soil sample to perform all required assays. The bulk soil was defined as the remaining mineral soil in the microcosm (total of 210 dry g equivalent). Overall, there was a mass ratio of rhizosphere to bulk soil of 1/10.Importantly, although the artificial rhizosphere received labile sugar input and nutrient solution (similar to a true rhizosphere), it did lack several key components that are common to a rhizosphere in the field (that is, the full suite of carbon compounds that exit a root, root border cells, root mucilage, mycorrhizae and other components)49. We selected this lab-based microcosm system to specifically target the DOC-microbial route to mineral stabilization, and not other forms of SOC stabilization such as aggregate formation or chemically recalcitrant particulate organic carbon, both of which are associated with shorter turnover times than mineral stabilization1. While our experimental design may have excluded mycorrhizal fungi, saprotrophic fungi and high-molecular-weight root C inputs, evidence suggests that these elements are primarily involved in these other, co-occurring forms of SOC stabilization (for example, mycorrhizal fungi and other soil fungi contribute chemically recalcitrant residues50 and play a key role in aggregate formation51,52, as do root inputs such as root hairs and root mucilage3). In contrast, the DOC-microbial route to mineral stabilization is dominantly supplied by low-molecular-weight C inputs that are anabolized by surface-associated soil microbes, and some evidence suggests that these mineral surface-associated microbes (and thus their necromass contributions to the mineral-stabilized SOC pool) are primarily bacterial1. Thus, while elements of the soil system were simplified in our lab-based design, our approach was intended to simulate dominant elements of the process of microbial formation of mineral-stabilized SOC as it would occur in a temperate forest ecosystem, permitting us to test the three proposed mechanisms of more efficient belowground formation in the absence of confounding factors.Carbon additions. To test for the interaction between the three proposed mechanisms affecting the efficiency of stabilization (see Fig. 1b for all eight treatments), each treatment involved adding a fixed quantity (81.25 mg 13C over eight weeks) of 99 atom% 13C-labelled glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) into a single location ×  frequency combination of the eight possible treatment combinations (four locations, two frequencies; n =  6 per treatment; 48 total microcosms). We set up six additional microcosms that contained only unlabelled glucose to provide natural abundance atom% values to calculate the 13C label amounts in different C pools (see below).For each of the four locations, C delivery was as follows: (1) aboveground entry into bulk soil: solution was delivered via syringe, distributed evenly along the surface of the organic horizon, with a 1 cm buffer zone on either side of the rhizosphere; (2) aboveground entry into rhizosphere: solution was injected on the surface of the organic horizon directly next to the artificial root; (3) belowground entry into bulk soil: solution was delivered via syringe with a 6 inch needle, and distributed evenly throughout all areas of the bulk soil, using a grid drawn on the glass of the microcosm (to avoid delivery into the same location twice); (4) belowground entry into rhizosphere soil: solution was delivered via syringe pump through the artificial root (allowing for sustained delivery of C into the same location). The two frequencies included a low-volume, frequent drip (0.5 mL of solution per day, three times per week; 24 total insertions =  12 mL), and a high-volume, infrequent pulse (6 mL of solution once every four weeks; 2 total insertions =  12 mL). The volume of water for the pulse event was based on precipitation during relatively high-volume rainfall pulse events in northeastern US forests53, whereas the rate for the root exudation was based on previous artificial root exudate experiments34. We confirmed that there was minimal migration of rhizosphere C input into the bulk soil, and vice versa (see below and Supplementary Table 6).To maintain similar conditions in all microcosms, unlabelled glucose was inserted into the seven location ×  frequency combinations that were not being specifically tested in an individual treatment, so that all microcosms were receiving the same amount of total glucose C in the organic horizon, rhizosphere and bulk soil. The only difference between treatments, therefore, was the location ×  frequency combination that contained the 13C-label. For treatments in which 13C-glucose was entering directly into the rhizosphere (treatments 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Fig. 1b), C addition rates averaged a daily rate of 0.5 mg 13C per week per dry g soil, representative of the intermediate range of daily C additions via root exudation38,39. For treatments in which 13C-glucose was entering directly into the bulk soil (treatments 1, 2, 7 and 8 in Fig. 1b), C addition rates averaged a daily rate of ~0.05 mg 13C per week per dry g soil, representative of the higher range of DOC flux through the organic horizon in temperate forests36. In total, we added 2.81 mg of C (13C-glucose +  12C-glucose) per dry g of mineral soil throughout the microcosm over the eight-week addition period. Following the eight-week C addition period, microcosms were left to incubate for one week to allow microbial assimilation and turnover of the final glucose additions.In addition, an adsorption assay was conducted on sterilized mineral soil to determine the extent of glucose adsorption to the mineral soil in the absence of a microbial community. Soil was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 30 min; this procedure was performed twice, with a 24 h incubation period in between54. Subsamples of sterilized soil (5 dry g equivalent) were then shaken for 24 h with 50 mL of solution55, which contained the same concentration of 13C-glucose as was added to the rhizosphere throughout the eight-week period.SOC fractionation and chemical stabilization assay. Microcosms were harvested by carefully excising the organic horizon, the bulk soil and the rhizosphere soil. A subsample of the air-dried rhizosphere and bulk soil (9 dry g equivalent) were shaken for 18 h with 30 mL of a sodium hexametaphosphate solution to disperse aggregates, and then thoroughly rinsed through a 53 µ m sieve, to separate out the particulate organic carbon fraction (>  53 µ m) and the MASOC fraction (<  53 µ m)  (ref. 44). We dried all soil fractions (including a subsample of organic horizon material) to constant mass, and ball-milled and weighed samples for elemental C and N percentages (Costech ESC 4010 Elemental Analyzer) and isotopic δ13C analysis (continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, precision ± 0.2%, Thermo Delta Plus Advantage; δ13C =  [(13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)standard ] −  1) ×  1,000‰.We then exposed a subset of the dried MASOC fraction to a chemical stabilization assay, whereby 0.5 g of MASOC was refluxed with 25 mL of 6 M HCl for 16 h at 100 °C (refs 39,40,56). After decanting the acid-hydrolysable fraction, the acid-unhydrolysable (mineral-stabilized) fraction was rinsed four times with de-ionized water, isolated by centrifugation, dried and subsequently run for elemental C percentage and isotopic δ13C. We selected this assay on the basis of the assumption that greater microbial processing of 13C-glucose would result in a lower proportion of 13C-MASOC that was acid hydrolysable. This was premised on the fact that the acid-hydrolysable fraction contains more chemically labile materials (for example, sugars, such as glucose), whereas the acid-unhydrolysable fraction contains more chemically resistant compounds40. While the chemical recalcitrance of a carbon compound does not correlate with its long-term persistence as mineral-stabilized SOC57, glucose specifically is known to show weak direct sorption with the solid mineral phase41, and is thus easily prone to leach down the soil profile via physicochemical stripping if it is not first transformed to microbial residues (many of which are more chemically resistant to acid hydrolysis than glucose alone). Thus, we assumed that a greater acid-unhydrolysable fraction of 13C-MASOC correlated with greater microbial processing of 13C-glucose and thus also a longer turnover time relative to intact 13C-glucose.The values of the stable 13C-MASOC fraction were subsequently compared with the original 13C-MASOC fraction (total 13C-MASOC). Six samples were lost during this assay due to human error, with insufficient soil left to rerun the assay (two samples in the belowground-rhizosphere-drip, one in the belowground-rhizosphere-pulse and three in the aboveground-rhizosphere-drip treatments). A standard isotope mixing model was used to determine 13C values of all C pools: Clabel-derived =  Ctotal ×  (atom% 13Cafter −  atom% 13Ccontrol)/(atom% 13Cglucose  −  atom% 13Ccontrol), where Ctotal is the total amount of C, atom% 13Cafter is the atom% value of the C pool at the end of the experiment, atom% 13Ccontrol is the atom% value of C in the unlabelled controls and atom% 13Cglucose  is the atom% value of the labelled substrate.We present our results on stable 13C-MASOC formation, total 13C-MASOC formation and all other 13C pools, both in terms of concentration (per dry g of rhizosphere or bulk soil) and in a whole-microcosm 13C budget. As our primary focus was on 13C formation, we primarily present our results graphically as µ g of 13C. However, we also present the data for percentage of 13C-glucose recovered NAture Geo ScieNce | www.nature.com/naturegeoscienceArticles NaTure GeoscieNcein each C pool within the whole microcosm (see Supplementary Table 2) as well as the percentage recovered per g of soil (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Graphically, the results are the same for µ g of 13C and ‘percentage 13C-glucose recovered’ for the whole-microcosm 13C budgets, but not for concentrations of 13C per dry g of rhizosphere and bulk soil (because a greater concentration of 13C-glucose entered the rhizosphere than the bulk soil).Microbial biomass. MBC and DOC were determined through a modified chloroform-fumigation extraction procedure7. Fumigated and unfumigated (control) soil samples were both shaken for 4 h horizontally on a shaker table with 0.5 M K2SO4. Total organic carbon of the extracts was measured on a total organic carbon analyser (Shimadzu), and the δ13C of the extracts were measured on a Thermo GasBench coupled to a Thermo Delta Plus XP isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). We calculated 13C-MBC as the difference in 13C between fumigated and unfumigated samples, which was then divided by a correction factor of 0.45 to convert extracted carbon to biomass carbon (ref. 58). Total MBC was calculated as the difference in total C between the fumigated and unfumigated samples, and divided by the same correction factor. We used the same correction factor for both the main microcosm experiment as well as the additional assay involving field-isolated rhizosphere and bulk soil communities (see below).Field-isolated rhizosphere versus bulk microbial community assay. Field-isolated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial inoculum were collected from the same site as described above. Rhizosphere soil was isolated by gently shaking tree roots from the sampling area; the soil still clinging to the roots after shaking was then carefully removed and designated as the field-isolated rhizosphere microbial community59. The bulk soil microbial community (non-rhizosphere soil) was isolated from soil that was in the same sampling area and that was not associated with living roots (and defined as the field-isolated bulk microbial community).To prepare the microbial inocula, a soil slurry was created for both the rhizosphere and bulk microbial communities by vortexing a subsample of soil with Milli-Q water (1/50 mass (g)/volume (mL) concentration)39. To generate the variable sizes of the microbial community, the amount of inoculum added to each treatment was increased by five times per level: 10 µ L, 50 µ L, 250 µ L and 1,250 µ L  of starting inoculum (values based on Kallenbach et al.39). Total replication of each microbial community was n =  12 (n =  3 for each level of starting inoculum). The soil +  inoculum was thoroughly mixed with a dissecting needle to ensure that the microbial community was equally distributed throughout the mineral soil. To mirror the different levels of microbial inoculum, and to help constrain microbial growth over the experimental period, different amounts of full-strength Hoagland solution were added at the beginning of the experiment to provide the following amounts of N: 0.01 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.25 mg and 1.25 mg (values based on Kallenbach et al.39). Gravimetric moisture was then standardized in all microcosms at 20%, so that all soils were at 65% water-holding capacity. Over the course of the three-week experiment, soils were maintained at 20 °C and 65% water-holding capacity.Five times over the course of the three-week experiment (days 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17), 99.9 atom% 13C-labelled glucose was syringe-injected into each microcosm at a rate of ~0.05 mg 13C per week per dry g soil (the same as in the bulk soil of the main microcosm experiment). A sterile dissecting needle was used to mix 13C-glucose additions thoroughly with the soil, to ensure uniform distribution of the 13C-substrate. At the conclusion of the experiment, soil was harvested, and 13C-MBC and stable 13C-MASOC were measured through the same techniques as described above. In addition, active microbial biomass was measured on all samples by using a modified substrate-induced respiration technique, whereby a subsample of soil is mixed with excess, easily degradable C substrate (autolysed yeast)60. Following the addition of C substrate, tubes were shaken on a shaker table for 1 h, incubated for 4 h at 20 °C and CO2 efflux was measured using an infrared gas analyser (Li-Cor Biosciences, Model 8100).Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical package R, version 3.3.2 (http://cran.r-project.org/). Linear regression models were fit using the factors ‘pathway of entry’ (aboveground versus belowground entry), ‘region of entry’ (rhizosphere versus bulk soil), ‘frequency of entry’ (frequent drip versus infrequent pulse) and their interaction. Non-significant interaction terms (P >  0.05) were dropped from the model. First, the models were fit for all response variables as they pertained to the C budget of the whole microcosm (for example, 13C-MASOC per microcosm; see Supplementary Table 7). Second, the models were fit for the same response variables, but as they pertained to the concentration of a C pool in a single gram of rhizosphere or bulk soil (for example, 13C-MASOC per g soil; see Supplementary Table 8). Residuals were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance. For retained factors, we considered P <  0.05 significant and P <  0.10 marginally significant61.Code availability.
