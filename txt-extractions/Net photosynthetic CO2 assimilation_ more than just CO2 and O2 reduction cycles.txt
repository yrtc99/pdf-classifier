ViewpointsNet photosynthetic CO 2assimilation: more than just CO 2and O 2reduction cyclesSummaryNet photosynthetic assimilation in C 3plants is mostly viewed as asimple balance between CO 2ﬁxation by Rubisco-catalyzed car-boxylation and CO 2production by photorespiration (and to a lowerextent, by day respiration) that can be easily manipulated during gasexchange experiments using the CO 2:O2ratio of the environment.However, it now becomes clear that it is not so simple, because thephotosynthetic response to gaseous conditions involves ‘ancillary’metabolisms, even in the short-term. That is, carbon and nitrogenutilization by pathways other than the Calvin cycle and thephotorespiratory cycle, as well as rapid signaling events, caninﬂuence the observed rate of net photosynthesis. The potentialimpact of such ancillary metabolisms is assessed as well as how itmust be taken into account to avoid misinterpretation of photo-synthetic CO2response curves or low O 2effects in C 3leaves.IntroductionPhotosynthesis of C 3plants is the net result of concurrent processesin which CO 2is ﬁxed (carboxylation) and released (photorespira-tion, day respiration). Gas exchange measurements are essential forthe characterization of leaf photosynthetic properties, includingstomatal conductance, carboxylation rate, or water use efﬁciency.The cornerstone of photosynthesis is the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), that can ﬁx eitherCO2(carboxylation) or O 2(oxygenation). Oxygenation is thestarting point of photorespiration, in which CO 2is liberated inmitochondrial glycine-to-serine conversion by the glycine decar-boxylase –serine hydroxymethyl transferase (GDC –SHMT) com-plex. Rubisco’s bi-functionality is visible in photosyntheticRubisco-limited models of net assimilation ( A) based on Michaeliskinetics as follows (Farquhar et al., 1980; Von Caemmerer &Farquhar, 1981; Von Caemmerer, 2013):A¼vc/C21/C0C/C3cc/C17/C0Rd/C18Eqn 1where vcis ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation rate,Γ*the compensation point in the absence of day respiration, cctheCO 2mole fraction at carboxylation sites, and Rdday respiration(nonphotorespiratory CO 2evolution). Here, Γ*reﬂects theintrinsic O 2:C O 2partitioning of Rubisco ﬁxation and subsequentphotorespiratory CO 2evolution. Hence, Γ*can vary slightly if thestoichiometry of photorespiratory CO 2release with respect to O 2ﬁxation changes from the theoretical value of one half (Cousinset al., 2011; Keech et al., 2012; Abadie et al., 2016a). Since Rubiscois not the sole limiting factor under a range of CO2:O2conditions,the more general expression of assimilation is given by:A¼w/C21/C0C/C3cc/C18/C19/C0Rd Eqn 2where wstands for the minimum of Rubisco carboxylation, RuBPregeneration and triose phosphates utilization. It can be seen inEqn 2 that if there are alternative sinks (that may or may not bedirectly associated with CO2ﬁxation or release), Awould beimpacted because electron or triose phosphates consumption affectw. In addition, Eqns 1 and 2 neglect the contribution of non-Rubisco carboxylation events (e.g. anaplerotic CO2ﬁxation),overlooks the contribution of processes other than (photo)respiration in CO2release, and assumes that Rdis constant. Still,they are extremely efﬁcient in modeling photosynthesis in the vastmajority of cases, because alternative CO2inﬂux or efﬂux processes(or alternative electron consumptions) are associated with rathermodest ﬂuxes. That is, measurements are often performed usingunstressed plants under conditions where photosynthesis issufﬁciently high, e.g. at ambient CO2and saturating light.However, it becomes problematic when photosynthesis is exam-ined at extreme CO2mole fractions, typically near or below thecompensation point (where Ahas low values), because usuallyminor processes can become proportionally large. It can also be ofimportance when very ﬁne measurements (such as internalconductance) are performed because even small numerical errorshave pervading consequences (Harley et al., 1992; Hanson et al.,2016). Furthermore, day respiration ( Rd) encompasses all sorts ofCO 2-producing events, from the tricarboxylic acid pathway(TCAP) to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Theassumption that Rdremains constant is currently believed to beincorrect, considering direct measurements or metabolic studiesthat all suggest Rdvaries with light intensity, CO 2and O 2(Tcherkez et al., 2017) .Despite these limitations, CO 2response curves of net photo-synthesis have been used worldwide for >30 years to computemaximal carboxylation capacity or maximal electron ﬂuxes and alsoestimate internal conductance and day respiration. As a result, theseminal paper describing mathematical relationships in gasexchange (Von Caemmerer & Farquhar, 1981) has been cited>4400 times. Recent studies have further discussed how photo-synthetic models and CO2response curves might be exploited520 New Phytologist (2019) 223: 520–529 /C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comForumusing Eqn 2 to infer information on photorespiratory nitrogenmetabolism (Busch et al., 2018) (as has been done before forphosphate utilization (Harley & Sharkey, 1991)), or suggestedalternative mechanisms for CO2efﬂux (Cousins et al., 2011;Bloom & Lancaster, 2018). More generally, as we get moreprecision in photosynthetic measurements (including onlineisotopic analyses), it is tempting to infer as many parameters aspossible (e.g. internal conductance).However, to interpret photosynthetic response curves appropri-ately, metabolic imperatives of nonphotosynthetic and nonpho-torespiratory pathways (that is, metabolisms other than simplyphotosynthesis and photorespiration) which both depend on CO2(or O 2) mole fraction in the short-term and inﬂuence leaf net CO 2exchange, have to be taken into account. In fact, even though theirassociated ﬂuxes are generally small, there might be particularsituations where they have a signiﬁcant impact on the photosyn-thesis rate and/or parameters derived therefrom.In this Viewpoint, we intend to examine such nonphotosyn-thetic and nonphotorespiratory metabolic processes and theirdependence on CO2(or O 2), using recent results that haveprovided molecular or metabolic insights on short-term response toCO 2and O 2, with associated experimental ﬂux measurements inC3plants (summarized in Fig. 1). Here, we will not discussphotochemistry (and associated redox control) or day respirationthemselves, which have been shown to be inﬂuenced by CO2:O2asexplained elsewhere (Heber et al., 1992; Laisk et al., 1997;Tcherkez et al., 2017). As will become apparent later, quantitativedata on metabolic ﬂuxes associated with nonphotorespiratory andnonphotosynthetic processes in illuminated leaves are relativelyscarce and the present article should be viewed as a call for moreresearch in this area.Alternative carboxylation activityIn C 3plants, Rubisco is the CO 2-ﬁxing enzyme of photosynthesis(as reﬂected in photosynthetic models, see earlier). However, thereare other carbon-ﬁxing enzymes, in different metabolic pathways:phospho enolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), carbamoyl phosphatesynthase (CPS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, etc. Amongst these, PEPCis certainly the most signiﬁcant considering both its proteinabundance and carbon ﬂux (Chollet et al., 1996). However, it hasbeen recently suggested that the reverse reaction catalyzed bychloroplastic NADP-dependent malic enzyme (CO2+pyru-vate+NADPH ?malate +NADP) is of importance (Bloom &Lancaster, 2018). This is extremely unlikely, considering the veryhigh Km(Michaelis constant) of the enzyme (in mM) compared tothe very low concentration of stromal pyruvate (in lM) (Wheeleret al., 2008; Krueger et al., 2011), the unfavorable NADPH :NADP ratio in the light ( /C251 in the steady-state) (Takahama et al.,1981), and the low carbon-13 (13C) enrichment in C-atomposition of malate other than C-1 and C-4 during13CO 2labeling(Tcherkez et al., 2009). In fact, if the chloroplastic malic enzymesynthesized malate, it would consume chloroplastic pyruvate.Therefore, malate molecules would inherit the13C-pattern ofchloroplastic pyruvate in C-1 to C-3 atom positions, while it wouldinherit the13C signature of dissolved CO 2in C-4. Sincechloroplastic pyruvate is highly13C-labeled (Abadie et al., 2018),there would be little difference in the positional %13C betweenOBSERVED CO2ASSIMILATION RATELow O2Ethylene-involving hypoxicresponsePihomeostasis,cETC proteinphosphoryla/g415on and turn-overIncreased mPDHand GDC ac/g415vity,inhibi/g415on of TCAPLow CO2or high O2Increased photorespira/g415onIncrease in metabolic CO2eﬄux ?Inhibi/g415on of linear electronﬂuxStress signalling (ethylene)Oxyda/g415ve stressPhotorespiratory intermediatesaccumula/g415onExtra electron u/g415lisa/g415on (and inhibi/g415on RuBPregenera/g415on?)*Increased RdIncrease in metabolic CO2eﬄux ?Increase in respiratory CO2eﬄuxInhibi/g415on of linear electronﬂuxDiverse poten/g415almechanisms(see text)Varying CO2Increased PEPC-MDH ac/g415vityPEP and electronconsump/g415onExtra electron u/g415lisa/g415on (and inhibi/g415on RuBPregenera/g415on?)*Increase in metabolic CO2eﬄux ?Increase in apparent CO2 inﬂuxRegula/g415on of protein, secondarymetabolite and lipid synthesisExtra electron u/g415lisa/g415on (and inhibi/g415on RuBPregenera/g415on?)***Fig. 1 Summary of metabolic pathways affected by CO 2:O2in the short-term and possibly affecting observed CO 2assimilation rate. For simplicity, effects onphotosynthesis are shown as falling into two categories: effect on chloroplastic electron transfer chain and/or ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration(red) and on CO 2production or consumption (blue). See the text for more details on numerical ﬂux values.

Experimentalevidence is to the contrary (Abadie & Tcherkez, 2019).PEPC ﬁxes bicarbonate onto phospho enolpyruvate and formsoxaloacetate in the cytosol, which can be then reduced to malate(by malate dehydrogenases, MDHs) in various cellular compart-ments. Isotopic labeling has demonstrated that this sequence oftwo reactions does occur in the illuminated leaf (Tcherkez et al.,2009; Abadie et al., 2017b). PEPC-derived oxaloacetate is alsoessential to sustain aspartate production, as demonstrated by bothintramolecular natural13C abundance in leaf aspartate (Melzer &O’Leary, 1987) and isotopic labeling (Abadie et al., 2017b).Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that PEPC activity is of littleimportance for steady-state C 3photosynthesis (Von Caemmerer,2013) and it is commonly not included in photosynthetic modelswhile it is recognized to contribute to lowering the observed12C/13C isotope fractionation during photosynthesis (Raven &Farquhar, 1990).PEPC-MDH activity is extremely relevant for photosynthesismeasurement since it leads to CO 2ﬁxation (via the rapidequilibrium between CO 2and bicarbonate) thus potentially, canincrease apparent photosynthesis rates. It also consumes twoelectrons per CO 2to reduce oxaloacetate to malate, therebyimpacting slightly the quantum yield of photosynthesis. Inaddition, PEPC-MDH activity is directly linked to (1) photores-piration via the utilization of reductive power generated by theGDC –SHMT complex and (2) TCAP replenishment to sustainglutamate and glutamine metabolism which is stimulated byphotorespiration. In fact, mutants affected in MDH show analteration in photorespiratory metabolism (Cousins et al., 2008;Tomaz et al., 2010) and mutants affected in glutamine-2-oxoglutarate amino transferase do exhibit an increase in PEPCactivity that correlates to leaf glutamine content (Ferrario-Meryet al., 2002). Quite critically, PEPC activity does vary with CO2and O 2mole fraction. First, the enzyme appears to be slightly lessphosphorylated at high CO 2:O 2ratio, suggesting a decline inactivity. Second, phopho enolpyruvate provision by pyruvate Pidikinase (PPDK) varies, due to a signiﬁcant loss in PPDKphosphorylation and increase in activity at low CO 2(Abadieet al., 2016b). Third, direct in vivo PEPC-MDH activity measure-ments by NMR have shown that while being rather small at highphotosynthesis (0.3 lmol m/C02s/C01), PEPC activity increases to1lmol m/C02s/C01or more at low CO 2(140lmol mol/C01) or highoxygen (100% O 2), representing up to 40% of observed netassimilation under high O 2mole fraction (Abadie & Tcherkez,2019). Taken as a whole, anaplerotic CO 2ﬁxation is not anegligible actor in CO 2response curves, and rather counterintu-itively, it decreases as CO 2increases.Electron and carbon utilization by anabolismIt is well-known that nitrogen (or sulfur) assimilation, amino acidand protein synthesis, lipid production and secondary metabolismrepresent signiﬁcant carbon and electron sinks, thereby potentiallyinhibiting sucrose synthesis or RuBP regeneration and thus CO2assimilation. The extra electron consumption causes an ‘offset’between total electron ﬂux (for example measured by ﬂuorescenceor O 2evolution), and electron consumption for CO 2(and O 2)ﬁxation only. Experimentally, it could be desirable to ensure thatsuch an offset is ‘real’ by comparing ﬂuorescence-derived electrontransport rate (ETR) and maximal electron transport computedfrom photosynthetic response curves ( A/cccurves). We note,however, that such a comparison can be complicated by (1)variations in the coefﬁcient used to convert the yield of PSIIphotochemistry ( ΦPSII) to ETR due to changes in, e.g. pseudo-cyclic electron ﬂux, and (2) the fact that alternative ﬂuxes arerelatively small and possibly within the experimental error of ETRestimates. Regardless of these technical issues, several studies havetaken advantage of the offset to estimate the electron ﬂux to nitrate(nitrite) reduction using the assimilatory quotient (Rachmilevitchet al., 2004; Bloom et al., 2010; Eichelmann et al., 2011). Theyhave suggested that nitrogen assimilation is promoted underphotorespiratory conditions (this conclusion being also supportedby other measurements such as enzyme activities, and naturalnitrogen-15 (15N) abundance) (Rachmilevitch et al., 2004; Bloomet al., 2010). However, the other earlier-cited electron-consumingbiosynthetic processes should not be overlooked. In fact, inArabidopsis, cytosolic protein synthesis has been shown to dependon photosynthesis, with much higher polysome abundance at light(compared to dark) (Piques et al., 2009) and a positive effect ofCO2mole fraction on the phosphorylation of the ribosomalprotein RPS6 and the translation initiation factor eIF4B, and anegative effect on the translation initiation inhibitor eIF4A(Boex-Fontvieille et al., 2013). Accordingly, isotopic labeling ofpeach leaves with14CO 2along a A/CO 2curve has shown that proteinsynthesis increases proportionally with photosynthesis (at about 1%of photosynthesis) as CO 2mole fraction increases (Escobar-Guti /C19errez& Gaudill /C18ere, 1997). These results clearly indicate that proteinproduction is not constant and when expressed in absolute units(lmol m/C02s/C01), increases with photosynthesis.Chloroplastic fatty acid synthesis also strictly occurs in the light,and requires NADPH as well as acetyl-CoA formed from pyruvateby chloroplastic pyruvate dehydrogenase (pPDH) (Bao et al.,2000). Contrary to its mitochondrial counterpart (mPDH),pPDH is not down-regulated by phosphorylation in the light,allowing efﬁcient conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in thechloroplast (Tovar-M /C19endez et al., 2003). It is generally believedthat acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which represents the committed stepof fatty acid synthesis, is activated by redox power to matchNADPH availability in the chloroplast (Rawsthorne, 2002). Thatsaid, increasing CO2mole fraction has little effect on the ﬂux tofatty acid synthesis (Williams & Harwood, 1997) and in fact,14C-labelling has suggested that lipids represent about 1% of net ﬁxedcarbon regardless of CO2mole fraction (Escobar-Guti /C19errez &Gaudill /C18ere, 1997). Fatty acid synthesis with13C-labeling has alsoshown that the ﬂux represents about 0.1 lmol carbon m/C02s/C01inArabidopsis in a slightly CO 2-enriched atmosphere ( /C25450lmol mol/C01CO 2), i.e./C251% of photosynthesis (Bao et al.,2000). However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements of lipidand protein synthesis should be noted, and the way the associatedﬂux in electron, carbon or nitrogen equivalents varies withphotosynthetic conditions is not so well-known. In addition, thereis currently little quantitative knowledge on reserve remobilizationNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 520–529 /C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comViewpoints ForumNewPhytologist 522 14698137, 2019, 2, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15828 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

At the leaf level, the synthesis ofisoprenoids has been shown to be generally <0.1lmol m/C02s/C01and to depend on CO 2and O 2mole fraction (Rasulov et al., 2009).In general, isoprene emission decreases at high CO 2or low O 2andthis has been related to pools of intermediates and phosphate,reductant supply as well as phospho enolpyruvate utilization(Monson & Fall, 1989; Loreto & Schnitzler, 2010; Rasulovet al., 2016). Interestingly, isoprene emission has also been shownto be modulated by nitrogen nutrition, with lower values at highnitrogen due to the competition for electrons and phos-phoenolpyruvate (Rosenstiel et al., 2004). The carbon ﬂux tophenylpropanoids has been suggested to be large because they canultimately represent up to 30% of plant biomass (Maeda &Dudareva, 2012). But at the leaf level, chlorogenate synthesis hasbeen measured precisely and found to be small ( <1% ofphotosynthesis) in sunﬂower and remarkably, has a bell-shapedpattern (i.e. decreased at low photosynthesis, and in 0.03% O2,maximal under ‘standard’ CO 2:O2conditions) (Abadie et al.,2018). Such compounds are of interest because their synthesis startsin the chloroplast and requires NADPH, phospho enolpyruvate anderythrose-4-phosphate. The latter is directly abstracted from theCalvin cycle and therefore depends on RuBP regenerationmetabolism.Photosynthesis and stress signalingChanging the CO 2:O2environment, in particular low CO 2orhigh O 2, represents stressful conditions for photosynthesizingleaves. There is now substantial evidence that photorespiration is asource of reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as peroxisomal H2O2)that have to be detoxiﬁed (Noctor & Foyer, 1998; Foyer & Noctor,2005) and trigger a rapid gene expression response (Eisenhut et al.,2017). In addition, stress-related signaling events involvingethylene are believed to be of considerable importance.Ethylene has long been known for its potential (and controver-sial) stimulation of stomatal closure, with considerable species-speciﬁc variations (Kays & Pallas, 1980; Pallas & Kays, 1982;Tanaka et al., 2005; Iqbal et al., 2011). Conversely, ethylene canantagonize abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure underwater deﬁcit (Tanaka et al., 2005), and in the long-term, mightstimulate plant growth (Pierik et al., 2006). Ethylene stimulatesantioxidants (ﬂavonols) synthesis in guard cells and thus counter-acts ROS accumulation thereby down-regulating the ABA responsein Arabidopsis (Watkins et al., 2014) and tomato (Watkins et al.,2017). In fact, this effect was not observed in Arabidopsis ethylene-overproducing1 (ein1) and tomato Neverripe (Nr) mutants affectedin ethylene signal transduction (Watkins et al., 2014, 2017);accordingly, mutants affected in ﬂavonol synthesis have a higherROS content in guard cells and are more sensitive to ABA.Unlike stomatal aperture, the photosynthetic machinery isnegatively impacted by ethylene. Using photosynthetic CO2response curve after a brief pre-exposure to ethylene, a decline inmaximal chloroplastic electron transport rate has been found(Taylor & Gunderson, 1986; Wullschleger et al., 1992). Otherstudies have further shown a decrease in Rubisco activity itself(Tholen et al., 2008) or carbon export from leaves (Woodrow et al.,1988). Phosphoproteomics analyses have shown that whenCO2:O2conditions vary, there are rapid changes in a number ofsignaling pathways (Abadie et al., 2016b) and amongst them,ethylene response is the most represented. This includes ACCsynthase and the central transducer EIN2, with a close correlationwith the CO2:O2ratio, suggesting that both ethylene synthesis andperception are enhanced at low photosynthesis (SupportingInformation Table S1). Although the speciﬁc effect of gaseousconditions on ethylene synthesis is less documented than in fruits(where it is well-known that CO2inhibits ethylene synthesis),available evidence indicates that in leaves, minimal carbonassimilation is required for carbon provision to ethylene synthesis(Grodzinski et al., 1982; Guy & Kende, 1984) but increased CO2mole fraction (but not super-high CO 2) inhibits ethylene synthesis(Guo et al., 2014). ROS-generating conditions (high photorespi-ration, low CO 2:O 2ratio) interact with ethylene signaling, assuggested by (1) the increased expression at low CO 2of 2-cysteineperoxiredoxin A (2CP A) within a few hours and (2) the fact that2CP B contains a strong ethylene response element in its promoter(Heiber et al., 2007). In addition, in Chlamydomonas the retrogradeROS-signaling protein TER23 (ethylene-dependent EGY1 inArabidopsis) participates in the fast phosphorylation response andthus on cyclic vs linear electron ﬂux in the chloroplast understressful conditions (Sch €onberg et al., 2017). Accordingly, innonsenescing leaves, ethylene has been shown to cause changes inantioxidant contents (Hodges & Forney, 2000) and a considerableincrease in biosynthesis of phenolic compounds (Tom /C19as-Barber /C19anet al., 1997; Liu et al., 2016), thereby consuming sugar phosphatesand reductive power in the chloroplast. Ethylene also perturbspolyamine synthesis and S-adenosylmethionine metabolism (Azizet al., 1997) and a beneﬁcial effect on nitrogen and sulfurassimilation has been proposed (Iqbal et al., 2012). Taken as awhole, ethylene-mediated stress signaling under unfavorablephotosynthetic gaseous conditions (low CO2:O2) has direct orindirect effects on photosynthetic electron transfer chain and thisshould in principle alter the quantum yield of photosynthesis in theshort-term.Speciﬁc effects of low oxygenIt is common practice to use low O 2mole fraction (typically 2% O 2or less) in gas exchange experiments to eliminate oxygenation andthus infer the contribution of photorespiration to net CO 2exchange. However, in addition to variable consequences onstomatal conductance, low O 2is associated with strong metaboliceffects that may change carboxylation activity.First, low O 2causes a well-known alteration of (sugar) phosphatehomeostasis in the chloroplast (and thus ATP generation) that canlead to a decrease in photochemical quenching and photosynthesisrate (Sharkey & Vassey, 1989). In addition, hypoxia has beendemonstrated to reconﬁgure the STN7-dependent phosphoryla-tion of proteins of the chloroplastic electron transfer chain (Bergneret al., 2015; Shapiguzov et al., 2016), typically LHC proteins that/C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 520–529www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Viewpoints Forum 523 14698137, 2019, 2, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15828 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseare responsible for the photosynthetic state shift (state I/state II).This directly impacts on the balance between the cyclic electron ﬂuxaround photosystem I and the linear electron ﬂux in the short term,and thus the quantum yield of photosynthesis.Second, despite the production of oxygen by photosynthesis, thelow-O2atmosphere triggers a hypoxic response even in the short-term (here, ‘short-term’ means a time frame of 1 to 2 h, that is, thetypical time required to carry out a photosynthetic response curve).From a metabolic perspective, hypoxia is associated with areorganization of glycolysis, TCAP and nitrogen assimilation,with considerable accumulation of biomarkers metabolites such asthe nitrogenous compounds alanine, b-alanine, glutamate or c-aminobutyrate (Limami et al., 2014). Such changes are associatedwith an increase in nitrogen demand (and thus nitrate assimilationusing electrons of the chloroplastic electron chain) as shown by thedecrease in phosphorylation of nitrate reductase under hypoxia(Lothier et al., 2018). Hypoxia is also associated with nitric oxideproduction from nitrite produced by nitrate reductase (for a review,see Planchet et al., 2017). Also, there is a potential change in CO2evolution: a substantial decrease in mPDH phosphorylation(Lothier et al., 2018) and thus an increase in pyruvate decarboxy-lation activity, alanine synthesis (that abstracts pyruvate fromcatabolism) and c-aminobutyrate synthesis by glutamate decar-boxylation (Abadie et al., 2017a). It has been suggested that under0.03% O2, the extra nitrogen demand represents about0.2lmol m/C02s/C01, i.e. about 2 lmol electrons m/C02s/C01(Abadieet al., 2018). However, the overall effect of hypoxia on dayrespiratory CO 2efﬂux is not very well-known (for a speciﬁcdiscussion, see Tcherkez et al., 2012).Hypoxia may also lead to changes in the expression of genesencoding proteins that play key roles in photosynthesis (summa-rized in Table S2). A comparison of the translatome of varioustissues of Arabidopsis photosynthetic tissues subjected to oxygen(and CO2) deprivation showed that there is a rapid (within 2 h)change in the translation of mRNAs encoding photosystem IIproteins CP22 (involved in nonphotochemical quenching) andOHP2 (involved in PSII assembly) as well as Rubisco chaperonins,suggesting an increase in turn-over of the photosynthetic machin-ery (Mustroph et al., 2009). In the longer term, it is believed there isan increase in the expression of genes encoding chlorophyll bindingproteins (LHCBs), as suggested by the comparison of transcrip-tome proﬁles under normoxia or hypoxia (for 2 h), in wild-type andmutants affected in the N-end-rule pathway and exhibiting aconstitutive response to hypoxia (including the typical group VIIethylene response factors) (Gibbs et al., 2011).Taken as a whole, hypoxia directly affects photosynthesis viarapid changes in metabolism and synthesis of the photosyntheticmachinery. Consequently, gas exchange experiments carried out atlow oxygen are not simply representative of photorespiration-freeconditions.The problem of photorespiration and nitrogen demandPhotorespiration does not only exist in a metabolic cycle wherebyO2ﬁxation (oxygenation) leads to glycine synthesis, subsequentCO 2release and recycling of serine to 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA).In fact, photorespiration has been shown to involve alternativepathways (such as formate oxidation) (Peterhansel et al., 2012;Obata et al., 2016), and at high oxygenation rates, to be associatedwith glycine and serine accumulation (Abadie et al., 2016a). Also,metabolic comparisons using gas chromatography-mass spectrom-etry (GC-MS) proﬁles (Carroll et al., 2015) has shown that highphotorespiration leads to a metabolic phenotype similar to somephotorespiratory mutants (Abadie et al., 2016a). It is worth notingthat despite the amino acid build-up, photorespiration per se doesnot represent a nitrogen assimilation pathway since it strictlydepends on the glutamine synthetase/glutamine-2-oxoglutarateamino transferase cycle (Wingler et al., 2000). Photorespiratoryrecycling (or lack thereof) of glycerate, glycine and serine has beencontroversial for a long time (Harley & Sharkey, 1991; Dirks et al.,2012; Tcherkez, 2013; Busch et al., 2018). The abstraction ofserine and glycine molecules from the photorespiratory cycle mightbe detrimental for photosynthesis because it leads to an extra-demand in electrons (for nirogen assimilation in glyoxylateamination to glycine) and PGA, potentially impeding RuBPregeneration. Using a modeling exercise that neglects (changes in)internal conductance ( gm), glycine and serine build-up has beensuggested to be of considerable importance, with about 30% ofserine not recycled to PGA, thus shaping the CO2response curve ofphotosynthesis (Busch et al., 2018) due to serine accumulation rateof up to 0.9 lmol m/C02s/C01and nitrogen assimilation rates up to1.2lmol m/C02s/C01. The nonquantitativity of glycine-to-serineconversion has been demonstrated experimentally (Abadie et al.,2016a), but metabolite accumulation represents only a few percentof oxygenation rate. In effect, using both metabolite kinetics andisotopomer distribution, it has been shown that glycine and serineaccumulation rates taken together never exceed 0.09 lmol m/C02s/C01regardless of the CO 2:O2ratio in sunﬂower, and often represent<0.05lmol m/C02s/C01(Abadie et al., 2016a, 2018). Therefore,glycine and serine nonrecycling increase the diversion of electronsto assimilate nitrogen, and maybe contribute to shaping CO2assimilation curves, but the impact is numerically very small.Furthermore, leaf nitrogen assimilation (from nitrate) is unlikelyto be as high as 1 lmol m/C02s/C01as suggested by modeling (Buschet al., 2018). It should be recognized that measuring instantaneousleaf nitrogen assimilation is, perhaps surprisingly, more compli-cated than one would think. The assimilatory quotient method,which leads to high values, can be compromised by alternativeelectron utilization (e.g. sulfur assimilation, PEPC-MDH activity,anabolism), as outlined earlier. Elemental analysis of plant organicmatter generally shows that nitrogen represents 2 –5% of totalorganic matter (while carbon is about 40%), and therefore suggeststhat the nitrogen assimilation ﬂux falls within 1/20thand 1/8thofnet CO 2assimilation. However, such an estimate is ﬂawed simplybecause (1) roots can assimilate nitrogen in many species, (2) leaf-assimilated nitrogen is redistributed to other organs (and a smallamount is lost as gaseous NH3), and (3) a considerable amount ofcarbon is lost by respiration. Using isotopic labeling (e.g. using15N) is also challenging because of the isotopic dilution byendogenous nitrates, the utilization of ‘new’ nitrogen atoms tosynthesize less easily extractible compounds (like proteins) andnitrogen redistribution to other organs.

In fact,with13C labeling, the ﬂux to de novo glutamate synthesis has beenfound to be <0.01lmol glutamate m/C02s/C01regardless of CO 2:O2, meaning a total ≤0.1lmol m/C02s/C01, accounting for carbonremobilization for total glutamate synthesis (Abadie et al., 2017b,2018). Using15N-labeling, total glutamate synthesis accountingfor15N isotopic dilution has also been found to be about0.1lmol m/C02s/C01(Gauthier et al., 2010). In these experiments,this value of 0.1 lmol m/C02s/C01was probably representative becauseshort-term labeling was used so it is unlikely a very high proportionof the label was allocated to proteins or nucleotides and glutamatewas the major product of nitrogen assimilation. Still, if we assumethat proteins represent about 1% of net assimilated carbon, thiswould mean an extra nitrogen demand of about0.07lmol m/C02s/C01(assuming net photosynthesis at20lmol m/C02s/C01). A recent estimation of ﬂuxes in Arabidopsisleaves based on mass-balance (ﬂux balance analysis, FBA) has alsoshown that in mature leaves, nitrogen assimilation from nitraterepresents about 0.2% of gross photosynthesis (Shaw & Cheung,2018), that is, about 0.04 lmol m/C02s/C01. Taken as a whole,instantaneous leaf nitrogen assimilation is an important actor ofphotosynthetic leaf metabolism but absolute ﬂux-values areimportant to keep in mind. Nitrogen assimilation is equal to, or<0.2lmol m/C02s/C01in most cases, meaning an electron consump-tion of about 2 lmol m/C02s/C01. This value probably changes tohigher values when particular circumstances increase the nitrogendemand considerably despite low photorespiration, such ashypoxia (see above). Also, it would be interesting to disentanglethe metabolism associated with nitrogen assimilation in geneticallymodiﬁed plants where photorespiration has been bypassed andplant biomass increases (Kebeish et al., 2007; South et al., 2019).Under what conditions are these metabolic pathwaysof particular importance?We have discussed the potential importance of metabolisms otherthan photosynthesis and photorespiration (‘ancillary’ metabolismsuch as PEPC ﬁxation, nitrogen assimilation, etc.) when CO 2andO2conditions vary and thus can have an impact on observed netCO 2assimilation. It is presently difﬁcult to provide preciseguidelines to account for such ‘ancillary’ metabolisms in observedCO2exchange rate, simply because the numerical values of ﬂuxesare not known with sufﬁcient certainty. That said, considering theirrather low ﬂux values, the impact is numerically small understandard conditions (400 lmol mol/C01CO 2, 21% O 2) or moregenerally, when photosynthesis (and electron utilization to CO 2ﬁxation itself) is sufﬁciently high (Table 1). In other words, theirpotential effect is more likely visible when photosynthesis is low, atlow CO2or high O 2because their relative impact on the CO 2ﬂuxmight be large. For example, when low CO 2conditions are used tocarry out Laisk curves so as to determine the compensation point inthe absence of day respiration ( Γ*) and day respiration ( Rd), thechange in assimilation caused by PEPC ﬁxation (which itself varieswith CO 2mole fraction) could cause an error in estimated Γ*(Abadie & Tcherkez, 2019).The alternative utilization of electrons in the chloroplast (fornitrogen and sulfur assimilation, malate synthesis, or secondarymetabolism) is also relatively small, but can have subtle consequenceson photosynthetic parameters. Typically, most calculations ofinternal conductance based on ﬂuorescence assume that total electronﬂux ( Jt) is partitioned between oxygenation ( Jo) and carboxylation ( Jc)and thus Jt=Jo+Jc. If the alternative consumption of electrons is notnegligible, the relationship becomes Jt/C0Ja=Jo+Jcwhere Jais theconsumption of electrons to alternative pathways. For instance, basedon the total computed in Table 1, when Jt(ETR) is larger than50lmol m/C02s/C01, potential errors in partitioning and conductancecalculations must be small. By contrast, under ambient oxygen(21%), when net CO 2assimilation is <8lmol m/C02s/C01and thus Jtlikely <50lmol m/C02s/C01, potential errors are large. In particular,internal conductance calculations are quite sensitive to potentialerrors in electron ﬂux, and thus can be affected by Ja. In fact, an errorof 1lmol m/C02s/C01in electron ﬂux (that is, of about 1%) can lead toan offset of at least 0.01 mol m/C02s/C01in internal conductance (for adetailed sensitivity analysis, see Harley et al.,1 9 9 2 ) .U n f o r t u n a t e l y ,a sit is apparent in this Viewpoint, the way Javaries with O 2and CO 2isnot known with precision. We also note that day respiration (notdiscussed here) can also impact on internal conductance (furtherdiscussed in Harley et al.,1 9 9 2a n dT c h e r k e z et al., 2017).Conclusions and perspectivesIn these perspectives, we have emphasized the need to have amore integrative view of leaf metabolism, which goes beyondCO2and O 2reduction cycles themselves. That is, even in theshort-term, leaf metabolism reacts not only via the CO 2:O 2partitioning of Rubisco kinetics and activation, but also throughother pathways that may have direct or indirect effects onobserved CO2assimilation rate, summarized in Fig. 1. Unfor-tunately, quantitative data on these aspects are scarce andinstantaneous metabolic ﬂux analysis when CO2and O 2conditions vary is insufﬁciently documented. It must berecognized that it is technically difﬁcult and expensive to carryout detectable isotopic labeling in metabolites, or to apply omicstechniques when gaseous conditions change rapidly and arecoupled to precise photosynthesis (and transpiration) measure-ments. That said, recent studies (cited here) have providedexperimental estimates of ﬂuxes in some pathways and newmetabolomics and ﬂuxomics technologies now offer outstandingcapabilities to use ﬂuxomics and thus get more precision in ﬂuxdetermination, remobilization and nonquantitativity of photo-synthetic and photorespiratory reactions.Also, most available data were obtained in common C3plants(such as Arabidopsis), and more data are required in C 3and C 4crops as well as C 3species that exhibit particular nitrogenmetabolism (i.e. that can affect relationships between photosyn-thesis and photorespiration) such as legumes. A better knowledge ofconcurrent, nonphotosynthetic metabolisms affected by gaseousconditions would be instrumental to deﬁne important regulationsand possibly, improve models of CO2capture by leaves inparticular (1) when net assimilation is low and thus the impact ofnonphotosynthetic metabolism may be proportionally large, and/C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 520–529www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Viewpoints Forum 525 14698137, 2019, 2, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15828 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].
