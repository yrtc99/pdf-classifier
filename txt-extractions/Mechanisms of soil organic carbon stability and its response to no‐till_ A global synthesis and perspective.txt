Carbon (C) contained in soils to 1 m depth is about three times as much as in the atmosphere. Thus, even a small pro -portion of soil organic C (SOC) could induce quantitatively relevant variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and generate positive feedbacks to climate change (Lal, 2004a). Furthermore, SOC plays a key role in determining soil health and agricultural productivity Received: 30 August 2021  | Revised: 6 October 2021  | Accepted: 28 October 2021DOI: 10.1111/gcb.15968  RESEARCH REVIEWMechanisms of soil organic carbon stability and its response to no- till: A global synthesis and perspectiveZheng-  Rong Kan1 |   Wen-  Xuan Liu1 |   Wen-  Sheng Liu1 |   Rattan Lal2 |    Yash Pal Dang3 |   Xin Zhao1 |   Hai-  Lin Zhang11College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Farming System, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, China2CFAES Rattan Lal Center for Carbon Management and Sequestration, School of Environment and Natural Resources, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA3School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, AustraliaCorrespondenceXin Zhao, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Farming System, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing 100193, China.Email: zhaox@cau.edu.cnFunding informationNational Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 32071977AbstractMechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization have been widely studied due to their relevance in the global carbon cycle. No-  till (NT) has been frequently adopted to sequester SOC; however, limited information is available regarding whether se -questered SOC will be stabilized for long term. Thus, we reviewed the mechanisms affecting SOC stability in NT systems, including the priming effects (PE), molecular structure of SOC, aggregate protection, association with soil minerals, microbial prop -erties, and environmental effects. Although a more steady-  state molecular structure of SOC is observed in NT compared with conventional tillage (CT), SOC stability may depend more on physical and chemical protection. On average, NT improves macro- aggregation by 32.7%, and lowers SOC mineralization in macro-  aggregates compared with CT. Chemical protection is also important due to the direct adsorption of organic molecules and the enhancement of aggregation by soil minerals. Higher microbial ac -tivity in NT could also produce binding agents to promote aggregation and the forma -tion of metal-  oxidant organic complexes. Thus, microbial residues could be stabilized in soils over the long term through their attachment to mineral surfaces and entrap -ment of aggregates under NT. On average, NT reduces SOC mineralization by 18.8% and PE intensities after fresh carbon inputs by 21.0% compared with CT ( p < .05). Although higher temperature sensitivity ( Q10) is observed in NT due to greater Q10 in macro-  aggregates, an increase of soil moisture regime in NT could potentially con -strain the improvement of Q10. This review improves process- based understanding of the physical and chemical mechanism of protection that can act, independently or interactively, to enhance SOC preservation. It is concluded that SOC sequestered in NT systems is likely to be stabilized over the long term.KEYWORDSmicrobial activity, physicochemical protection, priming effects, soil organic matter, soil structure, tillage practices694  |   KAN et Al.(Lehmann & Kleber, 2015). Therefore, improving SOC sequestration is an important goal for both scientists and policymakers.In agro-  ecosystem, SOC is sensitive to changes in climate and management practices (e.g., tillage, irrigation, and fertilizer), and thus it is not stable but has high temporal and spatial variabilities (Qi et al., 2019; Xue et al., 2018). For example, higher temporal variation was observed in conventional tillage (CT), with 12.1%–  35.3% lower SOC content compared with that under no-  till (NT) (Qi et al., 2019). Fertilizer application changed the contributions of wheat and maize to SOC, and caused a spatial variability in wheat–  maize cropping sys -tems (Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015). Nitrogen fertilizer alone could be sufficient to allow maintenance but not build-  up of SOC compared with unfertilized soil because mineral fertilizer application increased SOC mineralization rate in aggregates (Collier et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2012). Thus, understanding the processes of SOC stability is crucial to enhancing SOC sequestration.In the initial stages, more C inputs improve SOC levels during the rapid accumulation stage from time (T0) to time (T1) (Figure 1). However, no positive linear relationship exists between SOC gained and additional C inputs over time as the soil will eventually become saturated and unable to hold any further SOC (Berhane et al., 2020). This is responsible for the slow fluctuation in SOC content from time (T1) to time (T4). During the slow fluctuation phase, a recycling pro-cess is observed from time (T1) to time (T2), time (T2) to time (T3), time (T3) to time (T4), etc. This trend indicates that SOC saturation is associated with SOC stability, and leads to the prediction that SOC level in the future will be maintained around the saturation point in the topsoil and subsoil layers (Six et al., 2002; Stewart et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2015). In general, the saturation point in paddy soils is higher than that in upland soils due to the lower decomposition under waterlogged condition, and thus the greater capacity for SOC seques-tration in paddy soils (Wei et al., 2021). However, the saturation point is also affected by management practices and climate (Qi et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2007), which causes temporal and spatial fluctuation in SOC stocks. Temporal and spatial fluctuation can cause temporary net SOC loss, which must subsequently be recovered by more C inputs (Qi et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Thus, maintaining the stability (stabiliza-tion) of SOC, as important as achieving high SOC, is critical to sustain -ing the agricultural and environmental benefits of SOC sequestration (Qi et al., 2019). This issue is receiving increasing research attention (Angst et al., 2019; Bai et al., 2020; Mu et al., 2020).SOC stability and stabilization are both defined as the tendency of SOC to resist loss (Ives & Carpenter, 2007; Yang et al., 2020). SOC stability raises the question of whether it could persist for a long term, and tends to show the change of SOC at a certain moment or period, highlighting the results of SOC stabilization (Angst et al., 2019; Mu et al., 2020). However, SOC stabilization necessitates the understanding of diverse factors influencing its stability comprehen -sively, such as soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (Plaza et al., 2013). It describes the state of the whole soil-  environment system when SOC stabilization is achieved and underscores the en -tire process of SOC stabilization (Poeplau et al., 2017; von Lützow et al., 2008). The SOC accumulation depends on SOC stability in the long term, while increased SOC levels could maintain the SOC sta -bility because higher SOC contributed to building an eco-  enzymatic system in stable C pools (Dai et al., 2017; Menichetti et al., 2015). However, these processes are also regulated by climate and man -agement practices (Reichstein et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2018). Thus, it is not sure whether high SOC content can also enhance its stability.McCann (2000) summarized SOC stability, as an ecosystem property, which can be viewed from two perspectives: resistance (capacity to resist perturbation) and resilience (capacity to recover from the perturbation). However, previous studies have primarily fo -cused on perturbation from natural disturbance (Chen et al., 2021; Mccann, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2020). Agricultural soils contain 25%–  75% less SOC than undisturbed or natural soils (Lal, 2004b), indicating a large potential for SOC accumulation. However, there is a lack of a strong generalizable understanding of the mechanisms of SOC stability under different agricultural man -agement practices. Yet, improved knowledge is crucial to strength -ening predictions of SOC cycle feedbacks to climate change.In agro- ecosystem, management practices (e.g., tillage, irrigation, and fertilizer) strongly influence physical, chemical, biological, and en-vironmental events that cause successional upset, stress, and distur -bance to systems (Yang et al., 2020). Whether SOC can resist these changes and persist in soils is critical to understanding SOC dynamics in agricultural systems (Schmidt et al., 2011). Current thinking suggests that SOC persistence depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the SOC itself, but also on physicochemical and biological effects that lower the probability of its decomposition (Plaza et al., 2013). Building a conceptual framework integrating these factors affecting SOC sta-bility (e.g., physical, chemical, biological, and environmental factors) is FIGURE 1 Schematic diagram of carbon sequestration and emission (loss) during the processes of soil organic carbon stability (Qi et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 13652486, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15968 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

One practice that has shown the potential to increase SOC stability in the surface soil is conservation agriculture (CA). It is estimated that 9%–  15% of global arable land is currently managed using CA systems, or aspects of CA practice, for example, NT (Kassam et al., 2019; Prestele et al., 2018). Previous studies have primarily focused on the changes in SOC accu -mulation under NT, but SOC stock is dynamic and SOC stability is a major determinant of the capacity of a soil to sequester atmospheric CO2 (Poeplau et al., 2018). Greater SOC stability indicates a lower turnover and higher residence time of SOC (Dungait et al., 2012). Understanding the mechanism of SOC stability under NT helps to predict SOC dynamics under changing environments. Nonetheless, limited information is available about the mechanisms of SOC stabil -ity under NT. Thus, the objectives of this review are to identify (i) the factors that affect SOC stability, (ii) the mechanisms which stabilize SOC under NT, and (iii) whether the SOC under NT is likely to be preserved in soils over the long term.2 | FACTORS AFFECTING SOC STABILITYSOC comprises a range of organic compounds of various molecu -lar sizes and degrees of decomposition that interact with their sur -roundings (Lehmann & Kleber, 2015). The SOC pools can be divided into different pools that are defined functionally according to their ability to resist mineralization and persist in the soil, with distinct turnover rates for each pool (Zimmermann et al., 2007). Functional systems typically class SOC as labile, slow, and resistant pools based on their turnover time. It is assumed that the labile SOC pool is com -posed mainly of chemically labile and unprotected compounds and persists for several hours to months. The slow and resistant (stable) SOC pools persist for decades to centuries (Qin et al., 2019). Parton et al. (1987) defined labile SOC as having a mean residence time (MRT) of ~1– 5 years, slow SOC as having a MRT of ~20– 40 years, and resistant SOC as having a MRT of ~ 200–  1500  years.Several factors contribute to SOC stability and its MRT (Don et al., 2013; Plaza et al., 2013). For example, SOC accumulation is the balance between C input from plant biomass and C loss from SOC mineralization associated with the stabilization and destabiliza -tion processes (Crowther et al., 2016). It is expected that increased assimilation of C by crops will increase C inputs and SOC accumula -tion, and potentially reduce the increase in atmospheric CO2 (Dignac et al., 2017). However, fresh C inputs may also increase the existing SOC mineralization and release SOC-  derived CO2, via a phenom -enon known as the “priming effect (PE)” (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). Indeed, it has been estimated that, worldwide, positive PE intensi -ties have decreased SOC accumulation by 51% from 1901 to 2010 by increasing native SOC mineralization rates (Guenet et al., 2018). The C input from crop residues is also one of the most influential fac -tors regulating the chemical composition of organic materials in ag -ricultural soils (He et al., 2018). The decomposition of crop residues initially correlates with its bulk chemical composition, for example, the C:N ratio, lignin, and cellulose contents (Schmidt et al., 2011). Accordingly, the molecular structure of SOC has long been thought to determine SOC mineralization rates and has been regarded as an important factor regulating SOC stability. Indeed. complex chemical molecular characteristics (e.g., aromatic, aliphatic, alkylaryl, and bi -aryl bonds) can slow SOC decomposition (Yang et al., 2020).In addition to molecular structure, physical protection of organic material within soil aggregates and the chemical absorption of or -ganic molecules by soil minerals (chemical protection) are also im-portant to SOC stability (Angst et al., 2021; Gao, Wang, Li, Wu, et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Dead crop material converted into organic products can form intimate associations with soil aggregates and soil minerals through physicochemical and biological transformation (Lehmann & Kleber, 2015; Miller et al., 2019). Soil aggregates are a vital physical property, and nearly 90% of SOC in topsoil exists in ag-gregates (Jastrow, 1996), which are usually divided into different size classes with different stability (Devine et al., 2014; Modak et al., 2020; Razafimbelo et al., 2008; Six, Bossuyt, et al., 2004; Zhang, Zhu et al., 2018). Miller et al. (2019) concluded that, besides occlusion within soil aggregates, chemical protection through association with soil minerals also determines SOC stability. Thus, interest in SOC stability, mineral- mediated chemical stabilization, has increased considerably in recent years (Patzner et al., 2020). Chemical protection (stabilization) is associated with soil clay content, as well as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides, which can trap or adsorb SOC and reduce the degrading capacity of decomposers (Chen et al., 2021). Compared to soil micro-bial properties and crop growth, physicochemical protection explains more variance in the SOC stability (Chen et al., 2019). However, micro-bial properties are also important, because microbial activity directly drives the SOC mineralization (Blagodatskaya & Kuzyakov, 2008; Fang et al., 2018), and influences aggregate formation and adsorption by minerals (Six et al., 2002).SOC dynamics is a function of climate, and particularly the in -terplay between temperature and moisture regimes (González-  Domínguez et al., 2019). Schmidt et al. (2011) indicated that environmental conditions can affect the probability of SOC decom -position and SOC persistence. Warming impacts SOC stability and sequestration because SOC mineralization is temperature depen -dent (Melillo et al., 2002). Thus, the indicator called “temperature sensitivity ( Q10)” (the increase in SOC mineralization for every 10 degrees increase in temperature) can be used to predict the fate of SOC under global warming. Lefèvre et al. (2014) reported a gen -eral relationship between Q10 and SOC stability, with a higher Q10 observed for stable compared to labile SOC pools. Labile SOC in -creases soil microbial activity and macro-  aggregate formation under NT, which, in turn, protects the labile C from microbial attack by en -capsulation and occlusion (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Six, Bossuyt, et al., 2004). Furthermore, stable SOC is as vulnerable to PE as is more labile SOC (Guenet et al., 2012). Thus, labile SOC may not be always  13652486, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15968 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Soil moisture, in -fluenced by climate changes under global warming, regulates the microbial activity and substrate availability for microbial utilization, and thus affects the microbial acclimation to warming and SOC sta -bility (Wang et al., 2006). Hao et al. (2016) and Kan, He, et al. (2020) reported that SOC mineralization rates increased with the increase in soil moisture contents. However, Sun et al. (2016) argued that SOC mineralization was the lowest when the soil moisture regime was at the middle level. Thus, the relationship between soil moisture and SOC stability is unclear, and limited information exists about the interaction effects of temperature and moisture on SOC stability.In summary, SOC stability is determined by six mechanisms: (1) priming effects after inputs of fresh carbon; (2) molecular structure of SOC compound; (3) physical protection by aggregates; (4) chem -ical protection through association with soil minerals; (5) microbial properties; and (6) environmental effects (Figure 2). The present study is based on the hypothesis that these six factors govern the SOC stability and preservation independently and interactively.3 | SOC MINERALIZATION AND ACCUMULATION UNDER NTThe measurement of SOC mineralization rates via laboratory incuba -tion not only reflects the potential of SOC loss, but also correlates with soil physicochemical and biological characteristics, which are widely used to evaluate SOC stability (Balota et al., 2004; Das et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2016; Jacobs et al., 2010; Kabiri et al., 2016; Kan, Virk, et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2014; Whitman et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). In general, labile SOC is accessible for microbial decomposition and is depleted faster than recalcitrant SOC over the incubation period (Das et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019). Thus, laboratory incubation is an effective approach to assess SOC stability and identify factors impacting SOC mineraliza -tion and stability.A global literature review has thus been conducted to examine the SOC mineralization under NT as compared with CT. Overall, the studies were those implemented on a long-  term basis (20 years on average). In general, lower mineralization was observed in NT com -pared with CT in most studies (35 out of 49) (Autret et al., 2020; Kan et al., 2021; Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Kan, Virk, et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2019; Raiesi & Kabiri, 2017; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018; Sarker, Singh, Dougherty, et al., 2018; Sarker et al., 2019; Watts et al., 2010) (Table 1), although several studies also observed a higher mineral -ization rate under NT (Dimassi et al., 2014; Fernández et al., 2010; Oorts et al., 2006; Vazquez et al., 2019). On average, SOC mineral -ization in NT of 33.53 g C kg−1 SOC is 18.8% lower than that under CT ( p = .002; paired t - test) (Figure 3a). Furthermore, a negative cor -relation exists between SOC mineralization and SOC content in NT (R2 = .15, p = .006) and CT ( R2 = .21, p = .001) (Figure 3c), indicating that lower SOC mineralization is associated with the increase in SOC accumulation. A quadratic relationship is observed between SOC mineralization of NT/CT and SOC content of NT/CT, but most of the data points are in the first quadrant (Figure 4). This trend indicates that lower mineralization but higher SOC content occurs in NT com -pared with CT. On average, SOC content in NT of 18.96 g kg−1 is 19.9% higher than that under CT for the upper soil layer ( p < .001; paired t- test) (Figure 3b). Thus, it is concluded that NT reduces SOC mineralization, which contributes to the SOC accumulation in upper soil depth. It can also be hypothesized that the reduction in mineral -ization is due to the enhanced stability of SOC in NT systems.These results are similar to a number of other studies examining differences in SOC between NT and CT systems at both global and regional scales (Table 2). A global meta-  analysis showed that NT could improve SOC stock by 4.90 Mg ha−1 at 0– 30 cm depth, with a seques-tration rate of 0.57 Mg C ha−1 year−1 (Angers & Eriksen- Hamel, 2008; West & Marland, 2002). Similar findings were also reported by Virto et al. (2012). However, Luo et al. (2010) argued that NT only improved SOC stock at 0– 10 cm depth by 3.15 Mg ha−1, and decreased SOC stock by 3.30 Mg ha−1 compared with CT for 20– 40 cm depth. Thus, no FIGURE 2 Factors affecting soil organic carbon stability and mineralization and their relationship (Chen et al., 2021; Kan, He, et al., 2020; Kuzyakov et al., 2000; Schmidt et al., 2011; Six, Bossuyt, et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2020) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 13652486, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15968 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Using meta- analysis for China, Du et al. (2017) suggested that NT improved SOC stock at 0– 20 cm depth and no change at > 30 cm depth. Zhao et al. (2015) reported that NT improved SOC stock at 0– 10 cm depth, and improvement could be enhanced when NT is combined with residue retention (RR) compared with CT without RR.4 | SOC STABILITY UNDER NTMany studies have reported that NT has the potential to offset some of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 through SOC sequestration in upper soil layers. However, limited information is available regarding whether the accumulated SOC under NT would be sequestered for a long time horizon. Thus, we discuss how NT influences SOC stabi -lization using the mechanisms identified in Section 2 above.4.1  |  Priming effectsThe combination of NT with RR has been widely reported to im -prove SOC accumulation (Dikgwatlhe et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2020). Nonetheless, RR may also increase SOC mineralization and acceler -ate SOC loss if it induces a positive PE, and thus the rate of SOC sequestration under NT may not remain constant (Heitkamp et al., 2012; Shahbaz et al., 2017).

This knowledge would enhance the understand -ing of mechanisms involved in SOC sequestration under conserva -tion tillage (NT with RR). To achieve this, we reviewed PE intensities measured in five studies after inputs of fresh carbon were added to NT and CT systems (Table 3). In general, lower PE intensities were obtained under NT compared with CT based on long-  term field experiments (≥5 years) following the inputs of residues of wheat (Mo et al., 2021; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018; Sauvadet et al., 2018), maize (Kan, Virk, et al., 2020), canola (Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018), and cellulose (Dimassi et al., 2014). On average, PE under NT was 15.17 g C kg−1 SOC or about 21.3% lower than that under CT ( p < .05; paired t - test). Thus, while fresh carbon inputs cause positive PE intensities in both NT and CT, PE is lower in NT than under CT. However, in all the studies reviewed, aboveground parts were used as the fresh C source and belowground roots were ignored. As the contribution of root material to SOC is often higher than residues (Rasse et al., 2005), greater understanding is required of the role that root inputs have on the PE under different tillage practices.The reason for the lower PE intensity under NT may be related to differences in soil physicochemical properties (i.e., abiotic fac -tors) between tillage systems, as these are one of the main drivers CountryExperiment duration (years)Soil depth (cm)Cumulative SOC mineralization (g CO2- C kg−1 SOC)SOC content (g kg−1)Note Reference NT CT NT CTChina 10 0– 5 31.21 67.94 14.90 10.20 >2 mm AS Kan, Ma, et al.

For example, Kan, Virk, et al. (2020) reported a negative correlation between soil compaction and PE intensities among different tillage practices, and it has been well established that higher compaction often occurs in NT systems (Bogunovic et al., 2018). In compacted soil, the closer the packing of aggre -gates can alter soil hydrology (Alesso et al., 2019), and potentially lower aeration, which ultimately impacts aerobic microbial com -munities, potentially inducing changes in the magnitude of any PE. Furthermore, soil acidification is often observed after the adoption of NT (Li, Li, et al., 2020; Li, Song, et al., 2020), and a positive correla -tion exists between pH and PE intensities (Kan, Virk, et al., 2020). Soil pH not only affects the stability of aliphatic and long-  chain alkyl substances, but also changes the contents of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides (Berhe & Kleber, 2013; Bull et al., 2000). Thus, changes in soil pH under NT may affect PE intensities of SOC mineralization. Moreover, greater aggregation under NT was observed compared with CT after residue addition (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Because crop residues could not only provide a C source for microbial growth, but also contribute to the formation of microbial-  derived binding agents for aggregation (Six et al., 2000). In this sense, it potentially protects SOC from mineralization induced by the residue addition.FIGURE 3 Soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization (a) and SOC content (b) under NT and CT, as well as their relationship (c).

Using biomarkers and 13C nuclear mag -netic resonance (NMR) has advanced the understanding of sta -bilization mechanisms of SOC at the molecular composition and functional groups levels, and allowed a greater understanding of SOC genesis and transformation (Gao, Wang, Li, Han, et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2021). These techniques can also be used to quantify changes in the composition of SOC under NT and CT management. For example, SOC in macro-  aggregates under NT has a wider shape of aliphatic C (O-  alkyl and alkyl C) and aromatic-  C region compared with those under CT (Zhao et al., 2012). There are also tillage- induced differences in SOC associated with micro-  aggregates. In general, the shape of the alkyl-  C, aromatic-  C, and carbonyl-  C re -gions is also observed to be broader for NT than that for CT (Zhao et al., 2012). These results indicate that SOC under NT has a more steady-  state chemical composition compared with that under CT. However, several studies have reported that aliphatic C is the most dominant functional group, and conversion to NT retains more la -bile compounds (e.g., n-  alkanols, carbohydrates, and aliphatic C) in the 0–  10 cm depth than CT (Gao, Wang, Li, Han, et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2021). Despite these differences, it is difficult to deduce that SOC accumulated under NT is retained and stabilized in soil for the long term. The impact of SOC molecular structure on its stability has been questioned (Schmidt et al., 2011). An inherently “recalci -trant” biomolecule does not necessarily persist, and conversely, “labile” biomolecules do not necessarily readily decompose nor get quickly mineralized (Miltner et al., 2012). Although the increase in SOC under NT consists primarily of compounds from labile C pools, these can be protected against decomposition through interaction with the mineral matrix or by occlusion within aggregates (Gao et al., 2021; Lehmann & Kleber, 2015). Thus, some researchers have ar -gued that SOC stability is caused more by microbial inaccessibility due to mineral interactions and soil aggregation than by structural recalcitrance (Plaza et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2011). It can thus be concluded that SOC stability is not controlled just by molecu -lar structure in NT versus CT systems over the long term, but also by the rate of mineralization as influenced by changes in aggregate structure and other mechanisms of chemical protection.4.3  |  Physical protectionThe primary mechanism of physical protection of SOC is the en -closure within aggregates.

Physical protection depends on the level of aggrega -tion and SOC encapsulated within micro-  aggregates is more stable than that within macro-  aggregates (Pinheiro et al., 2004; Pulleman & Marinissen, 2004; Six, Bossuyt, et al., 2004; Somasundaram et al., 2018). Nonetheless, micro-  aggregates are formed within macro-  aggregates, and Six et al. (2000) reported that 27% of the macro- aggregate in CT consists of micro-  aggregates, whereas this value was 47% in NT. Thus, the dynamics of macro-  aggregates are crucial to SOC stability because it influences the micro-  aggregation and the sequestration of SOC within these micro-  aggregates (Six, et al., 2002; Six, Ogle, et al., 2004). It has been widely documented that NT reduces soil disturbance and increases macro-  aggregate formation, in contrast to CT (Six, Bossuyt, et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014). A global literature review showed that NT had a higher proportion of macro-  aggregates compared with CT, except in paddy soils when the experimental duration was 11 years (Wang et al., 2019). On average, the proportion of macro-  aggregates in soil under NT was 55.8%, and 32.7% higher than that under CT ( p < .05; paired t - test) (Table 4). Furthermore, the soil under NT often had a lower rate of mineraliza -tion in macro-  aggregates compared with that under CT (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018). As such, the soil under NT is characterized by a lower SOC mineralization compared with that under CT.4.4  |  Chemical protectionHighly reactive mineral surfaces regulate SOC by sorption and des -orption reactions and precipitation and dissolution of mineral-  SOC associations (e.g., organic bounded mineral Fe/Al oxides [Fep/Alp] and non-  crystalline mineral Fe/Al oxides [Feo/Alo]), thus limiting SOC mobilization and degradation (Coward et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019). Interestingly, NT management increases the relative im -portance of aggregation for stabilization and, in turn, decreases the contribution of mineral associations to the stable pool (von Lützow et al., 2008). Although aggregate turnover is an important process affecting SOC stability, Fe/Al oxides can lead to the formation of soil aggregates through their strong flocculating effect as a dominant binding agent, and in turn increase the protection of SOC by physi -cal protection in aggregates (Asano & Wagai, 2014; Six, Ogle, et al., 2004). In this sense, the chemical protection of Fe/Al may be more important than aggregate protection in SOC stability. Furthermore, the contents of Feo in NT were significantly higher than that under CT, and Feo contents were correlated with SOC content and SOC mineralization (Qi, Zhao, et al., 2021). Similar results were also re-ported by Inda et al. (2013), Huang et al. (2016), and Xue et al. (2019).Silt and clay minerals have a strong surface adsorption capacity, and more easily adsorbed hydrophobic SOC has a slow rate of deg -radation. Alkyl C is considered a particularly recalcitrant form of soil C, and clay size fractions generally show a greater alkyl C content than the whole soil (Lützow et al., 2006). Six et al. (2000) indicated that SOC in micro-  aggregates can be stabilized over the long term compared with mega-  or macro-  aggregate. Additionally, Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al. (2018) reported lower SOC mineralization in micro-  aggregate compared with macro-  aggregate. In general, micro-  aggregates contained well- decomposed plant and microbial residues, with the greatest organo-  mineral protection against microbial min -eralization compared with macro-  aggregates (Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018; Von Lützow et al., 2008). In contrast, less decomposed organic materials and some free particulate organic matter may be present in macro-  aggregates (Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018; Six et al., 2002). Nevertheless, some studies also reported that amounts of SOC mineralization in silt + clay fractions were lower than that in micro-  aggregates, primarily due to physicochemical protection and high specific surface areas (low microbial accessibility) in silt  + clay fractions (Fernández et al., 2010; Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018). Specific surface area and swelling–  shrinking in silt + clay could stabilize SOC through both polyvalent cations bridging and mineral surface sorption (Kleber et al., 2015; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018). Thus, a positive correlation is often ob -served between SOC and silt + clay contents (Chung et al., 2010; Gulde et al., 2008). Present studies are typically focused on aggre -gate turnover, and limited information was available regarding the variations in SOC protection by silt + clay induced by tillage prac -tices. Confusingly, one study found that NT decreased SOC content in silt + clay fractions, although NT decreased the SOC mineraliza -tion (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020). Disruption of aggregates is related to a loss of SOC as CO2 that depends on clay content (Stockmann et al., 2013). Compared to silt and sand contents, clay content can deter -mine fates of SOC with active SOC pool into CO2 (loss) or labile SOC pool. Thus, soils with higher clay content have a stronger aggregate structure to better resist disturbance from tillage, while soils with higher sand content have poor resistance for stability (Li, Li, et al., 2020; Li, Song, et al., 2020). A higher proportion of clay was ob -served in soil under NT compared with that under CT (Zhang et al., 2020). Moreover, clay dispersibility is widely used to evaluate soil structural stability. A negative correlation was observed between clay dispersibility and SOC content, and NT (or reduced tillage) re -duced the contents of clay dispersibility compared with CT (Gajda et al., 2018, 2021). Thus, it is concluded that NT could increase the clay content and decrease clay dispersibility, and thus promote soil aggregation and benefit SOC stability.4.5  |  Microbial propertiesSoil microbes control the C cycling, and SOC mineralization after sterilization can be half as much as in unsterilized soils under differ -ent tillage practices (Qi, Jing, et al., 2021). Thus, lower soil microbial activity should reduce the amount of SOC mineralization (CO2 pro-duction) (Blagodatskaya & Kuzyakov, 2008; Qi, Jing, et al., 2021). However, high soil respiration (CO2 production) is considered a sign of healthy soil. It has been reported that NT increases soil bacterial  13652486, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15968 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

In contrast, lower SOC miner -alization rates were typically observed in NT compared with that of CT reviewed in the current study (Figure 3). Jastrow et al. (2007) suggested that soil respiration (CO2 production) is mainly induced by intracellular metabolism (microbial pathway) carried out by vari -ous enzymes. However, it is widely accepted that soils also generate CO2 through non-  microbial pathways (Wang et al., 2017). Brookes et al. (2017) suggested that SOC mineralization is independent of microbial biomass size and structure. When microorganisms are not able to access SOC, the mineralization rate is actually regulated by the abiotic transformation of SOC into biologically available forms (the “Regulatory Gate Hypothesis”) (Brookes et al., 2017). Given that SOC mineralization refers to both microbial and non-  microbial CO2 emissions, it may therefore be possible for NT soil to have higher microbial activity and lower SOC mineralization if NT simultane-ously decreases rates of abiotic mineralization. In this regard, Qi, Jing, et al. (2021) evaluated non-  microbial CO2 emissions using sterilized soils, and observed that NT reduced non-  microbial CO2 emissions compared with CT, which can decrease SOC mineraliza -tion and lead to more SOC accumulation under NT. However, this is an under-  researched area and our understanding of the mechanisms behind the impact of tillage practices on non-  microbial CO2 emis -sions is limited. Thus, soil abiotic factors (e.g., aggregate protection and mineral association as described in Sections 4.3 and 4.4) were correlated with the protection of SOC from mineralization under NT. In addition, microbial activity also enhances the protection of soil aggregates and mineral association. For example, the production of microbial- derived binding agents contributes to the formation of macro-  aggregates (Six et al., 2000). Similarly, microbial- derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can form mineral-  associated SOC when it is adsorbed and co-  precipitated (Kleber et al., 2015).Some recent studies have indicated that microbial necromass (after their cell death) is an important source of stable SOC, and its contri-bution to SOC can be much more important than has been previously thought (Angst et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2018; Miltner et al., 2012). Microbial residues in soils contain components (e.g., murein, chitin, and lipids) specific for microorganisms, and these compounds have been suggested to stabilize in soils (Lützow et al., 2006). Aggregate protection and SOC associated with soil minerals are important to the stability of microbial residues. For example, microbial residues could be entrapped in small pores in aggregates, where decomposers are un-able to access them (Angst et al., 2021) (Figure 5).

Plaza et al. (2013) observed that interaction between microbial res-idues and minerals contributes to long- term SOC stabilization and sequestration under NT systems. Overall, interaction effects exist be-tween aggregate protection, association with minerals, and microbial activity (residues). To date, however, only limited information exists about the contribution of microbial activity (residues) to SOC stability under NT management. Nonetheless, conversion to NT management can enhance aggregate protection (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020) and the for -mation of Fe/Al oxides (Qi, Zhao et al., 2021), and thus promote the stability of microbial residues under NT (Figure 5).4.6  |  Environmental effectsIn general, temperature rise could stimulate microbial activity and improve the contribution of microbial residues to SOC (Ding et al., 2019). In coarser soils, soil moisture content also controls the deg -radation of lignin and the accumulation of microbial residues, thus affecting SOC mineralization (Ma et al., 2018). As described in Section 4.5, microbial residues play an important role in SOC sta -bility, and thus soil temperature and moisture regimes could af -fect SOC stability in NT systems. Increases in macro-  aggregate formation observed in NT systems are known to help protect SOC from mineralization (Kan, Ma, et al., 2020; Sarker, Singh, Cowie, et al., 2018; Somasundaram et al., 2018). Yet, macro-  aggregates have greater Q10 values compared with micro-  aggregates (Kan, He, et al., 2020). Moinet et al. (2020) postulated that the Q10 of SOC min -eralization decreases with an increase in SOC stability, and micro-  aggregate-  associated SOC is stabilized in the long term (Six et al., 2000). Furthermore, NT improves macro-  aggregate proportion by 32.7% compared with that under CT; thus, Kan, He, et al. (2020) re -ported that NT decreased SOC mineralization but increased its Q10 (Figure 6). This indicates that while the loss of SOC in NT systems is currently lower relative to CT, it could be vulnerable to loss following the temperature increases expected under future warming.A global meta-  analysis showed that soil available moisture ca -pacity may increase by 8.7% under NT compared with CT (Li, Li, et al., 2020; Li, Song, et al., 2020). Kan, He, et al. (2020) indicated that these increased moisture contents could constrain the increase in Q10 observed under NT. A reasonable explanation for this finding is that high soil moisture could decrease Q10 in macro-  aggregates (Kan, He, et al., 2020), and NT supports the formation of macro- aggregates (Table 4). Besides, soil moisture constrains the hetero -trophic component of SOC mineralization, inducing changes in the Q10 (Hursh et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021). These findings indicate that physical protection in macro-  aggregate could also constrain the accelerated SOC mineralization induced by temperature rise. Apart from temperature and moisture regimes, radiation is also an import -ant factor affecting SOC mineralization through light-  induced deg -radation. Because a system-  based NT is adopted with residue mulch, it protects SOC from light-  induced degradation (Zhao et al., 2020).5 | CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThis review suggests that physical (aggregate protection) and chemi -cal (association with soil minerals) protection plays a larger role in the SOC stability of NT systems compared to the molecular struc -ture of SOC, PE, microbial properties, and environmental effects. The most interesting finding is that chemical protection could be more important than aggregate protection due to the role of Fe/Al oxides and clay contents in flocculating soils and acting as binding agents for aggregation. The Feo and clay contents are significantly correlated with SOC content and mineralization, and Feo and clay contents in NT are significantly higher than those under CT. Higher microbial activity under NT also acted to increase the binding agent for aggregation and promote the association of SOC with soil miner -als. Moreover, higher microbial activity in NT contributes to greater microbial residues, which are stabilized in soils over the long term FIGURE 5 Effects of microbial activity and residues on soil organic carbon stability under NT as compared to CT (Angst et al., 2021; Kan, He, et al., 2020; Plaza et al., 2013; Qi, Zhao, et al., 2021) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]FIGURE 6 The response of soil organic carbon mineralization to temperature and moisture under NT (Kan, He, et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 13652486, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15968 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Furthermore, NT reduces non-  microbial CO2 emissions through protection by minerals and aggregates. Thus, conversion to NT reduces SOC mineralization and PE intensities after inputs of fresh C compared with CT. Although NT has a higher Q10 due to higher magnitude in macro-  aggregates, increases in soil moisture under NT can constrain the increase of Q10. This review highlights the crucial role of physical and chemical protection and their interaction in regulating the processes of SOC stability. Our findings enhance the prediction of SOC dynamics under climate change, potentially affecting the carbon-  climate feedback.However, the current research focus has been on the behavior of SOC in the surface soils of NT systems. Reduced SOC sequestration in subsoil under NT limits its potential to mitigate climate change. Global synthesis suggests that microbial- derived residues are crucial to stabilizing SOC in subsoil layers and deep soils can play a decisive role in SOC sequestration. Thus, it is recommended to identify the mechanisms of the microbial-  derived C to SOC stability under NT in the future and to enhance the SOC stability and sequestration in subsoil layers.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32071977).CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no competing financial interests.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTData sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were gener -ated or analyzed during the current study.ORCIDZheng-  Rong Kan   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-2175-4675  Rattan Lal   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-2972  Xin Zhao   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-2977-6430  Hai-  Lin Zhang   https:/ /orcid.org/0000-0002-7426-2885  REFERENCESAlesso, C.
