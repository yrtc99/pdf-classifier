This study aimed to characterize soilmicrobial genes and their potential to mediate SOC decomposition in threerevegetation shrublands ( Artemisia ordosica ,Salix psammophila and Caraganamicrophylla ) in the Mu Us Desert of northern China using an SOC mineralizationexperiment and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Among the three shrublands, theS. psammophila shrubland had the highest cumulative CO2emissions and highestrates of mineralization of the slow SOC pool. The mineralization rate of the slowSOC pool and the microbial taxonomic and functional composition displayed asignificant correlation. Most C-degradation genes were assigned to three bacterialphyla, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The relative abundance ofmicrobial functional genes involved in degrading recalcitrant C-complexes wassignificantly higher in the S. psammophila shrubland, resulting in the slowaccumulation of recalcitrant SOC. These results suggest that the microbialfunctional genes that regulate the decomposition of the SOC pool in drylandshrubland soils may be influenced by shrub species selection. These findingshighlight the importance of understanding how microbial catabolic potentialmediates the potential for SOC sequestration in different revegetation shrublands indrylands.HighlightsWe studied SOC mineralization and soil microbial functional genes in threerevegetation shrublands.S. psammophila shrubland had the highest CO2emissions and highestmineralization rates of the slow C pool.Slow SOC pool mineralization rate was related to microbial taxonomic andfunctional composition.Received: 8 August 2018 Revised: 31 March 2019 Accepted: 12 April 2019DOI: 10.1111/ejss.12824Eur J Soil Sci. 2020;71:93 –105. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ejss © 2019 British Society of Soil Science 93 13652389, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12824 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

In drylands, long-term anthropogenic activitiesand degradation of vegetation have resulted in massive soilC losses (Koerner & Klopatek, 2002; Z. Y. Zhou, Li, Chen,Zhang, & Li, 2011). Revegetation with xeric shrubs is awidely applied measure to rehabilitate ecological environ-ments and improve the soil organic C (SOC) content(M. Cheng, Xue, Xiang, Darboux, & An, 2015). Variationsin aboveground plant communities markedly affect the SOCpools by changing the quantity or quality of litters and byselecting for different soil microbial composition (Yan et al.,2018). It is widely accepted that the magnitude of theorganic C reservoir in soils depends upon the activity ofmicroorganisms (Liang, Schimel, & Jastrow, 2017). Thus,soil microbes significantly contribute to SOC turnover andthe rate of C sequestration after revegetation of xerophyticshrubs in drylands.Soil microorganisms contribute greatly to the C budgetof ecosystems through their roles as decomposers, therebyinfluencing the longevity and stability of soil C pools(Bardgett, Freeman, & Ostle, 2008; P. Trivedi, Anderson, &Singh, 2013). Different SOC pools possess various stabili-ties and, consequently, display different turnover times(Schmidt et al., 2011), which ultimately regulate C emis-sions. For example, the labile soil C pool has a fast turnoverrate and is vulnerable to environmental factors (Chen et al.,2016; X. Xu, Sherry, Niu, Zhou, & Luo, 2012), andincreases in the labile C pool contribute proportionatelymore to soil CO2efflux, particularly in a short period (Gu,Post, & King, 2004). Although stable SOC has a slowerturnover rate, its decomposition can also contribute substan-tially to soil CO 2efflux (Cai, Feng, Zhang, & Xu, 2016).Soil microbes can mediate SOC decomposition via alter-ations in their diversity and composition, ultimatelyinfluencing the degree of SOC accumulation (Zheng et al.,2017). However, the decomposition of different SOC poolsand mechanisms underlying the mediation of these phenom-ena by soil microbes with changes in plant species in dry-lands are yet unclear.The stability of soil C stocks is traditionally speculated tobe controlled by the recalcitrance of less reactive compoundsand physical protection, whereas other studies havehighlighted the important roles of soil microorganisms in thepersistence of SOM (Canarini, Carrillo, Mariotte, Ingram, &Dijkstra, 2016; Rabbi, Wilson, Lockwood, Daniel, &Young, 2014; Rumpel, Kögel-Knabner, & Bruhn, 2002).Previous studies reported that vegetation characteristics canaffect the diversity and composition of the soil microbialcommunity and consequently influence ecosystem function-ing (Schlatter, Bakkereeee, Bradeen, & Kinkel, 2015; Zak,Holmes, White, Peacock, & Tilman, 2003). However, taxo-nomic information regarding the microbial communitiesconcerned is often not sufficiently robust to predict theirfunctional capabilities, and the probing of microbial func-tional genes and the functional composition of microbialcommunities may help assess soil functions more efficiently(Barberán, Fernández-Guerra, Bohannan, & Casamayor,2012; Yang et al., 2014).In a plant –soil ecosystem, plant species govern the typeand abundance of many organic substrates provided to soilmicrobial heterotrophs. As the complexity and amount ofsoil substrate differ among different plant species, microbialcommunities can alter their functional potentials to adjusttheir decomposition strategies (Feng et al., 2017;Jagadamma, Mayes, Steinweg, & Schaeffer, 2014). Changesin functional genes used to degrade labile or recalcitrant Ccan alter SOC decomposition and long-term soil C stability(J. Z. Zhou et al., 2012). Therefore, an understanding of themicrobial functional potential for SOC degradation bytargeting related genes involved in C cycling may helpestablish correlations between organic C cycling andchanges in aboveground plant communities.In this study, we aimed to determine variations in thedecomposition of SOC and its constituents with changes inrevegetated shrub species and to investigate the extent towhich the microbial community functional potential(especially genes involved in soil C catabolism) can bealtered by different xerophytic shrub species to regulateSOC decomposition. We hypothesized that (a) shrub specieswould differentially influence the structure and function ofthe soil microbiome and the decomposition of SOC poolsand (b) the relative abundance of microbial catabolic genesspecific to labile or recalcitrant C-complexes would regulate94 SUN ET AL . 13652389, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12824 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

To test these hypotheses,we performed laboratory incubation and shotgunmetagenome sequencing to assay for SOC mineralizationand microbial key genes for C degradation in three revegeta-tion shrublands ( Artemisia ordosica ,Salix psammophila andCaragana microphylla ) in the Mu Us Desert in northernChina. In particular, our primary objectives were to deter-mine the functions of microorganisms involved indecomposing SOC and its constituent compounds in threeshrublands and to assess the selection of shrub species forecological restoration in terms of the microbial catabolicpotential for SOC.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1|Study site and soil samplingThe study was conducted at the Yanchi Research Station(37/C14040-38/C14100N, 106/C14300-107/C14470E; 1,550 m above sealevel) located at the southwestern edge of the Mu Us Desertin northern China (Figure 1). This site experiences a semi-arid continental monsoon climate, with an average annualtemperature of 8.1/C14C. The average annual precipitation is287 mm, with 62% of the rainfall falling between July andSeptember (Jia et al., 2014). This site has quartisamment soilaccording to the US Soil Taxonomy (USDA, 1975). Thedominant shrub species in this region are A. ordosica ,S. psammophila andC. microphylla. Before vegetation reha-bilitation, the study area comprised widespread bare sand-lands for decades. Since 1998, vegetation rehabilitation withA. ordosica ,S. psammophila andC. microphylla has beensimultaneously performed on bare sand-lands via aerialseeding, cutting propagation and seedling planting, respec-tively. Since then, the shrublands were fenced, grazing wasprevented and no fertilizer was applied.The A. ordosica ,S. psammophila and C. microphyllashrublands selected for this study are located within a rela-tively narrow geographical range and have a similar devel-opmental history. Their locations within the study site areillustrated in Figure 1. In August 2016, three 20 × 20 msampling plots were established in each shrubland, atdistances of 20 m away from each other. In each plot, allstandard shrubs were selected and numbered, and fiveshrubs were randomly selected using a random number gen-erator (https://www.random.org) for soil sampling. Soil sam-ples were collected beneath the canopy of each shrub (at acentral position between the trunk and the edge of the can-opy) and in open areas between shrubs; 10 samples wereobtained from each plot. Soil cores were obtained from adepth of 20 cm (excluding the litter layer) with a 4.5-cm-diameter soil auger. Thereafter, the 10 samples collectedfrom each plot were mixed to create one composite sample,providing a total of nine composite samples (three shrub spe-cies × three replicates). Each composite soil sample wassieved through a 2-mm mesh to thoroughly homogenize thesoil and eliminate roots and stones and then divided intothree subsamples. One portion was air-dried for physico-chemical analysis, the second portion was stored at 4/C14C forsubsequent assessment of the soil microbial biomass carbon(MBC) and laboratory incubation, and the third portion wassubsequently stored at −80/C14C on dry ice and used for meta-genomic analysis.FIGURE 1 Location of the studysite and the distribution of the threeshrublands within the study area.(a)Artemisia ordosica shrubland;(b)Salix psammophila shrubland;(c)Caragana microphylla shrublandSUN ET AL . 95 13652389, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12824 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

Soil pH was measured in a1:2.5 soil/water suspension. Total SOC was measured usingthe potassium dichromate oxidation method (Bao, 2000). Totalnitrogen (TN) content was analysed using the micro-Kjeldahlmethod (Jiang, 2000). Soil particle size was determined usinga Mastersizer 2000 instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern,UK) and classified as clay (<0.002 mm), silt (0.002 –0.05 mm)or sand (0.05 –2.00 mm) in accordance with the criteria devel-oped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Microbial bio-mass carbon was determined using a fumigation extractionmethod (Wu, Joergensen, Pommerening, Chaussod, &Brookes, 1990).To measure the soil C composition, soil samples wereprocessed using a two-step hydrolysis procedure to separatethe labile and recalcitrant C (Xue et al., 2016). Briefly,approximately 500 mg of ground soil was hydrolyzed with20 mL of 2.5 mol L−1H2SO4at 105/C14C for 30 min. Thehydrolysate was recovered via centrifugation and decanta-tion. The residue was washed with 20 mL of water, theextract was added to the previous hydrolysate and theresulting solution was called “labile 1 ”(primarily polysac-charides). After drying at 60/C14C, the remaining residue wasmixed overnight with 2 mL of 13 mol L−1H2SO4at 25/C14C,under continuous agitation. Thereafter, 24 mL water wasadded to dilute the acid to 1 mol L−1and hydrolysis was car-ried out for 3 hr at 105/C14C. The hydrolysate and 20 mL waterused to wash the residue were mixed and called “labile 2 ”(mostly cellulose). The labile 1 and 2 samples were quantita-tively analysed individually using a Liqui TOC-Analyzer(Elementar, Jena, Germany). Finally, the value of labile Cwas obtained from a combination of labile 1 and 2 fractions.Recalcitrant C content was determined from the differencebetween the amounts of SOC and labile C.2.3|Measurement of plant biomass and litterAfter soil sampling, five 1 × 1 m quadrats were placedaround the soil sampling cores in each plot. For those sub-plots, the understory herbaceous plants were harvested andall surface litters were collected. Three 5 × 5 m quadratswere selected in each A. ordosica shrubland plot to harvesttheA. ordosica aboveground part and root biomass. In eachplot of the S. psammophila andC. microphylla shrublands,six standard shrubs were chosen, and their abovegroundparts and root biomass were harvested. The dry weight of allplant and litter samples was measured after drying at 75/C14Cfor 48 hr.2.4|Incubation experimentFor each sample, 100 g of soil (dry weight) was weighed ina 500-ml jar. The water content of the soil in each jar wasadjusted to 60% of the water-holding capacity withdeionized water. A beaker containing 5 mL of 0.5 mol L−1NaOH solution was placed in each jar to trap CO 2emanatingfrom the soil. After sealing, all jars were incubated at 25/C14Cin the dark for 42 days. Three additional jars with a beakercontaining NaOH solution were incubated in parallel. Thesejars served as controls to account for CO 2trapped from theair. The NaOH solution in the beakers was changed after1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days. Carbon dioxideevolved during the incubation period was trapped in theNaOH solution, and excess CO 2was then titrated with0.1 mol L−1HCl after adding BaCl 2. Mineralized C was cal-culated as the cumulative CO 2-efflux rate (mg C kg−1soil).2.5|Estimation of the sizes andmineralization rates of the SOC poolsThe sizes and mineralization rate constants of SOC poolswere estimated using a parallel first-order and zero-ordermodel (Van Kessel, Reeves, & Meisinger, 2000). The coeffi-cient adjusted R2and Akaike's information criterion (AIC)(Akaike, 1974) were used to select the best-fitting model(Table S1). This model assumes that SOC comprises an eas-ily degradable (active) C pool mineralized exponentially inaccordance with first-order kinetics and a slow cycling(slow) C pool mineralized in accordance with zero-orderkinetics. The model is described by the following equation:Ct=Ca1−e−kat/C0/C1+kst, ð1Þwhere Ctis the cumulative amount of mineralized C at timet,Cais the size of the active C pool, and kaandksrepresentthe mineralization rate constants for the active and slow Cpools, respectively.

The DNA wasthen examined electrophoretically on a 1% agarose gel. EachDNA concentration was determined using a NanoPhotometerspectrophotometer (Implen, Westlake Village, CA, USA) andmeasured using a Qubit dsDNA Assay Kit in a Qubit 2.0fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The DNA in each sample was fragmented through son-ication to generate ~350 base pair (bp) fragments and gel-purified. Sequencing was performed using the IlluminaHiSeq 2,500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) atNovogene (Beijing, China).The raw reads obtained from every metagenomics datasetwere filtered by eliminating adaptor fragments and low-quality reads to generate clean data, which were then assem-bled using SOAPdenovo (Luo et al., 2012). The assemblywith the longest N50 in every metagenome was selected forsubsequent analysis. Scaftigs were generated after splittinginto“N”sequences within the scaffolds, and scaftigs shorterthan 500 bp were filtered out. USEARCH (Edgar, 2010) wasused to select unique scaftigs from all metagenomic datasets.The abundance of unique scaftigs in every metagenome wascalculated after mapping the corresponding clean data tounique scaftigs using SoapAligner (version 2.21) (Liu et al.,2011). The open reading frames (ORFs) contained in thescaftigs were predicted using MetaGeneMark (Zhu,Lomsadze, & Borodovsky, 2010). The predicted ORFs wereclustered using CD-HIT (identity threshold of 95%) (Fu,Niu, Zhu, Wu, & Li, 2012) and selected for subsequent usefor functional profiling. Relative gene abundance wasdefined as the ratio of the sum of the sequencing depth ofevery base in the predicated gene to the gene length. Func-tional annotation was performed using the CarbohydrateActive Enzyme Database (CAZy). For taxonomic analysis,the unique scaftigs were compared with reference microbialgenomes in NCBI MicroNT datasets (including those ofbacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses). The lowest commonancestor algorithm in MEGAN (Huson, Mitra, Ruscheweyh,Weber, & Schuster, 2011) was used to identify the taxon ofevery scaftig. Both functional and taxonomic annotationwere performed using the best BLASTX hit with 50 bp asthe minimum alignment length and E < 1 × 10−5as theE-value cut-off. All raw sequence reads generated in thisstudy were archived in the Sequence Read Archive databaseof the NCBI under accession number SRP149181.The CAZy database includes six CAZy classes, auxiliaryactivity (AA) redox enzymes, carbohydrate-binding modules(CMB), carbohydrate esterase (CE), glycoside hydrolase(GH), glycosyl transferase (GT) and polysaccharide lyase(PL). To estimate the SOC degradation potentials of soilmicrobial communities, we specifically focused on CAZygenes responsible for the catabolism of various C-complexeswith varying decomposability, ranging from labile C(e.g., monosaccharides and polysaccharides) to recalcitrantC (e.g., phenols). All CAZy genes detected herein and theirpotential substrates are listed in Table S2.2.7|Data analysesOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed toexamine differences in plant and soil properties, SOC miner-alization and the relative abundance of microbial functionalgenes among the three shrublands. The normality of resid-uals and the homogeneity of variances were assessed usingthe Shapiro –Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. Log/sqrt-transformation was used when data were not normallydistributed. Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) analy-sis was performed for multiple comparisons of means.Correlations between the soil properties and the relativeabundance of CAZy genes that degrade five categories oforganic compounds and SOC mineralization parameterswere evaluated using the Spearman method. The Mantel testwas performed to analyse the correlations between microbialtaxonomic and functional composition and SOC mineraliza-tion parameters. Differences in the taxonomic and functionalcomposition of microbial communities among theshrublands were assessed via permutational multivariateANOVA (PERMANOVA) and visualized using principalcomponent analysis (PCA). Linear regression analysis wasused to determine the relationships between the PCA axes.Statistical analyses, correlation analyses and linear regres-sion analyses were performed using SPSS software, version20.0. The Mantel test, PERMANOVA and PCA wereimplemented using the Vegan package in R software, ver-sion 3.3.1 (R Core Team, 2016). Results are presented asmean values ± standard error (SE). Statistical significancewas determined at a level of p< 0.05.3|RESULTS3.1|Plant and soil C propertiesPlant characteristics differed markedly among the threeshrublands (Figure 2a; p< 0.05). Above-ground and below-ground biomasses were the largest in the S. psammophilashrubland and the smallest in the A. ordosica shrubland. TheS. psammophila shrubland also had the largest litter biomass.Regarding soil C, total SOC content was significantly largerin the S. psammophila and A. ordosica shrublands(p< 0.05). Recalcitrant C content was the largest in theA. ordosica shrubland and labile C content was the largest intheS. psammophila shrubland (Figure 2b).3.2|SOC mineralizationCumulative CO 2emission resulting from SOC mineraliza-tion from the S. psammophila shrubland was significantlylarger than that from the other two shrublands (Figure 3;p< 0.05).

Differencesin C-degradation genes between A. ordosica andS. psammophila shrublands were primarily reflected in therelative abundance of catabolic genes specific to recalcitrantC-complexes (such as carboxylic acids and phenols). Therelative abundances of recalcitrant C-degradation genes,especially genes responsible for acetylxylan, pectate,alginate and lipids catabolism, were generally greater inS. psammophila shrubland ( p< 0.05).3.4|Taxonomic profiles of themicroorganisms involved in soil C degradationThe taxa of microbes catabolizing divergent C-complexeswere identified in accordance with the CAZy genes. Thecomposition of C-degradation microbes differed across thethree shrublands (Figure S1; PERMANOVA, F= 8.35,p= 0.0035) and was associated with the mineralization rateof the slow C pool (Table S3). The primary phyla of theputative C-degradation microbes identified in the presentsoil samples were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria andAcidobacteria (Figure 5). The relative abundance ofActinobacteria and Acidobacteria was significantly higherduring the catabolism of recalcitrant C than for labile C,especially in the S. psammophila shrubland ( p< 0.05).

A 3-year incubation study showed that CO 2emis-sions from the decomposition of resistant C can account forthe majority of total cumulative CO 2emission and that thedecomposition rate can be beneficial for accurate analysis ofsoil C decomposition (Feng et al., 2017). In our short-termincubation experiment, although most CO 2emissionsresulted from labile C pool mineralization, mineralization ofthe slow C pool was mostly responsible for the differencesbetween SOC mineralization rates in the three shrublands.Soil organic carbon mineralization is affected by manyfactors. Soil properties, such as the clay content, water-holding capacity and C:N ratio, are considered importantfactors regulating SOC decomposition (X. Xu et al., 2016).In the present study, few clear associations were foundbetween the soil properties and SOC mineralization, foreither the labile C pool or the slow C pool (Table 2), theexception being that the MBC content affected the minerali-zation rate of the labile C pool. The mineralization rate inthe initial phases of the incubation process depends onintense microbial activity in the rapidly oxidizable organic Cpool (Carvalho, Mendonça, La Scala, & Reis, 2013). There-fore, microbial biomass might be a key factor influencingSOC mineralization in the initial phase. In addition to MBCcontent, the taxonomic composition of the soil microbialcommunity contributed to changes in SOC mineralization(Table 3). Shifts in the bacterial or fungal community com-position towards certain groups potentially greatly contributeto SOC mineralization because of differing capabilities indegrading carbohydrates or complex organic compounds(Zheng et al., 2017). Microorganisms degrading complexorganic compounds may differ among the three shrublands,resulting in diverging slow C pool mineralization rates.Although variations in the soil properties in the threeshrublands did not directly affect the mineralization of theSOC pool, they might have caused indirect effects by modi-fying the soil microbial community composition.4.2|Effects of microbial functional genes onthe decomposition of SOC poolsAs hypothesized, soil microbial functional genes had a sig-nificant effect on SOC decomposition. Gene abundance is agood predictor of soil element-cycling rates because it inte-grates information regarding both environmental history andrecent process activity (Petersen et al., 2012). In the presentstudy, microbial functional genes, especially those for themetabolism of carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds,were significantly correlated with the mineralization rate ofthe slow C pool (Tables 3 and 4). Similarly, a previous studyrevealed potential associations between soil microbial func-tional genes and the decomposition of SOC constituents(Feng et al., 2017). Furthermore, a study on the associationsbetween soil microbial functional genes and enzyme activityindicated that gene relative abundance is an adequate predic-tor of the associated enzyme activity (Trivedi et al., 2016).TABLE 3 Correlations between soil organic carbon (SOC)mineralization parameters and the microbial taxonomic and functionalcomposition, as shown by the Mantel test ( n=3 )SOC decompositionparametersTaxonomiccompositionFunctionalcompositionrrCmin 0.289 * 0.383 *Ca 0.177 0.200ka 0.270 0.221ks 0.295 * 0.468 *Cminis the amount of total mineralized C at the end of incubation experiment.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseThus, although microbial enzyme activities involved inC-degradation were not measured directly, the highest rela-tive abundance of catabolic genes for recalcitrant C-complexes in the S. psammophila shrubland was associatedwith the microbial utilization of recalcitrant C-complexes.Together, the higher microbial degradation rate and activityfor recalcitrant C in the S. psammophila shrubland versusthose of the other two shrublands might retard the accumula-tion of the recalcitrant C pool in soil, although the largestplant biomass and quantity of litter were measured in the soilin this shrubland type (Figure 2a,b). Numerous studies onother ecosystems, including grasslands, the Tundra and for-est ecosystems, have demonstrated that warming or wateringcan enhance microbial functions in terms of recalcitrantC-degradation (L. Cheng et al., 2017; Hopkins, Torn, &Trumbore, 2012; Xue et al., 2016; Zhang, Johnston, Li, &Konstantinidis, 2017). Dryland microbes are consideredparticularly sensitive to global environmental changes (Nieet al., 2013). Thus, microbes in the S. psammophila shrub-land potentially drive accelerated decomposition of recalci-trant C-complexes with environmental changes.Labile C-complexes are utilized more efficiently bymicrobes than recalcitrant C-complexes (Cotrufo, Wallen-stein, Boot, Denef, & Paul, 2013). In the present study, nosignificant correlation was observed between the microbialfunctional genes and the mineralization rate of the active Cpool (Table 3). Differences in microbial functional geneabundance in the three shrublands did not result in differ-ences in the decomposition rate of the active C pool. Owingto robust correlations between enzyme activities with func-tional genes (P. Trivedi et al., 2016), these results suggestsimilar microbial utilization of labile C-complexes, particu-larly in the A. ordosica and the S. psammophila shrublands.However, higher accumulation of labile C was observed intheS. psammophila shrubland (Figure 2). It is likely thatpartial degradation products from recalcitrant C-complexescontribute to the labile C pool, as detected by Pires et al.(2017). Compared to the A. ordosica shrubland, the higherdegradation of recalcitrant C-complexes by soil microbes intheS. psammophila shrubland might, therefore, result in arelatively increased accumulation of the labile C pool. Inaddition, not only can microorganisms promote the releaseof C into the atmosphere through their catabolic activitiesbut also synthesize labile C into a stable form by their ana-bolic functions (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017). Wespeculate that microbial anabolic activities were smaller intheS. psammophila shrubland; however, further studies arerequired to investigate the contribution of microbial-derivedC to SOC sequestration in the three shrublands. In theC. microphylla shrubland, although the relative abundanceof C-degradation genes was the lowest (Figure 4), the accu-mulation of the C pool was also the smallest. The poorestsoil water content (Table S4) may have restricted microbialcatabolic and anabolic activities and resulted in equal accu-mulation of labile and recalcitrant C pools.In this study, both microbial taxonomic and functionalcompositions were significantly correlated with the decom-position of SOC pools (Table 3). Changes in the microbialtaxonomic composition may not alter the capacity of the soilto facilitate ecosystem functions because of functionalredundancy resulting from different taxonomic groups witha common function (Cardenas et al., 2015). However, PCAresults in the present study showed that the axes of the taxo-nomic and functional composition shared significant linearrelationships with each other ( p< 0.001; Figure 6c). Thesefindings indicate that the divergent microbial taxonomiccomposition in the three shrublands could alter the capacityof those communities to degrade SOC. Similarly, a study ofa temperate forest ecosystem showed that variations in thesoil microbial community structure can lead to differentialsoil microbial functions, including soil C transformation andturnover among contrasting forest types (You et al., 2016).The number of genes involved in the degradation of variousC sources is reported to differ between different microbialgroups (Trivedi et al., 2013; Zhao, Liu, Wang, & Xu, 2013).Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, which are classified asoligotrophs and thrive on moderately labile and recalcitrantforms of C (Fierer, Bradford, & Jackson, 2007; Trivediet al., 2013), were more abundant and related to the catabo-lism of carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds (Figure 5).Those microbial groups have a higher potential to generateenzymes involved in C-degradation in comparison withother groups and can be used to predict enzyme activity(Trivedi et al., 2013; Trivedi et al., 2016). Analysis ofgenetic diversity and functional microorganisms involved inSOC utilization are important for establishing further associ-ations between microbial composition and ecological func-tions during SOC mineralization (Brookes et al., 2017).Therefore, the composition of C-degradation genes canreflect the ability of microbes to utilize various C-com-plexes, thereby affecting the accumulation of SOC pools indifferent shrublands in recovering dryland environments.However, further studies are required to determine the asso-ciation between soil microbial genomic information anddynamic SOC decomposition processes.5|CONCLUSIONSIn summary, our results demonstrate that the soil microbialcommunities utilized divergent decomposition strategies fordifferent SOC pools in different shrublands. Instead of soilproperties, the soil microbial taxonomic and functional com-position shared significant relationships with SOC minerali-zation, especially for the mineralization rate of the slow soil102 SUN ET AL . 13652389, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.12824 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

The microbial communities directly affected SOCdecomposition, primarily by mediating degradation changesin the slow C pool in soil in different shrublands. In theS. psammophila shrubland, the highest mineralization rate ofthe slow C pool and highest relative abundance of genes forthe degradation of recalcitrant C-complexes might limit theaccumulation of the recalcitrant C pool. However, furtherstudies on microbial anabolic functions are necessary tocompletely explain differences in SOC sequestration inrevegetation shrublands. Overall, the present findings high-light the important role of the microbial functional potentialin decomposing SOC and its constituents after revegetatingdifferent shrub species in a dryland, indicating that an under-standing of this role may provide more comprehensive infor-mation regarding the mechanism underlying microbial SOCsequestration and may provide evidence for the selection ofappropriate ecological management practices in drylands.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis study was jointly supported by the National KeyResearch and Development Program of China (grant num-ber 2016YFC0500905) and the Fundamental ResearchFunds for the Central Universities (grant number2015ZCQ-SB-02).
