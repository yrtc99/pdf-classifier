LETTER Elevated CO 2and warming cause interactive effects on soilcarbon and shifts in carbon use by bacteriaYolima Carrillo,1* Feike Dijkstra,2Dan LeCain,3Dana Blumenthal3and Elise Pendall1AbstractAccurate predictions of soil C feedbacks to climate change depend on an improved understandingof responses of soil C pools and C use by soil microbial groups. We assessed soil and microbial Cin a 7-year manipulation of CO 2and warming in a semi-arid grassland. Continuous ﬁeld isotopiclabelling under elevated CO 2further allowed us to study the dynamics of the existing C (Old C)in soil and microbes as affected by warming. Warming reduced soil C under elevated CO 2buthad no impact under ambient CO 2. Loss of soil C under warming and elevated CO 2was attribu-ted to increased proportional loss of Old C. Warming also reduced the proportion of Old C inmicrobes, speciﬁcally the bacteria, but not the fungi. These ﬁndings highlight that warmingimpacts are C pool and microbial taxa dependent and demonstrate interactive effects of warmingand atmospheric CO 2on soil C.KeywordsBacteria, carbon, climate change, elevated CO 2, microbial C use, microbial communities,microbial function, soil, warming.Ecology Letters (2018) 21: 1639–1648INTRODUCTIONThe global soil carbon (C) stock is about three times largerthan that in the atmosphere, so changes in its size have thepotential to enhance or counteract ongoing climate changesvia the control of atmospheric CO 2. Future climate willinclude both elevated atmospheric CO 2(eCO 2) and warmerconditions, each of which is expected to impact terrestrial Ccycling. Despite increases in plant C inputs with eCO 2(Luet al. 2013; Yue et al. 2017), empirical and synthesis effortspoint at small effects or even losses of soil C with eCO 2acrossmultiple ecosystems (Norby & Zak 2011; Sillen & Dieleman2012; Procter et al. 2015; Black et al. 2017; Yue et al. 2017).These variable responses appear to be associated with varia-tion in C turnover rates (van Groenigen et al. 2014, 2015)across different C pools (van Groenigen et al. 2017) for whichthe mechanisms are not clear. The observed effects of warm-ing on soil C pools are likewise highly variable and the maindriving factors remain uncertain (van Gestel et al. 2018).Increased decomposition commonly occurs with warming butits impact on C stocks may be offset by increases in produc-tivity (Lu et al. 2013; Yue et al. 2017). However, mechanisticunderstanding of the drivers of this balance is still limited(Conant et al. 2011), given the multiplicity of factors at play.Recent studies suggest a role of differential responses of soilorganic matter pools (Hopkins et al. 2012; Frey et al. 2013;Pries et al. 2017) and of microbial abundance, communitycomposition and C use (Luo et al. 2014; Streit et al. 2014;Chen et al. 2015; Garcia-Palacios et al. 2015) as well as a roleof warming in the stabilisation of microbial C (Liang & Balser2012). Given the complexity of the individual impacts ofeCO 2and warming and the paucity of long-term multifacto-rial experiments, there is substantial uncertainty about howthese two factors combined will impact soil C stocks and theassociated feedbacks to climate change (Pendall et al. 2004;Crowther et al. 2016). Targeting the main sources of thisuncertainty should improve our ability to predict future Cbalance (Bradford et al. 2016).One main source of current uncertainty stems from the difﬁ-culty in assessing the actual standing stocks of C and theirresponses to current or simulated climate changes (K €ochyet al. 2015). High spatial heterogeneity, high backgroundlevels, soil sampling strategies, post-sampling handling andshort experimental duration (Gifford & Roderick 2003; Leh-mann et al. 2008; Hungate et al. 2009; Hoffmann et al. 2017)all hinder accurate assessment and thus, detection of changesover time. Furthermore, different C pools are likely torespond differently to environmental changes (Carrillo et al.2011; Groenigen et al. 2017) potentially leading to net effectsthat mask changes within speciﬁc pools. Partly due to thesecombined challenges, most efforts to assess soil C responseshave focused solely on C decomposition (e.g. Dieleman et al.2012; Zhou et al. 2016), while soil C formation, the other dri-ver of C stocks, is less frequently considered. The paucity ofmid- to long-term, direct assessments of total soil C stocksand their component pools in response to climate factors islimiting our ability to evaluate soil C feedbacks to climatechange (Bradford et al. 2016; Crowther et al. 2016). Labellingof plant biomass with C isotopic tracers in intact ecosystems,particularly if done for an extended time, offers multiple1Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University,Penrith 2570, NSW, Australia2Centre for Carbon, Water and Food, School of Life and EnvironmentalSciences, The University of Sydney, Camden 2570, NSW, Australia3Rangeland Resources & Systems Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service,United States Department of Agriculture, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA*Correspondence: E-mail: y.carrillo@westernsydney.edu.au©2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSEcology Letters , (2018) 21: 1639–1648 doi: 10.1111/ele.13140opportunities to improve our ability to assess shifts in soil Cpools. Isotope tracers allow us to follow the dynamics of dif-ferent soil C pools including the net accumulation of newlyﬁxed C and the net loss of native C.Our limited understanding of the role of soil microbes inboth C decomposition and formation under environmentalchange is another critical source of uncertainty about poten-tial soil C feedbacks to climate change (Bradford et al. 2016).Most research on the response of microbes has focused ontheir role as decomposers, mainly from short-term studies onsoil respiration (e.g. Eliasson et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2016).This understanding underlies the current representation ofmicrobes in Earth System models (Todd-Brown et al. 2012).However, a more reﬁned understanding and representation ofmicrobial responses and functions is necessary for more realis-tic projections (Wieder et al. 2015; Luo et al. 2016), butadvances are still hindered by limited empirical and ﬁeld-based knowledge. A number of recent advances highlightareas for which greater understanding is needed. Theseinclude: (1) different microbial groups are not likely torespond in similar ways to climate changes (Castro et al.2010; Andresen et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014), (2) initialresponses may dissipate or shift over time (Blankinship et al.2011; Craine et al. 2013), (3) microbial groups differ in thepools of C they use and these substrate preferences may shiftunder a new environment (Andresen et al. 2014; Streit et al.2014), and (4) their contribution to soil C decomposition andformation is likely to differ due to contrasting physiology andefﬁciency in their use of C (Liang & Balser 2012; Frey et al.2013; Allison 2014). It is clear that reﬁning our understandingof how microbial groups use C sources under future climateswill spur progress in understanding future C cycling. Long-term, multifactorial, ﬁeld simulations of future conditionsincorporating long-term C isotopic labelling allow for assess-ing microbial use of C pools over time. Combining these withthe concomitant observation of soil C pool dynamics will pro-vide empirical evidence of the linkages between microbial Cuse, microbial community composition and soil C stocks.Our ﬁrst aim was to study the dynamics of soil C over timeunder warming, eCO2and their combination at the PrairieHeating and CO 2Enrichment (PHACE) experiment. PHACEwas a 7-year climate change experiment that combined FreeAir CO 2Enrichment (FACE) and ecosystem warming in anative semi-arid mixed grass prairie in Wyoming, USA. Thecontinuous fumigation with isotopically labelled CO2in theeCO 2treatments allowed us to track the dynamics of thepools of unlabelled, pre-existing soil C (Old C) and New Csince the start of the experiment both under unwarmed andwarmed conditions. Thus, our second aim was to examine theimpact of warming on the Old C pool and its use bymicrobes. For this, we assessed microbial community compo-sition and the use of Old C by the microbial biomass overtime and by speciﬁc microbial functional groups. Further-more, we investigated the role of potential drivers of the shiftsin microbial C use. Parton et al. (2007) used the Daycentmodel to simulate the ecosystem-level responses of PHACEover 10 years and Mueller et al. (2016) studied the responsesof plant biomass over time. Here, we hypothesised that warm-ing would lead to an increase in soil C due to the suppressionof decomposition with drying from warming and no strongshift in plant inputs (Mueller et al. 2016; Parton et al. 2007;Fig. 1a). We hypothesised that in this water-limited system,eCO2would decrease soil C due to higher decomposition dri-ven by higher soil moisture, combined with no strong impactson belowground biomass inputs (Mueller et al. 2016; Partonet al. 2007; Fig. 1b). Thus, we hypothesised that, when com-bined, the effects of eCO 2and warming on decompositionwould offset one another (Parton et al. 2007) but soil Cwould increase due to positive, interactive impacts of the com-bined factors on plant biomass (Mueller et al. 2016; Fig. 1c).(a) Warming (b) eCO2 (c) eCO2 + WarmingNew COld C New COld C -- + ++ 0+New COld C New COld C --+ +-++ObservedSoil CSoil C+-HypothesisedFigure 1 Hypothesised and observed relative responses of soil C and fractions of New and Old C to Warming, elevated CO 2and combined factors at thePHACE Prairie Heating and CO 2Enrichment experiment native mixed-grass prairie.

Mean annual precipitation is384 mm; mean air temperatures are 17.5 °C in summer and/C02.5°C in winter (NOAA, 1994). Soils are Mollisols (ﬁne-loamy, mesic Aridic Argiustoll, mixed Ascalon and Altvanseries) with 0.96 kg C m/C02(0–5 cm). The PHACE experimentwas a factorial combination of CO 2and warming with ﬁvereplications. CO 2was raised during the growing season to600/C640 ppmv via Free Air CO 2Enrichment installed in 3.4-m-diameter rings. Increased canopy temperature (1.5 °C day-time/3 °C night, year round) was generated with a hexagonalarray of 1000-watt Mor FTE infrared heaters (ComstockPark, MI, USA) attached to a 1.5-m-high frame (Kimballet al. 2008). The CO2treatment began in early April 2006 andheating in early April 2007. Soil volumetric water was moni-tored continuously using frequency domain reﬂectrometry andnitrogen availability was assessed with buried ion exchangeresins (Mueller et al. 2016).Soil sampling, processing and analysisSoils were sampled once a year in late July starting the yearbefore treatments began until the experiment ended (2005 –2013, with the exception of 2006) by collecting and composit-ing four 3-cm diameter, 15-cm deep cores from each plotwhich were split among 0 –5 and 5 –15-cm depths. A subsam-ple of the composited soil was sieved to 2 mm and furtherinspected to remove any visible particulate organic matter.Following this, subsamples were treated to remove carbonatesby shaking with 1 M H3PO4(Sherrod et al. 2002) and thenﬁltered, rinsed and dried to remove the acid. After grinding topowder, soils were weighed for C and d13C analysis on a Fin-nigan DeltaPlus XP connected to a Carlo Erba NC-2500 ele-mental analyser via a Finnigan ConFlo III open-splitinterface.Microbial C and13C and microbial community PLFA and13C-PLFAWithin 24 h of collection, 2 mm sieved subsamples were pro-cessed for microbial C and d13C. Microbial C was assessedwith chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE, 0.05 M K 2SO4).Extracts were analysed for total C on a Total Organic Carbonanalyser (Shimadzu TOC-VCPN; Shimadzu Scientiﬁc Instru-ments, Wood Dale, IL, USA) after treating for carbonates(1 M H3PO4at 1 lL per 10 mL of extract). The d13Co fextracts was measured on a dried aliquot (60 °C) using a Fin-nigan DeltaPlus XP connected to a Carlo Erba NC-2500 ele-mental analyser via a Finnigan ConFlo III open-splitinterface. Microbial d13C was calculated as d13C mic =(d13Cf*Cf–d13Cu f *Cuf)/(Cf –Cuf), where d13Cf and d13Cuf val-ues are isotopic ratios (per mil) and Cf and Cuf are the Ccontent of the extracts of fumigated and unfumigated soilsrespectively.Phospholipid fatty acid composition (PLFA) and d13C-PLFA were determined on soils from the last samplingdate, in 2013. A 6-g subsample of soil that had been frozenfresh and freeze-dried was extracted with methanol –chloro-form –phosphate buffer (2:1:0.8 in volume) and fractionated(Zelles and Bai 1993) with a silica gel column, mild alkalinemethanolysis was used to produce phospholipid fatty acidmethyl esters which were then puriﬁed with NH2amino-propyl columns. PLFAs were analysed on an Agilent 6890Nchromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmintong, Dela-ware, USA). Peak identiﬁcation was done with the SherlockMicrobial Identiﬁcation System (MIDI, Inc., Newark, NJ,USA). Individual PLFAs were quantiﬁed in relation to aninternal standard of known concentration (20:0 ethyl ester).For d13C of individual PLFAs, extracts were run on aTrace GC Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo ElectronCorp., Milan, Italy) coupled with a Delta V Advantage iso-tope ratio mass spectrometer through a GC/C-III. The d13Cvalues were corrected for the contribution of methanol Cduring steriﬁcation using mass balance for each fatty acid.Estimation of the fraction of Old C in soil, microbial and PLFA CTo investigate impacts of warming on C dynamics and micro-bial use, we take advantage of the continuous addition of13C-depleted CO 2in the eCO 2plots to estimate the proportion ofOld soil C in soil, microbial biomass and PLFAs through iso-topic partitioning using measured isotopic values (SeeAppendix S1). Old C is deﬁned as the C existing prior to CO2enrichment, including any plant C. The proportion of Old soilC-derived C in soil and microbial biomass was calculated as:Fraction Old CðSoil ;Microbial Biomass Þ¼ðd13CSoil ;Microbial biomass /C0d13Csoil aCO2 Þðd13CAG/C0d13Csoil aCO2 Þwhere d13CSoil, Microbial biomass are the d13C of those pools ateach time and for each eCO 2plot, d13CSoil aCO2 is the d13Co fthe soil C in the ambient CO 2plots in each year. There wasno inﬂuence of warming on the d13C soil in either CO 2treat-ment (Table S1), thus no bias was introduced. d13CAGis thed13C of the aboveground plant biomass in each of the eCO 2plots and in each year from the annual biomass sampling(Mueller et al. 2016); thus accounting for shifts in C3 –C4abundance in the eCO2plots. Aboveground rather than rootbiomass d13C was used as the latter includes pre- and post-enrichment C (Carrillo et al. 2014a). For PLFA, the fractionof Old C was estimated as in Hopkins et al. (2014) followingKramer & Gleixner (2006) so that©2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSLetter Soil C and microbial use under future climate 1641 14610248, 2018, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13140 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

FACE-derived C in allpools is deﬁned as the remaining fraction after subtracting thefraction Old C.Quantiﬁcation of soil respiration and C primingThe day after the last soil collection (2013), incubations of soilwith and without13C-labelled glucose additions were set up toassess whether treatments had modiﬁed the susceptibility ofsoil C to decomposition in response to C addition (priming).Twenty grams of ﬁeld-moisture (14% average moisture con-tent) soil was incubated in sealed 500-ml jars for 44 h at roomtemperature (see Carrillo et al. (2011) for details). One set ofsoils received 2 ml of H2O and the other was amended with2 ml of a solution containing 250 mg of 6.96 atom%13C glu-cose and 38.3 mg NH 4Cl. The addition aimed to representapproximately 35% of the microbial biomass C and to con-tain a C:N of 10:1 to prevent N limitation. The d13Co fC O 2released from both sets was used to calculate the fraction ofthe respiration derived from soil C in the glucose-amendedsoils asFraction Soil CCO2¼ðd13CCO2 amended soil /C0d13Cglucose Þðd13CCO2 unamended soil /C0d13Cglucose ÞThese fractions were applied to respiration rates and prim-ing was calculated as the difference between soil-derived CO 2in amended soils and CO 2-C produced from unamended soils.Statistical analysesWe evaluated treatment effects on soil %C and microbial Cwith repeated measuresANOVA with CO 2, warming and theirinteraction as factors. Both variables showed only effects oftime and in the case of soil C some pre-experimental (2005)differences across plots (See Appendix S2). To account forthese, we then focused on evaluating the change in soil % C(DC, deﬁned as the difference between the %C value of eachplot in each year and its pre-treatment value in 2005). Thesemodels included CO2, warming, year (discrete, accounting forvariation over time without assuming a linear trend) and theirinteractions as ﬁxed effects and plot (as a random effect tospecify that values within a plot across years were repeatedmeasures) as factors. This approach accounted for error asso-ciated with site spatial variation, sampling and processingacross time so that treatment effects on change relative to pre-experimental conditions could be assessed. Priming was anal-ysed with two-factor (CO2and warming) ANOVA . Nonlinearregression was used to ﬁt the decrease in the fraction of OldC over time. Effects of warming on the parameters of bestregression ﬁts and on the fractions measured in particularPLFA functional groups were evaluated with t-tests. Effectsof treatments on PLFA proﬁles were analysed with principalcomponent analysis (PCA) on correlations and two-factorANOVA on PCs.To investigate potential drivers of shifts in microbial C use,we explored the role of root biomass, water availability andnutrients in plants and soil as predictors of microbial Old Cuse with multiple regression and model selection. All possiblemultiple regression models of microbial C use (total biomassand microbial groups (Table 1)) as a function of these fourvariables, were compared and the best models based on cor-rected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) within 2 AICcunits were selected. For this analysis we used values of poten-tial predictors averaged across years in each plot over thecourse of the experiment. These observations and their corre-sponding methodologies have been presented previously(Mueller et al. 2016). Root biomass (0 –15 cm) was used as anindicator of the amount of plant input. Root % N was usedas a proxy of plant N concentration.

Analyses were performed with JMP(version 11.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).RESULTSTotal soil CWarming and eCO 2interacted to signiﬁcantly affect DC (dif-ference between %C in each year and pre-experimental val-ues) at 0 –5 cm (Fig. 2). In shallow soils, DC increased witheCO2but only at ambient temperature (CO 2effect at ambienttemperature: P=0.033, F=6.64 D.F. =1). In contrast, soilDC decreased with warming, but only in combination witheCO 2(Warming effect at eCO 2:P=0.05, F=5.31, D.F =1).Overall values of DC ﬂuctuated across years (signiﬁcant effectof year but independent of treatment), which is attributable toerror associated with spatial variation and processing andanalyses of samples (Fig. 2). Soil C % and microbial C valuesvaried over time but did not show treatment effects (SeeAppendix S2).Soil respiration and primingSoil respiration measured in the soil incubations without glu-cose addition was signiﬁcantly higher under eCO2(Fig. 3a).This effect was mainly due to a greater amount of availablesubstrate, as suggested by a much weaker CO2effect on therespiration rate per unit of soil C (Fig. 3b). Despite increasedrespiration with eCO2, the priming assessment revealed thatthe stimulation of soil C decomposition caused by C additionwas reduced under eCO 2(Fig. 3c).Old C in soil and microbial biomass over timeThe fraction of Old soil C (derived from the C existing at thetime the ﬁeld CO 2addition started), decreased signiﬁcantlyover time to less than 0.88 at the end of the experiment(Fig. 4a). The decline in the fraction of Old soil C best ﬁts atwo-pool exponential decay model indicating a faster declinein the early stage (Fig. 4a). This decay dynamic reﬂects thedecline over time in the available C that was present in theoriginal soil organic matter. The initial rate of decline was fas-ter (decay constant =2.01 under Warming vs 0.97 underAmbient) and the overall decrease reached lower values underwarming (Fig. 4a), but these parameters were not statisticallydifferent. The fraction of Old soil C in the microbial biomass(with CFE) decreased faster than that in soil and reachedabout 0.6 by the end of the experiment (Fig. 4b). The declineof the fraction of Old C in the microbial biomass best ﬁt asingle-pool, three-parameter exponential decay modelapproaching a stable value. This value indicated that themicrobial biomass contained a signiﬁcantly lower fraction ofold C under warming ( p=0.024, t-test, n =5), thus showingreduced proportional use of Old soil C (thus increased use ofNew, FACE-derived C) with warming. The fraction of Old Cin microbial biomass and soil were positively related (Fig. 4c).Microbial communities and use of Old CElevated CO 2was the main driver of the microbial commu-nity structure (Fig. S3a); however, warming impacted particu-lar groups (Fig. S3b). Elevated CO2decreased the relativeabundance of actinobacteria while it increased the abundanceof fungi, as well as the ratio of fungi to bacteria and protozoa(Fig S3b). Warming increased the Gram-positive bacteria butreduced protozoa. The partitioning of individual PLFA C intoOld soil C and FACE-derived C, followed by grouping intofunctional groups indicated that at the end of the experimentthe overall microbial C was close to 50% Old C-derived (gen-eral microbial markers, that is, markers of all microbes,Fig. 5a). The use of Old C was not uniform across functionalgroups as the fraction of Old C in the bacterial markers wasmore than double than that in the fungal markers. While wedid not detect strong shifts in microbial community structurewith warming, isotopic partitioning demonstrated clearchanges in microbial use of C under warming. The fraction ofOld C in general markers signiﬁcantly decreased with warm-ing (Fig. 5a), in accordance with the independent estimatesbased on CFE microbial biomass (Fig. 4b). The overalldecrease in the proportional use of Old C with warming wasalso consistent with a signiﬁcant decrease in the fraction ofOld C with warming in the bacterial markers, which did notoccur for the fungal markers (Fig. 5a). Together, C tracing inmicrobial biomass and PLFA indicated reduced use of Old C,and thus greater use of FACE-derived C under warming con-ditions, driven by bacteria. As with the CFE microbial bio-mass, the fraction of Old C in the general and bacterialmarkers, but not fungal markers, was positively related to thefraction of Old C in soil (Fig. 5b).Root biomass and particularly soil moisture were signiﬁcantpredictors of microbial use of Old C (Table 1). Soil moisturewas positively related to the fraction of Old C in CFE micro-bial biomass and general microbial PLFA markers as well asbacterial markers. Root biomass, on the other hand, was neg-atively related to the CFE fraction of Old C.DISCUSSIONOur multifaceted, 8-year study of soil C in a native mixed-grass prairie contradicted our hypotheses that soil C wouldincrease with warming, decrease with eCO2and increase undercombined warming and eCO 2. Moreover, it revealed interac-tive effects of CO 2and warming previously not predicted byexperiment-speciﬁc ecosystem response modelling (Partonet al. 2007). These ﬁndings demonstrate the necessity of long-term, multifactor global change manipulations to improvepredictive understanding. The long-term C labelling andtracking revealed that warming had contrasting effects in theOld and New pools of C, also contradicting our hypothesis.Our microbial analysis suggested potential linkages betweenthese effects of warming and shifts in C use particularly bythe bacterial members of the microbial community.Despite higher soil moisture with eCO2and lower withwarming (Mueller et al. 2016), our observations of increasedsoil C with eCO 2and no clear effect of warming alone are incontrast to our predictions of decreased soil C with eCO 2due©2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSLetter Soil C and microbial use under future climate 1643 14610248, 2018, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13140 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Elevated CO2may haveincreased soil C via greater belowground C inputs (Carrilloet al. 2014a; Mueller et al. 2016). In addition, our data sug-gest that lower susceptibility to C loss under eCO2may havealso played a role. After eight growing seasons of eCO 2, soilC was less sensitive to priming induced by labile C addition(Fig. 3), which is consistent with observations of decreaseddecomposition of soil C under eCO2in controlled-environ-ment studies using PHACE species and soil (Carrillo et al.2014b, 2016). While increases in C turnover with eCO 2in soilpools cannot be ruled out and are likely to have occurred con-comitantly (van Groenigen et al. 2014; Groenigen et al. 2017),they appear to have been offset by greater plant inputs anddecreased overall susceptibility to decomposition, leading tosigniﬁcantly greater soil C storage with eCO2(Fig. 1). In thecase of warming, the lack of a signiﬁcant increase in soil C, aswas predicted, could have been due to lower belowgroundinputs (Mueller et al. 2016) offsetting the decreased decompo-sition with soil drying (Fig. 1). Our ﬁndings, thus, suggestthat despite the often important role of water limitation fordecomposition in this system, further mechanisms such aschanges in the susceptibility of organic matter to decay, needto be invoked to explain climate change impacts, particularlythose of CO2.Our results provide evidence that the effect of warming wasdependent on CO 2conditions: soil C was lost with warmingunder eCO 2, but not under ambient CO 2. This C loss was suf-ﬁcient to offset the positive impact of eCO 2alone and0–5 cmΔC (Change in %C relative to pre-experimental conditions)–0.50.00.51.05–15 cm2005 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013–1.0–0.50.00.51.0Ambient Warming eCO2 eCO2 + Warming CO2 x Warming P = 0.021Year P = 0.00050.00.10.20.30.40.50.6AVERAGEbababYear P = 0.004TimeFigure 2 Change in C percentage in soil relative to pre-experimental conditions ( DC) over time at the PHACE experiment.

Reduction in soil C with warmingand interactive effects with CO 2are in contrast to Partonet al. ’s (2007) predictions of suppression of decompositionwith reduced moisture independent of CO 2. Increased soilmoisture under eCO 2(Morgan et al. 2011; Mueller et al.2016) could have removed water limitation to decomposition,thus enhancing decomposition with warming (Pendall et al.2013). However, isotopically distinguishing Old soil C acrosstime indicated that the proportion of Old C declined withwarming. Our ﬁndings imply that a greater decrease in thefraction of Old C with warming, particularly early after treat-ment initiation, contributed to its offsetting of the positiveeffects of eCO2on total soil C. This is consistent with reportsof increased susceptibility to warming of C pools that vary inage from years to decades (Hopkins et al. 2012; Pries et al.2017). Our results demonstrate that at least for this grasslandthe impacts of warming are dependent on CO2conditions andcall for caution when extending observations of warmingunder ambient CO2to future conditions with higher atmo-spheric CO 2. Our ﬁndings further suggest that considering dif-ferential responses of soil C pools may improve our ability topredict interactive impacts of climate factors on C dynamics.The joint assessment of Old soil C in soil organic matterand in microbes over time revealed relationships betweenmicrobial C use and soil C pools. The increased loss of C (to-tal and fraction of Old C) with warming (compared tounwarmed eCO2) occurred in parallel with a reduction in theOld C in the total microbial biomass that was sustained overthe experimental period. This reduction, in turn, could beexplained by the reduced use of Old C (and conversely,increased use of plant C including dead roots, exudation andother rhizodeposits) by the bacteria. Hence, our observationsindicate that the impact of warming did not generally occurfor all microbial C use, but that the bacteria were moredirectly affected. Decreased incorporation of Old C intomicrobial biomass, and the bacteria in particular, could beinterpreted as reduced use of this pool, which in turn, couldbe associated with less decomposition of this substrate. Thiswould result in an inverse relationship between the proportionof a particular pool in soil and that in microbes. In contrast,we observed clear positive relationships between Old C in soiland in microbial biomass (Fig. 4c) as well in as the indepen-dently measured PLFA markers (Fig. 5b). This relationshipcould be explained by the availability of C to microbes: as lessOld C is present, less is available to be incorporated intomicrobes. In turn, less Old C-derived bacterial biomass cancontribute to soil organic matter formation, further contribut-ing to the positive relationship between Old C in soil andmicrobial/bacterial Old C (Bradford et al. 2013).Our exploration of other driving variables suggested thatother factors, besides overall Old C availability, could havefurther contributed to the reduction in the fraction of Old Cin the bacteria. Lower use of Old soil C by bacteria with thewarming treatment was related to greater root biomass. Thisinverse relationship is expected and consistent with a shorterﬁeld study in an alpine system showing increase in microbialuse of Old C with warming, which was linked to reducedplant inputs (Streit et al. 2014). However, we determined thatan even stronger driver of reduced Old C use was the decreasein soil water, which occurs with warming at PHACE bothunder aCO2and eCO 2(Morgan et al. 2011; Mueller et al.2016a). Potential explanations for this include reduced diffu-sion of Old C to bacteria with lower watered-ﬁlled pore space(Manzoni et al. 2016) or reduced accessibility of Old soil Cpools due to greater C adsorption to minerals with lowerwater content under lower moisture conditions (Conant et al.2011). It is also possible that the chemical quality of remain-ing Old soil C differed for warmed and unwarmed treatments,AmbientWarmingeCO2 eCO2+WarmingRespirationug C g soil–1 day–1 12141618202224AmbientWarmingeCO2 eCO2+WarmingPrimingug C g soil–1 day–10123456AmbientWarmingeCO2eCO2+WarmingRespiration per unit of soil Cug C g soil–1 g soil C–1 day–18001000120014001600CO2: P = 0.05 CO2: P = 0.03(a) (b) (c)Figure 3 Soil C respiration and soil priming in incubated PHACE soil after 7 years of experimental manipulation.

Our empirical ﬁndings suggested that even for water-limited systems, soil moisture and its impacts on decomposi-tion and plant inputs alone cannot explain the interactiveeffects of climate changes on soil C pools and their use bymicrobes. The dependency of the impacts of warming on CO2conditions demonstrates the need for multifactorial studies aswell as the importance of including mechanisms that couldaccount for interactive effects of climate factors in futuremodel development. More speciﬁcally, our ﬁndings indicatedthe importance of potential CO2effects on the susceptibilityof soil C to decomposition and differential warming effects onsoil C pools. Our observations also support the value of con-sidering the differential responses of distinct microbial groupsto warming in relation to soil C pool responses.
