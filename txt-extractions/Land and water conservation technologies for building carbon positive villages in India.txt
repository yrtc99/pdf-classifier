The timely adop-tion of integrated land and water conservation technologies minimises erosion andprovides significant adaptation and mitigation co-benefits. The objectives of thisstudy were to assess the mitigation potential of soil and water conservation technol-ogies and also the feasibility of making villages carbon positive. The extent ofminimisation of soil loss due to soil conservation technologies ranges from 0.10 to21.65 Mg ha/C01yr/C01, while carbon emissions minimised range from 0.73 to158.77 kg ha/C01yr/C01. Emission minimisation from various water management tech-nologies in rice ranges from 73.0 to 507.9 kg CO 2equivalents ha/C01yr/C01. Agrofor-estry practices can sequester 8.64 to 52.77 Mg CO 2ha/C01yr/C01besides enhancingsystem productivity, arresting soil erosion and carbon loss through erosion. Integra-tion of multiple technologies in a farming system further enhances the adaptationand mitigation benefits. Adoption of conservation technologies resulted in a net car-bon balance of 0.05 –1.23 CO 2Mg ha/C01yr/C01in 9 villages in India, indicating net posi-tive carbon balance due to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and carbonsequestration. Building carbon positive villages is a potential approach for preventingland degradation, while enhancing productivity, mitigating climate change andrealising the sustainable development goals. Building capacities of communities andestablishing institutions in villages are essential for upscaling and maintaining of soiland water conservation structures and community assets in the village. Furthermore,prioritisation and scaling of location specific land and water conservation technolo-gies hold the key to establish carbon-positive villages.KEYWORDSagroforestry, carbon balance, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, integratedfarming system, land degradationReceived: 29 March 2021 Revised: 6 October 2021 Accepted: 15 October 2021DOI: 10.1002/ldr.4160Land Degrad Dev. 2022;33:395 –412. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ldr © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 395 1099145x, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4160 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Additionally,placed at the 140th position globally, the Country contributes 6.2% ofthe annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (FAO, 2019) with a percapita emission of 1.9 tonnes (Baumert et al., 2005). Furthermore, theagriculture sector in India contributes to 16.5% of the gross domesticproduct while providing employment to around 66% of the Country'spopulation (World Bank, 2019). Simultaneously, operational land hold-ings, a critical component in determining socio-economic farmer secu-rity, increased from 129.22 million (2005 –2006) to 146.45 million(2015–2016) while their average size declined (from 2.28 ha in 1970 –1971 to 1.08 ha in 2015 –2016) (DAC, 2020). Therefore, small andmarginal farmers (i.e. < 2 ha of land), account for the majority of theland holdings (126 of 146.45 million) of which, 68.5% are possessedsolely by marginal farmers (< 1 ha of land), clearly reflecting the largeproportion of smallholder farmers in the Indian agriculture system.Consequently, large tracts of potentially fertile lands are either leftuncultivated or suffer from low productivity owing to lack of physicalinfrastructure along with financial and human capital (NITIAayog, 2016).Agricultural production of India has reached 290 million tonnesin 2019 and aiming at 298 million tonnes during 2020 –2021(DAC, 2020). India has experienced remarkable increase in agriculturalproductivity over the last decades (Pingali, 2012) and leads in produc-tion of various commodities like milk, jute and pulses and occupies thesecond position in terms of rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, fruits andvegetables production globally (FAO, 2019). However, an undernour-ished portion of the population of approximately 14% renders foodsecurity a critical concern for the Country (von Grebmer et al., 2020).Increasing food demand of the growing population, especially theincreasing demand for high-value products as incomes increase, posesa major challenge for Indian agriculture. There is a transformative pro-gress in comprehending and addressing food security concerns duringthe last 50 years. Although food security was synonyms withincreased production in the 1950s, environmental health, primaryhealth care and primary education are also being focussed upon now.As Swaminathan (2001) acknowledged, prioritising ecological factorscan lead to long-term sustainability of food systems. An integratedapproach is necessary for increasing food production, distribution andservice delivery mechanisms in view of the rapidly changing climaticconditions, continued population growth, urbanisation, changes indiets and depletion of natural resources (Lal, 2012). In this context,building resilient, carbon-positive and sustainable villages is imperativefor reducing and reversing land degradation while enhancing produc-tivity, mitigating climate change and realising the sustainable develop-ment goals. The present article aimed to provide a critical appraisal ofthe ongoing efforts in India towards building carbon-positive villagesand assess the potential of various technologies towards establish-ment of carbon-positive villages. We hypothesised that by enhancingadoption of various conservation practices and other mitigationtechnologies, the GHG emissions can be reduced significantly and vil-lages can be made carbon positive.2|PRODUCTIVITY CONSTRAINTS OFTROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS2.1 |Land degradationVarious organisations have attempted to assess the state of land deg-radation and desertification in India since it is a widespread problem.Estimates of land degradation by different organisations vary widely,for example, 53.28 million ha (million ha) (NRSA, 1985), 120.7 millionha (NAAS, 2012), 123 million ha (NWDB, 1985), 146.82 million ha(NBSS & LUP, 2004) and 173.64 million ha (MOA, 1985). An estimateby GLASOD (FAO, 1994) puts erosion by water as the leading causefor degradation affecting 32.8 million ha land area followed by winderosion (10.8 million ha), fertility decline (29.4 million ha), salinisation(4.1 million ha) and inundation (3.1 million ha). The total area affectedby diverse degradative processes is 80 million ha (Table 1). The annualeconomic loss due to land degradation in India was valued at Rs 2.60lakh crores (one lakh crore =one trillion; 1US$ =Rs.76) in 2014 –2015, which was 2.09% of the Country's gross domestic product(TERI, 2018).2.2 |DesertificationDesertification can be briefly explained as the expansion of deserttype landforms and landscapes in areas where there has not been inthe recent past (Le Houerou, 2002). Drylands in India experiencesevere problem of desertification. Around 82.64 million ha of drylandarea in India is presently impacted from desertification with anTABLE 1 Estimates of land degradation in India by variousprocesses (area in million ha)Process ofdegradationFAO,1994 NAAS, 2012Water erosion 32.8 73.3 (land area) and 9.3 (forestarea)Wind erosion 10.8 12.4Soil fertility decline 29.4 —Waterlogging 3.1 0.9Salinisation 4.1 6.5 (land area) and 0.1 (forest area)Lowering ofwatertable0.2 —Acid soil — 10.8 (land area) and 7.2 (forest area)Mining/industrialareas— 0.2Total 80.4 120.7Abbreviations: FAO, Food and Agricultural Organisation; NAAS, NationalAcademy of Agricultural Sciences396 SRINIVASARAO ET AL. 1099145x, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4160 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

The Thar Desertregion of India is severely negatively impacted by wind erosion.Removal of nutrient-rich soil from fields and their subsequent deposi-tion in non-agricultural areas are major wind erosion –associated con-cerns in the region. Furthermore, climate change and desertification indryland regions foster reductions in crop and livestock productivityalong with biodiversity losses. Detrimental impacts associated withmoisture stress, drought severity and habitat degradation arepredicted to impact 178 million people with a rise of 1.5/C14C and220 million with a rise of 2/C14C temperature by 2050 (IPCC, 2019).Therefore, region-specific prioritisation depending on severity isrequired for combating erosion.2.3 |Soil erosionSoil erosion is recognised as one of the major challenges for agri-culture in India. The extent of erosion in the Country is estimatedat 5.1 Gt yr/C01, out of which 34.1% of the eroded soil is depositedin the reservoirs, 22.9% is transpo rted outside the Country (mainlyto oceans) and the remaining 43.0% is displaced within the riverbasins (Sharda & Ojasvi, 2016). Accelerated soil erosion depletesthe soil organic carbon severely and quickly. Soil carbon is dis-placed through runoff and erosion owing to its low density andhigher concentration in surface (Singh et al., 2018). The erodedsediments are enriched with carbon with the enrichment ratiovarying between 1.5 and 5.0 (Lal, 1999). The eroded sedimentscomprise a soil organic carbon concentration ranging between8a n d1 2 gk g/C01, total C displaced by erosional process is16.4 Mg ha/C01yr/C01in arid and semiarid regions of India, whichl e a d st oc a r b o nl o s so f0 . 1 3 1 –0.197 Gg C yr/C01and 120.96 –181.44Tg C yr/C01, with an annual loss of 13.5 million tonnes of major crops(Narayana & Babu, 1983; Singh et al., 2016). The economic cost ofs o i le r o s i o ni nc r o p l a n da r e a sd u r i n g2 0 1 4 –2015 was about 0.35%of GDP (TERI, 2018). Adoption of conservation measures thatreduce erosion in turn leads to reduction of carbon emissions fromerosion-prone ecosystems.2.4 |Ground water exploitation and depletion ofwater tableOverextraction of groundwater for a prolonged duration throughsustained pumping leads to water-level decline and depletion, a con-cern affecting many regions of India. While groundwater levels havedeclined by 61% between 2000 and 2017, agriculture remains thedominant cause for the same as 89% of extracted water is utilised forirrigation purposes (Bhattarai et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2012). Exces-sive depletion is further leading to withdrawal from deeper layers formeeting growing demand.2.5 |Impacts of land degradation on climateIndia is likely to suffer from a higher frequency of extreme tempera-ture and precipitation events (IPCC, 2014). Climate change intensifiesland degradation by aggravating the drivers responsible for erosionsuch as wind, temperature, combined with increased flood anddrought spells. Global warming is projected to increase frequency,amount and intensity of precipitation events globally particularly inhigh latitudes of northern hemisphere, which will further contributetowards land degradation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018).Temperature changes impact the nitrogen and carbon cycles andmicrobiota through faster nitrogen cycling and changes in the carbonallocation (Solly et al., 2017). Ecosystems and biodiversity are vulnerableto climate change and weather extremes. Land degradation processesare driven by unsustainable exploitation of vegetation leading to loss ofvegetation and biomass carbon, causing net carbon releases (Lal, 2012).Degradation by different activities in tropical and subtropical regions isestimated to cause carbon releases up to 0.6 Gt C yr/C01(Pearsonet al., 2014). Land acts as both carbon source and sink by regulatingexchange of gases, water and aerosols between surface and atmo-sphere; sustainable management of land resources is critical for reduc-ing detrimental climate change effects on environment and societies.3|CARBON POSITIVE VILLAGEIn the absence of human interference of climate system, the stocks ofcarbon in the atmosphere, oceans, soils and forests exist in dynamicequilibrium (Mathur & Awasthi, 2016). Carbon neutrality is a dynamicbalance between the rate of emissions and their removal, which indi-cates that the total emissions are balanced by total offsets, and there isnet zero carbon emissions (Goodfield et al., 2014). A Carbon-positivebalance scenario indicates further reduction in the GHG emissions andenhanced removal of CO2by way of sequestration (McDonough,2016). The carbon balance for assessment of neutrality and net removalfrom the atmosphere considers all the important GHG emissionsexpressed in terms of CO2equivalents. In India where nearly 66% ofthe people live in villages (World Bank, 2018) and agriculture supportsmore than 60% of the population (Deshpande, 2017), minimising emis-sions and enhancing removals leading to net-negative emissions andpositive carbon balance in all the spheres of agriculture activities willlead to establishment of carbon-positive villages (Figure 1). A village isan administrative and management unit, a contiguous geographical arearanging from few hundred hectares to few thousand hectaresdepending on the topography. The available resources in the village aremanaged by the communities for various agricultural activities andfocussing mitigation interventions at this scale will be effective inminimising resource degradation and establishing carbon-positive vil-lages. The stepwise process of development of carbon-positive village ispresented in Figure 2.Globally, agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectorscontributed 24% of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions dur-ing 2007 –2016, and the extent of contribution is increasing graduallySRINIVASARAO ET AL. 397 1099145x, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4160 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License(IPCC, 2014). In India, the agriculture sector has contributed to 14% ofthe total emissions during the year 2016 (MoEFCC., 2021). Enteric fer-mentation by animals, rice cultivation, nitrogen emissions from soils andapplied fertilisers, crop residue burning and emissions due to manuremanagement are the important sources of emissions in India(MoEFCC., 2021). Apart from the above, land and vegetation degrada-tion in agricultural landscapes, use of fossil fuels in various agriculturaloperations and activities related to land use change contribute towardscarbon emissions (Foley et al., 2005). However, these activities providepotential opportunities for minimising GHG emissions, can enhanceresource efficiency, productivity and sequester CO2from the atmo-sphere thus contributing to the net negative emissions.Agriculture in a developing country like India is highly diversified,location specific and resource driven, meeting the household and mar-ket demands for producing diversified products. Continuous andunabated land degradation is contributing to decline in productivity,loss of productive soil, loss of biodiversity and threatening the liveli-hoods of millions in developing countries (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015).Efforts in arresting land degradation minimises the emissions, whiletheir rehabilitation enhances productivity and contributes towardscarbon sequestration and emissions removals (Pearson et al., 2014).Agriculture in developing countries would be sustainable andcontribute towards net negative emissions when climate resilient/smart technologies are adopted by communities on large scale. Anenabling and conducive environment leading to adoption of climateresilient smart technologies by communities in villages can lead toestablishment of carbon-positive villages. Development of such vil-lages will meet the objectives of climate change mitigation, enhancedproductivity and livelihood improvement. Further they can contributetowards sustainability by contributing towards various SustainableDevelopment Goals (SDGs) like climate adaptation and mitigation(SDG 13), arresting land degradation (SDG15) minimising poverty(SDG 1) and improving farmer income (SDG 2) (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).4|ACHIEVING CARBON-POSITIVEVILLAGE4.1 |Land and water conservation technologiesConservation technologies can be defined as approaches that con-serve land and water, reduce loss of soil carbon, promote crop pro-ductivity and sequester carbon (Mahajan et al., 2021). Besides, landFIGURE 1 Transformation ofa village from net carbonemissions to carbon positive[Colour figure can be viewed atwileyonlinelibrary.com]FIGURE 2 Process of establishing carbon-positive village for attaining the United Nations (UN)-Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]398 SRINIVASARAO ET AL. 1099145x, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4160 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

While in-situ measures collect water within the harvestingarea with the soil acting as storage, the ex-situ measures diverts wateroutside the harvesting area and the reservoir for collection can be nat-ural or artificial.The feasibility of a conservation practice depends on several fac-tors such as field slope, precipitation distribution, soil properties, croptype, etc. Bunding (mechanical approach commonly adopted in slopinglands to collect surface runoff, increase water infiltration and preventsoil erosion) is one of the effective in-situ measures suitable for redsoils with 8% slope (Chowdhury et al., 2016). Land configurations,such as broad-bed and furrow, ridge and furrow, etc., are effective in-situ conservation measures (Srinivasarao, Gopinath, et al., 2016).Broad bed and furrows minimised soil loss and reduced loss of carbonto 46% compared with that of the flat on grade system in Vertisols ofCentral India (Table 2, Mandal et al., 2013). Opening of conservationfurrows is one of the effective measures for in-situ conservation andfor minimisation of carbon loss. Vegetative barriers planted on con-tours are effective in minimising runoff, soil loss and carbon. Some ofthe promising vegetative barriers are Dichanthium annulatum, Panicumturgidum, Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris for arid regions(Gupta, 1966), Chrysopogon zizanioides ,Cymbopogon citratus andSaccharum spp. for semiarid regions of India (Dass et al., 2011). InInceptisols of Maharashtra receiving a rainfall of 723 mm vegetativebarrier of Cenchrus ciliaris recorded minimum runoff, reduced theextent of soil loss by 41% in comparison to no barrier and contributedTABLE 2 In-situ moisture conservation practices, the extent of soil loss (Mg ha/C01yr/C01), CO 2emissions (CO 2kg ha/C01yr/C01) and impact on cropproductivity (kg ha/C01)Practice Location Soil S SL CP CO 2 ReferencesTCB in finger millet withSaccharum sppSouthern Odisha Red lateriticSandy loam5 4.03 (8.26) 1500(1100)29.55(60.57)Dass et al.

Acombination of vegetative barriers with trench-cum-bund can furtherminimise soil and carbon loss; lowest runoff (8.1%) and soil loss(4.03 Mg ha/C01yr/C01) were observed in the rainfed uplands ofKokriguda watershed, Southern Odisha (Dass et al., 2011). Groundnut+pigeon pea (4:2) intercropping systems recorded the lowest soil loss(8.03 Mg ha/C01yr/C01), which was 47% lower than the cultivated fallowand enhanced yields by 158% in the hilly tribal areas of KandhamalDistrict of Odisha (Subudhi & Senapati, 2016).4.1.2 | Land treatments for soil, water, fertility andC loss minimisationLand treatments comprising of contour bund, graded bund, compart-mental bund, trench-cum-bunding and contour trenches are widelyadopted in watershed development programmes for erosion control.A contour bund consists of earthen embankments built across theslope of land following the contour closely. It divides the area intoseveral strips which act as a barrier thereby reducing soil and carbonloss by decreasing the quantity and velocity of runoff (Mishra &Tripathi, 2013).Contour bunding was found to reduce the surface runoff and soilloss considerably in many regions. Contour bunding at 0.7 m verticalinterval minimised soil loss to 0.03 Mg ha/C01yr/C01and carbon loss to0.22 kg/C01ha/C01yr/C01and enhanced sorghum yield by 10% in compari-son to no bunding in red soils of Bundelkhand region in central India(Narayan et al., 2014). Contour bunding supported by live bundingwith species like Leucaena has reduced the soil loss to a minimum atBangalore (Gund & Durgunde, 1995). In Dehradun, which receives arainfall of 1450 mm, graded bunding reduced the soil and carbon lossby 77% in comparison to control with a slope of 8% (Table 3; Khola &Sastry, 2005). Laser land levelling can minimise application losses ofwater, reduce energy requirement and enhance water productivity.Highest water productivity was observed in the laser levelled fields,which was 48%, 78% and 49% higher as compared to control(unlevelled), in rice, wheat and sugarcane, respectively. The extent ofsavings in energy is up to 31.5% due to laser land levelling in compari-son to no levelling (Naresh, Singh, et al., 2014).4.1.3 | Terracing and bund formation in hillecosystemsTerracing and formation of bunds are generally recommended in hillyregions with relatively high rainfall. Adoption of mechanical soil andwater conservation approaches can ensure retention of maximumrainfall and safe disposal of runoff from steep slopes thereby reducingerosion. Bench terracing in Dehradun, with a slope of 8%, minimisedsoil and carbon loss by 96% in comparison to no terracing (Table 4). Inthe northeast region of Meghalaya, bench terracing minimised soil lossand carbon loss up to 97% than control and contributed to yieldenhancement up to 135% in maize and 309% in rice (Patiram., 2002).Use of perennials such as Erythrina poeppigiana can minimise carbonloss and contribute towards carbon sequestration. Intermittent benchterracing is another approach for arresting the soil loss, conservationof water and soil in steep slopes of the Western Ghats has minimisedthe soil loss to 92% than control and enhanced crop yields up to 18%in Maharashtra (Badhe & Magar, 2004). Reducing the soil and carbonloss from fields retains the soil and carbon in the village itself.4.1.4 | Farm pond technologies for water storageand efficient recyclingEfficient in-situ conservation of soil moisture combined with harvest,storage and recycling of the excess runoff for supplemental irrigationcan lead to successful growth of rainfed crops. Farm ponds effectivelycapture the excess runoff after in-situ conservation and safely divertthe runoff into a pond, thus conserving the water and soil carbon in thefield itself. The importance of rainwater harvesting for agriculture hasfurther increased as an adaptation strategy in view of increased climaticvariability and frequency of extreme weather events. The advantages ofuse of harvested water for supplemental irrigation are significant andimprovement in crop yields was observed up to 560% depending oncrop, duration and degree of dry spell and quantity of water applied(Srinivasarao et al., 2015; Srinivasarao, Prasad, et al., 2016). Due to effi-cient use of harvested water, the water use efficiency was observed toenhance considerably (15.88 kg ha/C01mm/C01) compared to farmers' prac-tice (3.90 kg ha/C01mm/C01, Table 5; Das et al., 2012). Diversion of runoffwater in to farm pond helps in harvest of as much rainwater from thefarm in the farm itself and helps in collection and storage of soil and car-bon in the field itself.4.1.5 | Restoring soils with recycling eroded soils infarm and village tanksDesilting of ponds (Water bodies of fresh water often gets filled dur-ing the rainy season with runoff which is used for irrigation andrecharge) and water storage tanks was found to be an economicallyprofitable activity for creating more water holding capacity andreturning the silt back to the fields as a source of organic matter andplant nutrients. The organic carbon content of sediments ranged from5.3 to 27.2 g kg/C01, with an average of 10.7 g kg/C01in Medak,Telangana (Osman et al., 2015). The quantity of tank silt (is a fine soilbrought through surface runoff during rainfall from catchment areawhich is applied to fields as an amendment during dry period whenthe water body is dry) application to fields ranged from 12.5 to62.5 Mg ha/C01yr/C01, which results in addition of 125 to 625 kg ha/C01ofcarbon to soil (Table 6). The nutrient content of tank silt is highly vari-able and vary from place to place.

The extent ofyield improvement ranged from 22% in maize to 36% in sorghum dueto the application of tank silt while improving water-associated effi-ciency and productivity of different crops at several locations inAnantapur, Warangal, Solapur and Bhilwara Districts (Reddy &Dixit, 2017). Tank silt application is recommended as an organicamendment for improving water use efficiency and productivity.Impact of tank silt application in degraded Alfisols of AndhraPradesh, India, indicates strong response of maize and castor yieldsand found to improve soi l physical, chemical and biological proper-ties (Srinivasarao, Gopinath, et al., 2016). Results revealed reduc-tion in bulk density of soil from 1.5 to 1.25 g cc/C01on application oftank silt having clay content between 60 to 80%. Additionally,application of tank silt at 50, 100, 150 and 375 tractor loads perhectare enhanced available water content by 0.002, 0.007, 0.012and 0.032 g g/C01soil, respectively. Tank silt application resulted inimprovement in soil moisture con tent along with the ability ofcrops to withstand dry spells of 4 –7 days thereby reflecting therole tank silt can play during prolonged dry periods (Osmanet al., 2009).4.1.6 | Restoration of Jhum lands in hill ecosystemsShifting cultivation ( Jhum cultivation- Slash and burn method of culti-vation) is a traditional land use prevalent in hilly ecosystems of NorthEast India. Due to growing population, the shifting cultivation cycle isreduced to 3 –4 years in recent times as compared to 10 –12 years inthe past resulting in land degradation (Kumar et al., 2016). Ram &Singh (1993) observed soil erosion resulting from shifting cultivationto be particularly high (40.9 Mg ha/C01) along with an organic carbonloss of 702.9 kg ha/C01on steep slopes. Similarly, Singh & Singh (1981)estimated soil loss from hill slopes to be 147, 170 and30 Mg ha/C01yr/C01under first year, second year and abandoned jhum ,respectively. Several technologies like agroforestry, terrace farming,hedgerow cropping and sloping agricultural land technology (SALT;integrated approach applied in sloping lands) can lead to soil resourceconservation and increased grain production (Lamichhane, 2013). Cul-tivation of different hedgerow species in jhum fields can prove to bebeneficial to farmers. Hedgerow species like Alnus nepalensis ,Crotalaria tetragona, Gliricidia maculata, Indigofera tinctoria, Cajanuscajan ,Flemingia macrophylla, Desmodium rensonii andTephrosia candidaTABLE 3 Land treatments for soil and water conservation, soil loss (Mg ha/C01yr/C01) and carbon emission minimisation (CO 2kg ha/C01yr/C01) andtheir impact on crop productivity (kg ha/C01) and water productivity (kg m/C03water)Practice Location Soil S SL CP CO 2 WP ReferencesCB in maize Dehradun,UttarakhandSilty clay loam 8 10.13 (83.04) 1219 (fallow) 74.29 (608.96) — Khola & Sastry(2005)GB in maize Dehradun,UttarakhandSilty clay loam 8 19.51 (83.04) 1412 (fallow) 143.07 (608.96) —GB in sorghum Sindhanur,KarnatakaClay 6 0.57 (3.81) 1117 (879) 4.18 (27.94) — Rao et al.

SALT withAlnus nepalensis and Indigofera dosua species in test crop maizeresulted in minimised soil loss and carbon loss upto 84% –89% com-pared to no practice (Lamichhane, 2013; Singh, 2019). Furthermore,Saha et al., 2012 through a study at Changki, Nagaland, demonstratedthat soil and carbon loss was minimised by 22% by planting in contourhedgerow with Crotalaria tetragona injhum fields as compared to tra-ditional jhum sites (38.14 Mg ha/C01yr/C01; Table 7).4.1.7 | Land and water conservation in coastal andisland ecosystemsSoil erosion is a major land degradation problem in the sloping andundulated terrain of islands. Soil erosion resulted in fertilitydegradation and loss of top soil due to high-intensity storms and steeptopography. However, the island suffers from soil moisture deficitduring dry season due to high evapotranspiration and runoff associ-ated with soil erosion, which has a scour potential to reduce the soilproductivity by removing the most fertile topsoil and obstruct theagricultural operations. Therefore, soil erosion control and water con-servation are essential for island ecosystems. The soil mass of islandsis essential not only for maintaining fertility but also for the survival ofisland ecosystems. Relatively higher soil loss (124.8 Mg ha/C01yr/C01)was observed in rice-fallow as compared to ginger-fallow croppingpattern (70.6 Mg ha/C01yr/C01) in the South Andaman (Islands) District(Table 8). Staggered contour trenches and continuous contour tre-nches in cashew in coastal Goa resulted in minimising carbon loss tothe extent of 36 and 48%, respectively, compared to no conservationmeasures (Mahajan et al., 2021).TABLE 4 Terracing and bund formation in hill ecosystems and the extent of soil loss (Mg ha/C01yr/C01) and carbon emission (CO 2kg ha/C01yr/C01)and their impact on crop productivity enhancement (kg ha/C01)Practice Location S SL CO 2 CP ReferencesBT in maize Dehradun, Uttarakhand 8 3.07 (83.04) 22.51 (608.96) 1317 (fallow) Khola & Sastry (2005)25% maize on US +75%rice on BT in LSICAR-NEH Region,Meghalaya27–35 1.10 (35) 8.07 (256.9) Maize - 971 (412)rice/C01077 (263)Patiram.

Various management practices were developed,which can significantly reduce the methane and N2O emissions in ricecultivation (Table 9). Submerged rice fields are often regarded as amajor source of methane emissions from soil. This can be mitigatedusing several strategies such as alternate wetting and drying, direct-dry seeding (Tabbal et al., 2002), aerobic rice (Bouman et al., 2005),non-flooded mulching cultivation and system of rice intensification(SRI). Apart from crop establishment methods, nitrogen managementis equally important from view of GHG emissions. Carbon equivalentemission (CEE) was reduced by 27.4% in SRI and 30.1% in modifiedSRI over conventional method of planting (Jain et al., 2014). CEE intransplanted rice in various districts of Punjab ranged from 800 to2100 kg C ha/C01with an average of 1300 kg C ha/C01and in the directseeded rice (DSR) between 800 and 1500 kg C ha/C01with 1200 kg Cha/C01as average. DSR and SRI are alternatives to conventional pud-dled transplanted rice, which can save water, labour, increase farmers'income and minimise emissions (Pathak et al., 2013).4.2 |Agro-forestry systems as a sustainableland useAgroforestry systems can remove significant amounts of GHGs fromatmosphere through increased carbon storage in biomass abovegroundand belowground and in soil organic carbon (Goswami et al., 2014). Treesystems provide multiple benefits wh en integrated in to landscapes andprovide enhanced returns to farmers, stabilise productivity and impartsresilience to production sy stems, minimise risk for a gricultural productionand provides environmental services (Korwar et al., 2014). Agroforestrysystems help improve farmer livelih ood by mitigating global warming andenhancing carbon sequestration (Ajit et al., 2013). The extent of carbonsequestration from agroforestry systems in India ranges from 2.36 to14.42 Mg ha/C01yr/C01, depending on the tree den sity (Rizvi et al., 2011).Of the several tree-based systems, sh ort rotation intensive systems havethe potential to sequester substantial quantities of carbon in a short time,w h i c hc a nr e a c hu pt o1 4M gh a/C01yr/C01a n dc a nb et a k e nu pi nd e g r a d e dlands which are not suitable for intensive cropping (Prasad et al., 2012).T h i sc a ni nt u r nm i n i m i s ee r o s i o na n dc a r b o nl o s s( T a b l e1 0 ) .4.3 |Integrated farming systems for adaptationand mitigationIntegrated farming system (IFS) is a holistic system that utilises theresources available at the farm efficiently, diversifies income frommultiple sources, distributes income throughout the year, recyclesresources and minimises use of external inputs considerably. Animalcomponent of the system contributes to emissions, whereas peren-nials act as sinks (Meera et al., 2019). The net mitigation depends onthe nature of sources and sinks on the farm and their quantity (Reddyet al., 2020). In humid regions of Kerala, the IFS comprising of coco-nut, agroforestry and livestock is a sink with 228 kg CO2ha/C01yr/C01where an IFS consisting of agroforestry, crops, livestock and pastureis a source with emissions of 877 kg CO 2ha/C01yr/C01(Table 11).4.4 |Solar lifting devices for energy conservationand improved carbon footprintSolar water pumps are becoming increasingly popular for lifting waterand bringing additional area under irrigation as well as generatingTABLE 7 Restoration of Jhum lands in hill ecosystems minimising soil loss (mg ha/C01yr/C01) and carbon emissions (CO 2kg ha/C01yr/C01) and impacton improvement in crop productivity (kg ha/C01)Practice SL CO 2 CP ReferenceSALT with Alnus nepalensis species with maize 6.30 (58) 46.24 (425.72) 2250 (800) Lamichhane (2013)SALT with Indigofera dosua species with maize 9.00 (58) 66.06 (425.72) 2000 (800)HRGFG with finger millet 5.04 (9.71) 36.99 (71.27) 1413 (952) Lenka et al.

Governments are also promoting solarpower as a climate change mitigation strategy as it contributestowards decentralised power generation and helps in subsidy reduc-tion for agriculture sector (NAPCC, 2018). A solar pump can minimiseemissions to the extent of 0.891 Mg CO2ha/C01yr/C01(MoEFCC., 2021).It is generally used for providing irrigation water replacing an electricpump. The Government of India is promoting use of solar pumps on amassive scale in regions where the watertable is shallow. The NationalSolar Mission (NSM), launched on 11th January, 2010, had set a targetfor deployment of 100 Giga Watts of solar power by the year 2022.About 0.237 million solar pumps have been installed out of which65,892 solar pumps were installed during 2018 –2019 alone in thestates of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan (Table 12).5|VILLAGE INSTITUTIONS FORENHANCING ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGIESInstitutions established at the village level, such as the village climaterisk management committees, custom hiring centres, Salaha Samithi(An advisory committe constituted to make important decisions atlocal level for the implementation and adoption of various agriculturaltechnologies) self-help groups, commodity groups and watersheduser's association, help mobilise farmers' opinion about the perfor-mance of introduced technologies and provide a platform to discussvarious aspects of the introduced technologies (NAIP, 2012;Srinivasarao, Gopinath, et al., 2016). Making carbon-positive villagesrequires adoption and scaling up of proven land and water conserva-tion technologies on a large scale which requires participation of vil-lage institutions (Chary et al., 2019). Village institutions can guide theimplementing agency/organisation about the local resources and pref-erences of people while choosing technological options. As theproven land and water technologies are to be scaled-up in the entirevillage, comprising of private holdings and community areas, the roleof community structures is key for the establishment of structures inthe community land, protection of assets created, their maintenancein the long run and their sustainable use. Village institutions help inidentification of appropriate trees for development of agroforestry,pasture lands for minimising erosion and can play a key role for theirsurvival and taking up of regulated grazing and protection of struc-tures in long run.Custom hiring centres (CHC) are a new concept, which involvespurchase of costly farm equipment and making them available for useby farmers on rental basis (Srinivasarao, Dixit, et al., 2013).

The central andprovincial governments in India are supporting the concept of CHCs,and it is being scaled up. Large-scale adoption of farm equipment(broad bed and furrow maker, ridge and furrow planter, raised bedplanter, etc.) which are essential for in-situ land and water conserva-tion, can minimise soil and carbon loss and contribute towardscarbon-positive villages (Srinivasarao, Gopinath, et al., 2016). Institu-tions such as seed bank and fodder bank providing quality seed andgreen fodder in the villages can potentially help in enhancing the resi-due turnover of soil thus contributing to soil carbon sequestration andminimising enteric fermentation by way of enhanced green fodderavailability (Prasad et al., 2015).6|CARBON BALANCE WITH RESILIENTMANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES-ACASE-STUDY6.1 |Case-study of a carbon-positive village inIndiaThe village D.

Some of the technologies, which were adopted insignificant scale in the village, are construction of low cost check-dams for harvesting water for providing critical irrigation, in-situ mois-ture conservation practices, soil test –based nutrient application,rationalising nitrogen application, adoption of horticulture systemssuch as Mangifera indica ,Tamarindus indica , agri silviculture withGrevellia robusta ,Acacia , etc. (Table 13). Due to the adoption of thesepractices, the GHG emissions were to the tune of 620.3 Mg CO2equivalents yr/C01, whereas the extent of sinks was 799.8 Mg CO 2equivalents yr/C01. This indicates enhancement of sinks in the villagemaking the village a net sink (179.5 Mg CO 2equivalents yr/C01), andthe village has become carbon-positive (Figure 3).About nine villages were identified so far where the extent ofsinks is higher than the sources due to the adoption of the variousimproved practices (Figure 4). Action plan for making village carbon-positive should identify technologies, which can enhance productivity,contribute to climate resilience and also mitigation of GHG emissionsfor each of the prevalent cropping and farming systems. These tech-nologies are to be made familiar to the farming community by way ofvarious methods of transfer of technology. The management practicesto be adopted for achieving carbon positive village will be varying ascrops grown in a region are dependent on rainfall, soils, prevalent ani-mal systems, the food habits of communities and market opportuni-ties (Reddy et al., 2018). Such action plan should involve farmingcommunity, development departments, research institutes and otherinstitutes operating in the village (Srinivasarao, Prasad, et al., 2016;Srinivasarao, Rani, et al., 2016). Establishment of suitable support sys-tems by way of facilitating the supply of inputs, machinery, access towater, production technology, marketing, etc. is critical for enhancingthe adoption of technologies by large number of farmers.

In Bihar, villages prone to frequentdroughts and floods witnessed enhancement of sinks ranging from0.19 to 2.41 Mg ha/C01yr/C01through technology adoption (Figure 4;Reddy et al., 2020).

The case-study clearly shows adoption oftechnologies results in enhancement of sinks much more than thesources of GHG emissions in these villages, providing evidences ofmaking villages carbon positive. However, identification of drivers ofland degradation and potential land and water conservation technolo-gies is important and essential in making villages carbon positive inthe target region (Chotte et al., 2019).7|CONCLUSIONSOur study has clearly indicated the extent of mitigation possible byway of various land and water conservation and other mitigation tech-nologies in various ecosystems. The extent of carbon balanceachieved in the villages due to adoption of these practices rangedfrom 0.05 to 1.23 Mg CO2eh a/C01yr/C01which provides evidence forestablishing carbon-positive villages. The extent of mitigationachieved is variable depending on the mitigation technologies adoptedand also the extent of adoption of technologies. Some of the technol-ogies are effective in minimising emissions, while some, such as vari-ous agro-forestry practices, are effective in enhancing sinks. Anenabling environment that can contribute towards the adoption ofthese technologies not only results in mitigation of GHGs but alsocontribute towards productivity enhancement, resource use efficiencyand meeting the SDGs. Guidance on identification of appropriate soiland water conservation measures in a region depending on resourceendowments of farmer will be most helpful in enhancing adoption ofthese practices.8|WAY FORWARDCapacity building of village communities, systematic implementation,monitoring and accurate quantification of mitigation achieved are piv-otal for assessing the benefits realised from technologies. Informationabout impact of several technologies particularly related to loss andgain in carbon is limited and requires focussed efforts. For a develop-ing country like India, where much of the population resides in vil-lages, making villages carbon positive is a feasible option to meet thechallenges of climate change, land degradation, attaining the SDGs,enhancing resource efficiency and productivity. Our article describesthe technological options, which cover varied aspects of agriculturefor transforming villages into carbon positive along with requisite evi-dences. The technological options need to be prioritised dependingon the stakeholders involved in each location. Appropriate policy andinstitutional support are needed for increasing the ambit of thesepractices across diverse agro-ecosystems.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSAuthors are grateful to Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),New Delhi for financial support.
