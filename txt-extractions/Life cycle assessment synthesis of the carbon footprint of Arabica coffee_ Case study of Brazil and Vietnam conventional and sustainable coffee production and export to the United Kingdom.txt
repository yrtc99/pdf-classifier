REVIEW PAPERLife cycle assessment synthesis of the carbon footprint ofArabica coffee: Case study of Brazil and Vietnam conventionaland sustainable coffee production and export to the UnitedKingdomCarmen Nab |Mark MaslinDepartment of Geography, UniversityCollege London, London, UKCorrespondenceMark MaslinEmail: m.maslin@ucl.ac.ukFunding informationResearch Councils UK; NaturalEnvironment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/S007229/1Over 9.5 billion kg of coffee is produced annually and demand is expected to tri-ple by 2050. Hence, the identification and quantification of the greenhouse gasemission footprint of coffee is essential if it is to become a more sustainable crop.We have produced a detailed life cycle assessment of the carbon equivalent foot-print of coffee produced in Brazil and Vietnam and exported to the United King-dom. The average carbon footprint of Arabica coffee from both countries wascalculated as 15.33 (±0.72) kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per 1 kg of greencoffee (kg CO2ekg−1) for conventional coffee production and 3.51 (±0.13) kgCO 2ekg−1for sustainable coffee production. The 77% reduction in carbon foot-print for sustainable coffee production in comparison to conventional productionwas due to exportation of coffee beans via cargo ship rather than freight flightand the reduction of agrochemical inputs. Based on our results, further reductionscould be made through optimal use of agrochemicals; reduced packaging; moreefficient water heating; renewable energy use; roasting beans before exportation;and carbon offsetting. Applying these recommendations correctly through certifi-cation schemes could mitigate other environmental impacts of coffee cultivation.1|INTRODUCTIONThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2019) warned that humans have damaged a quarter of land onEarth (2 billion hectares) through land degradation and agriculture, which are responsible for almost a quarter of theworld ’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The IPCC (2018) report suggests that global emissions must halve by 2030 andbe net zero by 2050 if global temperature rise is to be kept to 1.5°C. Agriculture will play an important role in managingthe land and reducing GHG gas emissions.Coffee is a luxury agricultural commodity, sometimes referred to as a “drug food, ”as it provides no nutritional value.In 2018, coffee was the World ’s 121st most traded product, representing 0.17% of total world trade (OEC). Between 2017and 2018 coffee exports grew by 1.49%. Coffee is the world ’s 70th most traded agricultural commodity (International Cof-fee Organization [ICO], 2019), with over 9.5 billion kg produced in 2018 (Figure 1) with a total trade value of $30.9 bil-lion (OEC). Coffee is grown in tropical regions where the ecosystems are considered fragile due to other human pressures.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any me dium, provided theoriginal work is properly cited.The information, practices and views in this article are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Royal Geographical So ciety (with IBG).© 2020 The Authors.

With demand for coffee expectedto triple by 2050 (Conservation International, 2019b), the increasing global demand for environmentally friendly productshas pushed a rapid acceleration of sustainability initiatives among coffee producers and retailers (Noponen, 2012).If coffee is to become more sustainable we need to understand how and where GHGs are emitted through the produc-tion cycle and whether mitigating these emissions will increase or decrease the environmental impact of coffee cultivation.To this end we have applied an entire life cycle carbon footprint analysis (Cheng et al., 2014). This approach has previ-ously been used in agriculture (Ponsioen & Blonk, 2012), food consumption (Shirley et al., 2012), industrial production(Virtanen et al., 2011), and international trading (Peters et al., 2011). Analyses for individual agricultural products havebeen carried out, including butter (Flysjö, 2011), dairy (Asselin ‐Balençon et al., 2013), honey (Mujica et al., 2016), sugar(Yuttitham et al., 2011), wine (Pattara et al., 2012), and coffee products in Japan (Hassard et al., 2014). A carbon footprintanalysis by Hertwich and Peters (2009) concluded that global food production and consumption is the source of 20% oftotal anthropogenic GHG emissions, the majority of which is linked to agriculture (Cheng et al., 2014).2|COFFEE CULTIVATIONMost coffee grown is made up of two species: Coffea arabica (Arabica) and Coffea canephora var. Robusta (Robusta), theformer making up 70% of all coffee grown globally, and the latter encompassing the remaining 30% (ICO, 2019). Globally,coffee is currently grown between 22°N and 26°S (Wintgens, 2008). Germination of a coffee seed takes one to two months(Wintgens, 2008) and the plant takes approximately three years to mature and begin producing fruit (Hoffmann, 2018). Thecoffee plant flowers for less than two weeks, which is followed by the development of the coffee cherries. Developmenttakes 6 –9 months for Arabica and 9 –11 months for Robusta (Wintgens, 2008). At this stage, the berries turn from green todeep red and are ready for harvesting. Cultivated coffee trees have a lifespan of around 30 years (Bunn et al., 2015).Though they can live up to 80 years in the wild, the most productive years are between 7 and 20 years.Arabica coffee originated in Ethiopia and is grown within tropical forests at altitudes of 1,600 –2,800 m (DaMatta,2004). This region has well distributed rainfall patterns, ranging from 1,400 to 2,000 mm for two thirds of the year, withthe last third being the dry season and coinciding with the coldest months (Haggar & Schepp, 2012). Arabica ’s optimumrainfall is between 1,200 and 1,800 mm annually, and below 1,000 mm coffee plants cannot survive. The species prefersFIGURE 1 Total production of coffee by all exporting countries, 1990 –2018 (data from ICO, 2019).2o f1 9|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

These stringent environmental requirements mean that Arabica is mostlygrown in regions around the equator, with the major production areas being the Brazilian highlands, Central America, andColombia (Hoffmann, 2018). There are major concerns that future climate change (DaMatta et al., 2019) will greatly reducethe areas suitable for coffee cultivation, mainly due to the increased seasonal temperatures; see Bunn et al. (2015) for acomprehensive review.3|COFFEE PRODUCTIONThis study focuses on two sites in Brazil and Vietnam, and evaluates the different processes involved in the supply chainof Arabica coffee exported to the United Kingdom. Brazil and Vietnam were chosen as they are the two largest coffee pro-ducing countries, together producing over 50% of the world ’s Arabica coffee (Figure 2). Brazil is the world ’s largest pro-ducer of coffee beans, responsible for around 30% market share. Since 2008, coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam hasincreased by 60% and 165% on average, respectively, in comparison to average 1990 –2007 levels. In the 2017/2018 season,Brazil produced over 3 million metric tons of coffee (51 million bags), of which 60% was exported, whilst Vietnam pro-duced 1.8 million metric tons of coffee (30 million bags), of which approximately 80% was exported (ICO, 2019).Coffee ’s global significance extends beyond its large consumption numbers to the well documented environmental bur-dens as a result of effluent releases, fertiliser use, and habitat destruction (Hassard et al., 2014). Although there has beensubstantial research into the environmental impacts of coffee production, it has primarily focused on the production phaseand its contribution to the displacement of natural habitats and communities (e.g.,Komar, 2006; Rappole et al., 2003). Sig-nificantly less consideration has been given to the environmental cost of coffee processing, including the transportationfrom the production to consumption countries.Conventional coffee production consumes substantial amounts of energy, water, and land, which can have potentiallysignificant impacts on native tropical biodiversity (Arce et al., 2009), particularly due to the long, complex supply chainrequired to produce and transport the coffee bean to market. Although only grown in tropical and equatorial areas as theFIGURE 2 (a) Global top 10 coffee producers, 2000 –2018; (b) global top 10 coffee consumers, 2000 –2013 (data from ICO, 2019).NAB ANDMASLIN |3o f1 9 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseprimary export of many developing countries, the majority of coffee consumption occurs in the developed world, with theEuropean Union (EU) and the United States importing two ‐thirds of coffee produced worldwide (Salomone, 2003); see Fig-ure 2. The significant distance from production to final destination means there is a large amount of carbon emissions asso-ciated with the transportation phase alone, with roughly 15% of GHG emissions in coffee ’s lifecycle attributed tointernational transportation (Humbert et al., 2009; Killian et al., 2013; PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland, 2008).4|COFFEE CERTIFICATION AND SUSTAINABILITY SCHEMESWith mounting global focus on climate change, an increasing number of coffee associations and individual companies areintroducing sustainability schemes. In 2015, Starbucks announced that it had reached an industry milestone of 99% ethicallysourced coffee (Starbucks Coffee Company, 2019) and launched a traceability pilot programme, The Sustainable CoffeeChallenge. The programme aims to make coffee the world ’s first fully sustainable agricultural product and has since grownto more than 100 international partners (Conservation International, 2019b). To meet this goal, Nespresso launched theAAA Sustainable Quality Program, which supports more than 45,000 farmers and aims to reduce the carbon footprint of acup of Nespresso coffee by 28% by 2020 in comparison to 2009 (Nespresso, 2019b). Strategies in the programme rangefrom designing more efficient coffee machines to agroforestry and are informed by life cycle assessments (LCAs). As of2016, LCAs showed a carbon footprint reduction of 19.4%, with the company “insetting ”100% of its carbon footprint(Nespresso, 2019a); the process of embedding sustainable activities directly into supply chains, instead of offsetting themthrough indirect carbon ‐sequestering initiatives.Over time, the agricultural industry has increasingly used certification as a marketing tool for its products, in responseto increased competition and public scrutiny (International Trade Centre [ITC], 2011). These certifications prove to con-sumers that producers conform to good agricultural practices, practice safe pesticide use, engage in resource protection orprotect the environment. As a result, the product is accepted as safe and environmentally friendly. Whilst the certificationprocess is simple for producers of perishables such as a fruit and vegetables, the coffee industry is much more complex asa result of coffee farmers providing green coffee to overseas roasters, who in turn produce and market the finished product.Therefore, the identity of the producing individuals is often not known to the consumer, with the industry ’s complex supplychain making the validation of practices for certification difficult (Bosselmann, 2012). Nevertheless, several sustainabilityschemes have been introduced in recent years as a result of the increased consumer demand for environmentally consciousproducts. In 2012, 40% of global coffee (3.3 million metric tons) was produced in compliance with a voluntary sustainabil-ity standard, of which 40% was produced in Brazil and 15% in Vietnam (Potts et al., 2014). With smallholders supplying70% of the world ’s coffee (Kolk, 2011), sustainability certification schemes have focused largely on helping coffee farmersmaintain their high yield while reducing production costs and environmental degradation, by educating them about optimalfertiliser, energy and water inputs. Additionally, training coffee farmers techniques such as integrated crop management andsoil conservation helps them increase soil fertility to reduce the dependence on fertilisers and pesticides, further reducingthe inputs required to produce optimal crop quality and quantity. Lower production costs combined with price premiumshave been found to make sustainable coffee agriculture more profitable than conventional techniques, whilst maintaininghigh yields (Gobbi, 2000).Certification requirements and foci have varied considerably between the five main certification schemes; Fairtrade sup-ports small producers by guaranteeing a price premium, which is meant to be used to enhance social, economic, and envi-ronmental development. The Rainforest Alliance and Organic certifications have focused on protecting ecosystems andbiodiversity, whilst UTZ aims to mainstream sustainability across the coffee market. In 2011, the ITC conducted an analy-sis of the effectiveness of the most popular sustainability schemes for coffee, concluding that the Organic and RainforestAlliance schemes had the biggest environmental impact, particularly in terms of biodiversity and soil fertility. In terms ofenvironmental and sustainability requirements, the Rainforest Alliance certification scheme was found to be the most ambi-tious.The certifications have, however, some limitations: many of their criteria are difficult to monitor, such that there is noguarantee certified coffee has been produced according to certification standards. Additionally, the criteria are universal,lacking location ‐specific requirements for maintaining environmental integrity and biodiversity. In terms of carbon footprintreduction, private schemes such as the Nespresso and Starbucks schemes have been estimated to have a significantly largerimpact (Keller e al., 2013) due to their specific focus on reducing GHG emissions, higher level of intervention, and theiruse of emissions data to inform decisions. Additionally, their specific focus on their own suppliers means that they are ableto make more targeted changes in comparison to the blanket standards imposed by the main coffee certification schemes.4o f1 9|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License5|LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTSThe IPCC (2006), developed a standard inventory methodology for estimating all GHG emissions from the major economicsectors, which is now used by most governments to estimate national GHG emissions (Vergé et al., 2013). The resultinginventories are the foundation of national GHG mitigation strategies and international agreements, yet they are unsuitablefor tracking the effectiveness of mitigation strategies as they do not account for the complexity of agroecosystems and theresulting variability between producers, regions, and time. Moreover, the agricultural inventories do not include GHG emis-sions from energy use, omitting the transportation phase of crop production entirely (IPCC, 1996). As a result, there hasbeen a rapid development of various tools for assessing GHG emissions from agriculture. Some, like Century (Parton et al.,2006), DayCent (Parton et al., 2008), and the US Cropland GHG Calculator (McSwiney et al., 2010), are specificallyfocused towards assessing the crop production footprint per unit area. Others, such as the Cool Farm Tool (Unilever, 2011)and the Integrated Farm System Model (Rotz et al., 2012), calculate the carbon footprint of a farm as a whole by quantify-ing each production step. Simpler tools such as the Carbon Calculator (Carbon Farming Group [CFG], 2009) compute foot-prints per capita or per farm, without accounting for the broad inter ‐farm practice diversity (Asselin ‐Balençon et al., 2013).Nevertheless, none of these assessments enable fair comparison per quantity of a certain crop produced, as they do not sep-arate emissions from different crops. The wide ‐ranging nature of the coffee chain, with many individuals and companies ofdifferent types and sizes involved, makes an LCA the most accurate way of quantifying the environmental impact of eachstage in coffee production (McGeough et al., 2012; Salomone, 2003).The LCA method involves mapping out all activities of production, distribution, and consumption of a product, followedby a quantification of all impacts associated with these activities (Figure 3). This method follows the International Organi-zation for Standardization (ISO) 14,000 standards, which define LCAs as comprising four stages: goal and scope definition–outlining what the study intends to assess; inventory –quantifying the life cycle activities and their inflows (resourcesconsumed) and outflows (emissions); impact assessment –mapping these inflows and outflows to measures of environmen-tal damage; and interpretation –evaluating the results and developing recommendations (Kirchain et al., 2017).5.1 |Life cycle stages of coffeeThe life cycle of coffee can be divided into four general stages: production, transportation, roasting, and consumption. Thefirst three stages are generally the same for all types of coffee product, particularly when considering that many companiesproduce several different coffee products, whereas the final consumption stage processes differ depending on the producttype produced.Although LCAs have been extensively applied to a wide range of agricultural products, their application to coffee isvery limited in comparison to other agro ‐industrial products such as cash crops, dairy products, and canned food (Phrom-marat, 2018). Previous LCAs have produced widely varying estimations of the carbon footprint of coffee production, withvalues ranging from 3.7 to 15.8 kg CO 2ekg−1of green coffee (Table 2.2). Studies have collectively agreed that the cultiva-tion and consumption stages have the greatest environmental impact (Arzoumanidis et al., 2017; Coltro et al., 2006; Dom-ínguez ‐Patiño et al., 2014; Humbert et al., 2009; Killian et al., 2013; PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland, 2008). PCFPilotprojekt Deutschland (2008) estimated that 55% of coffee production ’s carbon footprint was generated during cultivationand on ‐farm processing and 30% during consumption, with the remaining 15% resulting from transport, processing, andwaste disposal. However, to date, all LCAs have been conducted using cargo ships as the method of exportation. Increas-ingly, roasters are importing fresher coffee, at a much higher price, by shipping the coffee by air instead of ship from thecountry of origin. These freight flights release an estimated 100 times more CO 2eper km travelled than cargo ships(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] and British Standards Institution [BSI], 2011), makingtheir inclusion in carbon footprint estimations crucial. To date, no LCA has included the exportation of coffee beans viafreight flight.In a carbon footprint analysis of six coffee products, Hassard et al. (2014) calculated the highest impact for the latte(224 g CO 2per serving), followed by canned coffee (223 g CO 2per serving), with the lowest impact calculated forespresso coffee (49 g CO 2per serving). These differences were attributed largely due to differences in packaging and theaddition of milk. However, on a per millilitre basis, espresso coffee had the highest impact (1.6 g CO 2eml−1), followed bycanned coffee (1.2 g CO 2eml−1), and the latte (0.97 g CO 2eml−1). This indicates the importance of selecting an appropri-ate functional unit when carrying out LCAs to carry out meaningful comparisons. In this study, the highest contributingfactors were the emissions from milk production, packaging, and the production stages of the coffee itself (Hassard et al.,2014).NAB ANDMASLIN |5o f1 9 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseIndirect, wider environmental impacts are often not considered in carbon footprint assessments due to difficulties inquantifying the amount of carbon they release. For example, an LCA by Salomone (2003) identified eutrophication (320 gPO43‐ekg−1of packed coffee) and terrestrial ecotoxicity (6 t/kg of packed coffee) as the main categories of environmentalimpact from coffee production. This comprehensive assessment included all life cycle stages from coffee cultivationthrough to consumption and disposal, but omitted fertiliser and pesticide use. In commercial farming, the excessive applica-tion of fertilisers (frequency and quantity) has been shown to exceed the soil ’s ability to retain and transform the nutrientsand release them according to the crop ’s needs (Coltro et al., 2006). Studies have shown that the saturation of the soil withphosphate or nitrogen has promoted losses of phosphates and nitrates into the groundwater (Dubos et al., 2017; Rahman &Zhang, 2018). On a farm level, the use of fertilisers and pesticides can cause the destruction of soil flora and fauna, whichcan in turn cause both physical and chemical deterioration of the soil itself, the groundwater, and the widespread environ-ment.Nevertheless, agricultural activities also have positive effects in terms of oxygen generation, carbon capture, and biodi-versity protection (Coltro et al., 2006). For example, Pelupessy (2003) estimated that coffee plants capture approximately35% as much CO2as the same area of woodland. None of the studies mentioned in this section considered the potentialpositive contributions of carbon storage in the coffee ecosystem to climate change mitigation, as carbon footprint estima-tions only include carbon fluxes between the system and its environment (BSI, 2008). Since coffee production systems canrange from simple monoculture plantations to complex agroforests, their above ‐ground and below ‐ground carbon stocksvary widely, with estimations ranging from 14.1 Mg/ha in an unshaded coffee monoculture (Hergoualc ’h et al., 2012) to46.3 Mg/ha in a highly diverse agroforest (Soto ‐Pinto et al., 2010).FIGURE 3 General life cycle stages of the production of a serving of coffee (adapted from Hassard et al., 2014).6o f1 9|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseTo examine the carbon footprint of coffee production, the CO 2eemissions from the growing, milling, and exportationphases were first quantified, after which the emissions from the processing phase estimated by a past LCA were investi-gated.6|METHODOLOGYCoffee ’s journey from producer to consumer is complex, with multiple sites and companies involved in the supplychain. This makes it difficult to quantify carbon emissions at each life cycle stage, particularly at the farm level wheredata are scarce. This study covers the full supply chain of Arabica coffee and is based on an extensive collation ofsecondary data gathered from peer ‐reviewed academic literature and online databases. The quality and quantity of dataavailable vary depending on which aspect of the LCA is being counted, and this is noted in the methods.For this study, the coffee supply chain is divided into four separate stages: growing, milling, the process of exportation,and processing (Figure 4a). In order to represent a broader view of carbon emissions across the coffee processing chain,the processing stage is further divided into six smaller stages (Figure 4b), with the information for these stages taken froma previous coffee LCA carried out by PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland (2008). The scope for this study was defined usingPAS 2050:2011, a carbon standard development recommended by the British Department for Environment, Food and RuralAffairs and the British Standards Institution (DEFRA and BSI, 2011).The calculated carbon footprint must be defined in terms of a functional unit to allow for inter ‐study comparisons(DEFRA and BSI, 2011). The functional unit defined for this study was 1 kg of green Arabica coffee beans, such that theresulting carbon footprint results are presented as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per 1 kg of green Arabica coffee(kg CO2ekg–1green Arabica coffee beans).The PAS 2050 method allows for the exclusion of some elements of the carbon footprint in order to simplify the evalua-tion, stipulating that at least 95% of the total emissions must be assessed. In this study, it is assumed that the land used forcoffee production at the selected study sites has been used for this purpose for at least 20 years, such that emissions fromland use change and carbon storage by shade trees can be excluded.FIGURE 4 Different stages of coffee processing with potential sources of carbon emissions (adapted from Killian et al., 2013).NAB ANDMASLIN |7o f1 9 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License6.1 |Life cycle inventoryA life cycle inventory was created, identifying the main inputs at the first three stages of coffee production; growing,milling, and exportation. The inputs required for the growing and milling stages were taken from LCAs carried out by DeMarco et al. (2018) and Arce et al. (2009), respectively (Table 1). These are generic data and therefore it was not possibleto differentiate differences between growing and milling in the two case study countries. The input units used for thesestages are average inputs required to produce 1 kg of green Arabica coffee beans on conventional and sustainable coffeefarms in a tropical environment. The coffee farm locations were placed at random points in Sao Paulo (Brazil) and BuônMa Thu ột (Vietnam), the biggest coffee producing regions in the countries (ICO, 2019). The nearest ports and internationalairports to these coffee farms were then identified using sea ‐distances.org (2019) and Google Maps (2019). The transportdistances from these ports to the Port of Bristol were then estimated using Google Maps (van distance, freight flight dis-tance) and sea ‐distances.org (cargo ship distance) for the exportation phase (Table 1).Based on emission hotspots identified by previous LCAs, the sustainable case studies varied from the conventional onesin three ways: the use of organic waste instead of artificial fertilisers, the lack of pesticides, and the exportation of coffeebeans to the United Kingdom via cargo ship rather than freight flight. Additionally, increased efficiency in the millingphase meant a reduction in water, electricity, and fossil fuel use in the sustainable case studies (Table 1).6.2 |Carbon footprint calculationThe carbon footprint quantification methodology was based on combined guidance from PAS 2050:2011 (DEFRA andBSI, 2011) and the IPCC ’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006). The footprint of each emissions factor wasdetermined using conversion factors provided by the UK Government and DEFRA. Country ‐specific conversion factors onelectricity and fossil fuels used for inputs based in Brazil and Vietnam to account for variation caused by the sources ofinputs (e.g., electricity). A spreadsheet model was created to calculate the carbon footprint, into which all the collected dataand emission factors were entered.6.2.1 |Step 1: calculating coffee productionTo start, the amount of coffee produced or processed at every stage was determined, by which the emissions at each stagecould be divided to determine the carbon footprint of a specific source of emissions for one functional unit. The informa-tion on coffee is presented as a function of 1 kg of green coffee beans.6.2.2 |Step 2: calculating carbon emissionsTo calculate the emissions of each source, its input value, presented in the life cycle inventory, was multiplied by its speci-fic emission factor. Different conversion factors were used to calculate these conversion factors: electricity and fossil fuelemissions were calculated using the national average electricity and fossil fuel emissions factors for Brazil and Vietnam,provided by DEFRA (2012). Emissions for water, firewood, and transportation were obtained from the UK Government,(2019). Fertiliser and pesticide emission factors provided by DEFRA (2012) were used.6.2.3 |Step 3: carbon footprint calculationThe emissions at each stage of coffee production were totalled and standardised in kg of CO 2e. These emissions were thendivided by the total amount of coffee produced or processed at each stage, resulting in the carbon footprint of each stageexpressed in kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee.The carbon footprint was calculated separately for each case study, resulting in four quantifications: conventional coffeefrom Brazil; conventional coffee from Vietnam; sustainable coffee from Brazil; and sustainable coffee from Vietnam. Thiswas done to allow for the comparison between conventional and sustainable coffee and between separate coffee growingregions, Latin America and Southeast Asia.After extensive evaluation of the available literature, the following data sources were chosen to complete the life cycleinventory:8o f1 9|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Whilst not as recent as De Marco (2018), this was chosen as itincluded the evaluation of primary data from multiple coffee farms.Though the literature is limited for coffee production, these sources were selected as they were deemed the most com-prehensive and provided clear data inputs for each stage of the coffee life cycle, for both conventional and sustainable Ara-bica coffee. These studies were based largely on primary data collected at coffee farms and mills, which were collated withresults from peer ‐reviewed academic literature to estimate inputs at each stage.The use of an LCA was appropriate as it quantifies carbon emissions released by each input of the product ’s life cycle,thus allowing for the accurate estimation of the carbon footprint of each phase of production. Additionally, the quantifica-tion of GHG emissions as a combined CO 2evalue was suitable as it factors in the climatic potential of each gas includedand allows for a comparison of the overall climatic impact of products that emit different GHGs.6.3 |Growing, milling, and exportation phasesThe carbon footprints estimated for conventional coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam were 11.56 and 12.99 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee, respectively, from farm level to a storage location in Bristol (Table 2, upper panel). The proportion ofthe carbon footprint contributed by each stage is similar for both countries, with the majority of the emissions coming fromthe freight flight transport between the producing countries and the United Kingdom (10.42 and 11.55 kg CO2ekg–1,respectively). This flight was calculated to contribute 98 –100% of emissions produced in the exportation phase and 90% oftotal emissions produced in the growing, milling, and exportation phases. In the growing phase, the use of fertilisers wasthe largest source of CO 2eemissions (95% and 92%), whilst in the milling phase fossil fuel use (77% and 45%) and elec-tricity use (16% and 51%) made the highest contributions.The carbon footprints estimated for sustainable coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam were much lower, totalling 0.32and 0.59 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee, respectively, for the growing, milling, and exportation phases (Table 2, lower panel).Whilst still the largest contributor, the exportation phase was responsible for 59% and 70% of total CO 2eemissions for Bra-zil and Vietnam, respectively, with the cargo ship transport from port to port contributing 67% and 50% of emissions in theexportation phase. The use of organic waste as fertiliser and lack of pesticide use made fossil fuel use (66% and 39%) andelectricity use (16% and 51%) the largest emission sources in the growing phase.

In total,the carbon footprint of conventional coffee production was 36 and 22 times higher than sustainable production in Braziland Vietnam, respectively.6.4 |Processing phaseAn LCA on coffee processing by PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland (2008) calculated a carbon footprint of 3.05 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee, with 70% of emissions associated with consumption, followed by grinding (10%), roasting (6%), distributionand disposal (5%), and packaging (4%).6.5 |Total carbon footprintBy combining all the stages including the processing phase (Figure 5), conventional coffee from Vietnam was calculated tohave the highest carbon footprint (16.04 kg CO2ekg–1green coffee) followed by conventional coffee from Brazil (14.61 kgCO 2ekg–1green coffee), though the primary difference between these two was the transportation distance. Sustainable cof-fee from Vietnam (3.64 kg CO 2ekg–1green) and sustainable coffee from Brazil (3.37 kg CO 2ekg–1green) were muchlower, and again the differences were due to different transport distances. For conventional coffee production, the exporta-tion process was calculated to produce over 70% of total CO 2eemissions in both case studies. The processing phase wasthe second largest source of emissions (19% –21%) followed by the growing (7%) and milling (1%) phases. In the case ofsustainable coffee, the processing phase was by far the largest source of CO 2eemissions, contributing 91% for Brazil and84% in Vietnam. Exportation was responsible for 6 –11% of total CO 2eemissions, followed by milling (2 –3%) and growing(1–2%). PAS 2050 classifies emissions exceeding 5 kg CO 2ekg–1as“very high intensity, ”whilst those between 0.1 and1.0 kg CO 2ekg–1are classed as “medium intensity ”(DEFRA and BSI, 2011). At over 10 kg CO 2ekg–1, both case studiesof conventional coffee production assessed would be classed as very high intensity, whilst those for sustainable coffee pro-duction are considered to be of medium intensity.With a drink containing approximately 18 g of green coffee (Starbucks Coffee Company, 2019), each kg of green coffeemakes approximately 56 espresso beverages. Thus, the carbon footprint found in the LCA is on average 0.28 and 0.06 kgCO 2eper espresso beverage for conventional and sustainable coffee, respectively (9.2 and 2.1 g CO 2eml–1). In an LCA ofFIGURE 5 The contribution of each phase to the total carbon footprint of coffee production (percentages may not add up due to rounding).12 of 19|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensemilk production, Hassard et al. (2014) estimated a carbon footprint of 2.26 g CO 2eml–1. Using these values, the carbonfootprint of standard coffee beverages was estimated: with the conventional production of coffee beans, the carbon foot-prints for one serving of caffe latte, flat white, and cappuccino were estimated to be 0.55, 0.34, and 0.41 kg CO 2e, respec-tively. When produced sustainably, these values were reduced to 0.33, 0.13, and 0.20 kg CO 2e. Whilst the carbon footprintof coffee production is four times higher than that of milk (per ml) for conventional production and equal to that of milkfor sustainable production, the larger proportion of milk than coffee used in these beverages resulted in a significantincrease in carbon footprint. For conventional coffee production, the carbon footprint increased by 25% (flat white), 50%(cappuccino), and 100% (caffe latte) in comparison to espresso (Figure 6). When produced sustainably, the large decreasein the carbon footprint of coffee meant that the difference was even larger, increasing by 205% (flat white), 315% (cappuc-cino), and 530% (caffe latte) in comparison to espresso (Figure 6).These estimations were higher than those made by Hassard et al. (2014), who calculated carbon footprints of 0.049 kg(espresso) and 0.224 g CO 2e(caffe latte) per serving. This is largely due to their use of Japan as the country of both pro-duction and consumption, omitting the exportation phase quantified in this study. Additionally, Hassard et al. ’s LCA ofmilk only included direct emissions created in the production phase, omitting indirect emissions such as methane producedby cows. An LCA by de Boer (2003) estimated that the emission of methane from cows adds an additional 48 –65% to theglobal warming potential of milk production, increasing its carbon footprint to 3.35 –3.73 g CO 2eml–1.7|DISCUSSION7.1 |Major contribution to coffee total carbon footprintWhen interpreting the LCA results, it is important to consider that the lack of real farm data regarding emissions means thatthe environmental impact calculated with an LCA may differ from the actual environmental impact (Thomassen et al.,2008). The LCA also does not provide any insight into the other environmental impacts of coffee production, includingdeforestation, biodiversity loss, water pollution, and eutrophication (reference).These case studies presented here demonstrate the importance of the exportation phase, with significant emissions withconventional coffee if international freight flights are used. Sustainable coffee production with no air transport, a large partof the emissions are in the processing phase. Previous LCAs placed the largest proportion of CO 2eemissions in the pro-cessing and production phases, with the exportation phase attributed to less than 5% of total CO 2eemissions. Whilst thecoffee farms investigated in these studies were largely similar to those studied in the conventional case studies, theyFIGURE 6 Comparison of the carbon footprint of different styles of coffee using conventional or sustainable coffee and diary milk or non ‐diary milk.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseincluded the international transport of coffee beans via cargo ship, explaining the small proportion of emissions attributedto the exportation phase.The sustainable case studies quantified in this study had an estimated 77% lower carbon footprint than the conventionalcase studies, mainly as a result of two sustainability measures. First, the use of cargo ships for the transportation of coffeebeans from the production countries to the United Kingdom instead of freight flights reduced estimated emissions by 10.3 –11.3 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee. Although transportation via cargo ship takes significantly longer, with transport timeincreasing from 12 hours to two weeks (24 times longer) for Brazil and 14 hours to three weeks (48 times longer) for Viet-nam (sea ‐distances.org, 2019), this method of transportation can export significantly larger shipments of coffee beans atonce. Second, the replacement of chemical fertilisers with organic waste in the sustainable case studies reduced estimatedemissions by 0.95 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee. An LCA of coffee production in Vietnam, based on interview data, foundthat most coffee farmers apply excess chemical fertilisers (on average 0.6 kg plant–1year–1) with the belief that this willincrease coffee yield linearly. In fact, a report from the Chumphon Horticultural Research Center (2011) calculated an opti-mal fertiliser application rate of 0.24 kg plant–1year–1. Their study found that any excess fertiliser could not be absorbedby the coffee plants, instead leaching into nearby surface water, resulting in nitrous oxide emission and water pollution.Based on this report, Ratchawat et al. (2018) estimated that the carbon footprint of coffee could be reduced by 12% if farm-ers followed this recommendation, saving them around £17/ha on the cost of chemical fertilisers.The lack of pesticide use in the production phase and reduced use of water and electricity in the milling phase furtherreduced the estimated carbon footprint of the sustainable case studies in comparison to the conventional ones, albeit at asignificantly smaller scale (<0.1 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee reduction each).7.2 |Further potential reductions of the carbon footprint of coffee production7.2.1 |Use of recycled materials and reduction of packaging amountThis reduces the demand for primary materials, thus reducing energy, water, and material consumption, air and water emis-sions in the production of packaging materials, and impacts on biodiversity from forestry and mining (von Geibler et al.,2016). An LCA by the Alliance for Environmental Innovation (2000) estimated carbon footprints of 0.52, 0.22, and0.18 kg CO2eper serving for paper, polystyrene, and ceramic cups, whilst Arena et al. (2003) estimated a carbon footprintreduction of up to 85% where recycled plastic was used to produce packaging in comparison to virgin plastic.7.2.2 |Increasing efficiency in water heatingIn the processing phase, an estimated 70% of CO 2emissions were attributed to consumption, largely due to the significantenergy use of automatic coffee machines (see PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland, 2008). This energy use could be reduced byusing more efficient water using technologies –although this is largely in the hands of the consumer –and the design ofmore efficient coffee machines. The addition of milk and/or sugar was not considered in this study.7.2.3 |Use of renewable energy sourcesThe use of fossil fuels for electricity and energy production releases significant air emissions during each phase of the cof-fee life cycle (von Geibler et al., 2016). An LCA by IRENA (2017) estimated that the use of renewable energy sources canreduce the carbon footprint of crop production by up to 70%. Based on the carbon footprints calculated in this study, theuse of renewable energy sources instead of fossil fossils could reduce the carbon footprint of coffee production by 0.11 kgCO2ekg–1green coffee (not including the processing phase).7.2.4 |Roasting the coffee beans in the producing countryCurrently, coffee is usually exported to the country of consumption before it is roasted, allowing retailers to market theircoffee as “freshly roasted. ”Whilst green coffee beans have a longer shelf life than roasted ones, roasted coffee beans canretain their fresh taste up to six months if stored at cool temperature (below 10°C) in air ‐tight laminated aluminium layer,one‐way valve and nitrogen flushed packaging (Josephy, Bush, Nipkow, & Pilone, 2013; Smrke, 2020). Roasting coffeebeans reduces their weight by more than half but the volume remains approximately the same. This makes a big differenceto air freight which is focused mainly on weight but less important for international shipping that is mainly concerned with14 of 19|NAB ANDMASLIN 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensevolume. Roasting the coffee beans before exporting them could reduce the carbon footprint in the exportation phase depen-dent on the method of exportation. This would also allow producer countries to move up the value chain and have associ-ated development advantages; this more than offset the downside of roasted and ground coffee being more perishable.In addition to making these sustainable changes to the coffee life cycle, coffee retailers could offset their entire carbonfootprint at a miniscule price of around £0.15 and £0.03 per kg of green coffee produced for conventional and sustainablecoffee production, respectively (£0.01 per kg CO 2e; Conservation International, 2019a), based on the carbon footprints cal-culated in this study. Carbon offsetting does, however, require due diligence to ensure “good quality ”offsets that will pro-duce the desired environmental benefits and should be seen as an additional environmental measure rather than a primarysolution.7.2.5 |Land use changeAlthough the amount and location of land used for coffee production has remained relatively stable over the past 20 years(Babin, 2014), one of the most frequently hypothesised but understudied results of the increasing demand for coffee is theswitch from coffee agroecosystems to monoculture systems with little ecological benefits. The carbon sequestration poten-tial of agroforestry systems is well documented, particularly for products such as coffee and cocoa, for which gross carbonsequestration has been estimated to outweigh GHG emissions throughout their lifetime (Fitriani, Zakaria, & Ismono, 2018).Whilst the intensification of existing agriculture allows for the avoidance of carbon emissions from land use change, inten-sive monoculture coffee plantations do not have this carbon sequestration potential. A carbon performance study in CostaRica and Nicaragua found that, whilst the highest yield and greatest profits were found in “full‐sun”coffee systems com-pletely lacking shade trees, these systems had the least potential for carbon sequestration (Noponen, 2012). To incentivisethe continued maintenance of existing coffee agroecosystems and compensate for the coffee production revenue lost, sus-tainability certification schemes such as Fair Trade have introduced a premium pricing scheme, which guarantees a higherretail price for coffee grown under Fair Trade standards (Babin, 2014). Noponen (2012) also found that, if maintenance ofless productive coffee agroecosystems results in the expansion of coffee production into areas of currently forested land tocompensate for the reduced yield, this land use change will release a mammoth 5,000 kg CO2eha–1year–1of GHG emis-sions. Thus, mechanisms that are based on reducing emissions by avoiding land ‐use change whilst intensifying productivityof agricultural systems, such as the UN ‐REDD programme, could play a major role in reducing pressure for forest conver-sion to agriculture and increasing agroforestry systems ’climate change mitigation success. Moreover, with the increasedrisk from raised temperature due to climate change (Bunn et al., 2015) more and more coffee production regions will haveto have shade species to protect the coffee plants (Wintgens, 2008), which will increase carbon sequestration and increaselocal biodiversity.7.2.6 |The processing phaseIn the sustainable coffee production case studies, more than 80% of the CO 2eemissions were produced in the processingphase. Of the 3.05 kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee estimated, 70% was attributed to the consumption of coffee. The source studyfound that a main emission driver is the preparation of coffee using an automatic coffee machine, which generates an esti-mated 60.27 g CO 2eper cup of coffee, in comparison to an estimated 10.04 g by traditional filter drip and French pressmethods, largely due to a six ‐fold increase in electricity use (PCF Pilotprojekt Deutschland, 2008). Consumers thereforeplay a critical role in reducing the carbon footprint of coffee production and should be encouraged to reduce their energyusage through consumer ‐focused awareness campaigns. To support this, manufacturers have made significant strides toincrease the energy efficiency of coffee machines in recent years. Measures such as auto ‐power ‐down, low or zero standbyconsumption, and better insulation of hot parts have been introduced to enhance energy efficiency. As of 2013, automatedcoffee machines had a market share of 23% in the EU, with an annual growth of 5.5% (Josephy et al., 2013). The extre-mely strong trend towards espresso portioned machines means that increasing energy efficiency is crucial to decreasing thecarbon footprint of coffee consumption. From 2013, coffee machines sold in the EU must have a power management func-tion that automatically switches the machines to a standby or off mode after the shortest possible time period of intendeduse (Josephy et al., 2013). The introduction of an energy label would be very effective in helping buyers recognise the mostefficient machines on the market. As retailers strive towards offering products of best label classes, an energy label wouldincentivise the coffee industry to develop more energy efficient coffee machines. When producing this label, the energyand resource consumption associated with the production of coffee capsules and pads should be taken into account.NAB ANDMASLIN |15 of 19 20544049, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/geo2.96 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License7.3 |Comparison of coffee to other agricultural productsAverage carbon footprints of conventional and sustainable coffee production in this study are 15.33 (±0.72) and 3.51(±0.13) kg CO 2ekg–1green coffee. In comparison to other highly traded agricultural products, the carbon footprint of cof-fee is relatively high, with animal products and highly processed products often having the highest carbon footprints:Beef = 27 kg CO 2ekg–1(Wiedemann et al., 2015); cheese = 13.5 kg CO 2ekg–1(Canellada et al., 2018); tea = 7.1 kgCO 2ekg–1(Cichorowski et al., 2015); bananas = 1.28 kg CO 2ekg–1(Roibás et al., 2016); wine = 1.72 kg CO 2eL–1(Pat-tara et al., 2012); sugar = 0.55 kg CO 2ekg–1(Yuttitham et al., 2011). The high quantity of coffee produced yearly meansthat the coffee sector has a significant total carbon footprint. Based on the results, coffee production can be attributed to atotal of 33.3 –125.6 billion kg of global annual CO2eemissions. This is comparable to the total annual CO 2emissions ofDenmark (33.9 billion kg) and the Philippines (137.2 billion kg), as calculated by the European Commission (2017). Incomparison, global tea production can be attributed to roughly 36.9 billion kg (Cichorowski et al., 2015), when exportedvia cargo ship, similarly to sustainable coffee production. The lack of nutritional value of both coffee and tea means thatthey can be considered luxury products, sometimes called “drug foods, ”as they are unnecessary for human survival, mak-ing their large carbon footprints arguably much worse than those of products with high nutritional values.8|CONCLUSIONSOur coffee carbon footprint analysis shows there is a significant difference between sustainable and conventional coffee.This is largely due to the exportation of coffee beans via cargo ship rather than freight flight and the reduction of agro-chemical inputs. This footprint could be further reduced by more efficient use of packaging materials, increased efficiencyin water heating, use of renewable energy sources, roasting beans before exportation, and carbon offsetting. With growingcompetition and global coffee demand, retailers are increasingly transporting coffee beans via freight flight to get freshercoffee. This makes it unlikely that they will switch back to cargo ship transport, despite the large climate change mitigationpotential, exposing the need for a tax on aviation fuel and/or a tax on flying luxury goods such as coffee and tea.Despite the widespread agreement that sustainable production practices are better for the environment, our sustainable casestudy carbon footprint was only 24% lower than that of the conventional case studies (excluding the exportation phase). Thereare also concerns that by focusing on the carbon footprint of production, other environmental impacts are being missed. Hence,sustainability certification schemes must be holistic in their approach and avoid the obsession with just carbon emissions. Care-fully thought out and financed certification schemes could reduce the environmental impact of coffee by educating farmers onoptimal fertiliser and pesticide inputs, soil fertility conservation and water conservation, whilst maintaining high yields andreducing production costs, increasing the profitability of coffee while reducing carbon emissions (ITC, 2011).Coffee cultivation faces an uncertain future, with climate change predictions suggesting a 50% reduction in the suitablegrowing area by 2050 (Bunn et al., 2015) at the same time as a tripling of demand. One adaptation is to ensure there areshade species to reduce the maximum temperature and damage to the coffee plants (Wintgens, 2008). Some certificationschemes do include climate change adaptation measures, such as paying a premium for agroforestry system cultivated cof-fee as opposed to intensive monoculture coffee plantations (Noponen, 2012). This needs to be expanded to all certificationschemes and imbedded in international agreements such as REDD + and the Bonn Accord to protect the environment andthe livelihoods of coffee producers.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors would like to thank the reviewers and the editors for all their hlepful and supportive comments.
