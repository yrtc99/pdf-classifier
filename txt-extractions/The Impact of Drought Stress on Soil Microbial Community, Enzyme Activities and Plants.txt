Droughtis one of the important, alarming, and hazardous abiotic stresses responsible for the alterations in soilenvironment affecting soil organisms, including microorganisms and plants. It alters the activity andfunctional composition of soil microorganisms that are responsible for crucial ecosystem functionsand services. These stress conditions decrease microbial abundance, disturb microbial structure,decline microbial activity, including enzyme production (e.g., such as oxidoreductases, hydrolases,dehydrogenase, catalase, urease, phosphatases, -glucosidase) and nutrient cycling, leading to adecrease in soil fertility followed by lower plant productivity and loss in economy. Interestingly,the negative effects of drought on soil can be minimized by adding organic substances such ascompost, sewage slugs, or municipal solid waste that increases the activity of soil enzymes. Droughtdirectly affects plant morphology, anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. Its effect on plants canalso be observed by changes at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. However, in plants,it can be mitigated by rhizosphere microbial communities, especially by plant growth-promotingbacteria (PGPB) and fungi (PGPF) that adapt their structural and functional compositions to waterscarcity. This review was undertaken to discuss the impacts of drought stress on soil microbialcommunity abundance, structure and activity, and plant growth and development, including the roleof soil microorganisms in this process. Microbial activity in the soil environment was considered interms of soil enzyme activities, pools, Ô¨Çuxes, and processes of terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen(N) cycles. A deep understanding of many aspects is necessary to explore the impacts of theseextreme climate change events. We also focus on addressing the possible ways such as genomeediting, molecular analysis (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) towards Ô¨Åndingbetter solutions for mitigating drought effects and managing agricultural practices under harshcondition in a proÔ¨Åtable manner.Keywords: climate change; water scarcity; soil microbiome; microbial activity; plant growthand development1. IntroductionAn increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4),and nitrous oxide (N 2O), and atmospheric temperature, and depletion of water resources,being a consequence of anthropogenic activities, have driven climate change [ 1‚Äì5]. Oneof the important consequences of climate alteration is the occurrence of drought stressconditions. Drought stress in soil occurs when the water content or humidity in the soil andair is signiÔ¨Åcantly low along with the high atmospheric temperature. This happens due toan uneven balance between the soil surface evaporation and plant transpiration followedby low soil water content [ 1]. Khan et al. [ 6] monitored global drought for almost twodecades (2001‚Äì2019) using big geospatial datasets from Google Earth Engine and calculateddrought indices, namely vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition indexAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010189 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomyAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 2 of 26(TCI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI), and precipitation condition index (PCI). Theseindices showed continuous Ô¨Çuctuation of soil moisture and severe vegetation drought thataffected 70% of the land globally. To date, many countries, including the USA, Australia,France, Russia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Mongolia, China, Brazil, Thailand, and Africa,have had historic events on the negative impact of drought, mainly on the agricultureand economy sector [ 6‚Äì10]. According to ICCP [ 2], each of the last four decades hasbeen successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global surfacetemperatures were higher by 0.99 and 1.09C in 2001‚Äì2020 and 2011‚Äì2020, respectively,than in 1850‚Äì1900, with larger increases over land (1.59C) than over the ocean (0.88C).In Europe, according to European Environment Agency (EEA; https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/global-and-european-temperatures; 29 December 2021), land temperatures haveincreased even faster over the same period by around 1.9‚Äì2.02C [11,12] compared to theaverage values. Moreover, climate change scenarios predict a further decrease in averageprecipitation from May to October [ 12]. These trends show that the risk of soil drought inthe vegetation growing season is high and may negatively affect crop yields. In Poland,a serious threat of agricultural drought was reported in the last few years, namely in 2010,2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018 [13].Drought is deÔ¨Åned as a state of the total water capacity being within the range of12‚Äì20% for a period of 16 days and can be distinguished from the water deÔ¨Åcit, which isthe state of water capacity falling below 30% [14‚Äì17].Drought is one of the most prevalent stresses that impact microbial community andactivity , crop development, yield production, and quality [ 5,12]. A negative impact of droughton soil microbes can lead to a decrease in enzymes activity , loss in nutrient cycling (e.g.,C, N, P), and soil fertility , thus plant productivity , especially of drought susceptible crops,and consequently economic outcomes [ 5,18]. The condition of the soil under drought stressstrictly corresponds to plant growth and development. Drought directly affects plant mor-phology , physiology, and biochemistry [ 19]. It also reduces seed germination and seedlinggrowth [ 20]. Plant responses to drought stress were also observed at transcriptomic andmetabolomic levels [ 21]. Severe and long-term drought stress disturbs the availability of soilmicrobiota to the plant roots, significantly affecting their microbiome composition leadingto modification of root structure and release of root exudates and disturbance of useful nu-trients. The microbiome of plant roots changes during drought, favoring Actinobacteria andmany other Gram-positive species, which substitute the Gram-negative taxa that are predom-inantly present in the rhizosphere [ 22]. Generally , soil microorganisms can enhance plantresistance to drought via different mechanisms, including the production of polysaccharidesthat improve soil structure and water holding capacity , synthesis of deaminase, indoleaceticacid (IAA), and proline (Pro), which induce drought stress tolerance in plants and improvedwater circulation through fungal mycelia [ 23]. Interestingly , the negative effect of drought onmicroorganisms can be mitigated by the addition of organic matter to soil [ 24]. Moreover,microbial activity (respiration rates) and soil microbial community structure can be modifiedby drought-associated phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), but adaptation to prolonged drought modifiesthe responses of soil microbial communities to these hormones [25].Despite negative aspects of changes caused by drought, such severe environmentalconditions can induce interesting adaptations in microbes and plants that allow them tosurvive and reproduce. These adaptations can lead to the emergence of new functionalgroups in the ecosystem or serve as an important tool for improving agricultural practicesand plant breeding programs [ 4,25]. Such drought-tolerant microorganisms and their traitscould be used in the search for efÔ¨Åcient compounds of biopreparations supporting plantgrowth [19].This review was undertaken to discuss the impact of drought stress on soil microbialcommunity abundance, structure, and activities, thus soil enzyme activities, pools, Ô¨Çuxes,and processes of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles, and plant growth and development,Agronomy 2022 ,12, 189 3 of 26including the role of soil microorganisms in this process. A deep understanding of manyaspects is necessary to explore the impacts of these extreme climate change events.2. Impact of Drought Stress on Microbial Communities and Enzyme ActivitiesProlonged drought has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the abundance, structure, and activityof the soil microbiome [ 12]. The potential metabolic microbial activity decreases with areduction in soil water potential, followed by lowering nutrient mineralization and respi-ration [ 26]. However, structural and/or functional adaptation of microbial communitiesin response to drought depends on soil type, farming system, and plant cultivars [ 22],as discussed later.In this section effect of drought in soils on microbial structure and enzyme activity,and consequently on nutrient cycling and soil fertility, is discussed (Figure 1).Agronomy 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 26   development, including the role of soil microorganisms in this process. A deep understanding of many aspects is necessar y to explore the impacts of these extreme climate change events. 2. Impact of Drought Stress on Microbial Communities and Enzyme Activities Prolonged drought has a significant impact on  the abundance, structure, and activity of the soil microbiome [12]. The potential me tabolic microbial activity decreases with a reduction in soil water potential, followed by lowering nutrient mineralization and respiration [26]. However, structural and/or functional adaptation of microbial communities in response to drought depends on soil type, farming system, and plant cultivars [22], as discussed later.  In this section effect of drought in soils on microbial structure and enzyme activity, and consequently on nutrient cycling and soil fertility, is discussed (Figure 1).   Figure 1. Schematic representation on  the impact of drought stress on microbial communities and activities. 2.1. Effect of Drought on Microbial Communities 2.1.1. Microbial Adaptations to Drought Stress It is known that thick peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is responsible for their higher resistance towards drought when compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Microbes either die or beco me dormant during immediate stressful environments, whereas on the arrival of favo rable conditions, the dormant forms regain their activity. In addition, dead microbial cells release many valuable compounds such as nitrogen, phosphates, amino acids, polyols, nutrients that can be beneficial to other microbes and plants. These microorg anisms that form spores (e.g., Bacillus  sp., myxobacteria, filamentous actinobacteria, or fungi) are resistant to abiotic factors, including drought stress, and able to survive for a long time in dormant forms. However, microbes might develop many tolerance mech anisms, some of which are energetically expensive, such as these related to the regulation of resistance  genes, alteration of carbon Figure 1. Schematic representation on the impact of drought stress on microbial communitiesand activities.2.1. Effect of Drought on Microbial Communities2.1.1. Microbial Adaptations to Drought StressIt is known that thick peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria isresponsible for their higher resistance towards drought when compared to Gram-negativebacteria. Microbes either die or become dormant during immediate stressful environments,whereas on the arrival of favorable conditions, the dormant forms regain their activity.In addition, dead microbial cells release many valuable compounds such as nitrogen,phosphates, amino acids, polyols, nutrients that can be beneÔ¨Åcial to other microbes andplants. These microorganisms that form spores (e.g., Bacillus sp., myxobacteria, Ô¨Ålamentousactinobacteria, or fungi) are resistant to abiotic factors, including drought stress, and ableto survive for a long time in dormant forms. However, microbes might develop manytolerance mechanisms, some of which are energetically expensive, such as these related tothe regulation of resistance genes, alteration of carbon and nitrogen Ô¨Çow, synthesis of stableproteins and osmolytes, which reduce loss of water or balance the available water [27,28].Desiccation-tolerant microorganisms, e.g., Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 [ 29],Microbacteriumsp. 3J1, Arthrobacter siccitolerans 4J27, Rhodococcus sp. 4J2A2 [ 30],Rhodococcus opacusAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 4 of 26PD630 [ 31],Lactobacillus paracasei [32], and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 [ 33] are known tooverproduce various molecules such as non-reducing sugars (trehalose), organic acids,polyols, amino acids, (rich in hydroxyl groups), pyrimidine derivatives such as ectoineand hydroxyectoine [ 30,33‚Äì38] responsible for the protection of cells from drought stressthat are called xeroprotectants. These molecules can also be taken up by non-synthesizingmicroorganisms in drought conditions [ 39,40]. A study by Garc √≠a-Fontana et al. [ 41] ondesiccation-tolerant microorganisms of Microbacterium sp. 3J1 showed overexpression ofgenes encoding for enzymes involved in DNA syntheses such as topoisomerases, DNApolymerases, and gyrases. This resulted in an increase in DNA production in cells as partof their defensive mechanisms to protect protein structures and functions from drying,conÔ¨Årmed by RNA-seq analysis. In addition, siderophores, secondary metabolites thatscavenge iron from environmental stocks and deliver it to cells via speciÔ¨Åc receptors, arebelieved to help bacteria to thrive in such environments [ 42]. It was proved that siderophoreproducing Azospirillum sp. strain B2 was most resistant to drought stress and used as aninoculant for wheat can alleviate drought stress on plant growth and yield [42].2.1.2. Effect of Drought Stress on Microbial Community in Different Type of Soils or underSoil ModiÔ¨ÅcationsSevere drought conditions modify the microbial community structure, size, and ac-tivity in soils. However, their effect on the microbial structure is more signiÔ¨Åcant in soilswith low organic matter content [ 12,43]. For example, controlled conditions of droughtstress-induced changes in the relative abundances of particular phyla present in sandyand loamy soils. Among six phyla, namely Actinobacteria ,Bacteroidetes ,Firmicutes, Plancto-mycetes ,Protecobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia that accounted for >95% of the total bacterialabundance, theActinobacteria (especially genera Gaiella and Nocarioides ) were most preva-lent in analyzed samples. While relative abundance of Proteobacteria , being corticotrophs,and Verrucomicrobia decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly [ 12]. Baldrian et al. [ 44], based on phospho-lipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses, recorded that with the decrease in soil moisture content,the microbial (bacterial and fungal biomass) also decreased. In contrast, Bastida et al. [ 45]showed that drought inÔ¨Çuenced the fungal PLFA biomarker but not the bacterial PLFAbiomarkers. Interestingly, in other studies on drought impact, a higher abundance of Firmi-cutes in soil that has previously been exposed to such stress conditions was observed [ 46].This indicates that soils under repetitive drought events exhibit lower stress mortality.This can be a consequence of microbial adaptation that has been developed.Castro et al. [ 47] reported that drought-induced reductions in labile carbon and ni-trogen entering the rhizosphere might be a contributing factor in the loss of microbialphyla such as Verrucomicrobia ,Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria , which are heterotrophs andsensitive to nitrogen ratios. It has been well-documented that exogenous organic matter inthe form of sludge or compost amendments plays an important role in protecting soil mi-crobial community and microbially-mediated processes in semiarid or arid soils [ 43]. Theyrecorded that the total and Gram-positive bacteria and total monounsaturated PLFA wereaffected signiÔ¨Åcantly by drought only in the unamended soil. The alterations in bacterialcommunity composition under drought stress were also observed in two types of wheatrhizosphere soils (Chernozem and Luvisoil) [ 22]. The Luvisol soil showed a decrease inGram-negative bacteria and persistence of actinomycetes under drought conditions. How-ever, at the same time, actinobacteria diversity was lower in Luvisol than in Chernozem soil.Therefore, in the case of Luvisol soil, which is less rich in organic matter content, the effectof drought was more prominent [ 22]. It is another proof that the application of organicresidues can be proposed as an adequate strategy against soil degradation in semiaridenvironments. However, the interactions between organic amendments and drought arenot fully known [12,43,45].Furthermore, microbial community structure and microbial activity (respiration rates)in soil under drought stress can be modiÔ¨Åed by drought-associated phytohormones (ABA,JA, and ACC) [ 25]. However, the authors demonstrated the adaptation of soil microbialAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 5 of 26communities to the long-term drought that was observed by their response to plant stresshormones. All three phytohormones signiÔ¨Åcantly declined Gram-positive biomarkers indrought soils. That is interesting, as these bacteria are generally assumed to be more stress-tolerant than Gram-negative bacteria [ 48]. Overall, the adaptation of microbial community-level to drought stress often involves shifts towards organisms with greater tolerance towater deÔ¨Åcit and slow-growing taxa with a reduced metabolic capacity [ 12,25,49]. Authorsspeculated that the decrease in Gram-positive biomarker abundance after treatment withall three phytohormones indicates drought-adapted bacteria that responded negatively tostress signaling by investing resources in survival strategies such as dormancy, osmolytes,or spore production instead of growth and turnover. Further, they claimed that drought-adapted soil microbial communities might perceive these phytohormones as signals ofimpending water stress rather than as a substrate for growth [ 25]. Moreover, they foundthat the abundance of Gram-negative biomarkers remained unchanged in droughted soilsbut increased with ABA, ACC, and JA addition to control soils. Therefore, the Gram-positive:Gram-negative bacteria ratio increased in drought stress. Furthermore, they alsofound that in response to all phytohormones, the relative abundance of saprophytic fungaland arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) biomarkers increased in droughted soils [25].Drought stress is known to hamper the availability of soil microbiota to the plantsand signiÔ¨Åcantly affect root microbiome composition. The differences in the abundanceof root-associated microbial communities at endosphere and rhizosphere levels duringmonsoon and dry seasons were reported by Naylor et al. [ 50]. They found that fungalcommunities in soils and rhizosphere were unaffected, whereas the class Actinobacteriadecreased signiÔ¨Åcantly in -diversity in roots with also a decline in Acidobacteria andDeltaproteobacteria . On the other hand, they also noticed an increase in enrichment ofActinobacteria (Saccharopolyspora, Glycomyces, and Actinopolymorpha ) under drought in theroot endosphere than in rhizosphere or bulk soil itself.2.2. Effect of Drought on Soil Enzyme ActivitiesSoil enzymes are produced by animals [ 51], plants [ 52], and microorganisms. Theyare prominently secreted by microbes and reÔ¨Çect microbial activity in this biome [ 53]. Soilmicroorganisms mainly synthesize extracellular enzymes such as -glucosidase, hydrolasesurease, phosphatase, glycosylating enzymes, cellulase, amylase, cyclomaltodextrinase,chitinase, and many more [ 43,54‚Äì56]. Other enzymes such as dehydrogenases or catalaseare intracellular. Therefore, soil enzymes play a vital role in the biodegradation of organiccompounds in soil and become the most delicate indicator of changes in microbial activities(termed as ‚Äúsensors‚Äù) that occur in the soil environment in response to different factorsincluding drought [43,57].The reports on the effect of drought on different soil enzymes are limited. Generally,these effects are uncertain or not easy to predict [ 58]. However, a decrease of moisturecontent in soils decreases microbial biomass and thus soil enzyme activities [ 44,59,60].Baldrian et al. [ 44] observed seasonal changes in the activity of enzymes and the abun-dance of microorganisms correlated with the water content in the soil. The signiÔ¨Åcantdecrease in soil microbial communities and reduction of >50% activity of laccase, Mn-peroxidase, endo-1,4- -glucanase, endo-1,4- -xylanase, cellobiohydrolase, -glucosidase,-xylosidase, chitinase, and acid phosphatase enzymes were recorded in soils with lowwater content (0.30‚Äì0.40 g g 1) when compared to control samples with higher watercontent (0.60‚Äì0.70 g g 1). In other studies, it was found that drought-affected activity ofC-cycling enzymes (cellulases, glucosidases, and xylosidases) in the rhizosphere of twowheat cultivars in loamy Chernozem and sandy Luvisol soils in organic and conventionalfarming. For ‚ÄòDichter‚Äô wheat cultivar, enzymatic activities were decreased in Chernozemsoil in both farming types. While in Luvisoil, increased activity of glucosidases and xy-losidases was recorded in organic farming. In the case of ‚ÄòRGT-Reform‚Äô wheat cultivar,drought negatively affected xylosidase and glucosidase activities in the Chernozem soil butpromoted glucosidase activities in Luvisol [22]. Drought impact on sediment revealed de-Agronomy 2022 ,12, 189 6 of 26crease in esterase (0.5%/day) [ 61],-glucosidase (>50%) [ 62], leucine aminopeptidase [ 63],phosphatase (>50%) [ 64], and phenol oxidase (PO) [ 63] activities. In the case of Mediter-ranean evergreen oak forests, a reduction of 10 and 21% of soil moisture in plots (by waterrunoff) decreased urease activity by 10‚Äì67% and 42‚Äì60%, protease activity by 15‚Äì66% and35‚Äì45%, and -glucosidase activity by 10‚Äì80% and 35‚Äì83% depending on the annual period(spring and autumn) and soil depth (0‚Äì15 and 15‚Äì30 cm). The lowest activities of theseenzymes were observed in autumn and at a greater depth. The signiÔ¨Åcant reduction of acidphosphatase activity (by 31‚Äì40%) was observed only when the moisture content in the soilwas reduced by 21%. The phenolooxidases (laccases, Mn-peroxidases, lignin-peroxidases,and tyrosinases) activities in evergreen oak forests were studied by Cricquet et al. [ 65].They observed a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities in autumnwhen compared to other months, while other phenoloxidases, lignin-peroxidases, andtyrosinases were never detected in analyzed samples. However, in this study, analyzedforest plots were not artiÔ¨Åcially dried by water runoff [ 65]. Similarly, in other studiesby Criqet et al., acid phosphatase activities were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher from November toJanuary and decreased in other months [ 66]. These highest activities (>610 2U g 1DM)correlated with high soil moisture content (around 65‚Äì70%). The lowest enzyme activities(1.210 2U g 1DM) were recorded in July, when soil moisture content was found to benearly 15%. The alkaline phosphatase was undetectable or at low activity when comparedwith acid phosphatase activities but highest between May and October. A signiÔ¨Åcantdecrease in enzymatic activity of dehydrogenases and phosphatases in both loamy andsandy soils was observed during the Ô¨Årst month under drought stress, while after twomonths of stress conditions, activity of dehydrogenases was even three times less whencompared to the control sample under the optimal moisture level [ 12]. However, the levelof dehydrogenase activity was considerably higher in the loamy soil than in sandy soil,which can be related to higher organic matter content in the former one [ 12,67], but theaspect of the presence of organic residues on microbial abundance and activity in soil willbe discussed later in this section.Moreover, relatively high soil exoenzyme ( -glucosidase, -xylosidase, -glucosidase(AG), -D-cellobiosidase (CBH), N-acetyl- -glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, leucineamino peptidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase (PER)) activities were observed duringsummer girdling of lodgepole pine (that was complete removal of the bark from aroundthe trunk of a tree) but decreased after girdling in response to drought [68].2.3. Effect of Drought on Microbial ActivitySevere drought conditions, despite enzyme activities, may compromise nutrient avail-ability in the soil, as proved in the study by Hueso et al. [ 43]. They found high soildehydrogenase activity (34% of the total variability), a decrease of other enzyme activity,high basal respiration, and water-soluble carbon in stressed soil compared to well-wateredsoils. Increased levels of water-soluble carbon may be linked to an increase in carbohydrateproduction (52% of the total variability) due to the fact that few soil microbes producebiological polymers in response to low water conditions. Perhaps, drought can cause thedeath of sensitive microorganisms unable to thrive under such harsh conditions, whichresults in the release of substrates from dead cells into their surroundings, in turn providingaccessible nutrients to the drought-resistant microorganisms or survivors. In addition,decreased metabolic activity of the soil microbial community was also observed underdrought conditions, in turn leading to a decrease in mineralization of carbon, nitrogen, andphosphorus biological cycles or pathways [ 43]. This suggests that a large community ofactive microbial biomass did not survive during long drought stress periods, resulting inthe decline of overall soil microbial functional diversity [12,18,69].Drought strongly affects soil nitrogen cycling by inhibiting nitriÔ¨Åcation [ 12]. The soilnitriÔ¨Åcation potential (NP) is a highly sensitive parameter, which reÔ¨Çects the response ofsoil microorganisms to environmental factors, e.g., temperature or moisture content [ 70].It describes the potential activity of a specialized group of autotrophic bacteria, namelyAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 7 of 26ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (mainly genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira ) that are respon-sible for the Ô¨Årst phase of nitriÔ¨Åcation [ 71]. Siebielec et al. [ 12] showed that after one monthdrought period, the NP activity was reduced by 70 and 80% in the loamy and sandy soils,respectively. These results indicate that the resistance of sandy soil with low organic mattercontent to drought stress was lower than that in loamy soil. Interestingly, the compostapplication to the sandy soils only slightly reduced the negative effects of drought on soilnitrifying bacteria [12].Deng et al. [ 72] investigated soil C and N pools and Ô¨Çuxes in response to droughtin three different ecosystems, namely forests, grasslands, and shrublands, conductingmeta-data analyses, wherein a huge amount of data was collected. These data were takenfrom 148 reports and included 1815 sampling data at 134 sites across the globe and weremainly focused on short-term drought. They analyzed vegetation-related properties, soilpools of C and N and their Ô¨Çuxes, soil microbial biomass, and activity of enzymes (Table 1).Overall, the effects of drought on soil C and N cycles were regulated by the ecosystem type,drought duration, and intensity. The latter two parameters intensiÔ¨Åed all effects. The soilorganic carbon (SOC) concentration was decreased across the globe as a consequence of de-creased litter input and decomposition under drought conditions. Drought also negativelyaffected root biomass. Microbial respiration (microbial CO 2) was increased, especially inforests and grasslands. Moreover, drought increased the contents of dissolved organiccarbon (DOC) by 59% and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) by 33% due to decreasedmineralization and higher stability of dissolved organic matter. Although the soil mineralnitrogen (SMN) content increased (by 31%), the nitrogen mineralization and nitriÔ¨Åcationrates decreased (by 5.7 and 13.8%, respectively), thus total nitrogen concentration un-changed. Globally, NH 4+and NO 3 increased (52 and 16%, respectively), but in forestsoils, an increase of NH 4+concentrations corresponded to an 11.3% decrease of NO 3 ,thus reÔ¨Çected the increase of N mineralization rate, but a decrease of nitriÔ¨Åcation rate. Inshrublands, unlike forest soils, the concentration of NH 4+slightly increased, but NO 3 increased signiÔ¨Åcantly (69.2%). Since nitrogen mineralization rate was unaffected, but nitri-Ô¨Åcation rate strongly decreased (by 56.4%), this might be a consequence of less N uptakeby plants under drought. Drought negatively affected microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN)content. Thus, the ratio of microbial biomass carbon MBC to MBN increased, similarly tofungal/bacterial ratio and enzyme activities across the globe (Table 1).Table 1.

Mitigation of Drought Effects on Microbial Activity by Soil AmendmentsThe negative effect of drought in the soil can be minimized by adding organic substances.The addition of different types of organic matter, namely compost (COM), sewage sludge (SS),and municipal solid waste (MSW) to the arid soil increased the activity of soil enzymes suchas oxidoreductases, hydrolases, dehydrogenase, catalase, urease, phosphatases, -glucosidase,casein- and N- -benzoyl-L-argininamide (BAA)-hydrolyzing proteases [ 24], probably as aconsequence of the increase in microbial biomass [43], as mentioned previously .Moreover, microbial activity (soil respiration) in drought soils can be modiÔ¨Åed by theaddition of plant hormones, namely ABA, JA, and ACC. However, soil respiration responseto phytohormones depended on their dose. For example, the addition of 1 mM ABA twotimes increased microbial activity in droughted soil when compared to control soil, butlower ABA concentrations, namely 1 M and 1 nM, did not affect the respiration rate ofsoil samples. Interestingly, both ACC and JA in low and high concentrations increasedmicrobial activity but not in intermediate concentrations. Respiration from droughted soilswas 1.5 times higher than from the control samples treated with ACC. In the case of JA, thelowest concentration of JA (1 nM) had the largest effect on respiration in droughted andcontrol soils [ 25]. Authors suggested that increased respiration rates in soils in responseto phytohormones could be a result of hormone utilization as sources of C and N by bulksoil microorganisms. However, such a relationship was conÔ¨Årmed only in the case of ABAaddition [25]. Therefore, further studies are required.3. Plant Morphological, Physiological, Biochemical Responses towards Drought StressIn general, plants are exposed to numerous environmental stresses in the course oftheir different stages of growth irrespective of the natural or agricultural environment [ 73].The occurrence of environmental alterations has developed various adaptations in plantsfor their survival in harsh conditions [ 1]. Common prominent environmental stress suchas drought caused due to dwindling of water resources is the main foundation in af-fecting overall plant productivity [ 73]. The plant responds to drought stress at differentlevels‚Äîmorphological, anatomical, biochemical, physiological, and molecular [ 73‚Äì76](Figure 2).Agronomy 2022 ,12, 189 9 of 26Agronomy 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 26   levels‚Äîmorphological, anatomical, biochemical, physiological, and molecular [73‚Äì76] (Figure 2).   Figure 2. Morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of plants to drought stress.  3.1. Morphological and Anatomical Changes in Plants in Response to Drought Stress Drought might affect plants at each stag e in their growth cycle, including seed germination. Water scarcity or drought reduces germination rate leading to reduction of seedling emergence or inhibition and furt her growth in plants [20]. Drought stress disturbs the seedling growth because of cell  expansion inhibition, decrease in carbon acclimatization, and partitioning [77]. The decrease in plant height is mainly due to decreased cell expansion, increased leaf sh edding, and impaired mitosis under drought conditions [78]. Reduction in seedling characte ristics in drought-stressed plant seeds such as Brassica napus  was reported by many authors [79‚Äì8 1]. Morphological changes in plant under drought stress involve reduced size, ar e a ,  a n d  n u m b e r  o f  l e a v e s  a s  w e l l  a s  t h e  growth of root and shoot length due to stim ulation of the ABA precursor called ACC that prevents the growth of root, with early matu rity, high growth in the root system, low number of stomata, more thick leaves with an increase in rolling and folding and wax Figure 2. Morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of plantsto drought stress.3.1. Morphological and Anatomical Changes in Plants in Response to Drought StressDrought might affect plants at each stage in their growth cycle, including seed germi-nation. Water scarcity or drought reduces germination rate leading to reduction of seedlingemergence or inhibition and further growth in plants [ 20]. Drought stress disturbs theseedling growth because of cell expansion inhibition, decrease in carbon acclimatization,and partitioning [ 77]. The decrease in plant height is mainly due to decreased cell ex-pansion, increased leaf shedding, and impaired mitosis under drought conditions [ 78].Reduction in seedling characteristics in drought-stressed plant seeds such as Brassica napuswas reported by many authors [ 79‚Äì81]. Morphological changes in plant under droughtstress involve reduced size, area, and number of leaves as well as the growth of root andshoot length due to stimulation of the ABA precursor called ACC that prevents the growthof root, with early maturity, high growth in the root system, low number of stomata, morethick leaves with an increase in rolling and folding and wax formation in order to preventloss of water from leaves as well as from roots [ 1,25,73]. In addition, plant leaves tend toincrease mesophyll palisade tissue, decrease spongy tissue, increase the number of celllayers, but decrease the volume and shorten the intercellular space to adopt drought, asAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 10 of 26found in two avocado cultivars [ 82]. Overall, the change of leaf area, which directly affectsplant photosynthesis and yield, is one of the most easily observed features of plant leavesunder drought stress [ 78]. Plants under drought stress have reduced the number of Ô¨Çowersand fresh and dry biomass [ 19]. Drought stress causes a decrease in nodulation [ 83] andnodule functioning [ 75]. In plants, the water deÔ¨Åcit conditions are recognized in roots,and then several molecular signals move from roots to shoots. Consequently, abscisic acid(ABA) phytohormone mediates resistance to drought stress by regulating stomatal closureand synthesizing stress-responsive gene expression in leaves, thereby affecting reductionin transpiration [84‚Äì87].3.2. Physiological and Biochemical Changes in Plants in Response to Drought StressPhotosynthesis, as mentioned above, is one of the main processes affected by waterstress leading to a decrease in plant growth. The decrease of photosynthetic rate un-der drought stress is the result of stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. The stomatallimitation is believed to be the main factor of photosynthetic rate decrease under milddrought while non-stomatal limitation under severe drought conditions. Stomatal clo-sure limits leaf absorption of CO 2and prevents transpiration water loss due to turgorpressure and/or reduced water potential [ 78]. Non-stomatal factors are related to thedecrease of activity or content of component, such as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)or ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) involved in the photosyn-thetic assimilation process and the efÔ¨Åciency of photosystem II (FPSII), respectively [ 88,89].Biochemical changes include the decline in chlorophyll levels, increase in Pro content,destruction of oxidative processes by the production of antioxidative enzymes, increase inABA levels, and synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 73]. Drought stress inhibits thechlorophyll synthesis (chlorophyll ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô), changes in chlorophyll ‚Äòa‚Äô/‚Äôb‚Äô ratio, especiallyin drought-sensitive plant cultivars, thereby the efÔ¨Åciency of photosynthetic apparatus,resulting in the production of ROS. They are formed as a consequence of photosyntheticelectron transport reactions in the circumstances of a Ô¨Çooded electron Ô¨Çow system with adecreased pool size of electron acceptors [ 90‚Äì92]. Therefore, chlorophyll decline is one of themost injurious concerns of drought stress. In response to the deterioration of photosyntheticapparatus, synthesized ROS causes oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids,lipids, as well as the destruction of the cell membrane [ 90,93]. Lipid peroxidation leads tooverproduction of malondialdehyde (MDA), which is one of the indicators of oxidativedamage [ 21,94‚Äì96]. Moreover, the accumulation of metabolites such as inorganic ions (Na+,K+, H+), amino acid (Pro), amine compounds (glycine betaine and polyamines), and sugar(trehalose, fructan, mannitol, etc.) in plants occurs for the regulation of osmotic potentialunder drought stress conditions. These substances are usually of small molecular weight,highly soluble, and have little toxicity to cells. They can maintain the normal osmoticpressure level, protect the protein activity and cell membrane structure, and so on [ 97‚Äì100].For example, the contents of Pro, glycine betaine, total soluble carbohydrate, and sucrosewere signiÔ¨Åcantly increased due to drought stress in several pistachio genotypes, as shownin the study of Khoyerdi et al. [101].Pro is well-known for its acclimatizing roles in plant stress tolerance, works as amolecular chaperone to alleviate the conÔ¨Åguration of proteins, and its high concentrationis considered an indicator of tolerance to water stress [ 102‚Äì105]. These amino acids arepreferentially stored in plant vacuoles and transported to the cytoplasm during osmoticstress. Increase of its concentration in cytoplasm leads to reduction of the osmotic potential,thus that the cell can still absorb extracellular water thus, maintaining the cell protoplasmand the external environment of osmotic balance. Proline can reduce the oxygen damagecaused by stress through chelating singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical or stimulate theactivity of POD, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO),and other enzymes in plants to remove drought stress generated ROS. It has a strongability to hydrate and bind to proteins, therefore, stabilizing and protecting biologicalmacromolecules, maintaining their structure and activity, and cell membrane structures [ 78].Agronomy 2022 ,12, 189 11 of 26Similarly, glycine betaine, as a water-soluble substance with amphoteric properties, canbind to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of biological macromolecules suchas enzymes and acts as an osmotic regulator. It was found that glycine betaine protectsthe key enzymes of the dicarboxylic acid cycle, terminal oxidases, and the photosystem,which have important physiological signiÔ¨Åcance in maintaining proper respiration andphotosynthesis of plants [ 106]. However, the osmotic regulations can only temporaryimprove plant resistance to drought stress. If drought stress is severe, the turgor pressureof plants cannot be maintained [78].In addition, plants under drought stress can synthesize drought-induced functional(e.g., late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including dehydrins and aquaporins) andregulatory proteins (protein kinases, phospholipase C, phospholipase D, G protein, calmod-ulin, transcription factors, and some signaling factors). They are involved in the protectionof ion channel functioning, ROS scavenging, water molecule binding, enzyme activity(e.g., SOD, POD), PSII proteins, membrane structure, and water transport at cellular orsubcellular levels or in signal transduction or gene expression regulation, and play indirectprotective roles in water stress [78].Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include superoxide radical O 2 , H2O2, singlet oxy-gen1O2, hydroxyl radical OH, and organic oxygen radical (RO, ROO), etc. They can beproduced in plants through many metabolic pathways, namely in the process of photo-synthesis and respiration, as well as in other processes in mitochondria, chloroplasts, andperoxisomes. However, some other organelles or parts with high oxidation activity orstrong electron transfer function may also be involved in ROS production. In plants underdrought stress, ROS are overproduced mainly by chloroplasts and mitochondria [ 107‚Äì109].For example,OH can directly induce the peroxidation decomposition of the unsaturatedfatty acid chain in phospholipids, thus destroying of membrane structure. In addition, ROScan destroy almost all proteins or enzymes, break, degrade, or modify single or doublestrands of DNA [110‚Äì112].For scavenging the high levels of ROS, plants have developed complex enzymatic andnon-enzymatic systems. The former includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathioneperoxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbatereductase (DHAR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and glutathione reductase(GR), while the latter a low molecular weight antioxidant, namely reduced glutathione(GSH), ascorbic acid (AsA), vitamin E, mannitol, Ô¨Çavonoids and carotenoids [ 78,113,114].SOD and APX are mainly localized in cytoplasm and chloroplasts, CAT in peroxisomes,GPX mainly in cytoplasm and mitochondria, and GR in chloroplasts [ 78]. The high amountof H 2O2in drought-stressed plants is generated as a consequence of SOD activity, whichtransforms superoxide radicals (O 2 ) to H 2O2and O 2. Generally, SOD activity increasedunder mild or short-term water stress but decreased under severe or long-term waterstress [ 78]. Generated H 2O2being toxic to plant cells is reduced to water by POD andAPX or converted to oxygen and water by CAT [ 97]. Moreover, GR, DHAR, and MDHARare also very important H 2O2scavenging enzymes [ 78]. All of these scavenging systemsnormalize H 2O2levels in plants [ 115]. Non-enzymatic ROS scavenging system involvessubstances that can react directly with ROS (GSH, AsA), act as substrates of enzymes inthe ROS scavenging mechanism, or, as in the case of vitamins, by scavenging oxygen freeradicals, preventing lipid peroxidation directly. GSH-AsA cycle is the main pathway ofGSH and AsA regeneration and antioxidant system in plants, which stabilizes the ROSlevel in the chloroplasts of plants [116].Sun et al. [ 117] analyzed the response of nearly 60 different plant species and theircultivars (e.g., oilseed rape, fava bean, maize, wheat, mustard, mung bean, soybean,Euphorbia tirucalli ,Coffea arabica , oak, cedar, Norway spruce, apple plants, and many more)to water stress (the median water stress intensity of 0.52 and experimental duration of36 days ) based on several independent variables of plant tissues such as leaf, shoots, roots,and whole plants. Water stress intensity was calculated as the proportional reduction in soilmoisture (reduced soil moisture under water stress treatment/soil moisture in the controlAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 12 of 26groups). They conducted meta-data analyses wherein a huge amount of data was collectedfrom 1301 paired observations of 84 studies across the globe and estimated the impact ofshort-term drought on plants. Based on the morphology, physiology, and functionalitiesof plants, they analyzed plant growth (dry weight and protein), photosynthetic character-istics (chlorophyll; maximal efÔ¨Åciency of PSII photochemistry; photochemical quenchingcoefÔ¨Åcient), plasma membrane permeability (ROS, MDA, and electrolyte leakage), enzy-matic antioxidants (APX, GR, glutathione reductase, CAT, POD, SOD) and nonenzymaticantioxidants (ABA, AsA, Pro, carotenoids, soluble sugars). Overall, a signiÔ¨Åcant increase inplasma membrane permeability (PMP), enzymatic antioxidants (EA), and nonenzymaticantioxidants (NEA) under water stress, but a decrease in plant growth and PS globally wasobserved, as shown in Table 2. An increase in ROS (by 65.7%), MDA (by 44.2%), and EL(99.4%) shows malfunctioning of the plasma membrane and lipid peroxidation, therebycausing oxidative stress while decrease in chlorophyll (Chl) content (by 24%), maximalefÔ¨Åciency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm; by 13%) and photochemical quenching coefÔ¨Å-cient (qP; by 26.4%) indicates damage of photosynthetic organs and altered leaf structureunder water stress conditions. An increase in EA (CAT, POD, and SOD) reveals the abilityof the plants to manage water stress by maintaining normal metabolic processes. HighNEA levels, especially ABA (+126%), Pro (+136.8%), and soluble sugar (+116.9%) contentsunder water stress suggest the plant adaptation mechanisms in order to endure the adverseeffect of ROS under water stress. Thus, this meta-analysis proved the negative impact ofwater stress on overall plant growth and performance.Table 2.

Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Changes in Plants under Drought StressResponse of plants to water-deÔ¨Åcient conditions can be observed at transcriptomic andmetabolomic levels (Figure 2) [ 21,86,118]. You et al. [ 21] studied drought-tolerant (DT) anddrought-susceptible (DS) sesame genotypes under drought stress and found that DS plantswere more disturbed by stress conditions that was conÔ¨Årmed at both transcriptional andmetabolic levels. Such plants contained more drought-responsive genes and metaboliteswhen compared to DT genotype. Transcriptomic analyses of DT and DS sesame plantsrevealed the presence of a total 2782 and 3542 up-regulated and 4163 and 4519 down-regulated genes, respectively. Among them, a set of core drought-responsive genes (atotal 2030 genes including 648 up-regulated and 1346 down-regulated genes) that weredifferentially expressed in both sesame genotypes under drought conditions was found.Upregulated core drought-responsive genes were involved in protein processing in the en-doplasmic reticulum, galactose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, whiledown-regulated core drought-responsive genes in photosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis,sugar, and amino acid metabolism (amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycine,serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis),DNA replication, and ribosome pathways. Transcriptomic analyses of both genotypesshowed that although they share common pathways to cope with drought stress, someunique ones, such as these related to alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, valine, leucine, andisoleucine degradation, photosynthesis and peroxisome were recognized in DT sesameplants [ 21]. Many other transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses in plants under droughtstress highlighted the important role of amino acid metabolism and ABA metabolism andsignaling pathways for drought tolerance in plants [119‚Äì125].The most important metabolites, which are accumulated in plants under droughtstress include phytohormone ABA, amino acids such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, valine,leucine, tyrosine, saccharopine, Pro and 2-aminoadipate, 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA),and organic acids, namely glutaric acid, and 2-methylcitric acid. Accumulation of trypto-han is thought to play an important role in the regulation of stomata, osmotic adjustment,and ROS scavenging [ 126]. Especially, higher levels of ABA, Pro, arginine, lysine, aromaticand branched-chain amino acids, GABA, saccharopine, 2-aminoadipate, and allantoin werefound in drought-tolerant sesame plants under drought conditions [ 21]. Similarly, drought-tolerant chickpea plants showed a lower level of oxidative damage than their drought-sensitive counterparts and higher activity of POD, CAT, AsA, and GSH and accumulationof Pro and consequently lower production of H 2O2or MDA [ 20]. In contrast, some nucle-osides and nucleotides such as guanosine, uridine, adenosine monophosphate, cytidinemonophosphate, guanosine monophosphate, and uridine monophosphate), and sugarssuch as D-galactose and stachyose were reduced under drought stress in both DS and DTsesame genotypes [21].In addition, other genes encoding for chaperones, including heat shock proteins(HSP) and small heat shock proteins (sHSP), Dna J proteins, aquaporins, orthologs ofABFs (ABA-Responsive-Element binding factors), and DREB2s (Dehydration-Responsive-Element-Binding Proteins 2), glutaredoxins (GRXs), glutathione S-transferase (GST), andmany more can also be involved in plant response to drought stress [ 127‚Äì136]. Transcrip-tome analysis of the many other plants or crops such as pine ( Pinus massoniana ) [137], teaoil camellia ( Camellia oleifera ) [138], maize ( Zea mays L.) [139], peanut ( Arachis hypogaea L.varieties) [ 140], endemic orchid species ( Dendrobium sinense ) [118] under drought stress alsoprovided insights into the molecular mechanism such as expression of drought stress genesand certain functional genes that helps the plant to cope with drought stress. Tahmasebiet al. [ 141] investigated the transcriptional response of two different plant species ( Oryzasativa (rice, C 3plant) and Zea mays (maize, C 4plant)) to drought stress based on 172 arraysin total from 11 drought stress studies. This meta-analysis also took into account the tran-scriptional response of shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in sorghum and barley,with respect to maize and rice, respectively, to drought stress, as shown in Table 3. In thismeta-analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis showed DEGs associated with photosynthesis,Agronomy 2022 ,12, 189 14 of 26metabolic pathways, and stress response. In maize, genes encoding for cytochrome c oxi-dase protein (COX19-like), metabolic processes, osmotic stress, photosynthesis, antioxidantactivity, DNA complex, defense signaling pathways, heat shock protein, photosyntheticgas exchange as well as other DEGs play an important role in drought tolerance. In rice,dehydrin protein (RAB16B) genes that are responsible for drought tolerance were highlyupregulated, and also genes responsible for stress tolerance, plant transduction, photo-synthesis, metabolic processes, oxidoreductase activity, and other DEGs, as mentioned inTable 4, were expressed. Several DEGs were identiÔ¨Åed under stress conditions in both plantspecies, as listed in Tables 3 and 4. In both C 3and C 4plants, genes such as transcriptionfactors, plastid translation, DNA replication and repair, antioxidant activity, and antioxi-dant defense genes were detected, as well as genes related to the hormone cytokinin, planthormone signal transduction, and carbon Ô¨Åxation were differentially co-expressed betweenspecies under stress conditions. This study reÔ¨Çects on similarities and differences amongthe two plant species, such as the response to stress, small molecule metabolic process,response to cytokinin, and photosynthesis. Therefore, this meta-analysis indicated theinÔ¨Çuence of drought on the biological processes of both plants at a larger scale, therebyreÔ¨Çecting the importance of transcriptomic studies for obtaining precise information onplant response to drought stress.Table 3.

Plant Growth Promotion and Protection by PGPB and PGPF underDrought ConditionsFor the functioning of ecosystems, interactions between plants and soil microorgan-isms are of utmost importance, along with their response to climate changes [ 142,143].Root exudates composed of enzymes, mucilage, ions, sugars, organic acids, amino acids,and so on actually decide the overall selection of root microbiome, as they attract beneÔ¨Åcialbacteria. Changes in the composition of root exudates (e.g., presence of stress signals)during stressful conditions may signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the root microbiome [ 50,144], as dis-cussed previously. Under drought conditions, mucilaginous material secreted by the rootsbecomes the major carbon nutrient source for microorganisms, thereby enhancing thenearby microbial biomass and altering the soil microbiome composition [ 145‚Äì147]. There-fore, efÔ¨Åcient management and maintaining rhizospheric microorganisms are vital for thewell-functioning of cropping practices [ 148]. Rhizosphere microbial communities adapttheir structural and functional compositions to water scarcity and have the potential tosubstantially mitigate the drought stress of crops. Metagenomic analysis of the rhizobac-terial communities revealed changes at the genome level in order to cope with droughtstress. Such changes included enhancement of functional genes encoding for enzymesresponsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates such as fructan and dextran,decrease in bioÔ¨Ålm, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase produc-tion, and reduction in genes encoding for spermidine (R,R)-butanediol dehydrogenase andglutathione. [ 22]. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and fungi (PGPF) bycolonizing the root areas are known to contribute towards the plant adaptive mechanism inorder to help the plant to survive the adverse effects of drought stress, as shown in Table 5.Microorganisms associated with plant roots minimize the harmful effects of stresses bydelaying wilt and drought-induced changes (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, andleaf discoloration), increasing amino acid content and Pro production, reducing H 2O2content, and increasing total phenolics in plants [ 1,149‚Äì153], increase nitrogen Ô¨Åxation,nutrients uptake, siderophore, phytohormone and secondary metabolite production, syn-thesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS), and many other organic compounds, and enhanceenzyme activities [154‚Äì164], and many more (Table 5).Table 5.

Conclusions and Further PerspectivesAccording to the recent studies [ 6,10,11] and last reports of ICCP [ 2] and EEA, anthro-pogenic activities have signiÔ¨Åcantly contributed towards climate change and drought thatis the most important consequence of climate change in recent decades with a negativeinÔ¨Çuence on our ecosystem, agriculture, and economy [ 6‚Äì10]. In this review article, wediscussed various impacts of drought on soil microbial communities and plants. Althoughin previously published papers, the impact of drought on microbial community abundance,structure, and activity was described, our current knowledge is still incomplete. Soil is avery complex environment. Therefore, microbial community structure and its activity arenot easy to explore and predict. The type of soil, especially the content of organic matter andthe accompanying type of vegetation, is a very important aspect in determining changes inthe structure and activity of soil microorganisms and subsequently enzyme activities, pools,Ô¨Çuxes, and carbon and nitrogen cycles. There are still relatively few metagenomic studies ofmicroorganisms inhabiting drought-affected soil environments, and this scientiÔ¨Åc problemshould be solved. Comprehensive analyses of microbial genome sequences, especiallydrought-tolerant ones, for genes encoding for drought stress-related compounds seem to bea promising tool to broaden our knowledge on how microorganisms cope with such harshconditions. To date, synthesis of polysaccharides, xeroprotectants such as soluble sugars,proteins, and amino acids, as well as phytohormones (ABA, JA, ACC, IAA), and manymore were described to increase microbial and plant resistance. An especially interestingsolution to mitigate the negative effects of drought stress in the soil, mainly semiarid andarid ones, and improve microbial abundance, activity, and soil fertility by amendment ofsoil with various types of organic compounds, including compost, sewage sludge, and mu-nicipal solid waste [ 43]. In addition, the use of speciÔ¨Åc compounds such as plant hormoneswas also proposed [ 25]. However, the response of microorganisms to phytohormones isambiguous and further research is required.Plants respond to water scarcity in different ways, and this is a complex process that westill need to work on to unravel completely. In past studies, changes in plant morphology,anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology under drought stress were described in detail.However, plant response to such extreme conditions at the trancriptomic and metabolomiclevels is still deÔ¨Åcient. Therefore, more studies on the response of different plant species todrought stress are required to understand various adaptive mechanisms evolved in theseorganisms. In addition, meta-analysis studies seem to be a valuable approach to knowglobal patterns of changes in the microbial community, its activity, and plants affected bystress conditions.Based on the current knowledge, some improvement in crop management skills suchas handling or selection of appropriate crops and soil, maintaining good levels of soil watercontent, insertion of abiotic stress tolerance traits into the plants using genetic engineeringor genome editing technologies were proposed to increase plant productivity in such abioticstress. Moreover, application of osmolytes, potassium, hydrogels, nanoparticles, mineralAgronomy 2022 ,12, 189 19 of 26nutrient (silicon), antioxidative protectant (selenium), and plant growth regulators suchas uniconazole and salicylic acid were considered to increase plant yield under abioticstress [ 1,73,129,180‚Äì183]. In addition, the application of plant hormones such as ABA,gibberellic acid (GA), ethylene, auxins, JA, cytokinins, and brassinolide (BR) that regulatedifferent beneÔ¨Åcial mechanisms in the plants can help them to cope with the adverseeffects of droughts [ 1,73].
