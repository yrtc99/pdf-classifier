Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can assist its host plants to effectivelymitigate salinity stress. However, less information is available on the molecular mech-anisms of AMF related to halophytes in adapting to moderate saline environments. Apot experiment was undertaken to detect the effects of AMF on the carbon (C),nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the halophyte Suaeda salsa whichwas grown at 100 mM NaCl and the underlying proteomic modulating mechanisms.The results proved that AMF decreased the N and P concentrations, increased the C,N and P accumulations and the C:N and C:P ratios. Proteomic analysis screened581 differentially abundant proteins (DAP), which were mostly categorized in carbo-hydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and folding, sorting and degradation path-ways. The enrichment analysis illuminated that the DAPs were assembled in 'carbonfixation in photosynthetic organisms,' 'nitrogen metabolism' and 'N-glycan biosynthe-sis' pathways, which might be associated with the stoichiometric changes. The inte-grative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis detected 64 DAP whose regulationswere concordant with those of the corresponding differentially expressed genes. Fur-thermore, these proteins were enriched in 'carbon fixation in photosynthetic organ-isms' and some amino acid metabolism pathways. The modulations of thesepathways might be correlated with C and N allocations and plant growth in moderatesaline conditions. The study supplements the comprehension of the roles of AMF inhalophytes grown in saline ecosystems.KEYWORDSarbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, halophyte, proteomic, saline soil, resource allocation1|INTRODUCTIONGlobal climate change and increasing anthropogenic activities haveaggravated soil salinization, with the areas of saline soil increasing inrecent decades (Flowers & Muscolo,2015 ; Shao et al., 2019 ). Morethan one-third of the arable land in the world is currently subjected tosoil and land degradation due to salt stress (Shao et al., 2019 ). Soilsalinity has negative effects on the growth and reproduction of themajority of plants, thereby reducing crop yield and farm productivity(Bedre et al., 2016 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Halophytes, which make uparound 1% of the world flora and can grow to reproduce in salty set-tings of 200 mM NaCl or more (Flowers & Colmer, 2008 ). PreviousReceived: 16 February 2022 Revised: 13 March 2022 Accepted: 20 March 2022DOI: 10.1002/ldr.4274Land Degrad Dev. 2022;33:1933 –1943. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ldr © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1933research on halophytes have shed light on the physiological andmolecular processes that allow plants to tolerate salt stress(Flowers & Muscolo,2015 ). However, the mechanisms of halophytesin association with microorganisms to accommodate salt environ-ments have been hardly elaborated. Understanding the mechanisms isbeneficial to develop their potential values in agriculture and otherecosystem services.Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play significant roles in eco-logical functioning activities, such as nutrients uptake and transfer,plant growth stimulation, and plant interactions with other biota(Powell & Rillig,2018 ; Tedersoo et al., 2020 ), particularly boostingplant tolerance to stress (Porter et al., 2020 ). AMF can regulate thephysiology of halophytes and thereby alleviate serious salt stress(Hajiboland et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ). For instance, the AMFGlomus mosseae can promote plant biomass and the growth of the hal-ophyte S. salsa at 400 mM NaCl by elevating leaf superoxide dis-mutase and leaf catalase activity (Li et al., 2012 ). However, little iswised about the molecular mechanisms of AMF affecting the growthand production of halophytes in moderate saline environments. Somehalophytes can show optimal growth (Flowers & Colmer,2008 ), andhigher root colonization can always be observed on arbuscular mycor-rhizal (AM) symbiosis in moderate salinity (Diao, Dang, Xu,et al.,2021 ; Hajiboland et al., 2015 ). The influences of AMF on plantgrowth and production differ between moderate and high saline con-ditions (Diao, Dang, Xu, et al.,2021 ), and a tremendously positiveeffect may occur at moderate saline conditions.Soil salinity usually may lead to the imbalance of ion homeostasis,metabolic confusion, the proliferation of reactive oxygen species(ROS) in plants, which may further result in osmotic stress and toxicitystress and inhibit plant development (Acosta-Motos et al.,2017 ; Zelmet al., 2020 ). Furthermore, plant response and adjustment to the saltenvironment are always accompanied by energy depletion and carbontranslocation (Shabala et al., 2020 ). Plants modify osmolytes and anti-oxidants in response to salt stress, resulting in a drop in growth ratebecause a result of the reallocation of energy sources to the synthesisof organic solutes and enzymes (Munns & Gilliham,2015 ). This majorallocation of resources is deemed impossible in plants under non-saltconditions, because it costs too many photosynthetic products, reduc-ing their availability for plant growth. Moreover, the procedures ofNa+compartmentalization into the vacuole and excretion into the rhi-zosphere also consume energies and resources (Theerawitayaet al.,2020 ; Wang, Liu, et al., 2020 ). Previous reports have also illumi-nated that AMF always promotes the uptake and accumulation ofnutrients to relieve salt stress (Hidri et al., 2019 ; Wang, Zhai,et al., 2020 ). Moreover, AMF can enhance plant photosynthesis andbiomass production under salt stress (Kaschuk et al., 2009 ; Konget al., 2019 ). However, some halophytes can grow better under mod-erate salt conditions than under non-salt conditions, such as S. salsa(Flowers & Colmer, 2008 ; Qiu et al., 2007 ). Due to the nature of halo-phytes in salt environments, AM symbiosis may trigger distinctivemolecular mechanisms in halophytes to distribute nutrients and adaptto salt environments.Omics technologies, including transcriptomics and proteomics,have been rapidly developed and widely used to identify differentialexpressions and elucidate potential molecular processes (Guet al.,2021 ; Song et al., 2019 ). Recently, proteomics technologieshave been employed to identify the proteins inducted by AMF, andreveal the mechanisms of AM symbiosis tolerating abiotic stresses atthe protein level (Bai et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2019 ). For instance, theAMF Rhizophagus intraradices can significantly improve protein syn-thesis, nitrogen metabolism and ROS scavenging to boost osmoticsubstance biosynthesis and response to alkaline stress in a salt-alkaligrass Puccinellia tenuiflora by proteomics (Wang et al.,2019 ). Jiaet al. ( 2019 ) revealed that the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis improvedCa2+signal transduction, the secondary metabolism level ofphenylpropane metabolism and ROS scavenging abilities and boostedprotein biosynthesis in Elaeagnus angustifolia seedlings under salinestress by proteomics. Therefore, it is feasible to elaborate the regula-tion mechanisms of AMF in halophytes in a moderate saline environ-ment by tandem mass tag-based (TMT) quantitative proteomicsanalysis.S. salsa is widely distributed in Asia, and grows in littoral andinland salt soils in China, and the species is a leaf-succulent halophyticherb that is able to accumulate salts in shoots and can be used torestore salty soils (Song & Wang,2015 ). Its favorable salt concentra-tion is from 100 to 300 mM NaCl for vigorous growth (Qiuet al., 2007 ). Our previous study has shown that the AMFFunneliformis mosseae can significantly increase the shoot dry weightby 238.5%, the shoot height by 48.3% and the shoot Na+accumula-tion by 137.3% in S. salsa grown with 100 mM NaCl (Diao, Dang, Cui,et al., 2021 ). Also, our early transcriptomic analysis by identifying dif-ferentially expressed genes (DEG) revealed the regulation mechanismsof AMF in promoting plant growth, that is, by enriching primarymetabolism, including carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and mostDEG related to photosynthesis showed a down-regulation (Diao,Dang, Cui, et al.,2021 ). Therefore, we used TMT quantitative proteo-mics technology to determine the protein changes in plant shoots tocorroborate the distinctive mechanisms of AMF in S. salsa at moder-ate saline environments in the present study. We monitored shootcarbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and accu-mulations, and shoot C:N:P ratios, and investigated protein changes inshoots of S. salsa . Moreover, a correlation analysis was appliedbetween proteomic and transcriptomic data, and the DAP whose reg-ulations were concordant with those of the corresponding DEG werefiltered and analyzed. We aimed to elucidate the distinctive molecularmodulations induced by AMF in S. salsa under a moderate saline envi-ronment, and the possible roles of AM symbiosis in the rehabilitationof salt-polluted grounds.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Experimental designFrom April 10th through August 23 2019, we conducted a pot experi-ment in a greenhouse at the Inner Mongolia University in Hohhot,China. The greenhouse's temperature ranged from 15 to 35/C14C, with ahumidity level of 50% –80%. S. salsa was utilized as the model plant,1934 DIAO ET AL. 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseand inoculation of AMF ( F. mosseae ) to the plant was used as thetreatment and a non-inoculated plant was used as the control. TheS. salsa seed grew for 90 days to allow for symbiotic establishment (Liet al.,2012 ), and then all pots were irrigated with NaCl solutions for45 days to maintain a salty environment until the culture finished.Each pot had six seedlings, and each treatment was replicated threetimes.2.2 |Experimental materials and preparationThe bank of Glomales from the Beijing Academy of Agriculture andForestry Sciences, China, provided the F. mosseae inoculum (number:BGC NM04A). The S. salsa seeds were obtained in China's YellowRiver Delta (36/C14120N, 118/C14500E), and a specialist in the field of PlantTaxonomy has confirmed the seed based on the phenotype of plantand seed.For surface sterilization, the seeds were immersed in 10% NaClOfor 10 min, and then washed several times with deionized, sterilewater. The plastic pot was filled into 2.5 kg autoclaved mixture (sand:soil=1:1 mass ratio), and the form of the tub was 15 /C218/C215 cm(lower diameter /C2upper diameter /C2height). These sands werewashed three times with deionized water after first being rinsed withtapwater. The soil properties were pH 7.83, 1.38% organic matter,10.6 mg kg/C01available nitrogen, 26.4 mg kg/C01available phosphorusand 55.9 mg kg/C01available potassium. The soil and sand wereautoclaved for 2 hr at 121/C14C and 0.24 MPa pressure (Wang, Zhai,et al., 2020 ). The inoculated groups were added with 50 g of the inoc-ulant (a mixture of soil substrate, mycorrhizal root fragments, sporesand mycelia of F. mosseae ). The non-inoculated groups received 50 gsterilized inoculant in the same way and 30 ml filtrate (filtered inocu-lant using a 0.25 m filter membrane to keep the same microbial biotabut devoid of mycorrhizal propagules). The seeds were sown and grewfor 90 days to allow symbiotic establishment (Li et al.,2012 ), afterwhich they were irrigated with NaCl solutions. A 50 mM NaCl con-centration was utilized first, and then 100 mM NaCl concentrationwas used from the next day to the last. A threefold volume of sub-strate capacity was employed to keep the same salt concentrationevery day (Diao, Dang, Cui, et al.,2021 ). Hoagland solution was usedto water each pot every 2 weeks. After 45 days of salt irrigation, allplants were harvested.2.3 |Determinations of C, N and P concentrationsand accumulations in plant shootsAt 70/C14C, the collected shoots were dried until they reached a consis-tent weight. The concentrations of C and N in shoot samples weredetermined by an elemental analyzer (CHNOS Elemental Analyzer,Elementar Co., Germany). Sulphanilamide standard reference material(S15.00-0062, Elementar Co., Germany) was used for quality control.A total of 500 mg shoot samples were combined with 5 mlHNO3, and digested for 96 hr at 120/C14C using the AIM600 digestingapparatus. The concentrations of P in the digested solutions weredetermined by ICP-OES (Optima 7000 DV, PerkinElmer, USA).The C, N and P concentrations were multiplied by the shoot dry-weight, respectively, to compute C, N and P accumulations.2.4 |Proteomics analysis2.4.1 | Protein extraction, digestion and TMTlabelingBased on the difference in plant growth phenotype and trans-criptomics between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal S. salsa , plantshoot samples were taken for proteome analysis (Diao, Dang, Cui,et al., 2021 ). On the day of harvest, the top and fresh shoots werepicked and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen before being storedat/C080/C14C.The shoots were ground and suspended in a 1:3 mixture of 1%PVPP and BPP buffer. The samples were centrifuged, then vortex at4/C14C for 10 min with an equal volume of Tris-saturated phenol. Theywere centrifuged after that, and an equivalent volume of BPP bufferwas added to the phenol phase, which was vortexed at 4/C14C for10 min. The protein supernatants were combined with 5-fold volumesof 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol and stored at /C020/C14C for12 hr to precipitate protein. The samples were washed twice with90% acetone after centrifugation. Finally, the dried samples were son-icated for 2 min in protein lysis buffer (1% SDS, 8 M urea) with prote-ase inhibitor. The protein supernatant was centrifuged, and BCAProtein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) was applied to deter-mine the quantity and concentration of the protein.The digesting procedure was then carried out. A 100 μg proteinwas resuspended in TEAB buffer (triethylammonium bicarbonate) to afinal concentration of 100 mM. The samples were alkylated with IAMfor 40 min in the gloominess at 24/C14C, and then precipitated in acetonefor 4 hr at /C020/C14C. After centrifugation, the samples were incubated at37/C14C overnight with trypsin (trypsin: protein =1:50 mass ratio). Ten-plex TMT reagents were used to tag the peptides. The samples werecombined and dried under a vacuum.2.4.2 | High pH RPLC separation and LC –MS/MSanalysisTo increase proteome depth, all samples were fractionated by Van-quish Flex binary UHPLC chromatography (Thermo Scientific, MA,USA) with ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column (1.7 μm,2.1 mm /C2150 mm, Waters, USA). Peptides were separated first usinga gradient of elution over 48 min at 200 μl per minute. The gradientelution was performed with 0%, 5%, 10%, 30%, 36% and 42%. Eachsample generated 20 fractions, which were merged.Labeled peptides were analyzed by EASY-nLC system and massspectrometer with an ion source. The peptides were first eluted for120 min using a C18-reversed-phase column with solvent A andDIAO ET AL. 1935 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Solvent A contained 2% ACN and0.1% formic acid, while the solvent B included 80% ACN and 0.1%formic acid. The Q Exactive HF-X instrument was set in DDA mode.2.4.3 | Protein identification and quantificationPROTEOME DISCOVERER 2.4 software was used to match the RAWdata files to the transcriptome of S. salsa (Diao, Dang, Cui,et al.,2021 ). The search criterion was applied at 20 ppm mass toler-ance for MS and 0.02 Da for MS/MS, and the enzyme chosen as tryp-sin allowed two missed cleavage, and the dynamic modificationschose as methionine oxidation. Protein identifications set high confi-dence peptides using a 1% FDR threshold, and only the proteins withat least one unique peptide were identified. Differentially abundantproteins (DAP) were screened by R software using Student's t-test,and the criteria were set as p< 0.05 and fold change >1.2 or <0.83(Gu et al.,2021 ; Wang et al., 2019 ).2.4.4 | Bioinformatics analysisThese DAP were annotated and classified using KEGG and GO data-bases. The significance of protein enrichment on GO term and KEGGpathway was assessed by Fisher's exact test ( p-value), and the q-valuewas got by rectified p-value with Benjamini and Hochberg method.Subcellular locations of the DAP were predicted using the Sublocdatabase.2.5 |PRM analysisBased on the findings of the proteomic analysis, 10 DAP related tophotosynthesis were selected to perform parallel reaction monitoring(PRM) quantification analysis, with the aim to confirm the credibilityof TMT-based proteomic data. Protein extraction and digestionfollowed the same steps as the TMT test. A mass spectrometercoupled with Easy-nLC 1200 was used in the experiment. Each pep-tide sample was injected, and they were split by C18-reversed-phasechromatography and a linear gradient from 2% to 80% ACN, 0.1% FAwith 300 nl per minute. Finally, SKYLINE software was used to ana-lyze PRM data.2.6 |Statistical analysisThe significant difference in shoot C, N and P concentrations or pools,and the C:N, C:P and N:P ratios between the inoculated and non-inoculated treatments were analyzed using independent samplest-test in SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., IL, USA). And the choices ofp-values in statistical results were dependent on the result ofLevenes test for equality of variances. The significance were indicatedwith *( p< 0.05) and **( p< 0.01). All figures were pictured with theggplot2 package in R software.3|RESULTS3.1 |C, N and P concentrations and accumulations,and C:N:P ratiosAMF significantly decreased the N concentration by 32.8% and P con-centration by 42.2%, but did not alter the C concentration, in-plantshoots (Table1). AMF significantly increased the C, N and P accumu-lations by 244.5%, 124.9% and 91.7%, respectively. AMF significantlyincreased the C:N ratio by 49.2% and the C:P ratio by 76.4%, but didnot alter the N:P ratio.3.2 |Protein identification and functionalannotationThe shoots of S. salsa with or without AMF association were analyzedusing TMT quantitative proteomic technique to investigate the molec-ular processes of AMF assisting plants to resist or adapt to the moder-ate saline conditions (100 mM NaCl). The analysis generated 663,471spectra, and further identified 131,952 spectra. A total of 61,927 pep-tides were found and were assigned to 8247 proteins. Mass and cov-erage distributions of these proteins were shown in Figure S1.These identified proteins were functionally annotated and classi-fied using KEGG and GO databases. A total of 4434 (53.8%) proteinswere annotated in the KEGG database and mapped in 20 pathways offive branches. The proteins were mostly classified into branches of'carbohydrate metabolism,' 'translation' and 'folding, sorting and deg-radation' (Figure S2).

The term 'cellular process' wasthe most dominant group in biological process, and the term 'catalyticactivity' was the most dominant group in molecular function(Figure S3).3.3 |Identification and subcellular localizationanalysis of DAPThese identified proteins were analyzed quantitatively, and a total of581 DAP were detected in the study. Volcano plots were drawn toexhibit the significant regulation of proteins in the experiment(Figure1). The number of upregulated proteins was 385, more thanthat of downregulated proteins.The DAP were analyzed using the Subloc database to calculatethe subcellular localization of proteins (Figure 1). A total of237 (40.8%) DAP were predicted in cytoplasmic, and 70 (12.0%) DAPwere localized in the chloroplast.3.4 |Functional categorization and enrichmentanalysis of DAPTo further acquaintance the adjustment induced by AMF, 202 of581 DAP were annotated and functionally classified, using the KEGGdatabase (Figure2). Metabolism (63.1%) and genetic informationprocessing (26.5%) pathways occupied the high proportion.Furthermore, carbohydrate metabolism (15.7%), energy metabolism(10.4%) and folding, sorting and degradation (9.3%) pathways ownedhigh proportions of the DAP.These annotated DAP were further categorized into 92 detailedpathways in the KEGG database and they were carried out enrich-ment analysis using software KOBAS. The pathway 'carbon fixation inphotosynthetic organisms' showed the most significant enrichmentand owned the most number of DAP (13 DAP). In addition, the path-ways of 'nitrogen metabolism' and 'N-glycan biosynthesis' were alsoenrichment. The top 10 enriched pathways were showed in Figure3(based on q-values), including 'photosynthesis —antenna proteins' and'pPhotosynthesis.' To further understand the pathways adjusted byAMF, 352 of 581 DAP were annotated and they have further carriedout an enrichment analysis in the GO database using softwareGOATOOLS. Many GO terms linked to carbohydrate metabolism,molecule glycosylation and nitrogen metabolism, including 'single-organism carbohydrate metabolic process,' 'carbohydratephosphorylation,' 'monosaccharide metabolic process,' 'photosynthe-sis, dark reaction,' 'reactive nitrogen species metabolic process,' 'mac-romolecule glycosylation,' 'protein N-linked glycosylation.' Thedetailed results about enriched GO terms were shown in Table S1.3.5 |DAP related to photosynthesis in proteomicsThe DAP related to photosynthetic pathways were chosen, includingthe pathways 'photosynthesis —antenna proteins,' 'photosynthesis'FIGURE 1 Volcano plot (a) and subcellular localization analysis (b) of DAP in shoots of Suaeda salsa at 100 mM NaCl from Funneliformismosseae inoculation treatment [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ]DIAO ET AL. 1937 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

The abun-dance of proteins described as NADP-dependent malic enzymes wasupregulated to the maximum level (1.40-fold) in the carbon fixationpathway. Moreover, the abundance of DAP described as ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase small chain PW9 was downregulated to themaximum level (0.42-fold). In addition, the abundance of threeantenna proteins were affected by AMF. Four DAP enriched in thepathway of photosynthesis showed downregulation, and the abun-dance of proteins described as photosystem I reaction center subunitN were decreased by 0.63-fold.3.6 |Integrative proteomic and transcriptomicanalysisA poor Pearson correlation (rho =0.0485) was found between theprotein expression ratios of proteomic and the corresponding geneexpression ratios of transcriptomic (Figure S4). Interestingly, 64 DAPwere identified, whose regulations were concordant with the regula-tions of the corresponding DEG. Moreover, the upregulated numberwas 18 and the downregulated number was 46.

A total of 26 (40.6%)DAP were predicted in cytoplasmic and 20 (31.3%) DAP in the chloro-plast. The function classification showed that 91.9% of the DAP wereassigned to the metabolism pathway. Furthermore, amino acid metab-olism (29.7%), energy metabolism (27.0%) and carbohydrate metabo-lism (18.9%) pathways owned the top three numbers. The enrichmentanalysis indicated that the pathway 'carbon fixation in photosyntheticorganisms' had the most significant enrichment and owned six DAP.Other significantly enriched pathways ( q-value <0.05) were attributedto amino acid metabolism pathway, including “alanine, aspartate andglutamate metabolism,' 'arginine biosynthesis,' 'cysteine and methio-nine metabolism' and 'glycine, serine and threonine metabolism,' andall these DAP showed downregulation in mycorrhizal plants.3.7 |PRM validationA total of 10 DAP were selected to perform PRM analysis and con-firmed the credibility of the TMT results. The validation showed thatthe expression tendency of these DAP in PRM analysis was highlyconsistent with those in the TMT results (Figure S5). Thus, theseresults indicated that the proteomic analysis was highly trustworthy.4|DISCUSSIONSome halophytes can grow optimally under modest salt concentrations(Flowers & Colmer, 2008 ;G u oe ta l . , 2018 ), as halophytes have evolvedspecific features to adapt to salt environments, such as high toleranceand regulation for Na+in xylem, in addition to having common salt-tolerant mechanisms they share with glycophytes (Zarei et al., 2020 ;Zelm et al., 2020 ). AMF induces different strategies in halophytes torespond to salt environments. Pan et al. ( 2020 ) expounded that AMFcan lead to certain discrepancies in physiological responses to saltstress between glycophytes and halophytes. Moreover, our previousstudy has shown that AMF induced the DEG that are mainly enrichedin carbohydrate and energy metabolism, including the pathways 'carbonfixation in photosynthetic organisms' and 'glyoxylate and dicarboxylatemetabolism,' in the halophyte S. salsa at 100 mM NaCl, using trans-criptomic analysis (Diao, Dang, Cui, et al.,2021 ). In this study, we fur-ther used proteomic analysis to corroborate the distinctive modulationsfrom a view of resource allocation.TABLE 2 DAP related to photosynthesis in shoots of Suaeda salsa at 100 mM NaCl from Funneliformis mosseae inoculation treatmentAccession Description Fold change Regulation p-valueCarbon fixation in photosynthetic organismsDN150_c0_g1_i11_orf1 NADP-dependent malic enzyme 1.40 Up 0.023DN1282_c0_g1_i6_orf1 Phosphoglycerate kinase 3 1.37 Up 0.010DN41_c1_g1_i5_orf1 Malate dehydrogenase 1.31 Up 0.004DN18289_c0_g1_i1_orf1 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP)-like 0.82 Down 0.041DN5386_c0_g2_i1_orf1 Pyruvate, phosphate dikinase 0.81 Down 0.039DN42117_c0_g2_i1_orf1 Hypothetical protein TSUD_98560 0.79 Down 0.048DN13790_c1_g3_i2_orf1 Aspartate aminotransferase 0.73 Down 0.048DN5521_c0_g1_i5_orf1 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 0.72 Down 0.011DN59328_c0_g1_i2_orf1 Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain 3 0.71 Down 0.039DN5468_c0_g1_i3_orf1 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase B 0.70 Down 0.009DN8645_c0_g1_i1_orf1 Glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 0.70 Down 0.031DN17707_c0_g1_i1_orf1 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A 0.70 Down 0.037DN24575_c0_g1_i6_orf1 Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain PW9 0.42 Down 0.008Photosynthesis —antenna proteinsDN36231_c0_g1_i1_orf1 Chlorophyll a-b binding protein 7 1.41 Up 0.029DN23887_c0_g2_i1_orf1 Chlorophyll a-b binding protein 1 0.72 Down 0.016DN6890_c0_g1_i6_orf1 Chlorophyll a-b binding protein 0.56 Down 0.044PhotosynthesisDN1790_c0_g2_i1_orf1 ATP synthase gamma chain 0.81 Down 0.045DN4933_c1_g1_i1_orf1 Photosystem I reaction center subunit II 0.81 Down 0.049DN12072_c0_g2_i1_orf1 Ferredoxin-2 0.70 Down 0.013DN638_c0_g1_i13_orf1 Photosystem I reaction center subunit N 0.63 Down 0.032Note : fold change, NaCl +AM vs. NaCl +NM. p-value, Student's t-test.DIAO ET AL. 1939 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

A low correlation has also beenfound in transcriptomic and proteomic integration analysis to explorepeanut seed coat in response to pathogenic fungus infection (Zhao, Li,FIGURE 4 Subcellular localization analysis (a), KEGG function categorization analysis (b) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (c) of64 cases of concordant regulation between DAP and DEG in proteomic and transcriptomic data [Colour figure can be viewed atwileyonlinelibrary.com ]1940 DIAO ET AL. 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

However, the results of the proteomic analysis show thata total of 581 DAP (Figure 1) are mostly classified in metabolismprocessing, including carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolismand amino acid metabolism (Figure 2; Table S1), which is consistentwith the classification of DEG in shoots by transcriptomic analysis(Diao, Dang, Cui, et al., 2021 ). Wang et al. ( 2019 ) have also shownthat carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and amino acidmetabolism are affected by AM symbiosis at 300 mM NaHCO3in astudy of P. tenuiflora inoculated with AMF under tolerating alkalinestress in alkali-degraded soil. Previous studies suggest that the regula-tions of primary metabolism by AMF may optimize plant capacity fornutrient allocation to sustain growth (Diao, Dang, Cui, et al.,2021 ;Kaur & Suseela, 2020 ).The variations of N and P concentrations and stoichiometry inthe plant can also mirror the adjustment of nutrient allocation in cellu-lar organs and trophic dynamics (Chen et al., 2010 ; Johnson, 2010 ). Nis the essential component for all enzymes (Hidri et al., 2019 ), and75% of N in plant leaf is invested in chloroplasts and thus in the pro-curement of C through photosynthesis (Johnson, 2010 ). This studyshows that AMF decreases N concentration, which is in agreementwith the downregulation of the abundance of most DAP related tophotosynthesis, though they increase N accumulation (Tables1and2).AMF did not alter C concentration, though increased C accumulationand C:N ratio (Table1). We speculate that C assimilation can be com-pensated by the increase in photosynthetic areas of plants, as mycor-rhizal plants have higher shoot height and other morphologicalfeatures in the last phase of vegetative stages (Diao, Dang, Cui,et al.,2021 ). Furthermore, our enrichment analysis of the DAP indi-cates that the pathways of 'carbon fixation in photosyntheticorganisms,' 'nitrogen metabolism' and 'N-glycan biosynthesis' areaffected by AMF (Figure3), which is correlated with the C and Nmodulations in plants (Table 1). These results of mycorrhizal plantshaving lower N concentration but higher biomass compared to non-mycorrhizal plants were also reported in clover ( Trifolium repens ) colo-nized by AMF (Chen et al.,2010 ). These suggest that AMF induce thechanges in pathways related to C fixation, N metabolism and N-glycanbiosynthesis, leading to the changes in N concentration and C:N ratio.Not inconsistently with our results, proteomic analysis revealed AMFinduce certain DAPs related to ROS scavenging-related functions inalkali-tolerant plant P. tenuiflora under alkaline stress (300 mMNaHCO3) and salt-tolerance plant E. angustifolia under salt stress(300 mM NaCl) (Jia et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). The inconsistencymay imply that the regulation of AMF on these pathways in halo-phytes differs with the environment, that is, between under the mod-erate and high salinity stress. Most DAPs related to photosynthesisare downregulated (Table2), which may trigger another possiblemechanism. When the abundance of antenna proteins is down-regulated, it signifies the relaxation of the harvested light, and therebyphoto-inhibition can be avoided in the photosynthetic organs with saltinterference (Diao, Dang, Cui, et al.,2021 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ).The enrichment analysis of 64 DAPs concordant with DEG dem-onstrates that the proteins enriched in 'cysteine and methioninemetabolism,' 'arginine biosynthesis,' 'alanine, aspartate and glutamatemetabolism' and 'glycine, serine and threonine metabolism' pathways,are all assigned to amino acid metabolism, and show a downregulation(Figure4; Table S2). These regulations may be affected by thedecrease of N and P concentrations (Table 1), because N is a compo-nent of amino acids and P is a component of nucleic acids, playingrespectively key roles in protein and RNA synthesis (Johnson, 2010 ;Zhao et al., 2015 ). However, N and P accumulations were significantlyincreased, which is a consequence of the dilution effect by biomass(Chen et al., 2010 ), so as C:P and C:N ratios have risen in mycorrhizalplants (Table 1). These results imply that AMF has promoted C assimi-lation in vegetative stages that provide C resources for fast growth ofplants (i.e., C accumulation) in moderate salt environments, whichresults in a similar shoot C concentration in inoculated and non-inoculated plants (Eroglu et al.,2020 ; Smith & Stitt, 2007 ). Moreover,three DAPs related to sugar transporter are upregulated, beneficial tocarbon allocation (Zhao, Chen, et al., 2019 ). Therefore, AMF canreadjust the balance among C assimilation, storage and growth, thusaffecting N allocation in plant shoots, and attribute to the regulationof the relevant pathways, such as 'carbon fixation in photosyntheticorganisms,' 'nitrogen metabolism,' 'N-glycan biosynthesis' and someamino acid metabolism pathways.5|CONCLUSIONSWe conclude that AMF can decrease the N concentration andincrease the C:N ratio in plant shoots at 100 mM NaCl, and the alter-ation is associated with the regulations of 'carbon fixation in photo-synthetic organisms,' 'nitrogen metabolism' and 'N-glycanbiosynthesis' pathways that are enriched by the DAP in KEGG data-base. Moreover, AMF improves C and N accumulations. These resultssuggest that AMF affects the N allocation and supplies more Cresources for the fast growth of halophyte S. salsa at the moderatesaline environment. The 64 DAP concordant with DEG, identified byintegrative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis, are enriched in 'car-bon fixation in photosynthetic organisms' and some amino acidmetabolism pathways, also indicating the possibility of resource allo-cation by AMF. Future researchers should pay close attention to thechanges of metabolites induced by AM symbiosis and define thecorresponding regulation pathways to verify the capacities forresource allocation modulated by AM symbiosis in sustained growth.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was financially supported by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China [31860170 and 41977113]; the NaturalScience Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018MS04003] and the MajorScience and Technology Projects in Inner Mongolia AutonomousRegion [ZDZX2018054 and 2020ZD0020].DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTData sharing not applicable - no new data generated, or the articledescribes entirely theoretical research.DIAO ET AL. 1941 1099145x, 2022, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4274 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].
