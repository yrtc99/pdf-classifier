China is starting an energy transition with the aim of building an en-ergy system for the future. China has made tremendous progress in increasing the amount of renewable energy and reducing the cost of renewable energy over the last 20 years. According to the 14th 5 year plan, China aims to incorporate 20% of renew-able energy to the primary energy mix and attain 27% reduction in CO2 emissions. Bioenergy crops constitute a significant proportion of biomass-based bioenergy and have recently been promoted by the Chinese Government to help overcome food and fuel conflict. Steps are being taken to promote bioenergy crops on marginal lands in China, and various regions across the country with soil marginality have been evaluated for bioenergy crop cultivation. The present paper reviews the status of bioenergy in China and the potential status of marginal lands from different regions of China. It also elaborates on some of the policies, subsidies and incentives allo-cated by the Chinese Government for the promotion of biomass-based energy. Land management and plant improvement strategies were discussed, which are effective in making marginal lands suitable for bioenergy crop cultivation. Managing planting strategies, intercropping and crop rotation are effective management practices used in China for the utilization of marginal lands. A national investigation is desirable for creating an inventory of technical and economic potential of biomass feedstocks that could be planted on marginal lands. This would assist with highlighting the pros and cons of using marginal lands for bioenergy production and effective policy making.KEYWORDSbioenergy, China, feedstock, marginal land, policy, subsides1 | INTRODUCTIONChina has been undergoing tremendous economic growth over the last four decades and efficient policies by the Chinese Government have moved approximately 750 million people out of extreme poverty (WorldBank, 2017). Such huge economic growth coupled with an industrial revolution led to high energy demand and consumption over time. Currently, 22 |   QASEEM And WUthe industrial sector in China consumes a larger proportion (about 60%) of total primary energy, which is higher than any other country in the world (NSB, 2018). According to a Reuters report that analysed the first 5 months of 2020, China brought in 148.71 million tons of coal, up 16.8% from the same period last year. Although residential coal consumption has reduced over the past couple of years due to high indus-trial growth, coal consumption increased by 1% and jumped to 3.84 billion tonnes in 2020 (NBS, 2018). Also, since 2017, coal consumption for power generation has increased by 8% (CNCA, 2018). Likewise, crude oil and natural gas consump-tion also increased by 6.5% and 18% in 2018, respectively, and oil consumption jumped to 639 million tonnes, which is 3.4 times higher than domestic output. The oil import was 2.4% higher than in 2018 and Chinese dependency on imported oil has now reached 72%. A recent report sug-gests that Chinese natural gas consumption has increased by 45.3% (NBS, 2018) and China has imported 1.9% (40.12 m tonnes) more natural gas in the first half of 2020 than in 2019. Researchers expect China's natural gas import volume and import dependence to continue to grow (Li et al., 2016; Lin & Wang, 2012; Wang et al., 2016; Figure 1a). China is heav -ily dependent on foreign oil supply, importing oil from more than 10 countries, of which Russia, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Oman, Iraq, and Iran are the major suppliers. Oil import from five of these six countries is seaborne and passes through the Strait of Malacca (Shaikh et al., 2016). There is a spatial dif-ference in oil and coal production and utilization as many domestic oilfields are present in the western and northeastern areas of the country, but these areas have less industrial oil consumption than southeastern coastal regions. Likewise, the southeastern coastal regions of China have high oil demand due to them being the industrial hub of the nation, but they lack domestic oil resources and rely on maritime import. The Chinese Government is interested in energy cooperation and development across its borders, in addition to marine trans-port which accounts for about 80% of total import. China has developed three onshore strategic energy routes by construct-ing cross border pipelines. These include Kazakhstan–China, Russia–China and Myanmar–China (Chen & Fazilov, 2018; Muhammad & Long, 2020).Energy independence has a vital role not only in sus-tainable development of a society but also in policy mak -ing, international relations and cooperation. Sufficient energy resources are fundamental for a country's progress. Moreover, a country must ensure energy security for the present as well as for the future to continue to achieve significant growth and development (Nabiyev, 2018; Zou et  al.,  2020). Energy demand and environmental impact of coal and fossil fuel burning are a preference of China's national security and policy legitimacy. China is revising its land and renewable energy development policies to pro-mote sustainable development of its small and large com-munities. Currently, China is developing strategies to attain energy independence by 2050 and this dream can only be fulfilled by growth of the state's power. With emergence and utilization of new and advanced technologies of crop, land and technology management, China could attain its energy independence goal (Zou et al., 2020).Fast economic and population growth coupled with high CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are two main reasons that are pushing China for sustainable energy de-velopment. China hosts about one-fifth of the total global population with a fast-growing GDP of over 9%. Over the last two decades, China has undergone tremendous economic growth, which has led to doubling of the consumption of energy resources, and now China is among the world's top energy consumers (CEPPEI, 2018). Thus, for a country with FIGURE 1 (a) Share of different fuel types in primary energy consumption in China during 2018–2019 (b) CO2 emission in China due to burning of fossil fuels during 2006–2018 (c) Share of different energy sources to primary energy supply in China during 2018, 2020 and 2025.

This will help in the social uplift of communities living in China as well as provide macroeco-nomic and raw material security to the state (Althaqeb, 2017; BioFuels, 2019; Zhang & Lis, 2020).According to recently released official economic data, China is unable to control CO2 emissions, since a 2.6% in-crease in CO2 emissions was recorded during 2008–2019 (Figure  1b) and low carbon sources accounted for only 35% of the increase in energy demand (BP,  2020). This share will have to reach 100% or more for emissions to peak and decline, especially as the focus on energy secu-rity limits the scope for switching from coal to gas and oil (IEA, 2020; NBS, 2019). Various regions of China differ considerably in their growth, energy utilization, and CO2 emissions, for example, eastern regions of China have high energy consumption coupled with high CO2 release com-pared to the central and western regions (Dong et al., 2018; Feng & Wang, 2017). Thus, different policies for different regions of China should be formulated and implemented in order to effectively control CO2 emissions.An estimate shows that in China, about 19% of land area is affected with soil erosion, about 75% of lakes are polluted, and 15%–20% of the country's species are endangered (Liu & Diamond, 2005). Climatic change has also pronounced ef-fects on ecosystem structure and functioning coupled with multiple economic loss (CAEP, 2014). The mean annual tem-perature has increased by 1.0°C over the past three decades which is higher than the global average (Wang et al., 2010). Furthermore, the pattern and spatial distribution of rainfall has also significantly changed over the years although no sig-nificant alteration in annual precipitation has been observed as a whole (EC-TCNARCC, 2015; Wang, et  al.,  2010). Further intensification of this climatic scenario is predicted in the upcoming years. The economic losses caused by the burning of fossil fuels in China are shown in Table 1.Bioenergy production has increased in China after emer -gence of renewable energy law in 2007. By 2020, bioenergy accounts for approximately 14% of total primary energy of the China while in 2025, this contribution will rise to 19% (CNREC, 2019) (Figure 1c). Owing to the limited cultivatable land area, China has implemented a national land policy that enforces sustainable and planned use of land resources. To prevent further squeezing of cultivatable land, China is pro-moting the cultivation of non-grain feedstock for bioenergy production on marginal lands. Since 2007, the Chinese gov -ernment has prohibited cultivation of bioenergy crops on land that is being used for cultivation of food crops to avoid food insecurity. A study demonstrated that growing energy crops on crop land could increase food prices by about 0.1% (Weng et  al.,  2019) while planting energy crops on marginal land could enhance non-grain feedstocks by 10% and save about 0.217% of croplands (Tang et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 2011). Thus, China needs to promote non-grain feedstock on mar -ginal land in order to achieve its energy independence, as well as to prevent food insecurity and environmental damage.In the early 1990s, renewable energy in China was only developed to fulfil shortage of small-scaled agricultural fuels and thus policies at that time were focused on construction Environmental external costBillion (CNY)Environmental external costBillion (CNY)Health loss from coal induced air pollution267 Clean cost 3.41Health loss of coal mine workers 93.4 Coal mining sewage treatment3.14Timber loss 53.07 Gangue land use 1.43Reduction of crops 50.39 Gangue self-burning loss 0.97Environmental damage from railway transportation42.57 Local resident emigration 0.65Underground water damage 34.42 Environmental loss of agriculture land0.14Soil and water run-off 20.07 Dispersion of coal dust 0.13Coal loss during railway transportation10.67 Planting cost 0.12Coal loss during uploading 9.32 Grassland degradation 0.1Coal loss during unloading 8.72 Biodiversity loss by deforestation0.05Land sink 6.68 Soil damage by gangue 0.01Ecology loss by deforestation 4.34TABLE 1 Economic Cost for Burning Fossil Fuels in China (CAEP, 2014) 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

The specialized policies or guidelines for the development of renewable energy and en-vironmental regulation evolved during the 1990s through to 2005, and among them, a major breakthrough was the devel-opment of the renewable energy law in 2005, which was later amended in 2007. After the passing of this law, various regu-lations were adapted to promote bioenergy at a national scale, yearly targets and mandates were set, and many incentives and feed in tariffs were introduced (Schuman & Lin, 2012). Afterwards, renewable energy production and promotion was incorporated into a series of 5 year, medium and long-term plans. This uplifted bioenergy in China as incorporation of bioenergy production in China's 5 year plan produced more effective results than other laws. A recent example is due to these efficient policies and regulations, China has achieved its renewable energy target set in the 13th 5 year plan well before 2020 (NDRC, 2017). Many other laws for bioenergy promotion and environmental regulation and protection were brought into action. A Clean Energy Consumption Action Plan was issued in 2018 for better utilization of available renewable energy resources and to reduce waste. For each region of China, minimum targets for renewable energy con-sumption were set in order to solve power integration prob-lems in 2020 (NDRC,  2018). To cope with environmental constraints caused by the burning of fossil fuel, the Chinese government has introduced a farmland protection policy and the law of land administration. The objectives of both were to facilitate land storage and reforestation as well as to improve the quality of the environment. The State Council of China set a limit of 120 Mha of cultivable land and imposed quin-tupled tax on cultivatable land if used for non-food purposes and forbidden use of grains and green grain crops for biofuel production after 2007 (Zhao, 2018). The progress in bioen-ergy policy during the last decade is shown in Figure 2.2 | INCENTIVE AND INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE BIOENERGY FEEDSTOCK ON MARGINAL LANDVarious soil and environmental characteristics can be used to define soil marginality, for example, marginal soil has poor quality water or may be drought or salt affected, it may have poor soil properties, undesired texture and topology, a steep slope, compactness, imperfect drainage and may have adverse climatic conditions with low or no potential for food crops. Many definitions for soil and land marginality were put forward, but these differ from one area to another and also for one crop to another. Generally, marginal lands include con-taminated brownfields such as lands affected by soil pollutants like heavy metals and pesticides (Smith et al., 2013), agri-cultural lands with low productivity, degraded lands (Tilman et al., 2006) and lands used to dispose city or industrial waste (Nixon et  al.,  2001). Thus, food production from marginal land is not possible till effective management practices are employed. China is focusing on the use of marginal lands for bioenergy production and employing many management and economic policies to reduce marginality and to promote bioenergy feedstock production on these lands. Although the Chinese government has employed many incentives for bio-energy production from food-based feedstock, a clear policy about the promotion of non-grain feedstock on marginal land is still lacking (Chen et al., 2016). Many incentives were of-fered by the Chinese government to promote bioenergy feed-stock. A renewable energy development fund was established to support renewable energy producers and offer them spe-cial subsidies (MOF, 2011). Generally, bioenergy subsidies offered by the Chinese government can be divided into front end subsidies supporting energy crop production, promotion and rural development, and backend subsidies that facilitate FIGURE 2 Evolution of bioenergy policy in China during 2007–2019. VAT: Value added tax 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Specifically, bioethanol-based subsidies can be either fiscal subsides of-fering support to energy-oriented enterprises, subsidies for feed-in engineering of biomass and subsidies for operation and maintenance of independent power generation systems (MOA, 2007). Similarly, in 2014, a notice for exemption of excise tax and reimbursement of value added tax was issued for bio-based fuel ethanol production.Plantation of oleaginous nut-bearing plants was per -formed across many provinces of China by the State Forestry Administration comprising of an approximately 800,000 ha area with capacity of producing 6 million tons of biodiesel in order to promote feedstock for biodiesel production (Zhao, 2015).Many problems including expensive reclamation of marginal land, extra expenses on transport of feedstock to production plants and limited irrigation facilities hinder pro-motion of non-grain feedstock produced on marginal lands (Qiu et al., 2012b; Zhuang et al., 2011). Thus, for effective management of marginal land in addition to identifying the exact reason for marginality based on economic factors, soil health and environmental criteria, a detailed review of the ex-isting soil, water and agriculture policies to promote energy production special incentives must be conducted and offered to stake holders for efficient promotion of non-grain biofuels (Qiu et al., 2012a; Yu et al., 2019). Furthermore, the lengthy and time-consuming process of approving subsidy payments that involve multiple institutions needs to be shortened for investors to get maximum benefit (ICE, 2018).Conversion technologies are vital for promotion of non-grain feedstock promotion as these are key challenges for commercial biofuel producers (Qiu et al., 2012b). In China, ethanol production from cassava, sweet sorghum and sweet potato accounts for more than 70% of total production cost (Zhao et  al.,  2015). Therefore, the Chinese government should offer subsidies on conversion technologies involved in the bioethanol production process that can enhance input to product conversion ratio (Chen et al., 2016). Finally, a strong research–extension–farmer network must be established to ensure that the biomass producer or farmer can get maximum benefit. In order to gain maximum benefits from improved technologies, there is a dire need for capacity building of the extension staff. Therefore, for effective promotion of non-food-based biofuel from marginal land, future policies for the Chinese government must focus on effective marginal land utilization, feedstock improvement, and planting and conver -sion technologies improvement (Ge & Lei, 2017).3 | STATUS OF BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IN CHINARenewable energy has a significant contribution in China's plan for low carbon economic development. During the past 20  years, China has significantly increased its renew-able energy development potential and reduced the cost of renewable energy production. As a result, China has incorpo-rated 14.3% share of renewable energy to its primary energy consumption that is very close to the 15% share which was planned during the 13th 5 year plan. In the next 5 year plan, China aimed for 20% share of renewable energy towards total primary energy consumption (EPPEI, 2019). In 2019, biofuel production in China was 111.3 PJ, which is 6.6% higher than 104.4 PJ production in 2018, while biofuel con-sumption in 2019 was 110.8 PJ, which is 10.4% lower than 99.3PJ in 2018 (BP, 2020). Fuel ethanol production in 2019 jumped to a record 3.4 million tons up 1.1 million tons, due to new production facilities that began operations in 2018 and FIGURE 3 Incentive and subsidies offered by the Chinese government to promote bioenergy and non-grain feed stock 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License26 |   QASEEM And WU2019. Currently, Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia are major contributors to China's bioenergy accounting for 9.65%, 9.24%, 8.15% and 7.63%, respectively, while Tianjin and Shanghai accounted for 0.02% and 0.01% of total bio-mass energy (Figure  4a). Forest biomass is the largest contributor to this biomass energy and shares 82% to total bi-omass energy followed by grassland which accounts for 16% of biomass energy while crop land accounts for 2% of total bioenergy. Forest land in Yunnan province contributes the maximum, which is about 11% to total forest base biomass energy while grasslands from Tibet (33%), Qinghai (22%) and Xinjiang (16%) show maximum contribution to biomass energy. Crop land from Henan and Shandong provinces has maximum contribution to current bioenergy (Figure  4b). Recent estimates show that rice, wheat and maize residues contribute maximum to biomass energy compared to other crops while timber and shrubby forest residues contribute maximum to biomass energy (Figure 4c,d).Incorporation of 20% bio-based energy to total primary energy consumption by 2030 as planned by the Chinese government requires an additional 800–1000 GW renew -able energy, which is equal to the current size of the entire electricity grid of the United States. Recently, China has re-leased its 14th 5 year plan (2021–2025) with ambitious but realistic end-targets for renewable energy. During the 14th 5  year plan, the Chinese government aims to achieve 19% non-fossil energy to total energy content, reduction of energy intensity by 21% and reduction of CO2 emissions by 27%. Currently, fossil energy accounts for almost 86% of the total energy mix while renewable energy accounts for 14% of the total energy mix. The Chinese government plans to reduce fossil fuel-based energy to 58% and promote biofuel energy to 42% by 2020 (CNREC, 2019) (Figure 5a, b). The 3 year pollution control plan released by the State Council in 2018 emphasizes the reduction of air pollutants particularly in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta re-gion and the Fenwei Plain region, in terms of reduction in PM2.5 content and the number of days of heavy pollution and air quality improvement. An important development during this plan was the incorporation of Shaanxi and Shanxi as tar -geted regions (State Council, 2018).Biomass resources have been exploited extensively in China for electricity and biofuel generation, and the main sources of biomass include crop residues, forest residues with production potential of 300 each and municipal waste with production potential of 210 million tons. A total of 60% of current municipal waste produced in China has potential to produce about 1–2 billion cubic meter of methane if used in landfill methane applications (Kang et al., 2020; NBS, 2019; Zhang et al., 2010). Furthermore, increasing trends in forestry and forest product industries could increase forest and wood residues with a potential of 12,000 PJ per annum by 2020 FIGURE 4 Bioenergy production in China.

China is also diversifying its cellu-losic biofuel feedstock by incorporating new improved bio-energy crops such as cassava and sweet sorghum for ethanol fuel production. In addition to conventional bioenergy crops, China is also promoting other plants that have bioenergy po-tential including Xanthoceras sorbifolia, Pistacia chinensis, Koelreuteria paniculate, Sapium sebiferum, Swida wilsoni-ana, Idesia polycarpa, Rhus chinensis, Euphorbia tirucalli and Vernicia fordii. Biodiesel potential of these oilseed-bearing  forest trees ranges between 20.5 and 123.1 billion litres (Chang et  al.,  2012; Dyka et  al.,  2016; Li et  al.,  2014). In addition to trees, some second-generation energy crops can produce high amounts of biomass and have great potential for biofuel development. For example, a China native C4 perennial grass Miscanthus can grow in all climatic zones of China and produce high amounts of biomass. It can serve as the most prominent domesticated and well-adapted sec-ond-generation energy crop species of China. The govern-ment is planning to produce one billion tons of Miscanthus biomass from approximately 100 Mha of marginal and de-graded land located in Northern and Northwestern China (Sang & Zhu, 2011). Increasing different feedstock resources like energy crops and forest residues can make a significant contribution to biomass energy in China. A recent study pre-dicted that improving bioenergy potential of various energy feedstocks can enhance ethanol production by 85.18% and biodiesel production by 186.62% by 2030 (Chen et al., 2016; Figure 6).4 | MARGINAL LAND STATUS AND POTENTIAL IN CHINAAlthough land resources are very limited in China, a large proportion of its total land area is wasteland. This wasteland has great potential for bioenergy after effective management and reclamation. Wasteland is not suitable for production of food crops owing to occurrence of adverse soil and environ-mental conditions and has potential to be used as an area for no grain feedstock growth (Li et al., 2010; Figure 7). Thus, planting bioenergy feedstock on this type of wasteland is an effective and attractive approach in China and is gaining a lot of attention from the government and law makers.Marginal lands are lands with poor soil where the en-vironmental conditions are not suited for food crop pro-duction but are desirable for production and cultivation of plants with specialized characteristics such as halophytes and woody crops, which can serve as a source of biomass energy development. However, due to huge differences in marginal land selection, accurate definition, identification criteria and data sources from a number of studies from China are needed from different lands as marginal with different feedstock and energy potentials. Furthermore, the total marginal land area also varies due to all these fac-tors (Cai et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2014; Kou et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2008; Zhang, et al., 2012; Zhuang et al., 2011). A recent study divided total marginal land into three main categories, which were aban-doned agricultural land, low productivity and rest land. The abandoned agricultural land accounted for 0.088%–0.404% of total land area of the country and was concentrated in Southwest and Southeast China. The low-productive land accounted for about 5% of total land area and included the western regions such as Tibet and part of Qinghai province. About 12% of total land area fell under the rest of land category and was distributed throughout China with shrub cover, herbaceous cover and sparse herbaceous cover land as the main vegetation types (Li et al., 2017). According to another estimation, 61.1 Mha of marginal land suit-able for biomass energy production was identified (Guo & Hanaki, 2010; Wang & Li, 2011). A survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2008 investigating marginal land resources of China that have potential for energy crop cultivation identified about 34 Mhm2 land area consisting of 7 Mhm2 winter fallowed paddy land and 27 million hm2 FIGURE 6 Predicted potential of various biomass resources of China till 2030FIGURE 7 Province wise distribution of waste lands with bioenergy potential in China along with climatic conditions (Unit: area in 104 hm2) adapted from Li et al. (2010) 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License28 |   QASEEM And WUof wasteland marginal land suitable for bioenergy crop cul-tivation (Kou et al., 2008). Another study estimated 82.3 million hm2 marginal land area was suitable for biomass production out of which 24 million hm2 could be reclaim-able (Yan et al., 2008) and about 7 million hm2 was suitable for bioenergy crops cultivation (Liao & Zhang, 2000; Xu et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1999). Concluding results from multiple studies demonstrate that about 24–163.74  Mha land area in China is marginal and such a huge difference in the data range reveals a high degree of variability in estimation methods and different criteria used to define marginality of land by various researchers. Approximately 16.825%–17.6% of total land area is suitable for bioenergy crop production and cultivation in China (Li et al., 2017). Mainly, many types of these marginal lands are concen-trated in the southwest and northwest of China as well as the northeast of Inner Mongolia (Figure 8a,b).A study in 2015 estimated that marginal lands suitable for bioenergy crops are being squeezed in the past 20  years in China due to human activities and natural factors (Figure 9a,b). They proposed that marginal land suitable for energy plants will continue to decrease in the future and land variation factors should be considered in the evaluation of biomass energy re-sources and industrial layouts (Jiang et al., 2014; Zhang, 2010).As marginal lands differ in their area and climatic condi-tions, they differ considerably in their bioenergy potential. A recent study estimated that total annual geographical potential of energy plants planted on marginal lands was 17.816–19.373 EJ (Li et al., 2017), slightly higher than the previous estimate of 16.107 EJ annually (Shi, 2011). This study estimated that by using conventional and bioenergy crops as feedstock, 290 Mt year-1 of ethanol can be produced from marginal land while growing energy crops on different types of marginal lands including wasteland, land riser/boundary, mining land and roadside land, China can produce 150 Mt of ethanol (Tang et al., 2010). Similarly, two cellulosic crops switchgrass and Miscanthus on 47  M  ha marginal land in China could pro-duce 70–110 Mt ethanol annually. Furthermore, switchgrass could yield 70–110 Mt ethanol while Miscanthus can yield 230–330 Mt ethanol largely depending on conversion tech-nologies (Qin et  al.,  2011). One study predicted that China can produce 152.13 million metric tons of non-food biofu-els by 2030 from multiple resources including planting en-ergy crops on marginal lands (Chen et al., 2016). Based on resource availability, another study concluded that growing energy plants on marginal land could produce 8,905 PJ/year in 2030 (Zhao, 2018). Similarly, production potential of each bioenergy crops on marginal land differs partly due to differ -ent environmental and soil conditions. A study reported cas-sava yield on marginal land in China was 52.51 million tonnes and the energy ratio value varied from 0.07 to 1.44, whereas the net energy surplus of cassava-based fuel ethanol in China was 92,920.58 million MJ (Jiang et al., 2019).

While potential productivity without considering the overlapping areas was 6.81  ×  106 t/yr from X. sorbifolia, 8.86  ×  106  t/year from  C. humilis, 7.18 × 106 t/year from J. curcas, 9.55 × 106 t/year from P. chinensis and 7.78 × 106 t/year from C. wilsoniana. Sorghum varieties grown on marginal lands with low temperature conditions in Inner Mongolia have almost constant biomass yield from different parts and higher total content of hexose and pentose in stems (725.4 g/kg) than leaves (642.3 g/kg) (Diallo et al., 2019). According to an estimation, biodiesel po-tential from energy crops grown on marginal lands in different regions of China will reach 25.57 million metric tonnes with maximum contribution (1,165.73 ten thousand metric tons) from Xanthoceras sorbifolium (Chen et al., 2016).5 | CAUSES OF LAND MARGINALITY IN CHINAVarious regions or cities of China are very vulnerable and at high risk of climate change. Water resources of the country are very limited as a study from 2013 demonstrates avail-ability of only 6% of freshwater resources to feed 21% of the world's population. (Wong,  2013). In addition to high drought stress, overgrazing, deforestation, mining and land conversion have left many regions of the country highly vul-nerable. China is developing strategies of land restoration to cope with frequent floods, desertification and sandstorms in the region near Gobi particularly when considering increased threats from climate change and the need for food and natural resource security (WorldBank, 2006). Major causes of land degradation and/or marginality and their occurrence among various region of China are reviewed below.5.1 | SalinizationSaline soil contains a high enough concentration of soluble salts to influence plant growth (Li, et al., 2016). According to Zhaoyong et al. (2014), the area of salinized soil in China is about 36.93 million ha, which accounts for about one-third of the total arable land. In the oasis basin of Xinjiang in north-west China, the area of salinized soil makes up about 1.05 million ha, which accounts for 33.4% of the total agricultural land in the region, and research has found that the salinity of this area is trending upwards reviewed in Claudio (2018) and Zhaoyong et al. (2014). According to Yang (2006), climate change is another significant driving factor in the salinization of the soil. North and north-east China are becoming warmer and drier, which contributes to the increasing salinization of the region's soils. Wind and air, waterlogging, water used for irrigation and impeded drainage in areas irrigated by con-tinuous flooding are the main reason for land salinization in China reviewed in Claudio (2018)5.2 | AcidificationOne study collected all published data on topsoil pH from 2000 to 2008 and the results showed considerable acidifica-tion of all top soils, especially soils cultivated with cereal or cash crop that received high fertilizer inputs, with an aver-age pH decline of 0.13–0.8 (J. H. Gao et al., 2018). In some areas, the pH values dropped by 0.8 over two decades, with some soils growing high-input cash crops reaching a pH of 5.07. As a comparison, when soil is left under natural condi-tions, it takes at least 100 years to reach this level of acidifi-cation (Gilbert, 2010). Another study in Foshan (Guangdong Province) showed that 90% of the soil samples in the study area had a pH < 4.5, and only 8% of soils had a pH within the range 4.5–5.5 in the year 2008 and 2009 (Hou et al., 2012).5.3 | DesertificationChina now has 261 million ha of soil that is classified as un-dergoing desertification. This corresponds to about 27.2% of the China mainland, and is spread across 528 counties in 18 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, directly affecting some 400 million people (Hao,  2016). Desertification is mostly observed in the provincial regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Gansu, and Qinghai, which together account for 95.48% of the total area of deser-tified lands in China (SFA, 2011).5.4 | SandificationUp to 2014, the total sandification area in China was 172,117,500 ha, which accounts for 17.93% of the total land area and reduces by 990,200 ha. The sandified land in China is distributed in 30 provinces, 920 counties and 8,146 town-ships. It is the most severe in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai and Gansu where the sandification area count was 43.40%, 23.70%, 12.54%, 7.24% and 7.07% of the total sandification area in China respectively (UNCCD, 2017).5.5 | Soil and water erosionThe area of soil and water loss (water erosion) in China in 2011 was 1,293,200 km2. The area of mild, moderate, intense,  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License30 |   QASEEM And WUextremely intense and violent is 667,600, 351,400, 168,700, 76,300 and 29,200 km2, respectively, counting for 51.62%, 27.18%, 13.04%, 5.90% and 2.26% respectively. Most seri-ous soil and water erosion in China takes place in the Loess Plateau of mid-reach of Yellow River and southwestern karst area (UNCCD, 2017).5.6 | MiningAn estimation by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), China, revealed the extent of soil degradation in the mainland, showing that about one-fifth of uncultivated land in China is contaminated with heavy metals (MEP,  2014; Patel,  2014). Mining is the main factor responsible for land contamination as China hosts about 9,000 large- and medium-sized mines and 26,000 small mines (Li et al., 2014). Mining activities result in accumulation of heavy metals in surround-ing lands that not only affect atmosphere quality but also im-pose serious health risks to the population living in nearby areas (Hu et al., 2010). Several mines are located in the Loess Plateau area where they are causing major problems to the soil, environment and public health. Open-cast coalmines are primarily located in the environmentally vulnerable regions of northwestern China, such as Gansu, Shanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi provinces of China (Zhang et al., 2016).5.7 | Forest and grassland lossChina is the main processing hub of forest and forest residues since 2000, since China is now the largest consumer and im-porter of wood and forest-based products (Hoare, 2015). Due to rapid forest and tree loss, China was ranked one of most forest deficient countries in the world with forest cover 9% less than the global forest average of 31% (FAO, 2012). Many factors including overgrazing, urbanization, agriculture, min-ing, high CO2 and nitrogen deposition are responsible for grassland degradation (Veldman et al., 2015). Grasslands in China are either degraded or have very low productivity, and these types of grasslands are present in the western and north-ern provinces such as Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu and Inner Mongolia (Chen & Fischer, 1998).6 | PLANT IMPROVEMENT FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION ON MARGINAL LANDAdverse environmental conditions such as biotic or abiotic stress and soil conditions in marginal land hinder the yield and biomass production of various energy crops that grow on marginal land. Thus, for effective utilization of marginal lands in addition to land management practices, plant im-provement is required to tolerate adverse conditions and pro-duce high biomass (Jones et al., 2015). A bioenergy plant is ideal for cultivation on marginal land if it has the following characteristics, perennial life cycle with C4 photosynthe-sis, long canopy duration, fast growth during spring, high water and light use efficiency and ability to store nutrients in its roots which can be used during adverse conditions (Sticklen,  2008). Thus, breeding for many traits like light interception, photosynthesis, plant architecture and carbon partitioning efficiency could significantly enhance crop biomass production in marginal lands. Herbaceous plants with dense canopies and large leaf area and number yield higher biomass due to deep penetration and interception of light (Boe & Beck, 2008; Fernandez et al., 2009; Song et  al.,  2013). In woody species, vertical growth habit and production of sylleptic branches are also important to attain high plant densities and increase biomass yield per hectare (Dubouzet et al., 2013; Marron et al., 2006; Rae et al., 2004). Two important determinants of efficient biomass synthesiz-ing plants are carbon partitioning efficiency and efficient root system establishment to store high amounts of carbon reserves (Jones et al., 2015; Zhu et  al.,  2010). Change in the expression patterns of sucrose synthase genes or su-crose transporters in plants using genetic engineering can also enhance biomass production (Braun et al., 2014; Yadav et al., 2015). A study on switchgrass showed that overexpres-sion of Sucrose Synthase (PvSUS1) can lead to increased plant height (37%), biomass yield (13.6%) and tiller number (79%). The role of roots in biomass production is less stud-ied because it is costly, time-consuming and technically de-manding, especially in field conditions (Pierret et al., 2016). Two important factors determining plant biomass are the du-ration of exposure, which determines the capacity of plants to capture light, and the stage of plant growth, which deter-mines the ability of plants to synthesize maximum biomass in vegetative tissues before maturity (Jones et  al.,  2015; Salas Fernandez et al., 2009). An ideal bioenergy plant for marginal land must have a long growing season, as well as a developed and dense canopy with lack of or very re-duced reproductive structures (Jones et al., 2015). C4 plants show high sunlight to biomass conversion ability compared to C3 plants due to their ability to prevent photorespiration by sustaining high CO2 concentrations (Mann et al., 2013). Thus, C4 plants are preferred for planting in marginal lands (Schuler et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2010).One common approach is to search and screen bioenergy crops for induced or natural variations to enhance biomass and/or saccharification efficiency of biomass. Generation of chemically and biologically mutated rice with higher biomass and saccharification efficiency has opened up new avenues for bioenergy research to use nonedible organs for bioethanol production (Li et al., 2015). A set of chemically generated  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

A mutant population of Arabidopsis with defec-tive starch-degrading enzymes, modified auxin transport and other mechanisms was generated with increased saccharifica-tion efficiency (Stamatiou et al., 2013).Bioenergy crops produce large amount of lignocellulosic biomass which not only differ in quantity but also in quality. Different types of biopolymers and biochemicals are reported from lignocellulosic biomass of different species, but its ex-traction and processing are difficult and expensive (Isikgor & Becer, 2015; Trindade et al., 2010). Lignocellulosic bio-mass is degraded into different polymers that by the action of various enzymes or treatments are converted into biofuel. Physical and chemical pretreatments coupled with enzymatic digestion and yeast-mediated fermentation of soluble sugars are basic steps in the conversion of plant biomass into etha-nol or biofuel (Carroll & Somerville, 2009; Xu et al., 2012). Plant cell walls, an abundant renewable biomass resource for biofuels on earth, contribute lignocellulosic biomass in a major way (Hao & Loqué, 2017; Isikgor & Becer, 2015). Complexity in structure, mechanical strength and polysac-charide composition has made physical and biochemical di-gestion of the cell wall difficult in nature and recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass has an unacceptably high cost (Felby,  2009; Loqué et  al.,  2015). The cell walls of food-stocks are easily destructible and thus require milder and cheaper treatments to be used as biofuel or other bio-based products compared to other plants. Increasing content of a specific molecule or identifying biopolymers that interfere with digestibility of lignocellulose biomass in bioenergy plant cell walls by using plant breeding and biotechnology approaches could enhance biomass end use for biofuel pro-duction (Haghighi Mood et  al.,  2013; Xie & Peng,  2011). However, identification of one wall polymer is technically difficult as alteration in expression of one gene in mutants could change multiple wall polymers. Systems biology-based analyses of large biomass yielding plant populations have identified three main wall components involved in cell wall synthesis that are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin ( Wang, et al., 2016).Prior knowledge of the chemical constituents of biomass is vital as it may affect the final product composition and energy conversion process. Lignocellulosic biomass with low lignin content can efficiently be converted into ethanol (Weng et al., 2008) due to recalcitrant effects of lignin on bio-mass conversion (Rocateli et al., 2012). Likewise, high ash content in biomass also hinders thermochemical conversion efficiency of biomass (Cassida et  al.,  2005). Thus, under -standing factors affecting biomass conversion such as enzyme inhibition, cellulose accessibility, and enzyme adsorption are vital for bioenergy production. As these factors reduce bio-conversion efficiency of enzymes, they also provide many opportunities for end-product yield improvement through feedstock genetics coupled with process engineering (Feltus & Vandenbrink, 2012).7 | BIOMASS RESOURCES OF CHINA7.1 | Food cropsCorn grain ethanol is one of the most important first-generation  biofuels. Its lifecycle GHG emissions are higher than cel-lulosic ethanol due to its potential land use change impacts (Dunn et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2016). Yet in many countries, including China, corn ethanol has been limited to avoid com-petition with food production. Corn grain ethanol currently accounts for 82% of China's first-generation petrol, while Cassava 's dried chip and wheat kernel accounts for 13% and 5% of food crop biofuels (USDA, 2019). In 2007, the government banned the use of grain for the potential expan-sion of biofuel production due to increasing concerns about the effects of biofuel expansion on food security. The use of these feedstocks in the light of competing uses, especially livestock feed, must be considered carefully. Increasing the use of bioenergy to substitute fossil fuels will minimize air pollution such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (Fan et al., 2007).7.2 | Agricultural residuesStraw and stalks from various food crops such as rice and wheat produced as by-products during cultivation and har-vesting practices are the main components of agricultural straw (Zhao,  2018; Figure  10). China has made excellent progress in grain and straw production over the last three decades and an estimate shows that crop residues will reach 545 million tons in 2020 (Wang et al., 2010). As crop resi-dues are by-products of crop cultivation, production and col-lection, and utilization of straw does not compete with crop land resources and serves as an effective resource of renew-able energy generation. As China is among the top ranked rice and corn producers, it can produce large amounts of crop residues annually. Proper utilization of crop residues in the future could make a significant contribution on reducing fossil-based reliance of the country. Crop residue production and its energy potential is investigated by many researchers both at the province level (Liu et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et  al.,  2019)  as well as nationwide  (Catania,  1999; Xiaoguang Chen, 2016; Jiang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2008; Qiu et  al.,  2014; Zeng et al., 2007). China produces about  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License32 |   QASEEM And WU600–800 million tons of crop residues annually; however, for regional bioenergy development, a deep assessment of types of crop residues and production potential is required (Gan & Yu, 2008). Furthermore, some parts of crop residues are burned in fields by farmers whereas some portion of total crop residues are kept as leftovers to improve soil fertility and prevent erosion (Bi et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2012; Shi, 2008).7.3 | Energy cropsCellulosic bioenergy crops in addition to bioenergy pro-duction can also minimize the environmental costs (Qin et al., 2011; SANG & ZHU, 2011; Figure 10). Many regions of China have started planting cassava and sweet sorghum as sources of cellulosic biomass recently (USDA,  2015). Cassava has accounted for around 35% of China's total bioethanol production capacity (Baeyens et al., 2015). Due to the limited areas in China, cassava cultivation is concen-trated in Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Yunnan, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. The six provinces yield about 97% of total cassava output with maximum contribution (about 60%) from Guangxi Province (Fu et al., 2018; Ming-yu, 2008).The Ministry of Agriculture increased cassava planting area to 1 million hectares in 2015 and established the world's first large-scale cassava ethanol producing plant in Guangxi by China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) with annual production capacity of 200,000 metric tons (Nesbitt et al., 2011). From 2010 to 2019, cassava-based bioethanol production increased from 1,009 thousand million litres to 1,424 thousand million litres while cellulosic bio-mass-based bioethanol production increased from 240 to 450 thousand million litres during 2012–2016 (USDA, 2019).China is a major centre of sorghum diversity and mainly cultivated in the northern and northeastern regions of the country. Various breeding approaches are employed in China to develop a vast diversity of sorghum, and these hybrid va-rieties exhibit higher biomass production than their parents (Burow et al., 2012; Mathur et al., 2017; Zhang, et al., 2010). In northern China, sorghum showed high energy efficiency coupled with high economic returns at saline-alkali land (Liu et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2012). A study revealed that ethanol production from Sorghum can be increased to 244.0 × 104  t/year if whole grain sorghum is replaced by sweet sorghum. Addition of this amount of ethanol to the overall system will satisfy 63.2%–84.9% of the country's current demand of E10 (Zhang, et al., 2010). A recent study estimated that the suit-ability of marginal lands from different regions of China for sweet sorghum plantation. Results revealed that biofuel po-tential of sweet sorghum in high-slope farmland (0.30–0.73 EJ) and marginal land (11.98–15.18 EJ) can satisfy the bio-fuel goal in 2050 (6.70–8.60 EJ). Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan are the most suitable provinces for sweet sor -ghum production (Nie et al., 2019).South China hosts the most sugarcane production which is increasing. Over the last few decades, the highest expan-sion in sugarcane production has been seen in Guangxi and Yunnan Province while in Guangdong, it is decreasing due to the development of non-agricultural industries having higher potential than sugarcane (Peng et  al.,  2014). Many commercial sugarcane varieties developed in China dif-fer in their sucrose content or cane yield or both and these include Funong95-1702, Yuetang93-159, Yuetang94-128 and Guitang94-116. For example, sucrose content of Yuetang93-159 increased up to 31.86% and cane yield was 26.6% higher than major commercially grown ROC10 cul-tivar when planted under the same environmental conditions (Guishui, 2009).The latitudinal range between ∼25–35°N and ∼110–120°E in China is considered a diversity hotspot for Miscanthus and distribution of species varies with latitude, for example,  M. lutarioriparius grows at 30°N while M. sacchariflorus grows between 30 and 45°N (Sun et al., 2010). Liaoning Jilin and Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan provinces are habitat of M. sinensis while M. floridulus grows in Anhui and Hubei and M. sacchariflorus is concentrated in northern Jiangxi and Hunan provinces (Sacks et al., 2013). Furthermore, marginal lands distributed in central part of Northeast China and the Loess Plateau are priority zones for cultivation of Miscanthus FIGURE 10 Biomass resources of China 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 33QASEEM And WUas a bioenergy crop. A study found that there was about 27.6 Mha of marginal land suitable for energy production with a total annual production of 0.41 billion tons of biomass in the Loess Plateau of China. Furthermore, soil carbon sequestra-tion was 9.3 Mt C year−1 and they predict that it will take only 0.97  years on average to repay the carbon debt (Liu et al., 2016).Switchgrass is a perennial C4 plant with efficient pho-tosynthetic pathways (Lewandowski et al., 2003) and has advantages over annual crops to produce cellulosic bio-mass because it does not require annual establishment. This property not only provides the necessary economic and net energy inputs (Mitchell et al., 2008) but also reduces the risk of soil erosion (Ma et al., 2000). Nineteen differ -ent switchgrass cultivars/lines were tested in the Loess Plateau located in Northcentral China with altitudinal range between 34° and 41°16´N and 101°–114°33´E with yield potential from 9.5 to 5.6  Mha reviewed in Cooney et al. (2017). A recent study demonstrates that total of 284 dry weight Mt/year of switchgrass could be obtained from 30 Mha marginal land with technical potential of 5.1 EJ/year (Zhang et al., 2020).Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) is a mem-ber of the sunflower family native to North America and is well adapted to marginal lands specifically to salt effected and drought prone lands. Thus, it is selected as a cover crop for large-scale cultivation in saline–alkaline soils or coastal shoals (Long et al., 2010; Rossini et al., 2019). Due to its strong adaptability, Jerusalem artichoke is widely distrib-uted in China as a cultivated crop (Taha et al., 2012). Its ethanol yield ranges from a minimum of 1,500  l/ha to a maximum of 11,000  l/ha (Lachman,  2008). The average net calorific value of dry biomass harvested in autumn could be up to 18.0  MJ  m2, compared to the spring fig-ure of 18.5  MJ  m2 (Rutkauskas,  2005). The net calorific value can also be expressed as 14.6 kJ g (Long et al., 2016; Vacek,  2013). It is well suited for marginal lands in arid or semi-arid conditions in China and usually preferred to be cultivated on Loess Plateau in China along with Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shanxi provinces. Jerusalem artichoke  has high tolerance to drought, diseases and insect pests, and can survive between –40 and –30°C. In the west re-gion of Heilongjiang Province, Jerusalem artichoke can have a tuber yield of 30–45  t/hm–2, even up to 75–150   t/hm–2 (Long et  al.,  2016; Shi,  2010). Erianthus arundi-naceus (Sweetcane) is a tall, perennial crop that prefers to grow in hot climates and is native to southern China. It is considered an important genetic source for the sugarcane breeding programme. The species is related to taxa in  Miscanthus,  Narenga,  Saccharum and  Sclerostachya, so it is considered a member of the ‘sugarcane complex’ (Amalraj & Balasundaram, 2006; Wang et al., 2019).All sweetcanes were found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China, specifically in the regions east of the Tibetan Plateau, south of Huai River–Qinling Mountains line. Sweetcane was gen-erally found below an altitude of 1,500 m; however, it could be distributed up to 2,350 m (Yan et al., 2009). Sweetcane had a relatively high biomass yield when compared with other bioenergy plants grown in the same environment (Singh et al., 2015; Zeng, 2013). The high yield of sweet-cane corresponded to growth conditions, planting time and harvest time (Palmer et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2014). For instance, sweetcane biomass yield in test field reached to 43.76 t/ha in Huaihua, Hubei, while it gave 38 t/ha when tested at Changsha, Hunan. When tested at Nanning, Guangxi, the biomass yield was 11.27–25.16 t/ha while in constructed wetland, it produced 9.5 t/ha biomass (Hou et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2013. A study on 20 sweetcane varieties cultivated in Sichuan Province showed that coefficient of dry matter production per plant was 25% (Liang, 2011).7.4 | Forest resourcesForest tree biomass energy is a kind of energy stored in the forest. It has the characteristics of less pollution, low ash content and is renewable, and the forest tree can effectively absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during the growth process. Therefore, the forest tree biomass energy reduces greenhouse gases and plays an important role in platoon-ing. China is very rich in forest resources, with forest area of 207,690,000 HM2, and total standing stock volume of 16.433 billion m3 (SFB,  2019). Abundant forest resources have laid a good foundation for the development and utilization of forest biomass energy in China. Many researchers have analysed and evaluated the status of forest biomass energy resources, mainly focusing on the evaluation of the poten-tial of forest biomass energy resources in micro-regions, and the evaluation of the potential of specific types of forest bio-mass energy resources (Fu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). A study in 2015 estimated potential of different types of forest residues form China. Total potential of these residues was 169 million tons with maximum contribution (38%) of wood felling and bucking residues followed by wood processing residue which accounted for 37% of total residue potential. East China shares maximum (39%) to these forest residues followed by Southwest (17.4%) and South China regions (16.3%) while Shandong displays the highest contribution to biomass po-tential accounting for about 11.9% of total resources (Zhang et al., 2015).Forest-based bioenergy development is favoured because it does not compete with agricultural crops for land resources and thus avoid food versus fuel competition. According to strategy of the Chinese government, all new forests will be  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Approximately 54 million ha area of the country com-prising of barren and waste land is suitable for plantation of bioenergy forests (Peidong et al., 2009; Zhuang et al., 2010). In addition to small-scale energy plants including shrubs, trees can be planted on marginal lands. A survey by SFA in 2011 reported that 12 Mha land suitable for bioenergy tree plantation is available and distributed across 21 provinces of China (Schweers et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013; Zhuang et al., 2011).Trees with bioenergy potential show high diversity and about 30 woody plant species with about 40% oil content in their biomass have been reported in literature. Major advantage of these oil-bearing plants is they have a long harvest period and are well adapted to diverse and harsh climatic conditions so they have great potential for plan-tation at marginal lands (Shao & Chu, 2008).  Metroxylon sagu, Manihot esculenta, Jatropha curcas, Sindora glabra, Cornus wilsoniana, Euphorbia tirucalli, Pistacia chinen-sis, Camellia oleifera, Garcinia multillora, Simriaondsia chinensis, Cinnamomum pauciflorum, Sapium sebiferum, Sapindus mukorossi, Swida wilsoniana, Vernicia for -dii and Xanthoceras sorbifolia are some important forest plants with bioenergy potential and their composition and spatial distribution in China has been reviewed (Zhang et al., 2012). Jatropha is also forest-based bioenergy crop of China.The cultivation area of Jatropha in China was 0.15 mil-lion ha in 2008 and 95% of cultivation area lies in Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan Province. The Jatropha seeds con-tain 27%–40% of oil which have the ability to produce fine quality biodiesel (Weiguang et  al.,  2010). The Chinese government is promoting Jatropha cultivation at multiscale involving a number of ministries, agencies and bureaus at the national, provincial and municipal levels. For example, development and utilization of Jatropha resources in Jinsha hot-dry valley region (2002–2004) and energy crop devel-opment and utilization in Southwest China (2004–2006) are two of many Jatropha biofuel producing projects in China (SFA, 2011; Yang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addi-tion to Jatropha, seeds from Quercus  have high starch con-tent (about 50%) and Quercus  trees are planted on about 18 million ha with annual production potential of 10  Mt with theoretical ethanol yield 2.5 Mt. Radix pueraria con-tains about 30% starch content and has annual production of 1.5  Mt. (SFA,  2011; Jun Yang et  al.,  2013). Poplar is another important bioenergy plant that is planted in south temperate central areas of Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces. The area of plantation of Populus in these provinces is about 600,000 km2 (Fang et al., 2005, 2010). Recent estimation has shown that it is planted across 825.49 thousand M ha, account-ing for 10.9% of the national plantation area (SFB, 2019) Furthermore, poplar is also used for intercropping with conventional crops like wheat, corn and soybean cropping systems. A study aimed to compare the effects of three pop-lar intercropping designs and two intercropping systems (wheat–corn cropping system and wheat–soybean cropping system) on biomass production and C stocks in poplar in-tercropping systems revealed that poplar biomass increased with increasing tree density, ranging from 8.77 to 15.12   t/ha (Fang et al., 2010).7.5 | Forest residuesWoody biomass from forest resources makes a significant contribution in China's sustainable energy development. A recent estimate revealed that forests account for 22.96% of total land area with capability of about 18.802 billion tons biomass production and carbon stock of 9.186 billion tons (SFB, 2019). The annual production of forest residues was 197.2 Mt per year 2011, and in combination with fire wood and shrub residues, these can reach 300 Mt per year (Zhou et al., 2011). These residues were 257.44 Mt with annual potential of 54.69 Mt in 2016. Of total wood resi-dues, 43.34% (98.83 Mt) was contributed by forest pruning residue, 16.39% (37.37 Mt) was contributed by wood log-ging residue and 18.73% (42.72 Mt) was contributed by wood bucking residue. In addition to natural forest, planted forest also made a significant contribution to the country's biomass yield, for example, planted bamboo processing residues and waste bamboo accounted for 21.26 Mt and 1.60 Mt to total forest-based biomass respectively. Three provinces namely Guangxi, Yunnan and Fujian contribute 17.88–32.66 Mt, highest among all provinces, to total for-est-based residues (Fu et al., 2020). Generally, Southeast, Southwest, Northeast and Xinjiang are hotspots for pro-duction of forest-based wood biomass production, though these can be collected throughout the country (Yanli et al., 2010).7.6 | Other plants with bioenergy potentialMany halophyte species were found effective for biomass and energy production, in addition to various other advan-tages, they can be irrigated with contaminated water with-out affecting biomass yield (Sharma et al., 2016). They show high biomass and grain yield in saline condition com-pared to other crops, for example, Salicornia bigelovii a halophyte can produce 18 tons of biomass per hectare and two tons per hectare of seeds when grown on saline lands (Glenn et al., 1991). Many drought tolerant species have the ability to yield high biomass in drought prone areas, for example, higher tolerance to drought, disease, insect  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Mangroves in China are mainly distrib-uted in the southeast coastal tropical, subtropical coastal harbours, estuary bays and other sheltered waters. North from Hainan Island, with the gradual rise of latitude, the cli-mate belt from the central tropics (southern Hainan Island, the northern Leizhou Peninsula and the southern part of Taiwan), the South Asian tropics (Guangxi, Guangdong, Northern Taiwan and Fujian Province, the southern coastal areas of Fujian Province) (Baowe, 2014). China host 502 species of halophytes belonging to 218 genera and 71 fami-lies (Lin, 2004; Zhao, 2005; Zhao et al., 1999). Rhizophora mucronate, Rhizophora stylosa, Pongamia pinnata, Cerbera manghas, Barringtonia racemosa, Vitex trifolia Linn. var. simplicifolia, Clerodendrum inerme, Excoecaria agallocha, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Avicennia marina, Nypa fru-ticans and many other mangrove species have bioenergy potential (Hui-Min et  al.,  2012). In addition, many fibre plants, starch containing plants and algae can also serve as an effective source of forest-based bioenergy. There are many advantages in using algal biomass. It has a greater ability to produce biofuel than other grain and non-grain crops (Tan et al., 2015). A study in 2011 revealed that a hectare of algae has the ability to produce 20,000 gallons per year of biodiesel compared to 18 gallons by 1 hectare of corn and 700–800 gallons by 1 hectare of palm trees (He & Yang., 2014).8 | MARGINAL LAND MANAGEMENT TO ENHANCE BIOMASS FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTIONIt is usually difficult practically to convert marginal lands into biomass producing lands due to their heterogeneous na-ture. Multiple factors including poor soil structure, soil deg-radation, site abandonment or environmental contamination may be responsible for marginality so multiple factors need amendment. Furthermore, these lands differ considerably in their quality and productivity and plant requirement of these factors differs with species, so it is not possible to use the same marginal land for multiple crops (Campbell et al., 2008; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011). Many strategies are employed by farmers and other stakeholders to im-prove productivity of marginal lands, including harvesting of cover crops for biofuel production (Austin et al., 2017; Qi-Qi et al., 2015), establishment of perennial biofuel crops in the edges of field filter strips (Cibin et al., 2018) (Figure 11).Establishment of a bioenergy crop on marginal land with adverse conditions is the first and most vital step for its sus-tainable production. Many management practices including seed quality, plantation time, row spacing, weed manage-ment and seeding rate must be considered for effective en-tablement of any crop at marginal land. To conserve soil moisture content and to prevent soil erosion, a zero-tillage planting of energy crops is preferred (Douglas et al., 2009). Row spacing also has a vital role in crop establishment and biomass generation, for example, in the case of switchgrass narrow spacing could increase biomass yield per unity and FIGURE 11 Marginal land management strategies 17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Furthermore, pre-emergence application of a non-selective broad-spectrum herbicide is an effective and broadly used strategy for weed management (Douglas et al., 2009).Planting a mixture of bioenergy crops or energy crop and other crops (intercropping) like legumes is also an effective strategy to reclaim marginal land and reduce the cost of ni-trogen fertilizers. The only drawback is planting a mixture of species could create competition for water resources and thus reduce biomass yield. A study from the semi-arid re-gion of the Loess Plateau in China concluded that planting switchgrass with other annual crops lower its biomass yield and water use efficiency. Furthermore, no biomass gain was obtained by adapting 2:1 intercropping row-replacement sys-tem (Xu et al., 2008).Growing cover crops on marginal land and harvesting them for bio-feedstock are an effective way for production of biofuel biomass in sustainably way. This strategy has min-imal or no effects on food crop production as these crops are terminated and incorporated into land before plantation of food or cash crop and thus increase soil organic content and increase water holding capacity and fertility (Blanco-Canqui, 2016). Thus, these cover corps have two purposes; firstly, they enhance the nutrient supply to the soil, and sec-ondly, they enhance lignocellulose biomass for biofuel pro-duction. Land located near edges of rivers and stream is also considered marginal land and these lands are well suited for bio feedstock crop production (Cai et  al.,  2011; Campbell et  al.,  2008; Gopalakrishnan et  al.,  2011). A recent study from Gansu province in Northwest China reported that grow -ing cover crops is one of preferred practice for a sustainable agriculture programme and soil and water conservation (Nong et al., 2020). Crop rotation, another strategy, is an ef-fective approach to sequestrate C in soil and to enhance soil fertility (Hassink, 1995; Jarecki & Lal, 2003). For example, Alfalfa, as a primary rotation legume, is widely grown for animal feed for the fast-growing livestock industry (Wang et  al.,  2008) in the Loess Plateau of northwestern China, while also reducing soil erosion and improving soil fertility and quality (Jun et al., 2014). A recent study reported that the lentil–wheat–maize and maize–flax–pea rotations are the most suitable patterns to optimize simultaneous economic and ecological development of arid and semi-arid regions in China (Wei et al., 2020). Likewise, various other legume plants are planted with food and crops to improve soil fertility and characteristics (reviewed in Zeng et al. (2016)). Recent studies show that certain tree-based intercropping systems exhibit multiple benefits for the environment, such as in-creasing C sequestration and landscape biodiversity (Henry et al., 2009; Palma et al., 2007; Takimoto et al., 2008), as well as for productivity and economic profits (Fang et al., 2005; Graves et al., 2007). A study from a Northwestern Jiangsu province, China, reported that intercropping poplar with food crops could significantly enhance biomass production and improve carbon sequestration (Fang et al., 2010) Likewise, a comprehensive study about Contour hedgerow intercrop-ping in the mountains of China revealed that it contributes to soil and water conservation, soil fertility amelioration, land productivity improvement, bio-terrace formation and gives more options for income generation based on local resources in mountain areas (Sun et al., 2008).Finally, reclamation of marginal lands by plantation pe-rennial, cellulosic species is the most effective approach as it not only provides bioenergy but also helps in ecosystem res-toration. Similarly, biofuel from these plants emits less GHGs than fossil fuels due to the high content of cellulose in their biomass (Farrell et al., 2006). Many other ecological advan-tages can be achieved by planting these species on marginal lands including habitats for wildlife, improve soil health, more carbon sequestration and less competition with food crops (Tilman et  al.,  2006; Williams et  al.,  2013) as these species require fewer fertilizer and pesticide inputs, slow run-off and increased water infiltration (Mann & Tolbert, 2000; Parrish & Fike, 2005). Therefore, in conclusion, mixed plan-tation of perennial grasses, short rotation woody crops, deep rooted plants species and addition of fertilizers and manures are the possible ways to reclaim these marginal lands. China's agricultural support polices have significantly contributed to the increased use of agricultural fertilizers through encour -aging farmers to bring more land under cultivation (Wu et  al.,  2019). For instance, the abolition of agricultural tax by the Government of China in 2006 increased the area of wheat, rice and corn by 10%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. Much of the added land was newly cultivated marginal land with low fertility (Chen et al., 2010).A report from the Ministry of Land Resources of China revealed that due to industrialization, desertification and urbanization, China is about to reach the arable red line. Approximately 25 Mha land area in arid regions of China has salinity and drought problems and thus remains un-cultivatable. Reclamation and proper utilization of saline soils located in arid regions of country has attracted atten-tion from government officials as well as from scientists. Various reclamation efforts have been started to reclaim sa-line soil in northwest regions of China involving a number of mechanical, engineering, chemical and biological meth-ods (Wang et al., 2013). One approach is plantation of salt hyperaccumulating plant species which can accumulate high concentration of salts in their above ground tissues. Literature review revealed that many plant species, for ex-ample, Suaeda maritima and Sesuvium portulacastrum,  have the ability to extract salts from soil and store them in their above ground parts which can later be harvested to re-move salts. Another approach is to use drip irrigation sys-tems that can improve water use efficiency in lands located  17571707, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12770 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 37QASEEM And WUin arid regions (Ravindran et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013). These two approaches coupled with various others can be used to reclaim saline marginal lands form various regions of China for bioenergy feedstock cultivation.9 | CONCLUSIONGrowing energy crops to produce alternative fuels is a promising option in the face of rising demands for fuels, decreasing available land and competition from food versus fuel scenarios. Crop residues from existing croplands and potential energy crops grown on marginal lands may contribute significantly to feedstock supplies for biofuels in China without reducing food produc-tion. Marginal lands account for about 16.8%–17.6% of total land area of China and can produce 17.816–19.373 EJ biomass energy per year. According to recent esti-mates, China still possess approximately 260 million ha of wasteland which can be used for cultivation of bioenergy crops. Forest and agriculture residues and bioenergy plants account for a significant proportion of biomass feedstock in addition to municipal waste and other sources. Many estimations show that China can increase production potential of energy crops and forest residues by 83% and 38.92% on marginal land by em-ploying effective marginal land use strategies. Although China has developed many effective policies for biofuel production, there is still need for encouraging policies. For effective increase in biomass production, govern-ment should allocate more subsidies to the biofuel indus-try. These subsidies should not only focus on the biofuel production but also benefit procedures like planting, harvesting and transportation. Furthermore, for effec-tive feedstock promotion and utilization of marginal lands, improved agricultural management and landscape planning should be encouraged. Finally, a strong need to search potential bioenergy crops and improvement in available bioenergy crops using advanced biotechnol-ogy and molecular biology is required to enhance their adaptability on marginal land.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors are thankful to Shaolong Sun from South China Agricultural University, China, for critical reading and comments.
