The turnover of organic carbon in subsoils. Part 2.Modelling carbon turnoverD. S. J ENKINSONa,b&K .C OLEMANaaDepartment of Soil Science, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, andbDepartment of Soil Science, School of Human andEnvironmental Sciences, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6DW, UKSummaryA new model, RothPC-1, is described for the turnover of organic C in the top metre of soil. RothPC-1 isa version of RothC-26.3, an earlier model for the turnover of C in topsoils. In RothPC-1 two extraparameters are used to model turnover in the top metre of soil: one, p, which moves organic C downthe proﬁle by an advective process, and the other, s, which slows decomposition with depth. RothPC-1is parameterized and tested using measurements (described in Part 1, this issue) of total organic C andradiocarbon on soil proﬁles from the Rothamsted long-term ﬁeld experiments, collected over a periodof more than 100 years. RothPC-1 gives ﬁts to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon in the0–23, 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm layers of soil that are almost all within (or close to) measurement errorin two areas of regenerating woodland (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and an area of culti-vated land from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. The ﬁts to old grassland (the ParkGrass Experiment) are less close. Two other sites that provide the requisite pre- and post-bomb dataare also ﬁtted; a prairie Chernozem from Russia and an annual grassland from California. Roth-PC-1gives a close ﬁt to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon down the Chernozem proﬁle, providedthat allowance is made for soil age; with the annual grassland the ﬁt is acceptable in the upper part ofthe proﬁle, but not in the clay-rich Bt horizon below. Calculations suggest that treating the top metreof soil as a homogeneous unit will greatly overestimate the effects of global warming in accelerating thedecomposition of soil C and hence on the enhanced release of CO2from soil organic matter; more real-istic estimates will be obtained from multi-layer models such as RothPC-1.IntroductionIn this paper, we use data from Part 1 (this issue, Jenkinson et al.,2008) to develop a model for the turnover of organic C in sub-soils. These data came from soil proﬁles located on the Roth-amsted long-term ﬁeld experiments, sampled over a period ofmore than a century. Thermonuclear bomb tests between 1955and 1965 brieﬂy doubled the concentration of radiocarbon inthe atmosphere, inadvertently providing a tracer for the turn-over of C in soil. A good model for C turnover must be able toaccount for secular changes in total organic C and in radiocar-bon before and after the bomb tests. Bomb radiocarbon isa particularly useful tool for investigating soil fractions withlong turnover times (Bruun et al., 2005).Several processes contribute to the movement of organic mat-ter down the soil proﬁle. Roots move downwards through thesoil, releasing exudates and sloughed-off organic material, ulti-mately to die and decompose in situ. Surface litter is moveddownwards by earthworms and similar soil animals. Solubleorganic matter descending from the upper soil horizons can beretained by lower horizons, as in podsolization. On the otherhand, activities by creatures such as moles or ploughmensometimes reverse this downward movement.The ﬁrst approach to modelling the migration of C down theproﬁle (O’Brien & Stout, 1978; Van Dam et al., 1997), is fromthe classical diffusion equation (Atkins, 1986)dC=dt¼Dd2C=dz2; ð1Þwhere C is carbon concentration, ttime, zdistance below thesurface and Dthe diffusion coefﬁcient (distance2time/C01). Thesecond (Nakane, 1978a, b) is based on convective mixing:dC=dt¼/C0 vdC=dz; ð2ÞCorrespondence: K. Coleman.

Elzein & Balesdent (1995) useda model in which both processes were employed. Baisden et al.(2002b) used a three-compartment model, each compartmenthaving a characteristic transfer coefﬁcient that moves C and Ndownwards by advection. A small portion of material from theoldest compartment is passively returned to the surface. Fenget al. (1999) also used advective mixing, but with a single com-partment model.Models for the turnover of organic matter in subsoils mustdeal with the downward movement of C and with the stability ofthat C in the deeper soil layers. Some models (Nakane, 1978a;Van Dam et al. , 1997) assume that the decomposability oforganic C declines with depth; that is, the decomposition rate‘constant’ declines with depth. This is clearly in accord withgross respiration rate measurements (Chiba, quoted inNakane, 1978a; Van Dam et al., 1997; Lomander et al., 1998;Gill et al. , 1999 – apart from the surface layer; Certini et al. ,2003). However, O’Brien & Stout (1978) and Elzein & Balesdent(1995) were able to model downward movement satisfactorilyby assuming that soils contain a passive fraction of great age(and, in O’Brien and Stout’s model, of uniform concentrationdown the proﬁle), plus much younger ‘active’ fractions thatdecrease in concentration with depth, but have the same rateconstants throughout the proﬁle.There is strong evidence that many soils contain a passivefraction of great age that is intimately and inextricably boundto clay and/or amorphous iron and aluminium oxides. Wattel-Koekkoek et al. (2003) showed that soil surface area, which isrelated to both clay mineralogy and hydrous oxide content, isnegatively correlated to14C activity and hence positively toradiocarbon age. Kaiser et al. (2002) and Masiello et al. (2004)observed that the major mechanism protecting subsoil C frombiological attack was its close association with secondaryhydrous oxides in the clay fraction. Likewise, Scharpenseel &Becker-Heidmann (1992), Scharpenseel et al. (1986), Tornet al. (1997) and Paul et al. (2001) all found that radiocarbonage was directly related to clay content. Clay-bound passiveorganic matter is not of course the only stable fraction; manysoils contain carbonized materials such as ancient charcoal,coal or ‘black carbon’ (Schmidt, 2001; Skjemstad, 2001; Daiet al., 2005; Jenkinson et al., 2008).Much recent work has been directed to calculating the con-centration of C down the soil proﬁle from that in the surfacelayer, often by means of an exponential relationship; see forexample Minasny et al. (2006) or Hilinski (2001), whoextended the CENTURY model to subsoils in this way. Thesepapers are about how much C is held in the soil proﬁle; herewe are more concerned with the dynamics of this stock of C.We have two aims in this paper. First, to use data from theRothamsted soil proﬁles to develop a version of the dynamictopsoil model RothC-26.3 that can be applied to subsoils. Oursecond aim is to test the new model on data taken from theliterature, where the necessary measurements (particularly ofpre- and post-bomb radiocarbon) have been made throughoutthe top metre of soil (Baisden et al., 2002b; Torn et al., 2002).RothPC-1: the subsoil version of RothC-26.3RothPC-1 is based on the earlier model RothC-26.3 (Coleman &Jenkinson, 1999), which was designed for use in topsoils, likemost models for the turnover of C in soil. Smith et al. (1997) givea comparative review of nine topsoil models, including RothC.Petersen et al. (2005) discuss contemporary models. The struc-ture of RothPC-1 (the PC standing for proﬁle carbon) is setout in Figure 1. Incoming organic C is partitioned betweentwo compartments, decomposable plant material (DPM) andresistant plant material (RPM), each of which decomposes bya ﬁrst-order process. On decomposition, both DPM and RPMproduce CO2, microbial biomass (BIO) and humus (HUM), inthe same proportions but at different rates, the rate constantfor DPM being greater than that for RPM. Both BIO andHUM decompose by ﬁrst-order processes, again with differentrate constants, to give more CO2, BIO and HUM. Thus theDPM and RPM compartments of RothC-26.3 decompose byBruun et al. ’s (2004) non-feedback pathway, the BIO andHUM compartments by their feedback pathway. Each layerof the soil also contains an inert organic matter (IOM) com-partment, containing C that was in place before the com-mencement of any of the model runs and neither decomposesnor moves during any of the model runs. Different layers arepermitted different amounts of IOM, but the IOM has thesame radiocarbon age (50 000 years, i.e. with a D14C of -998)in all of the layers. This age was chosen so that IOM containsvirtually no radiocarbon. We visualise the IOM compartmentas a receptacle for ancient clay-bound organic matter, but itmay also contain ancient carbonized material such as coal. Inthe model, all ﬁve compartments, DPM, RPM, HUM, BIOand IOM, are deﬁned by the amount of C they contain, notthe amount of organic matter. Like RothC-26.3, RothPC-1uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic C (t ha/C01),microbial biomass C (t ha/C01) and D14C (from which a radio-carbon age may be calculated), on a years-to-centuries timescale.The rate constants in the top layer (expressed for conveniencein year/C01, although the model runs in monthly steps, monthlyrates being obtained by dividing the annual rate by 12) are thesame as those used in RothC-26.3 for the DPM compartment(10 year/C01), the RPM compartment (0.3 year/C01) and the HUMcompartment (0.02 year/C01). The rate constant for the BIOcompartment is 1.5 year/C01, compared with a value of 0.66year/C01in RothC-26.3.RothPC-1 divides the top metre of soil into ﬁve layers, of equalthickness,although inthis paper onlyfourareused.Thesefourarethe historic 9-inch Rothamsted sampling layers, giving layers of0–23, 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm. The input of organic C (fromlitterfall, deadroots,etc.)ispostulated to enter the top layer alone.Turnover of organic carbon in subsoils401#2008 Rothamsted Research LtdJournal compilation #2008 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,59,400–413 13652389, 2008, 2, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01026.x by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Any lag between between photo-synthesis, which creates plant tissue with the current radiocarboncomposition of the atmosphere, andthe timewhen thissame planttissue dies and starts to decompose, is ignored.Effects of vegetational cover, temperature and soil watercontent on the rate constantsThe rate constant for each compartment (except IOM) is mod-iﬁed by a multiplier for vegetational cover, a multiplier for tem-perature and a multiplier for soil water content. When the soil isvegetated, decomposition is slowed in all compartments (exceptCDPM( D' )RPM( R' )IOM( I' ) jC (1-j)CrdD' rrR'p (1-c-d) rdD'Then as D' inshaded box, butwith this effluxp crdD'pdrdD'HUM(H' )BIO(B' ) pcrhH'rhH' rbB'pdrhH'pcrbB'Top layerp(1-c-d) rhH' p drbB'(1-p)rdD' (1- p)rhH' (1- p)rbB'DPM(D'' ) HUM(H'' )BIO(B'' )IOM( I'' )N'' rdD'' N'' rhH'' N'' rbB'' Second layerThen as D' inshaded box, butwith this efflux  Then as H' inshaded box, butwith this efflux  Then as B' inshaded box, butwith this efflux DPM( D''' )HUM( H''' )BIO( B''' )IOM( I''' )N''' rdD''' N''' rhH''' N''' rbB''' Third layerThen as D' inshaded box, butwith this efflux  Then as H' inshaded box, butwith this efflux  Then as B' inshaded box, butwith this efflux   And so on, down to the     fifth layerOrganic inputCO2 CO2p (1-c-d) rbB'CO2Figure 1 Structure of RothPC-1. Incoming organic C is split between the DPM compartment (decomposable plant material) and the RPM com-partment (resistant plant material), with a fraction j going to DPM and (1-j) to RPM. The DPM compartment decomposes with a rate constant rdmonth/C01, the RPM at rrmonth/C01. Most soil organic C is in the HUM (humus) compartment, with a rate constant rhmonth/C01. The microbial bio-mass C compartment (BIO) has a rate constant rbmonth/C01. All four rate ‘constants’ are adjusted (see text) for temperature, vegetational coverand soil water content. The IOM (inert organic matter) compartment contains C that is totally resistant to decomposition. A letter in parenthesesinside a shaded box represents the total stock of C in that box, not the quantity formed each month. Primes indicate layers; thus (H ¢) is the quan-tity of HUM C in the surface layer, (H ²) in the second layer. The factor N, applied to all except the IOM compartment ,slows decomposition inthe lower layers (see text); in the top layer it is 1 and not shown. An oval represents the quantity of C mobilized each month from a particularcompartment. Thus, a quantity rhH¢is mobilized each month from the HUM compartment; of this, a part pstays in the same layer, some ( pcrhH¢) as newly-formed BIO, some ( pdrhH¢) as newly-formed HUM, and some ( p(1/C0c/C0d)rhH¢) is liberated from that layer as CO 2-C and then lostto the atmosphere. A quantity (1 /C0p)rhH¢of HUM moves to the layer below.402 D. S. Jenkinson & K.

This retain-ment factor isappliedtothe toplayeralone and has the samevalue(0.6) as in RothC-26.3. Decomposition rates in all compartmentsand in all ﬁve layers (shown in italics on Figure 1) are modiﬁed fortemperature, using monthly mean air temperatures, exactly as inRothC-26.3. The rate constant for each compartment (exceptIOM) is multiplied by a quantity A, given byA¼47:9=ð1þexpð106 =ðtmþ18:3ÞÞÞ; ð3Þwhere tmis the monthly mean air temperature. It is applied toall model compartments alike – a contentious over-simpliﬁcation, as pointed out by Knorr et al. (2005) and byDavidson & Janssens (2006). This function was set (Jenkinsonet al. , 1987) by measuring the rate of decomposition of thesame14C-labelled plant material in the same soil in two con-trasting climates. One was at Rothamsted, in England (10 yearincubation in the ﬁeld; mean annual temperature 8.9 °C), andthe other was at the International Institute of Tropical Agri-culture Ibadan, in Nigeria (5 year incubation in the ﬁeld; meanannual temperature 26.1 °C; for details see Ayanaba & Jenkinson,1990). The decomposition curves could be almost perfectlysuperimposed if one Nigerian year was equivalent to fourEnglish years. In these experiments with14C-labelled plantmaterial, decomposition was dominated by the HUM com-partment, which makes up by far the largest part of the resid-ual labelled plant C, once the initial months of decompositionare over. The assumption in RothPC-1 that monthly air tem-perature applies to all ﬁve layers is acceptable in the humidtropics, but will be increasingly wrong in higher latitudes,where the swing between seasons is larger and there isa marked seasonal lag in temperature down the proﬁle.Decomposition rates are modiﬁed for the water content ofeach layer as follows.The maximum soil moisture deﬁcit (Max SMD) for each layeris ﬁrst calculated from the expressionMax SMD ¼/C0 ½ 20þ1:3ð%clay Þ/C00:01ð%clay Þ2/C138;ð4Þjust as in RothC-26.3. This is for a layer 23 cm in thickness, with% clay being the clay content of the speciﬁed layer.When the site is vegetated and monthly potential evapotrans-piration exceeds rainfall, each layer, starting from the top andmoving down the proﬁle, dries out until it reaches the Max SMDfor that layer. When the soil wets up again, each layer ﬁlls up toits Field Capacity, starting from the top, and moving, layer bylayer, down the proﬁle. The rules are different when the soil isnot vegetated, for example during the period between harvestand the emergence of the next crop. Then the Max SMD for thetop 23 cm (as given by Equation (4)) is multiplied by 0.556 (justas in RothC-26.3) to give Bare SMD. The top layer is notallowed to dry out further than Bare SMD. If the SMD is alreadyless than Bare SMD, the top layer cannot dry out any further.Lower layers of bare soil do not dry out any further; althoughthey can already be dry, say just before harvest.The rate constants for the DPM, RPM, BIO and HUM com-partments are then modiﬁed for the water content of each layer,exactly as in RothC-26.3. Thus the rate constant is multiplied bya factor that stays at 1 between Field Capacity and 0.444 of MaxSMD as the soil dries out. This factor then falls linearly from 1 at0.444 of Max SMD to 0.2 at Max SMD as the soil continues to dry,but cannot decrease further than this, no matter how dry the soilbecomes. RothPC -1 should be used with great caution on desertsoils. This is because RothPC -1 (an d, for that matter, RothC-26.3)is primed to start in the ﬁrst month after monthly precipitationexceeds monthly evapotranspiration. In very dry places, monthlyevapotranspiration is greater than monthly precipitation through-out the year and the model then runs with the moisture ratemultiplier set at 0.2 throughout. Nor should RothPC-1 be used ifdecomposition is restricted throughout the year by water-logging.It should therefore not be used on undrained peat.Inﬂuence of clay on decompositionIn RothC-26.3 clay content (as % clay) does not directly alter therate of decomposition, as for example, does temperature.Instead, clay has two indirect effects on decomposition: (i) itinﬂuences the quantity of water that the soil can hold and (ii)it affects the ratio (CO2-C evolved)/(newly formed (BIO þHUM) retained in the soil) whenever organic matter under-goes decomposition (Coleman & Jenkinson, 1999). Similarcalculations are made in RothPC-1 for each layer, using theappropriate clay content of that layer (for details see below).Rate constants and soil depthThe rate constants of the DPM, RPM, BIO and HUM compart-ment all decrease with depth. This is done by multiplying theRothC-26.3 rate constant for a particular compartment in thelayer in question by a factor Ncalculated from the sigmoidrelationship:N¼ð /C0 1=ð1þðexpð/C0sðF/C0fÞÞÞÞÞ=ð/C01=ð1þðexpð/C0sð/C0fÞÞÞÞÞ ;ð5Þwhere sis a constant, in cm/C01,Fthe distance, in cm, from themiddle of the top layer to the middle of the layer in question,and fis the distance, in cm, from the surface to the middle ofthe top layer. For the Rothamsted data used in this paper, fisalways 11.5 cm. For the top layer, Fis zero, so Nbecomes 1.The constant s, which slows decomposition as depth increases,was set during ﬁtting (see below).Downward movement of organic CCarbon moves downwards from the DPM, RPM, HUM andBIO compartments (see Figure 1). Upward movement by inver-sion ploughing or bioturbation is ignored. At the end of eachmonth, the amount of C ‘mobilized’ during that month fromTurnover of organic carbon in subsoils403#2008 Rothamsted Research LtdJournal compilation #2008 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,59,400–413 13652389, 2008, 2, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01026.x by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The term ‘mobilized’ coversboth C subjected to microbial attack and C moved to the layerbelow. Consider, for example, the HUM compartment in the toplayer, containing H ¢tCh a/C01. The quantity mobilized ina month is rhH¢, where rhis the rate constant, with dimensionsyears/C01, modiﬁed as necessary by temperature, plant coverand water content. Of this rhH¢, a part pstays in the top layer,some ( pcrhH¢) as newly-formed HUM, some ( pdrhH¢)a snewly-formed BIO and some ( p(1/C0c/C0d)rhH¢) is liberated asCO 2-C and then lost to the atmosphere (Figure 1). The termsp, c and d are dimensionless fractions. A quantity (1 /C0p)rhH¢of HUM moves to the layer below. Similar calculations (seeFigure 1) are done every month for organic C in each com-partment and in each layer, allowing of course for the claycontent of the particular layer.RothPC-1 is internally adjusted so that the quantities ofnewly-synthesized humus and biomass formed during mobiliza-tion from any topsoil compartment are the same as the corre-sponding quantities formed each month in Roth-26.3. This isdone as follows.In RothC-26.3, monthly decomposition in any compartmentgives CO2,BIO and HUM (where BIO denotes newly-formedbiomass and HUM newly-formed HUM) in proportions givenby the equation (Coleman & Jenkinson, 1999):ðCO 2-CÞ=ðBIO þHUM Þ¼1:67ð1:85þ1:60exp ð/C00:0786ð%clay ÞÞÞ ¼ Z:ð6ÞBut, again taking the HUM compartment as an example,rhH¢¼CO 2-CþBIO þHUM : ð7ÞSubstituting and rearranging,ðBIO þHUM Þ¼rhH¢=ðZþ1Þ: ð8ÞTaking the HUM compartment as an example, Figure 1 showsthat in RothPC-1 the ratio between the quantity of CO 2-Cformed in the top layer at the end of one month and the quan-tities of BIO and HUM formed is given by:ðCO 2-CÞ=ðBIOþHUM Þ¼½ ð prhH¢Þ/C0ðpcrhH¢þpdrhH¢Þ/C138=ðpcrhH¢þpdrhH¢Þ:ð9ÞBut we wish to make the quantity of new biomass and HUMformed in the top layer each month the same in RothC-26.3and RothPC-1, so, for RothPC-1:ðCO 2-CÞ=ðBIO þHUM Þ¼½ ð prhH¢Þ/C0ðrhH¢=ðZþ1ÞÞ/C138=ðrhH¢=ðZþ1ÞÞ;ð10Þ¼pðZþ1Þ/C01: ð11ÞIn essence, C is moved downwards, at the expense of CO 2released by the topsoil (Figure 2). Thus, if pis 1, no C movesdown to the layer below and RothPC-1 becomes like RothC-26.3; as pbecomes less than 1, more C moves down the proﬁle,at the expense of CO2. The parameter pcan only vary betweena maximum of 1 and a minimum that depends on the clay con-tent of the layer in question. Thus the minimum is 0.19 fora clay content of 10%, 0.22 for 20% clay and 0.24 for 50%.The model should not be used below the minimum value of pfor a particular clay content; to do so implies that all of the Cmobilized in a month moves downward and none is availablefor microbial attack – a somewhat implausible assumption.As the quantity of C moving down each month is directlyproportional to the concentration of HUM in a speciﬁed layer,RothPC-1 is a variant of the convective mixing model (Equation(2)). Because all C inputs are postulated to enter the top layer, itmight be thought that direct inputs to lower layers from (say)roots are ignored. This is not so: each month some material fromeach of the DPM and RPM compartments is mobilized andmoved downwards (see Figure 1), in effect mimicking directinputs of fresh organic material to lower layers.RothC-26.3 was originally calibrated using long-term ﬁelddata for topsoils (Jenkinson & Rayner, 1977; Jenkinson et al.,1987).

Thedifferences between the two models in the rate constant for theBIO compartment will have little effect on generated valuesfor total organic C, because biomass C is commonly only 1–2%of the total organic C in topsoils. The two models generateidentical outputs for topsoil if the BIO rate constant inRothC-26.3 is changed from 0.66 to 1.5 year/C01.Another advantage of the procedure used to move C down theproﬁle is that movement is assumed to be subject to temperature,soil water content, etc., exactly as is decomposition in RothC-26.3. This is plausible – for example, downward movement is lesslikely in a dry soil or in a very cold soil – although whether theassumption is correct remains to be seen.Fitting RothPC-1 to the dataFor the four Rothamsted sites, rainfall, air temperature andevaporation are 30-year mean monthly values for Rothamsted,as given by Coleman & Jenkinson (1995). The clay contents ofthe four layers on the Broadbalk and Park Grass sites are takento be 23, 30, 50 and 49%, starting from the top; for the Geescroftsite, 21, 43, 55 and 63% (see Jenkinson, 1971). Arable soils underwinter wheat are deemed to be bare in August, September, Octo-ber and November; thereafter vegetated throughout the year.Grassland and woodland soils are taken to be continuously veg-etated. For soils reverting to woodland, the DPM/RPM ratio istaken to be 1.44, the usual value for arable crops and grassland,for the ﬁrst 25 years and 0.25 thereafter, as grasses and herbs diedout and trees became dominant (Jenkinson et al., 1992).The model was ﬁrst run to equilibrium (taken as a run of10 000 years) by iteratively adjusting the annual input of organicC (C in Figure 1) and the size of the IOM compartment (I ¢inFigure 1) to give the measured total organic C and radiocarboncontents of the 0–23 cm layer of the earliest soil (pre-bomb)sample. Using the value of IOM thus found, the annual inputof C was iteratively adjusted to give the best ﬁt to measured totalorganic C in the 0–23 cm layer for all of the following samplings,best ﬁt being deﬁned as that giving least squares of differencesbetween measurement and prediction. Note that the data used inthis ﬁtting did not come exclusively from Jenkinson et al. (2008);some came from Jenkinson et al. (1992).The next stage was to obtain the optimal values of the para-meters pand sfor each site, using the measured values of% modern for each layer to calculate the IOM content of thatlayer. The IOM content of a particular layer is assumed to bealways the same, whenever sampled. An arbitrary IOM con-centration was ﬁrst set for each of the three lower layers. Themodel was then run for a speciﬁed value of pand a speciﬁedvalue of sto give the total organic C contents and the radio-carbon contents (as % modern) of all four horizons for eachof the sampling dates. The modelled radiocarbon content ofeach layer was averaged over all the sampling dates. The aver-age measured radiocarbon content (again as % modern) ofthat layer was also averaged over all the sampling dates. TheIOM content of that layer was then adjusted iteratively untilthe measured and modelled values of % modern were thesame. The procedure was repeated for each of the three lowerlayers. IOM thus calculated was added to the calculated totalorganic C and the initial arbitrary value subtracted. The dif-ferences between the total organic C thus calculated and thecorresponding measured values were squared. The squares forthe three lower horizons (i.e. excluding the 0–23 cm layer) atall the different sampling times were added, to give a sum ofsquares, Q.The parameter pwas varied systematically, eachtime readjusting IOM as described above, until a minimumvalue of Qwas found for the speciﬁed value of s. The parame-terswas then varied systematically and the whole procedurerepeated until a minimum value of Qfor both pand swasestablished. Figure 3 illustrates this process for the GeescroftWilderness site. The best ﬁt values of s(shown as the dottedline on Figure 3) improved as smoved from 0 (i.e. N¼1 andthe rate constants are not affected by depth) to a ﬂat minimumat about –0.06 to –0.07 and then rose again.

In any case, thispaper is about the validation of a subsoil model, RothPC-1. A t-test (as used by Sutherland et al., 1986) was applied separatelyto each of the three layers. The Mean Sum of Squares was cal-culated for each proﬁle, excluding the 0–23 cm layer. Whit-more’s (1991) lack of ﬁt statistic LOFIT was calculated andused to obtain the variance ratio F(¼MSLOFIT/MSE),where MSLOFIT is the mean squares due to lack of ﬁt andMSE is the mean squares due to error in the measurements(Smith et al. , 1997). If Fthus calculated was greater than thecritical 5% value, the discrepancy between measurement andprediction was too large to be explained by errors in the mea-surement alone; the measurements are sufﬁciently precise forfurther improvements to the model to be worthwhile. If Fisless than the critical 5% value, nothing is to be gained froma better model. In pooling data from the 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm layers to obtain Fin this way, we assume that the var-iances are similar in the different layers and the data for eachlayer are independent and normally distributed. Measure-ments made on three different layers from the same samplinghole (as ours were) cannot be regarded as truly independent,so conclusions based on Fshould not be pressed too far.Modelled and measured total C and radiocarbon in theRothamsted sitesTable 1 shows the optimized values for pand sand the result-ing values of total organic C, radiocarbon and IOM for the1999 sampling of the four Rothamsted sites. It should benoted that the statistical tests in Table 1 are based on the 1999sampling alone, because this was the only sampling with errormeasurements. However, the values of p,sand IOM inTable 1 were set using all the data for the 23–46, 46–69 and69–92 cm layers from all the sampling dates, so that they arenot necessarily the best for 1999 alone.In all four sites the top three layers contained about 4 tIOM C ha/C01, with the bottom layer being more variable. ForGeescroft Wilderness, the model gave a ﬁt ( F¼3.0; Table 1)for the total organic C measurements that was less than the5% level of signiﬁcance for errors in the measurements them-selves ( F¼3.8; Table 1). The modelled ﬁt for radiocarbon(F¼5.9) was greater than the 5% level of signiﬁcance for themeasurements ( F¼5.1), so that the model lack of ﬁt was mar-ginally greater than that of the measurements.Total C and radiocarbon are plotted against time for Gees-croft Wilderness (our best site; see Jenkinson et al. , 2008) inFigure 4(a,b). The model consistently overshoots the total Cmeasurements taken in 1965 and undershoots those taken in1999. Differences in sampling procedure may be responsible,although a more likely explanation is that the annual returnsof C to the soil increased during reversion to woodland,whereas the model input is set at 2.76 t C ha/C01year/C01through-out the period 1883–1999. Figure 4b reveals more seriousproblems – at least for the 23–46 cm layer. The radiocarboncontent of this layer is modelled too old in 1883 and too youngin 1999. There was a similar discrepancy in Broadbalk Wilder-ness (not shown). We have no explanation. The model showsthat the deeper the soil layer, the longer it takes for bombradiocarbon to attain its maximum value (Figure 4b). Themodels used by Wang et al. (1999) and by Telles et al. (2003)showed similar lags, but for shallower soil layers.There was a close relationship between modelled and mea-sured cumulative total organic C down the proﬁle of GeescroftWilderness (Figure 5a), which held for both the 1883 and 1999samplings. A similar relationship held for radiocarbon, hereexpressed in units of mass (Figure 5b).For Broadbalk Wilderness and Broadbalk Arable, both tandF-tests indicate that the model predictions for total organic Cand radiocarbon were within the errors in the actual measure-ments, so that there is no gain to be had from a better model.It should be noted that the F-test in Table 1 is insensitive forthe Broadbalk Wilderness and Broadbalk Arable radiocarbondata, with only two replicate measurements per layer; for thesame reason we do not give the tvalues.The discrepancies between measured and modelled data aregreater for Park Grass than for the other three sites (Table 1); inparticular, the modelled value for total organic C in the 69–92 cmlayer of Park Grass is too small, showing up as a very large Fvalue. The best ﬁt was for a pof 0.82 and an sof/C00.07. In cal-culating this ﬁt, the measured organic C contents of the 0–23cm layer were corrected for coal C as described by Jenkinsonet al. (2008); the lower layers were assumed to be coal-free.Aggregating the Park Grass measurements made on differentfertilizer and liming treatments (as in Table 1) could have beena mistake, although attempts to ﬁt the fertilized treatment(plots 14/2c and 14/2d) by itself made little improvement. Wehave modelled Park Grass assuming it was never cultivated,despite the marks of medieval ploughing. Park Grass has cer-tainly been under grass since the beginning of the 18th cen-tury, although this may not have been long enough for organicC to recover after the disturbance caused by ancient cropping.There is evidence (see Jenkinson et al. , 2008, Table 3; thisissue) that organic C has been accumulating throughout theproﬁle over the last 100 years.Errors will be introduced by the assumption in RothPC-1 thatthere is no lag between the uptake of atmospheric CO2by veg-etation, with its characteristic D14C value for a particular year,and the start of decomposition of this plant C in the soil. Thisassumption is not far wrong on the Broadbalk Arable site,where the crop is annual winter wheat and the lag will be lessthan a year. In the old grassland site (Park Grass) the lag willbe a little greater, with some plant roots living for a year ortwo (Jenkinson et al. , 2004). On the calcareous site underregenerating deciduous woodland (Broadbalk Wilderness)there is no carry-over of surface litter from year-to-yearbecause of earthworm activity, although there will be a lag ofa few years between the formation and death of ﬁne roots.

However, inour work, this litter layer was incorporated into the 0–23 cmmineral soil layer prior to anal ysis. The modelled radiocar-bon content (expressed as % modern) of the 0–23 cm layersampled in 1999 from Geescroft Wilderness was 103.8% (seeTable 1); had there been a 5-year lag it would have been105.0%, a difference of only 1.2%. The corresponding ﬁg-ures for the 69–92 cm layer were 57.0 and 56.9%. Introduc-ing an arbitrary 5-year lag thus made the ﬁt betweenmeasured and modelled radio carbon in Table 1 marginallyworse. Needless to say, a 5-year lag has a greater effect inone of the more dynamic fractions than in soil organic C asa whole. For the same 0–23 cm layer collected in 1999 fromGeescroft Wilderness, modelled % modern in the DPMcompartment was 110.1%; with a 5-year lag, 113.1%.Although lag effects can be important in litter and in thinsoil layers (Hahn & Buchmann, 2004; Torn et al., 2005), theyare small for total radiocarbon in the thick mineral soil lay-e r su s e di nt h i sp a p e r .Downward movement of C at RothamstedThe values of pin Table 1 indicate that a greater proportion ofthe incoming organic matter moves downwards over a year inGeescroft Wilderness ( p¼0.64) than in Broadbalk Wilderness(p¼0.72). This is in accord with the pH of the two sites:downward movement of dissolved organic C is more likely inthe strongly acid Geescroft (pH 4.5 in the 0–23 cm layer in1999) than in the calcareous Broadbalk (pH 7.7). The smallvalue of pin Broadbalk Arable ( p¼0.49) is consistent withsome soil mixing between the top two layers (in the 1980sploughing occasionally went a little below 23 cm) and deeprooting ( c. 1.2 m) by the winter wheat. Organic C is less proneto moves downward in Park Grass ( p¼0.82) than in any ofthe other three sites ( pranging from 0.72 to 0.49). Grasslandsare generally more shallow-rooted than temperate deciduousforest (Jobba ´gy & Jackson, 2000), so that the direct input of Cfrom roots dying in situ will be less in the lower horizons.Table 1 gives optimal values of p(0.72) and s(/C00.08) forBroadbalk Wilderness that are very different to the corre-sponding values for Broadbalk Arable (0.49 and /C00.04,respectively).

It follows that pincreases (i.e.a smaller fraction of the incoming C moves downward) whenploughing ceases and the site reverts to woodland. At the sametime, sbecomes more negative; that is, the restriction ofdecomposition with depth becomes greater.Measured and modelled soil microbial biomassCastellazzi et al. (2004) measured soil microbial biomass C inthe same samples taken in 1999 from Geescroft and BroadbalkWildernesses that are used in this paper. We used RothPC-1 tomodel biomass in these two sites, using an arbitrary rate con-stant (1.5 year/C01) for the BIO compartment; subsequent work(not reported) showed that 1.3 year/C01would have been abetter choice. Although of the right order, agreement is poor,particularly for Geescroft Wilderness, in which the modelledvalues are too large, except for the topsoil (Table 2). The ﬁtfor Broadbalk Wilderness is closer for the 23–46 and 46–69 cmlayers, but not for the other layers. Geescroft is strongly acid(mean pH of the 0–23 cm layer in 1999 was 4.5), witha marked mor layer and no earthworms. Broadbalk Wilder-ness is a slightly alkaline (mean pH 7.7) mull site, with abun-dant earthworm casts and no carryover of litter from year toyear, so it is perhaps not surprising that the same biomassparameters cannot ﬁt both Wildernesses.Although not activated in the present work, RothPC-1 con-tains two biomass compartments that can be independentlytuned. Undoubtedly, much better ﬁts than those in Table 2could be obtained by activating the two compartments andadjusting their rate constants separately for Geescroft andBroadbalk Wildernesses. However, we feel that ﬁne-tuning ofthe biomass parameters in RothPC-1 should await more data onchanges in biomass concentration down a wider range of soilproﬁles. But even this limited incursion into biomass ﬁttings-h-o-ws that it is necessary to slow decomposition with depth ifRothPC-1 is to generate realistic quantities of biomass C inthe lower soil horizons. If this is not done, the biomass in thebottom layer is more than a magnitude too small.Fitting RothPC-1 to other data sets with pre- and post-bomb measurementsThere are very few data sets in which pre- and post-bomb carbonand radiocarbon have been measured in sufﬁcient detail downa soilproﬁletoprovidea critical testbed for RothPC-1.One comesfrom the work of Torn et al. (2002), in which proﬁles taken froma Russian Chernozem in 1900 (or thereabouts) and again fromthe same site in 1997 were radiocarbon dated. The site is in theKamennaya Steppe National Park, with a mean annual temper-ature of 6.4 °C and an annual precipitation of ;420 mm at thebeginning of the 20th century, rising to 520 mm at the end. Thedetailed inputs of monthly mean temperature, monthly pre-cipitation and monthly potential evaporation that are needed torun RothPC-1 were calculated as the means for the three near-est of Mu ¨ller’s (1982) EURASIAN meteorological stations inthe same climatic zone (his sites 67, 77 and 81). The meanannual temperature for these three sites is 6.6 °C, mean annualprecipitation 453 mm and mean annual potential evaporation651 mm. The soil was developed on deep calcareous loess,thought to have been deposited some 4500–6000 years ago dur-ing the mid-Holocene. We tested the model on data from fourlayers (0–23, 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm), calculated by inter-polation from Torn et al.’s own sampling layers.The optimal values for p(0.38) and s(/C00.08) were obtainedby tuning the model to the organic C and radiocarbon data forthe 23–46 and 46–69 cm layers in the 1900 and 1997 sam-plings. Using these values, the model gave a close ﬁt to all themeasurements save those from the 69–92 cm layer (Figure 6).Even though the model had been initiated in the usual way, byrunning it for 10 000 years, the 69–92 cm layer had still notreached equilibrium. In 1997 this layer contained 24 t C ha/C01,but the model predicted only 10 t C ha/C01. If the model is right,the site is too cold and too dry (for much of the year) for the69–92 cm layer to have reached equilibrium, even if soil for-mation had gone on for 10 000 years, as was not the case withthis particular proﬁle. Apart from the bottom layer, this pro-ﬁle appears to contain vastly more IOM than our Rothamstedproﬁles; according to the model the 0–23 cm layer contained11.5 t IOM C ha/C01, the 23–46 cm layer 21.8 t, the 46–69 cmlayer 21.3 t and the 69–92 cm layer 1.6 t. The reason for thelow IOM content of the bottom layer is that the model movesdown so little C into this layer that very little IOM-C is neededto give the right radiocarbon content. It is likely that the loesscontained much IOM on arrival, but we have no idea how thiswas distributed down the proﬁle. This Kamennaya Chernozemis in no way unusual – a Chernozem from the Kursk regioncontained almost exactly the same quantity of carbon in thetop metre of the proﬁle (Mikhailova & Post, 2006).Table 2 Modelled and measured biomass C in the Geescroft andBroadbalk Wilderness proﬁlesSiteLayer Measured biomass Modelled biomassa/cm /t C ha/C01/t C ha/C01Geescroft Wildernessb0–23 0.61d/C60.073 0.5723–46 0.15 /C60.039 0.2946–69 0.12 /C60.027 0.2269–91 0.04 /C60.025 0.17Broadbalk Wildernessc0–23 1.23 /C60.075 0.7623–46 0.31 /C60.008 0.3846–69 0.25 /C60.020 0.3569–91 0.10 /C60.031 0.29aModelled with rate constant BIOF ¼rate constant BIOS ¼1.5 year/C01.bModelled with p¼0.64 and s¼/C00.06.cModelled with p¼0.72 and s¼/C00.08.dIncludes litter layer.Turnover of organic carbon in subsoils 409#2008 Rothamsted Research LtdJournal compilation #2008 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,59,400–413 13652389, 2008, 2, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01026.x by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

We selectedtheir Turlock Lake site from a chronosequence of four alluvialterrace sites in the eastern San Joaquin Valley, with a meanannual temperature of 16 °C and a mean annual precipitationof 300 mm, falling almost entirely in winter. The monthlymean temperature, rainfall and evaporation data needed torun the model were taken from Mu ¨ller’s (1982) North Americaweather site No 85 (Fresno). The soil contained 5–8% clay inthe top 62 cm, increasing sharply to some 40% in the 76–110cm layer (Bt horizon). It was formed on glacial outwash fromthe Sierra Nevada, originally deposited some 0.6 M years ago.The soil had been sampled in 1952 and again in 1997. Baisdenet al. (2002b) had normalized their layer thicknesses to a con-stant bulk density of 1.65 g cm-3. We plotted their total C andradiocarbon data cumulatively to depth (as in Figure 5) andfrom this obtained total C and radiocarbon contents in the0–23, 23–46, 46–69 and 69–92 cm layers.Figure 6 shows the ﬁt between modelled and measured total Cand modelled and measured radiocarbon for the 1952 and 1997samplings. All the ﬁts were tolerable for the top three layers, butpoor for the bottom layer. The model predicted that the lowestlayer should contain only 0.4 t C ha/C01, but in fact this layercontained 4.2 t C ha/C01in 1997, with a D14Co f /C0262 (corre-sponding to a radiocarbon age of 2440 years). Increasing theIOM-C content of the 74–114 cm layer to 3.8 (i.e. 4.2 /C00.4)tCh a/C01will of course allow the model to ﬁt the organic Cdata. However, the radiocarbon content will then be far toosmall, because the IOM compartment in RothPC-1 is postu-lated to have a D14Co f /C0998. Relatively young organic Cmust have been trapped on its downward path by this clay-rich layer, a view already proposed by Baisden et al. (2002b).The Chernozem, developed under cold continental condi-tions, contained some 10 times more C andradiocarbon thanthe Californian annual grassland, developed under a Mediter-ranean climate. Yet, setting aside the lowest horizon, RothPC-1can give an acceptable ﬁt to both.How warming affects modelled C stock in a proﬁle treatedas a single entity or in layersMost attempts to model the effect of global warming on thestock of organic C held in terrestrial soil treat the top metre asa homogeneous unit (see, for example, Jones et al., 2005). Wedecided to use RothPC-1 to see how a single-layer C modelresponds to warming, compared with a multi-layer model. Weﬁrst ran the model for 10 000 years under Rothamsted climaticconditions to give the equilibrium C content of a soil in 1980.A subsequent increase in mean annual temperature of 0.25 °Cper decade over the next 100 years caused the stock of C heldwithin the top 92 cm to fall by 16% in the single-layer version,compared with a fall of 6% when the same proﬁle was dividedinto four equal layers (Figure 7; the legend speciﬁes how themodel was run). This calculation strongly suggests that treat-ing the top metre of soil as a homogeneous unit will greatlyoverestimate the effects of global warming in accelerating thedecomposition of soil C and hence on the enhanced release ofCO2from soil organic matter.ConclusionsOur work shows that the topsoil model RothC-26.3 can beextended to the top 92 cm of soil by the addition of two extra0 5 10 15 20 25 30Total C/t ha-1cumulative to depthMeasured, 1997Modelled,1997Baisden et al.2002a, b0-100-80-60-40-20Depth/cm-100-80-60-40-2000 100 200 300 400Depth/cm1900, measured1997, measured1900 & 1997, modelledTorn et al .(2002)0 5 10 15 20 25 30Radiocarbon/µg ha-1cumulative to depth1952, measured1952, modelled1997, measured1997, modelledBaisden et al.2002a, b0-100-80-60-40-20-100-80-60-40-2000 50 100 150 200 2501900, measured1900, modelled1997, measured1997, modelledTorn et al .(2002)Figure 6 Top two diagrams .

A singleparameter moving C downwards is insufﬁcient – the ﬁtbetween measured and modelled data becomes poor when sisset at zero; that is, when decomposition rates are the samethroughout the proﬁle. Because topsoil C is younger than sub-soil C, it is dominated by the relatively recent history of thesoil, whereas subsoil C reﬂects events far into the past. It istherefore intrinsically easier to model topsoil C, and the prob-lems in modelling ancient subsoil C are vividly illustrated byour attempts to calculate subsoil C turnover in a RussianChernozem and a Californian annual grassland. Some of theassumptions in the model, in particular the assumption thattemperatures throughout the proﬁle are the same as themonthly mean air temperature, are gross oversimpliﬁcations.What we have done is to assume, in the absence of experimen-tal data, that monthly air temperature and soil moisture con-tent inﬂuence decomposition throughout the proﬁle in thesame way as in the well-tested topsoil model RothC.26-1. Thissimpliﬁcation cannot be totally wrong, otherwise we wouldnot have been able to ﬁt data on measured total organic C andradiocarbon from proﬁles at Rothamsted, central Russia andCalifornia, places with very different climates. Despite theoversimpliﬁcations implicit in RothPC-1, we think that thismodel can generate estimates of C turnover in the top metre ofsoil – a reservoir that contains roughly twice as much C as theatmosphere – that are better than those given by models thattreats the top metre as a single entity. We hope that the newmodel will be useful in understanding how this reservoirresponds to climate change.AcknowledgementsThis work was funded in part by the Natural EnvironmentResearch Council: grant reference NER/B/S/2003/00884.

Two alternatives arecompared: treating the 0–92 cm soil proﬁle as a single layer, ordivided into four equal 0–23 cm layers. RothPC-1 was ﬁrst run for 10000 years to give the equilibrium content in 1980, using the usualRothamsted weather data; thereafter the mean annual temperatureincreased in steps, by 0.25 °C per decade. The soil proﬁle was assumedto contain no IOM. The annual input was 1.67 t C ha/C01year/C01before and after 1980, a value typical of an arable soil at Roth-amsted. The clay contents of the layers in the four-layer test were 23,30, 50 and 49% (as in Geescroft Wilderness); the clay content in thesingle layer test was 38% (the mean for the four layers). The DPM/RPM ratio of the incoming organic C was taken to be 1.44; the rateconstants for the different compartments had the usual RothPC-1values. The parameters pand swere taken to be 0.63 and /C00.06. Thesoil was vegetated throughout the year, except for August, Septem-ber, October and November, when it was bare.Turnover of organic carbon in subsoils 411#2008 Rothamsted Research LtdJournal compilation #2008 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,59,400–413 13652389, 2008, 2, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01026.x by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].
