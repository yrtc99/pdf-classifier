Different time-series satellite data were acquired and classified into land-use categories using ArcGIS and ENVI 5:0, followed by IDRISI forecasts up to 2050, and finallymodeling with INVEST. Data were collected within the plot constructed in a systematic ran-dom sampling manner using quadrates 20 m X 20 m. The social cost of carbon (US$12/tCO2e) used to estimate the monetary worth of the services. Forest conversion anticipatedto reduce the carbon stock by 1.86 Mt by the end of 2050, from 65.8 Mt in 1978 to 7.01 Mtin 2018. The rate of Carbon sequestration was 2.1Mt/year at the end of 1998, and it will bereduced to 1.49Mt/year by the end of 2050. Overall, 121.1Mt of CO 2is sequestered over63 years, but there was also emission from deforestation and service loss (84.4Mt), resultinga net sequestered CO 2of 36.6Mt by the end of 2050. The total elemental carbon stock valuein 1978 was $2. 896 billion, this will be reached $2.5billion ($9.175 billion CO 2e) at the endof 2050. The value of sequestration will be estimated at $1.715 billion, but with a value lossof $1.153 billion, the net sink value from 1988 to 2050 will be $0.6 billion. In general, thesefindings show that the forest region will have a total storage and sequestration value (CO2e)of $9.775 billion by the end of 2050. The carbon worth in this forest area is thus a goodindicator of the importance, and thus the value estimate here may well persuade policy-makers to revise their forest-related policy and provide site-specific information to preservethis remnant forest.KEYWORDSCarbon sequestration;carbon stock; coffeeforest; valueIntroductionThe earth ’s temperature is expected to rise by1.5–5.88/C14C[1] during the twenty-first century. Thisis due to greenhouse gas emissions caused byanthropogenic activity, including land-use changein the case of deforestation [ 2]. Terrestrial habitats,on the other hand, significantly contribute to cli-mate change mitigation by sinking greenhousegases [ 3,4], with forests playing a significant role incarbon storage in the given bio-network structureand carbon sinking in the given time series proc-esses [ 5,6].The moist evergreen forest of SouthwesternEthiopia has a long history; as a result, habitatsaccumulate more carbon per hectare [ 7] but trad-itionally converted to other land covers at anannual rate of 8% [ 8]. The forest, which is also asource of Coffea arabica, serves as a gene pool ser-vice and is regionally significant due to its locationin the Baro-Akobo basin [ 9].These have a great contribution to fauna andflora conservation, erosion protection, nutrientcycling, and climate change mitigation [ 10,11].Forests in the Baro catchment are floristically richerwhich lie at lower to higher altitude(650 –1900masl) the tree species are Trichiliadegeana, Trilepsium madagascerensis, Ficus exasper-ata, Cordia africana, Croton machrostachyus,Eugenia bukobensis, Strychnos mitis, Aningeria altis-sima, Anthocleista schweinfurthii, Celtis philippensis,Elaeodendron buchananii, Garcinia huillensis,Manikara butugi, Morus mesozygia , and whichbelongs to highland forest [ 12] , similarly our iden-tification also presented (Appendix A). The otherforest found in this region is midland forest, whichcomprises, Ficus spp , and Syzygium guineense fol-lowed by small trees and bushes includes Galineracoffeodes and ground stratum includes local spicesAframomum korarima , turmeric ’s and long pepper.This biomass, has a vital role in carbon storageCONTACT Ayehu Fekadu Hailu ayehufekadu5@gmail.com Center of Environmental Science, Addis Ababa University, 1000 AddisAbaba, Ethiopia./C2232021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCARBON MANAGEMENT2021, VOL. 12, NO. 5, 531 –548https://doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2021.1976676and sequestration, and preservatives of soilorganic carbon, under the floor [ 13].The dynamics of land cover, on the other hand,contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emis-sions into the atmosphere, primarily from farmedtropical soils [ 12]. The forest of southwest Ethiopiais a solution for reducing CO2emissions from for-est ecosystems [ 14]. This is one of Ethiopia ’s rem-nant and buffer zones of moist evergreenAfromontane forests, which cover a large area [ 15].Worldwide, research on Carbon stock conductedmajority indicated that Carbon sequestration andstorage in the terrestrial ecosystem was greatlyreduced in the case of several factors [ 16].Particularly in Ethiopia, the Carbon storage andsequestration quantity and values commonly esti-mated at the national level, rather than location-specific, this all does not bring changes to themind of the local governance, policymakers andthe local community, also not reduce the pressureon the natural forest [ 14] and [ 17]. Furthermore,previous studies revealed varying results, forexample, Ethiopia ’s Forest Reference Level (EFRL)estimated aboveground biomass carbon 100 Ctons/ha [ 18], global forest resource assessmenttechnical report on Ethiopia (UNFCCC, 2020) stated57–58.5 C ton/ha and Ethiopian Forest ResourcesCurrent Status 106 C t/ha reported [ 19] and inKenya also very variable outcomes [ 20].Similar studies were conducted in SouthwesternEthiopia by Oumer [ 21], but only at a higher eleva-tion; however, this study differed because it includeda lower elevation. The overall carbon value of theforest identified and assessed to close the variabilitygap, reduce CO2emissions through carbon seques-tration, and stop deforestation. As a result, climatepolicy involvement implemented to reduce emis-sions and initiate policy incentives [ 22]a n d[ 16].Previously, the community in and around the for-est reflected a constructive approach that prioritizedfuture benefits over immediate rewards. This isbecause their livelihood is based on honey, and thereachable forest area is divided by clan leaders, witheach stratum of the forest having its illegal owner.They considered this forest to be sacred, and it wasnot deforested or destroyed like an Ethiopian churchforest, but it used as a source of materials and forthe placement of beehives (Dukehs personal com-munication, 2018 Guraferda).The destruction began in 1988 when the Bebakaplantation started, according to clan leaders, duringthe Derg regime. Currently, over 100 licensed agri-business investors are beginning to work, all ofwhich is reliant on the forest resource [ 23]. Theinvestors are thinning or completely removing theforest, which has a significant impact on the localcommunity, causing them to push and compute theforest and pledge to divert the natural forest, inwhich case the society ’s choice has been trans-formed [ 8]. This particular region is one of Ethiopia ’sforest priority areas (FPA), and its carbon value andquantity have never been evaluated previously [ 24].We hypothesized that the ecosystem servicesvalue of carbon is very high and that mapping,quantification, and valuation of carbon in this vir-gin forest is critical for sustainable forest manage-ment. As a result, this study is very important forthe area because it provides valuable site-specificinformation for forest conservation.(1) Estimated carbon is creating an insurancebuffer for reducing emissions in the event of defor-estation and increasing sequestration as a result ofconcerned focus (2) Obtain certification for thearea, after which carbon can be sold to generatefunds for community benefit. (3) initiates a dia-logue between scholars (on the available carbonvalue), policymakers (to revise forest-based invest-ment policy), communities and associations (fol-lowing the Protective and Productive approach),and then shifts society ’s preference to future bene-fits over immediate benefits.(4) The amount of carbon stored (present andfuture) as well as the loss or sequestration in ton/ha will be mapped, and (5) the overall economicworth of the carbon stock will be determined (6)Importantly, the net flow of value ($/ha) of carbonsequestration between the present and the future,based on the social cost of carbon and land useland cover change, will be assessed from 1988 to2050 projection scenarios.Therefore, the objectives of this study are (i) toestimate the quantity and value of the carbon stockbased on the land use land cover change categoryof different time serious (ii) to map and estimate thecarbon sequestration quantity and value from 1988to 2050 projection scenario, thereby determine thecarbon sequestration value coefficient.MethodologyStudy areaThe study was conducted in the moist evergreenAfromontane forests of Southwestern Ethiopia,which is the home of Arabica coffee [ 25]. The areais found in the Bench Maji zone of three districts(Guraferda, South bench, and Sheko) ( Figure 1 )532 A. FEKADU HAILU ET AL.located from 5.33/C14to 7.26/C14latitude and longitudesfrom 34.88/C14to 36.14/C14with an elevation range from690 to 2500 meters above sea level, which has140000 ha of the natural forest [ 23]. It is far away640 km from Addis Ababa and found under theBaro akobo basin and the buffer zone of the high-land forests, besides that coffee forest Biospherewith spices is found in this area.Land cover mapping and classificationA Set of different time-series satellite data in 1978,1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 were acquired from theUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) ( https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov ) of earth explorer with a dif-ferent ID (Landsat 2,5,7and 8) and sensor(Multispectral scanner, Thematic mapper, Enhancedthematic mapper, and Operation Land Image) with araw 055 and path 183 and 170 with a low cloudcover (0.5 to1%) with a spatial resolution of30/C230m. This was projected to the UniversalTransverse Mercator (UTM), projection system zone36 N. Forest map was collected from the regionaland Zonal Forest conservation and natural resourceoffice; this was Geo-referenced and developed aship-fill using Arc GIs to clip the region of interest.This study began with the classification of fiveland use categories after Quaic and FlashFigure 1. Map of the study area.CARBON MANAGEMENT 533atmospheric correction of the Land-sat image. Forthis, the image was classified by pixel-based super-vised image classification place in the year 2018 byENVI 5:0 remote sensing software. Accuracy of theclassification was made by collecting 450 ground-truth points using GPS.This classification includes natural forest (whichhas less human intervention except for someresource collection and coffee is grown and regen-erating naturally), semi-forest (which is similar tonatural forest, but managed and thinned out atleast once per year and coffee seedlings may beplanted/regenerating naturally), and Coffee planta-tion (commercial coffee investment), grass/shrubs(primarily for wild animal grazing place, with someshrubs), and agricultural lands (covered by annualand perennial crop).For the processes, ENVI 5:0 remote sensing soft-ware was employed and finalized by ArcGIS. Weused IDRISI Land Change Modeler for the predic-tion of the 2050 future scenario (CA –Markovmodel), this all used for the input of INVEST formodeling the carbon storage and sequestration ofthe land use types.Data collectionTransacts were laid out across the slope, in differ-ent length based on the forest extent, and thespacing between two transects along the slopevaried from 2 to 4.5 km, and the distance betweenthe two sampling plots was ranging, from 400 to1000 m, this was depending on the slope and theland homogeneity of the forest.We were setting the plot in a systematic ran-dom sampling method using quadrates of 20 m x20 m that were distributed along the transect. Allvegetation and soil data were collected in theentire place of the plot. Many researchers usedsimilar sample sizes and shapes [ 26–33]. However,the number of sample plots varied in relation tothe land use category that was included for forestand semi-forest 88, coffee investment 26, agricul-ture 19, grass and shrubs 17.Carbon dataUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange groupings carbon pools into five catego-ries this was included aboveground biomass,belowground biomass, soil, dead wood, and deadorganic matter [ 34]. This study designed to esti-mate this carbon pool based on the collected sam-ple from the nested quadrat design approach forlitter, herbs (non-woody with DBH <2 cm), andsoil samples with inside 1 by 1 m frame (but allfrom different places in which the entire plot oftree measurements);10m /C210m for 2 –10 cm DBH(shrubs) and dead wood, again DBH /C2110 cmcounted in the entire sample plots of 20m /C220m.We measured the DBH at 1.3 but for multiplestems below the collar diameter or at 1.3 m, fol-lowing the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)irregular tree diameters measurement meth-ods [ 35].For growth abnormalities, we followed Rain forprotocols [ 36,37], and for coffee, we used othermethods [ 38]. The plant heights were estimatedbased on the observed angle on the top of thetree and the distance of the reader from the treeby using clinometers and this was computed bystandard trigonometric relationships [ 39]. We usedthe appropriate revised non-destructive allometricequation recently developed for tropical vegeta-tion for trees /C215 cm diameter [ 40]. Based on thisthe aboveground live biomass (AGB, kg) were esti-mated as a function of DBH (cm), height (H, m),and wood-specific gravity ( q, g/cm3).AGB¼0:0673x pD2H/C0/C10:976 (1)Below ground biomass (BGB), estimated fromroot-shoot ratios (R/S) by taking 25% of above-ground biomass [ 41,42], and total carbon is 47% ofthe biomass [ 43]. However, for trees 2 –5cm diam-eter, another allometric equation was used devel-oped for the tropical area [ 44–47]. The estimationper 400 m2plots of each species and the summa-tion of the above-ground mass of all the trees atthe sample point was converted into hectare.Others also used the same plot area and proce-dures [ 26,32,33,48–50] and allometric formula[28,44] for tropical forest and for EthiopianAfromontane coffee forest [ 25].Any live vegetation in this study below 2 cmDBH was considered as non-woody above-groundbiomass [ 19]. We used the frame method(1m/C21m) placed at the four corners and the cen-ter of the sample plot, non-woody vegetationinside the frame was collected. The sub-samplewas measured and taken into Mizan Plant regionallaboratory and oven-dried at 75/C14C. Based on driedmass, the wet to dry ratio of the sub-sample wasestimated and this converted into plot and hec-tare bases.We measured standing deadwood (with all partsexcept the leaves) similarly with live tree measure-ment steps. However, for measuring standing534 A. FEKADU HAILU ET AL.deadwood with big branches alone and otherdeadwood types, we were following the practiceof others [ 50–52] 3% reduction.We obtained Wood Specific gravity at the specieslevel from the Ethiopian natural resource and theGlobal Wood Density Database [ 40]. We identifiedthe species, but, for those unknown species we weretaking to Addis Ababa University National Herbariumand identified to the species level using the Voucherspecimens were deposited. We considered in thisstudy the dead organic surface materials less than10 cm diameter as a litter, and then this sample col-lected in the frame of 1m /C21m in the four cornersand the center. The sub-sampled was taken to labo-ratories, for oven-dry, finally, the dry mass per plotand then per hectare was calculated. Soil sample(150) was collected from a 1 m2frames, from0–20 cm, 20 –40 cm, and 40 –60 cm soil depth. Thesub-sample was taken and this was air-dried, sieved,and ground and 100 g were taken into Tapi regionalsoil laboratory for carbon analysis. For soil bulk sam-pling, we used a core sampler with a similar depthof soil carbon sample. The bulk density of the com-posite sample was determined in the laboratory. Thiswas oven-dried at 105/C14C, and the dry weight andbulk density were calculated. To calculate the soilcarbon stock, the volume of the soil was calculated(area by depth) and then multiplied by bulk density,followed by the fraction of carbon (%).During transect sampling, we discovered crop-land (including coffee), which we treated aswoody, and thus the carbon stock was measuredsimilarly to the forest woody and non-woody pro-cedures described above.T h ea m o u n to fc a r b o ns t o r e di na n n u a lc r o p l a n d ,on the other hand, is negligible because the gain isassumed to be equal to biomass losses from harvestand mortality [ 43], and then soil carbon and trashcrop residue were estimated based on litter and soilattributes. Carbon in the grass and shrub categorieswere measured using the same procedure as for soil,litter, and herbal biomass [ 42], and for shrub bio-mass, we used a 5m /C25m plot to collect above-ground biomass using the same definedmethodological specifications of others (49). Carbonaccounted for 47% of aboveground biomass.Modeling approachWe used the InVEST model to map carbon in thevarious poles of the forest area, based on the cate-gorized image and the acquired carbon data. Wethen indicated the stored carbon, as well asmapped the sequestered or lost carbon over time.However, this model has also a limitation, sinceassumed that LULC types are fixed storage levelequal to the average of measured storage levelswithin that LULC type, the only stock changes aredue to changes from one LULC type to another(not change, have a sequestration value of 0),because incremental and regrowth is not consid-ered. The valuation result of InVEST also only indi-cates the future value, not for current conditions[53]. Based on this the annual value flow of thesequestration and storage services were calculatedwith excel following the appropriate formula.Climate regulation service and Dis-Service modelingAccounting of carbon storage servicesThe most widely recognized ecosystem service is for-est carbon sequestration and storage [ 43]. Climatechange mitigation and a key ecosystem benefit pro-vided by forests are the reductions of released car-b o na n dt h ec o n s e r v a t i o no fc a r b o ni ns t o r a g e[54,55]. Human interventions influenced forest coverchange [ 56], posing a significant challenge to carbonstorage and biodiversity conservation [ 37].The amount of carbon stored in each land usecategory over time was calculated using a compre-hensive approach that included a sum of AGB,BGB, soil, and dead organic matter polls placed oncurrently collected data. This was related to theland use category classified map (Tabel2). A peri-odic accounting method was used to computedecadal stock variation with the assumption of netsequestered carbon increment based on the 2018collected data scenario.We assumed that the carbon stock of the previousdecade had increased due to sequestration and thatthis leaner increment would continue on biomassuntil 2050, as many scholars suggested [ 57]. Finally,the carbon stock was calculated and mapped usingthe InVEST model based on land category.Sequestration servicesThe carbon sequestration service is one type ofregulating service provided by forests. In thisstudy, the amount of carbon sequester by land-useclass was estimated from 1988 to 2050 based onthe gain and loss scenario. This determined by theincrement of above-ground and below-groundbiomass, resulting from natural growth ( Table 1 ),and new plants regenerated. This method was theCARBON MANAGEMENT 535most common approach used for Carbon uptakeestimations [ 61–63].However, during estimation, we did not includethe sequestered carbon in soil and dead matter. Weassumed that some of the soil pool also used tocompensate for carbon outflow during soil hetero-trophic respiration and stand consumption becauselitter is dynamic and cannot be considered a long-term carbon store [ 64,92]. Many studies have foundthat stand respiration consumes a portion of carbonuptake in mature forests, influencing net yields intropical forests [ 45]. Furthermore, increased plantinputs in tropical soil may alter the formation oforgano-minerals, limiting the ability of tropical soilsto sequestered additional carbon [ 65].Carbon sequestration rates were computedbased on the baseline year 1988 ( Equation 2 to6).The incremental coefficient, the expansion factor,and the regeneration ratio ( Table 1 ) of the landcategory were collected from different sources [ 14,59,60]. The naturally regenerated volume also cal-culated based on the expansion parameters foreach land use category for forest (0.1%), shrubland (0.2%) [ 17,66], however, we gave zero valuefor Semi forest, plantation, and agriculture becausetinning, slashing and other management activitywas taken and we considered no any plant wasregenerated.IVt¼Ah aðÞ /C3MAI m3=ha=year/C0/C1(2)RathaðÞ ¼Ah aðÞ /C3Rrð%Þ (3)Rvt¼Ra/C3IR m3=ha=year/C0/C1(4)AGB ivðÞ¼iv/C3BCEF (5)AGB rvðÞ¼ rv/C3BCEF (6)Ivt¼total incremental volume, MAI ¼meanannual increment, Rat ¼total regeneratedarea,Rvt ¼total regenerated volume,IR¼regeneration rate, BCEF ¼biomass conversionand expansion factor, AGB ¼above ground bio-mass.

Thiscomputed based on survey questionnaires from250 respondents following “PEN ”standards, guide-lines, and procedures to make accurate, reliable,and valid results of the investigations, but with acertain modification that relevant to carbon similarto this author that did before [ 67,68]. Becausethese items are used, sold, and purchased on themarket. We estimate the carbon loss due to fullwood consumption based on daily consumptionbecause one household (4.53 families) consumedan average of 1 women ’s load/4 days.This estimated 0.75 /C20.35/C20.25 (0.066 m3)ranged from 14 to 30 kg an average of 29.2 kg/4 days, 6.52 kg/days or 1.63 kg person/day(0.0037 m3person/day) 1.25565 m3/capita/year or594.95 kg, this multiplied by the total populationdirectly benefited from the forest. Full wood trans-ported to the nearby 11 towns also measured,weekly 3women ’s (0.12 m3) load/town (total 33)this converted into the year (1716 women ’s load/or 50107.2 kg). Similar, finding of annual per capitatraditional fuel consumption of 601 kg [ 17]reported in Ethiopia.The households on the forest edge did not usecharcoal to meet their energy needs, but theyused it as a source of income, transporting andselling it in the nearby 11 markets. According totheir estimation, two women ’s loads (40 kg/mar-ket/day) were sold to the local market, which mul-tiplied by the number of towns and thenconverted into annual. We assumed that theTable 1.

FEKADU HAILU ET AL.conversion efficiency of fuel wood to charcoal is 5to 1 by weight, and 47% of this is carbon. To cal-culate the decade consumption, we used a popula-tion incremental rate of 2.5% per year [ 69] andenergy demand growth information 2.8% [ 70].The carbon loss by construction materials com-puted based respondent ’s estimate there are 43Kebles (local administrative) within the extent ofthe forest, minimally 3new-house constructed and2old houses repaired per year. The total roundwood needed for one new house construction was1. 5/C21. 5/C23 m (6.75 m3) and one-fourth of this isenough for old house repairing (1.6875 m3). Thismultiplied by the number Keble ’s directly bene-fited from the forest and converted into total mass(1 m3¼600kg). Totally 8.4375 m3for one Keble ’s, or362.8125 m3/year for the total were required. Thisindicated that 217687.5 kg/year harvested aroundthe forest, and 47% of this is carbon. The decadalconsumption was estimated based on 2.5%/year,the demand increment of the Zonal min, and theenergy office scenario [69, 71].Carbon also lost in timber wood that ’s used forfurniture and others, consequently, we estimatedthe timber volume based on the known speciesCordia africana . These species dominantly con-sumed in the area for timber production. However,transported timber wood to the central marketwas negligible but, there are 44 furniture andwoodworking shop that, found in 11 cities whichdirectly benefited timber from the forest. Oneshop bay and used 6 Cordia africana, which is anaverage estimated volume of each 0.016 m3(2/C20.02/C20.4 m3) timber per week.This was converted on a yearly basis and multi-plied by the related wood density and the numberof shops to calculate the total volume harvestedfrom the forest. We used the conversion factor (amean root/shoot) as specified above for below-ground biomass. A total of 0.848 kg /C26o f Cordiaafricana was required, which equates to 0.73 kgper day or 265.3 kg per year per shop. Currently,11673.2 kg of timber is used per year in 44 shops,and the total weight of carbon hasbeen calculated.The total estimated shop was 3 in 1988, 11 in1998, 21 in 2008 and now 44, this will be rise to 54in 2050 [ 23], we used this scenario for a decade ofconsumption. The forest was, not subjected tofires, thus this loss was not included, however,insect attacks, diseases and pest infestation wasexpected, hence, we adapted the other method,0.031% of damage and stand mortality 0.031% [ 14,72]. For the loss of harvest damage (fuel wood andwood for charcoal) 5%, for timber, and for con-struction wood 12. 5% of the volume harvestedwas used [ 70,72,73]. Finally, net carbon sequestra-tion was computed ( Equation 9 ).Net CO 2Sequestered ¼Sequestered /C0Releasedx3 :67(9)Valuation of carbone storage and sequestrationThe monetary valuation of regulation service inthis study was done by the social cost of carbon(SCC) method, a commonly employed methodgrounded on the expected value of carbon-storingtoday by avoiding future damages, however, valu-ation based on the market price was difficultbecause prices were strongly dependent on theset-up of the market. The SCC was low before2010 and also varies from 10 in 2010 to 26for 2050.For that reason, we used a SCC presented bythe US government standard value (US$12/tCO 2eor $44 for C, in 2007 dollars unit at 5% discountrate), as adjusted in 2013(Interagency WorkingGroup on Social Cost of 2013, updated in 2016).The monetary value was estimated based on twoapproaches. The first approach was estimating thecarbon stored value in the forest at any giventime. This was done directly without computingdiscounting rate ( equation 10 ) similarly to the nat-ural capital project computed approach (Sharp etal., 2016).Carbon density 5poolsðÞ ton=haðÞ Area haðÞ x cost =ton ðÞ ¼Value(10)The second approach was to value sequestra-tion (Beaumont et al. , 2013). Because InVEST canonly estimate land conversion but not anotheruptake, we used the standard calculation proced-ure to calculate the total service flow from 1988 to2050. Based on this, the net present valueapproach was used to estimate the value of thechange in carbon uptake over time, and the coeffi-cient value ($/ha) was determined.NPVt¼X1tCt=ð1þrÞt(11)C¼Net benefits in year t, r ¼Discount rateResults and discussionThe classification accuracy of the Landsat imagebased on the collected ground truth (450 points)by ENVI 5:0 remote sensing software (1978, 1988,CARBON MANAGEMENT 5371998, 2008, and 2018) and IDRISI for prediction ofthe 2050 future scenario ranged from 89 to 92%,and the Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.87 to0.95, indicating that the classification met theaccuracy and nearly perfect agreement ( Figure 2 ).Therefore, the estimated carbon quantity andvalue of the study area was accurate, thus, wehypothesized that the carbon stock and sequestra-tion value of the southwestern Ethiopia coffee for-est would be high,Land cover changeThe impact of land use/land cover change (LULC)from 1978 to 2050 ( Table 2 ) affected the carbonstocks in the study area. This result showed a35.1% decrease in natural forest coverage over thelast three decades. This decreased by 11052.6 habetween 1978 and 1988, 22080.6 ha between 1988and 1998, 3234.4 ha between 1998 and 2008, and8728.58 ha between 2008 and 2018. This loss willbe continued and reduced by 10992.53 ha from2018 to 2050, which predicted an average of779.01 ha/year ( Figure 2 ). This result is similar tothe earlier findings of 36% forest covers loss inSouthwestern Ethiopia [ 74–76]. Conversely, agricul-ture and investment increased except for grass-land, which reduced. This inter-period change hada significant impact on carbon uptake and, as aresult, had a significant impact on global warmingdue to carbon emissions [ 77].Carbon stock changeThe highest carbon stock recorded in this studywas from a natural forest (461 t/ha), followed by asemi (396 t/ha) and grassland (286 t/ha).Agriculture also had a higher carbon stock (246.5t/ha) when compared to similar cropland that hadrecently been converted to cultivation due todeforestation. Many studies reported findings thatwere consistent with these findings on natural for-est (496.26 t/ha) [ 78], 508.9 t/ha [ 79], in Ethiopia.The IPCC [ 42] also estimated 130 –510 ton/ha ofaboveground oven-dry biomass in Africa, with car-bon accounting for 47%. The global carbon stockestimated to be in the range of 84 –642 t/ha, andthe carbon density of aboveground biomass fortropical moist forests estimated to be around 248t/ha [ 30].Similar to this area on natural forest [ 80], from 0to 60 cm depth of soil, 365 Mg/ha of carbon on soilreported, likewise on the indigenous natural forestin Kenya on aboveground carbon (360), belowground carbon (90), and soil carbon (305) in tone/ha was informed [ 20]. But some also reportedFigure 2. Land use land cover change map in 1978, 2008 and predicted 2050.538 A.

Otheralso lower, 316 t/ha in Gara-Mukitar forest [ 81]in Ethiopia.The carbon stock ( Table 3 ) was directly affectedby the land cover change ( Table 2 ). The total forestcarbon stock in 1978 (only forest) was59117214.1 ton, which was greater than the cur-rent (2018) total LULC carbon stock ( Figure 3 ). Inthe beginning, 65804452.6 tons of carbon werestored (1978) in all land, with the forest accountingfor 90% of the stock. Totally, 7017669 tons of car-bon have been released into the atmosphere inthe last 40 years (175441.7 t/year), with an add-itional 1861261 tons expected in the next threedecades. Similarly, many researchers indicated thatchanges in land cover had a significant impact oncarbon stock [ 82,83].According to our findings, converting this nat-ural forest into a coffee plantation lost nearly 70%of the total biomass and thus carbon content(Tables 2 and 3), whereas Simi forest land con-verted into a coffee plantation lost 58% of thestock. The highest level of canopy cover found inwild and semi-forested areas provides a globalbenefit in terms of carbon storage [ 66,84].The amount of carbon loss from natural forestconversion into agriculture 96.2%, followed bySemi forest into agriculture 94.6%, thus agriculturalexpansion and investment growth at the expenseof forest in this region were a great concern [ 31,85] and affected the general bionetwork of thisremnant forest [ 74].Accounting of carbon sequestration and lossBesides storing carbon, the forest provides regulat-ing services; these services defined by the incre-ment in growth and the carbon uptake by newlyregenerated plants. The result of this computedbased on ( Tables 1 and 2) above, formulation onincrement in volume and biomass expansion andconversion factor since 1988 using Equation (2 to6)as indicated ( Tables 4 and 5).Our quantitative assessment indicated, the CO2sequestered at the end of 1998 were 21176043 ton(2117604 t/year) which had forest 86.3% share,however, the carbon sequestration quantity,affected through forest changes ( Tables 2 and 4),carbon dioxide uptake from the atmospherereduced and reach to 19967902tons at the end of2008 (19967902 ton/year) and a rate of 1915934 t/year from the last eleven years to the present,recorded. This uptake will be significantly reducedin the future (31 years) and reach 58893126 tons(forest share71%) ( Table 4 and Figure 4 ).In total, 92411073tons of CO2sequestered andwill be sequestered over the period from 1988 to2050. This indicates a sequestration rate of 4.1 C t/ha/year (15.1 CO2) for natural forest and 4 t/ha/year for semi-forest, which contributed more toremove CO2from the atmosphere. A similarTable 2.

This was comparable to the reduction rateobserved in this region over six years [ 87].Valuation of carbon storage andsequestrationOur stock value estimation based on REDD reason-ing [ 90] by direct valuation approach indicatedthat the total elemental carbon stock value in1978 was $2.895 billion, with 94.5% forest share,so we considered this as the country Nationalaccounts [ 14]. However, due to deforestation incase of forest-based economic activity, this reachedFigure 3. Carbon storage change.540 A. FEKADU HAILU ET AL.$2.587 billion, an 11% decrease from the start in 2018(Table 3 ). This will be continued and expected toreach $2.504 (9.175 CO 2e) billion at the end of 2050, areduction of at least 4% from the present.The net present value methodology used toassess the overall economic value Carbon seques-tered by the land uses class (Tabel5). The total car-bon value flows from 1988 to 2050 expected to be$1.766 billion, with forests being the largest con-tributor at $1.446 billion (81.5%) , followed bysemi-forests at $0.22 billion (12.5%). However,when forest land converted into coffee plantations,the sequestration capacity of the biomass reduced,resulting in a $48 reduction in CO2 uptake value;however, when converted into agriculture, thiswas severe, resulting in a $164.52 loss per hectareconversion; a total 13.3% reduction in net seques-tration value will be estimated at the end of 2050as compared to the end of 1998.The monetary value loss associated with forestconversion was $1.06 billion. The other natural loss(disease and mortality) and harvesting lossaccounted for $0.086 billion dominantly from for-ests (98%). Based on this calculation, the net bene-fit after compensation of the loss will be $0.613billion at the end of 2050. Comparable findingsalso reported for natural forests [ 14,22,59,91].ConclusionForests help to mitigate climate change by storingcarbon and removing CO 2from the atmosphere.The southwest Ethiopian forest is one of thecountry ’s remaining forests and one solution to cli-mate change. However, when engaging in variousforest-based economic activities, policymakersundervalue the value of the forest. As a result, thisstudy investigates the quantity and value of car-bon stock (1978 to 2050) and sequestration (1988to 2050) in this forest region.The results show that the total land coverstored in 2018 is 58786783t of carbon (forest 90%share), with a monetary value of elemental carbonof $2.6 billion, which is less than the total landcover stored in 1978 by 7017669t (value $3.1 mil-lion) due to forest conversion.This will be 56925521t by the end of 2050,worth $2.5 billion ($9.175 billion CO2e), represent-ing a $3.9 million decrease in stock value from1978 to 2050.
