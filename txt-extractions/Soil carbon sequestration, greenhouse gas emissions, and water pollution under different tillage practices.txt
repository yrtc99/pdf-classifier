Till-age can affect a variety of soil-mediated processes, e.g., soil carbon sequestration (SCS) or depletion, greenhouse gas(GHG) (CO 2,C H 4,and N 2O) emission, and water pollution. Several tillage practices are in vogue globally, and they ex-hibit varied impacts on these processes. Hence, there is a dire need to synthesize, collate and comprehensively presentthese interlinked phenomena to facilitate future researches. This study deals with the co-bene ﬁts and trade-offs pro-duced by several tillage practices on SCS and related soil properties, GHG emissions, and water quality. We hypothe-sized that improved tillage practices could enable agriculture to contribute to SCS and mitigate GHG emissions andleaching of nutrients and pesticides. Based on our current understanding, we conclude that sustainable soil moisturelevel and soil temperature management is crucial under different tillage practices to offset leaching loss of soil storednutrients/pesticides, GHG emissions and ensuring SCS. For instance, higher carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide(N2O) emissions from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) could be attributed to the ﬂuctuations in soilKeywords:Soil carbon sequestrationSoil healthTillage systemsEutrophicationSoi organic matterScience of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 154161⁎Corresponding authors.E-mail addresses: haﬁz.iqbal@tec.mx (H.M.N.

In addition, NT may enhance nitrate (NO 3−) leaching over CT because of improvedsoil structure, in ﬁltration capacity, and greater water ﬂux, however, suggesting that the eutrophication potential of NTis high. Our study indicates that the evaluation of the eutrophication potential of different tillage practices is stilloverlooked. Our study suggests that improving tillage practices in terms of mitigation of N 2O emission and preventingNO3−pollution may be sustainable if nitri ﬁcation inhibitors are applied.Water pollutionEnvironmental healthGHG emissionsContents1 .

IntroductionCurrent agricultural practices have enormously intensi ﬁed by focusingon enhanced crop yield to feed the world's billions of people ( Busariet al., 2015 ). Such agricultural intensi ﬁcation is putting additional pressureon natural resources, altering natural processes, and causing deteriorationof soil, air, and water quality, by soil organic carbon (SOC) depletion, ele-vated greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, soil nutrient imbalances, and fer-tilizer and pesticide export to aquatic bodies ( Poeplau et al., 2011 ;Vitouseket al., 2009 ;Subbarao et al., 2017 ;Sun et al., 2012 ). However, these im-pacts and their magnitude vary with site properties and farming practices(van Groenigen et al., 2011 ). Tillage is an agricultural management practicethat affects soil, air, and water quality by affecting the exchange (sequestra-tion of losses) of greenhouse gases to air and the loss of nutrients and pesti-cides to water. For example, tillage generally decreases soil carbonsequestration (SCS) due to the decomposition of elevated carbon (C). In ad-dition, it may enhance/lessen carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions ( Ogle et al.,2005 ;Abdalla et al., 2016) . Reduced or no-tillage is thus seen as a meansto enhance soil carbon sequestration (SCS) and reduce CO 2emissions.This effect may be counteracted by enhanced emissions of nitrous oxide(N2O), as shown in several studies ( Mei et al., 2018 ;Van Kessel et al.,2013 ), while tillage also affects methane (CH 4) emissions. Reduced tillageis also advocated as a means to reduce losses of accumulated pesticidesand nutrients through leaching or surface-runoff ( Fig. 1 )(Luo et al., 2010 ;Endale et al., 2017 ;Nevins et al., 2020 ;Aziz et al., 2013 ;Zhou et al.,2017 ;Raiesi and Kabiri, 2016 ;Haddaway et al., 2017 ;Çelik et al., 2021 ;Shang et al., 2021 ;Elias et al., 2018 ). Numerous statements regarding theadverse impacts of tillage and thus the bene ﬁts of no-tillage or reduced till-age, however, overlook differences among tillage practices, soil properties,and associated land management. Different kinds of tillage practices arebeing practiced globally ( Porwollik et al., 2019 ), for instance, conventionaltillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), reduced tillage (RT) or minimum tillage (MT),ridge Tillage (RiT), strip-tillage (ST), strategic tillage (STR), and deep tillage(DT) (see Section 2.1 for background on these practices). The effects ofthese tillage types on soil-air-water quality may vary across regions andare dependent on speci ﬁc soil-climatic-management conditions(Chatterjee and Lal, 2009 ;Feng et al., 2020 ;Hussein et al., 2019 ;Powlson et al., 2014 ).Below we summarize some impacts of soil-climatic-management condi-tions on (i) SCS and CO 2exchange, (ii) N 2O and CH 4emissions that maycounteract the CO 2emissions, and (iii) nutrient (N and P) and pesticideleaching and runoff.Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in duced by agricultural practices isan important solution for decreasi ng the overall emissions to cause anet atmospheric C drawdown ( Derpsch et al., 2014 ;Mehra et al.,2018 ;Zomer et al., 2017 ;Li et al., 2020 ). SCS potential of global agri-cultural soils accounts for 0.90 –1.85 Pg C yr−1(Zomer et al., 2017 ), ex-emplifying the potential of agricultural soil management ( Lal, 2015 )t omitigate CO 2emissions ( Krupenikov et al., 2011 ). SCS and GHG emis-sions within agricultural settings a re associated with adopted tillagemethods. ( Wulanningtyas et al., 2021 ;Shakoor et al., 2021 ;Shanget al., 2021 ). Studies have shown that the effect of NT over CT on SCSmight be con ﬁned to surface soils (0-10 cm) in developing countries(Bhattacharyya et al., 2021 ), which is also evident in Europe ( Soaneet al., 2012 ), China ( Wang et al., 2021 ;Huang et al., 2016 ). Contrarily,N Tm a yp o s i t i v e l yi n ﬂuence SCS in terms of whole soil pro ﬁle com-p a r e dt oC Ti nI t a l y( Badagliacca et al., 2018 ), Mediterranean regions(Mazzoncini et al., 2016 ), and Japan ( Wulanningtyas et al., 2021 ).These studies imply that the potential of tillage practices on SCS ﬂuctu-ates widely ( Chatterjee and Lal, 2009 ). These above-mentioned varia-tions produced by NT may arise discrepancies ( Wang et al., 2021 )and must be considered to have a clear idea about future endeavors.Moreover, soil organic matter (SOM), SOC and its fractions, soilaggregates, soil microbial community, soil hydrological attributes(e.g., water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity, etc.), andtheir inter- and intra- relationships de ﬁne effective and sustainableSCS ( Bhattacharyya et al., 2022 ). Several studies showed that intensivetillage operations could augment changes in the chemical compositionof SOM, also on the quantity and quality of soil microbial populations,and lead to a reduction in structural stability, thus reducing the SOCS.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541612storage capacity of the soil ( Acir et al., 2020 ;Assunção et al., 2019 ;Sithole et al., 2019 ;Tuzzin de Moraes et al., 2016 ;Kladivko, 2001 ).Tillage practices also in ﬂuence N 2O emissions by affecting nitri ﬁcationand denitri ﬁcation processes ( Li et al., 2015 ) and CH 4emission by affectingmethanotrophs. N 2Oa n dC H 4are greenhouse gases with a global warmingpotential of about 300 and 30 times larger than CO 2.C H 4and N 2Ob o t hc a noffset the positive bene ﬁts gained by SCS ( Guenet et al., 2021 ;Hemes et al.,2018 ).Shakoor et al. (2021) observed a substantial amount of N 2Oa n dC H 4releases were associated with NT soils over CT globally. So, these tillage-induced trade-offs should be well-documented to fetch out future researchdirections.Soil tillage affects SCS and GHG emissions and soil and water quality byerosion and runoff by affecting soil structure, reducing soil stability, andmaking it more prone to erosion. Melland et al. (2017) concluded that till-age, e.g., ST may increase the susceptibility of soils to erosion while resis-tance to erosion has been reported for CT/NT rotation ( Zhang et al.,2018 ). In addition, although tillage may improve soil water storage capac-ity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ( Schlüter et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al.,2018 ), tillage may also facilitate particulate nutrient loss ( Melland et al.,2017 ), e.g., particulate organic C (POC) or particulate organic N (PON).Several studies have revealed that tillage may also either increase ( Eliaset al., 2018 ), decrease ( Klik and Rosner, 2020 )o rn o ta f f e c t( Okada et al.,2019 ) leaching or runoff of soil stored pesticides/fertilizers to aquatic bod-ies. When nitrogenous fertilizers are applied, soil immediately adsorbs andimmobilizes NH 4+(Sørensen and Amato, 2002 ). In contrast, the negativecharge of NO 3_produced by nitri ﬁcation, is not easily adsorbed andimmobilized by soil, resulting in NO 3−loss through runoff or leaching ( Liet al., 2015 ), tillage practice may in ﬂuence these processes. Bertol et al.(2017) revealed that runoff is more prominent under NT than CT. However,NT prevents erosional loss, while Daryanto et al. (2017b) stated that NTfailed to control erosion-induced phosphorus (P) loss to the water. In lightof these ﬁndings, ﬁnding a way to resolve this detrimental phenomenon re-main as an enormous challenge.This study jointly presents the varied impact of tillage practices on soilquality, soil carbon sequestration (SCS), GHG emissions, leaching of Cand N, and water pollution ( Fig. 2 ). Previous reviews or meta-analyses con-sidered only the effects of NT, CT, or DT on SCS or only their pathways ( Baiet al., 2019 ;Haddaway et al., 2017 ;Bandyopadhyay, 2019 ) or only N 2Oemissions ( Huang et al., 2018 ;Feng et al., 2020 ) or only water pollution(Elias et al., 2018 ;Daryanto et al., 2017a ). Optimizing tillage practices foragronomic and environmental bene ﬁts requires insights into the synergiesand trade-offs of these practices. We hypothesized that improved tillagepractices could enable agriculture to contribute to soil carbon sequestration(SCS) and mitigate GHG emissions and leaching of nutrients and pesticides.Our study provides in-depth global insights into the varied impacts of dif-ferent tillage systems on soil carbon storage and air and water pollution.2. Tillage practices and their impacts on soil carbon sequestration andrelated soil properties2.1. Tillage practicesConventional tillage (CT) is described as any tillage activity that utilizescultivation such as ploughing and harrowing to prepare a seedbed, removeplant residues from the previous crops, or manage weeds. CT improves soilporosity, aeration, temperature and favors good root growth. No-tillage(NT)/zero tillage is the extreme form of conservation tillage practicewhere seeds are sown in a no-tilled soil without incorporating residuesinto soils from previous crops ( Horowitz et al., 2012 ). Reduced tillage(RT) or minimum tillage (MT) is another conservation tillage techniquethat does not turn the soil over, thus avoiding changes in soil structure. Incontrast, the soil surface is kept partly covered by 15% or 30% of cropFig. 1. Conceptual schematic diagram illustrating tillage practices (NT and CT) impact soil-air-water quality. Note: SCS- soil carbon sequestration, POM - particulate organicmatter.S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541613residues from the previous crop. Compared to CT, NT/RT practices tend toincrease soil moisture retention and improve water in ﬁltration, but the soilremains prone to wind and water erosion. Ridge tillage (RiT) is a method ofseedbed preparation where the topsoil is concentrated in a de ﬁned regionto raise the seedbed above the natural topography. RiT is considered as asustainable tillage practice in the black soils of China ( Liu et al., 2018 ).Deep tillage (DT) involves mechanical modi ﬁcation of the soil pro ﬁlesuch as subsoiling, deep ploughing, and mixing of soil pro ﬁles that can alle-viate high subsoil compaction, and help deeper rooting of plants to reachwater and nutrients from the subsoil ( Tian et al., 2016 ;Scanlan andDavies, 2019 ;Schneider et al., 2017 ). This type of tillage may not be prac-tical for sites without root-restricting soil layers and could even decreasethe crop yields in that situation. It is only recommended for areas with apresence of root-restricting soil layers, especially in regions with continualaridity and erratic rainfall ( Schneider et al., 2017 ). Strip-Tillage (ST) is amethod of tillage where the soil is disturbed just in the seeding row whileleaving the inter-row with residue cover, conserving soil moisture, decreas-ing penetration resistance, and creating an ideal seedbed for plant emer-gence and development ( Licht and Al-Kaisi, 2005 ). Strategic tillage (STR)aims to achieve a balance between NT and CT, combining the bene ﬁts be-tween both methods while minimizing the negative impacts of NT ( Danget al., 2015 ). The main objective of this kind of tillage is to manageherbicide-resistant weeds, diseases, and insects that have a below-groundpupal stage.2.2. Impacts on soil carbon sequestrationSoil organic matter (SOM) is a mixture of materials, including organicparticles, humus, coal, and living microbial biomass and the ﬁne roots ofplants ( Stockmann et al., 2013 ). SOM improves soil chemical and biologicalcharacteristics, increases water and nutrient use ef ﬁciency, and promotesimproved agricultural output and sustainability ( Obalum et al., 2017 ;Sarker et al., 2018a, 2018b ). It contains three-folds more C than anyother source ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ). SOM usually comprises almost half ormore than half of soil organic carbon (SOC) of its total composition(Pribyl, 2010 ). This indicates the dependent dynamism (changes in SOMcan induce change in SOC) of SOM on SOC. The SOM stabilization is attrib-uted to the humi ﬁcation process, which favors the selective preservation ofmore recalcitrant organic structures, the physical protection of soil aggre-gates, and chemical bonds through organo-mineral complexes ( Bottinelliet al., 2017 ;Sarker et al., 2018a, 2018b ;Six et al., 2002 ).However, SOC is prone to changes due to different tillage practices. Forinstance, CT increases O 2availability and microorganisms' access to soil ag-gregates, speeding up SOM decomposition, stimulating oxidation of SOC toform CO 2(Sithole et al., 2019 ;Six et al., 2000 ). Especially, CT withharrowing and ploughing makes the SOM more exposed to microorganismsand increases mineralization, which may trigger higher CO 2emissions fromsoils ( Galdos et al., 2019 ;Marafon et al., 2020 ). In addition, in a maize cul-tivation system, mixing crop residues in deeper soil layers through CT mayencourage higher microbial activity, enhancing CO 2emissions compared toRT (Rutkowska et al., 2018 ), which corroborates with the ﬁndings ofFranco-Luesma et al. (2020) . They concluded that apart from microbial ac-tivities, higher soil temperature and around 60% water- ﬁlled pore space(WFPS) may contribute to the higher CO 2emissions from CT soils. In NTsystems, soils are not disturbed, kept covered by crop residues, reducesplash erosion of the topsoil so that SOM may remain proportionally higherin the upper soil than in deeper layers ( Corbeels et al., 2016 ;Lal, 2019 ). A23 years study in Brazil revealed that NT increases the particulate organiccarbon (POC), the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), andhumin contents. This enhances the ef ﬁcacy of SCS in diverse organic matterfractions ( Ferreira et al., 2020 ). NT systems can increase SOC by increasingthe mean residence time and decreasing turn-over ( Rahmati et al., 2020 ).Fig. 2. Conceptualized schematic representation of the relationship between soil C and N pools, GHG emission, and leaching of C and N. Note: SOC- soil organic carbon, POC-particulate organic carbon, DOC- dissolved organic carbon.S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541614Additionally, in a meta-analysis performed by Haddaway et al. (2017) , 351studies were systematically reviewed and found signi ﬁcantly higher in NTrelative to forms of CT in the 0 –15 cm soil layer. But CO 2emission maybe higher in NT soils. For instance, Li et al. (2010) compared CT and NTin Chinese-directed seeded paddy ﬁelds and found NT substantially aug-mented CO 2than CT. CO 2ﬂuxes might be related to soil temperature(Almaraz et al., 2009 ;Li et al., 2010 ). STR may increase CO 2releasestwo-folds ( Melland et al., 2017 ).Negassa et al. (2015) observed that RiTemits substantial CO 2instead of chisel tillage in various topographicareas. The root causes identi ﬁed were high soil moisture and soil tempera-ture. In ST, fuel consumption and working speed of the tractor remain as thedetermining factor for GHG emissions. For instance, Šarauskis et al. (2017)reported low working speed and working depth augmentation from 0 to200 mm produced the highest CO 2from the system. A long-term experi-ment conducted in Belgium showed higher CO 2production from RT thanCT. The underlying reason might be the uniform incorporation of residuesthroughout the soil pro ﬁle, which improved SOM. Hence, greater microbialrespiration led to the substantial production of CO 2(Lognoul et al., 2017 ).Almaraz et al. (2009) reported tillage-derived CO 2ﬂuxes as season-dependent in soybean ﬁelds. For instance, during summer CO 2emissionswere 160 g m−2d−1and 68 g m−2d−1under CT and NT, respectively,while N 2O emissions remained signi ﬁcantly higher over CT owing to resi-due retention in soils. The reasons behind higher CO 2ﬂuxes may be highersoil temperature (21 –28 °C) and WFPS (44 –60%) in the summer ( Horáket al., 2020 ).Table 1 shows some studies that compared the SOC stock or SOC con-tent in different tillage systems in different soils and regions of the world.It illustrates that a comparison of no tillage with conventual tillage arethe most common studied tillage systems and the intercomparison showsthat SOC stocks or contents are always higher in the no tillage (and alsostrip and ridge tillage) systems as compared to conventional tillage butthe impacts of tillage on SCS is affected by soil-climatic conditions(Abdalla et al., 2013 ).2.3. Impacts on soil structureSoil tillage can have multiple impacts on soil structure ( Table 2 ), andimproved soil structure is vital for greater SCS ( Guo et al., 2020 ). Goodsoil structure ensures preserving SOC for a longer time and preventsbeing respired as CO 2in the atmosphere ( Ewing et al., 2006 ). Studieshave shown that tillage systems exhibit substantial in ﬂuence on SOC dy-n a m i c s ,p o o l s ,s t o c k s ,a n di nS C S( Alvarez and Steinbach, 2009 ;Heet al., 2011 ;Van Den Putte et al., 2010 ;Ramnarine et al., 2018 ;Jhaet al., 2020 ;Awale et al., 2017 ;Mehra et al., 2018 ). Two major poolsthat regulate SOC dynamics are light fractions (LF) and heavy fractions(HF) ( Christensen, 2020 ;Cerli et al., 2012 ). The constituents of HF in-clude water-soluble and non-water-soluble elements. A long-termstudy conducted by Ramnarine et al. (2018) revealed NT exerted a sub-stantial impact on HF, especially on the non-water-soluble fractions andsequestered C, which accounted for 28.9 Mg C ha−1. The sequestered Cwas con ﬁned to 0-10 cm soil depth over CT with increasing soil depth.Thus, an insigni ﬁcant difference exists between NT and CT in these com-ponents. Pinheiro et al. (2015) observed SOC stocking in HF around12.3 g kg−1soil under NT. Again, these fractions may vary with soiltypes. Azam et al. (2020) found HF maintains a strong relationshipwith TOC while LF does not. Therefore, HF regulates SOC dynamics,and undoubtedly, the SCS potential of HF is high. Again, a correlationcan be drawn among SOC, soil aggregation, and tillage operations(Guo et al., 2020 ). Aggregate stability and macroaggregates formationare the prerequisites for effectiv eS C S ;a g g r e g a t ec o l l a p s ec a u s e sS O Closs. Theoretically, C is ﬁrstly captured by macroaggregates and thentransferred to microaggregates, hen ce, macroaggregates enrichment isanother important key to obtaining abundant SCS. High SOC contentis often found in soils with more stable aggregates ( Parvin et al.,2021 ). The stability of soil aggregates increases with microbial activity,which helps create glues such as glomalin, allowing this aggregation.Physical soil aggregates are formed when the soil matrix is disruptedthrough wetting and drying cycles ( Rodríguez et al., 2021 ). Becausesoil aggregates contain nearly 90% of SOC, they are vital componentsof SOC protection. For instance, Kan et al. (2020) found that NT in-creases the proportions of macro-aggregates. Hati et al. (2019) reportedbetter aggregate stabilization through enhanced activities of soil biota(more C enriched macroaggregates) in topsoil under conservative till-age in vertisols of India, although SOC and nutrient strati ﬁcation wasevident. Kravchenko et al. (2011) reported long-term CT affects soil po-rosity and aggregate formation in al ﬁsols. Aggregates, in general, arevulnerable to tillage; disruption of macro-aggregates causes transforma-tions of soil structure to microaggregates. Macro-aggregates are formedby adhesives that result from activities linked to microbial activity ( Kanet al., 2020 ). Resins and glues produced by microbes in the soil helpbind soil particles together to form water-stable aggregates. They func-tion as the main reserves of SOC and could be a useful parameter tomonitor SOC. Pinheiro et al. (2015) acknowledged the signi ﬁcant roleof sand particles in SCS comp ared to silt and clay but af ﬁrmed thesefractions mainly protect and store the sequestered C in soil. Again, till-a g eo p e r a t i o n sh a v eas i g n i ﬁcant effect on soil particles. NT with residueretention increased silt plus clay associated C by 45% and 74% at 0 –20and 20 –40 cm depth, respectively over CT ( Kumar and Nath, 2019 ). De-creasing mechanical cultivation allows SOC to be protected by reducingmacro-and micro-aggregates turnover. This helps minimize exposure ofmore stable SOC to microbial activities ( Brewer and Gaudin, 2020 ).Overall, soil aggregates can shiel d SOC substantially from microbialspells ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ). These studies suggest that microaggregatesare another important regulator of SOC dynamics and can be used as asustainable indicator to identify and calculate the SCS rate.Apart from these, transition from CT to RT may lead to the formationof soil ﬁrmness, but remain unpaid, lacking higher actions by soil micro-organisms ( Schlüter et al., 2018 ). Moldboard plow appeared as the bestoption for conserving soil structure (0-20 cm depth) in a long-term ex-periment in Danish Sandy loam soils compared to RT. Residue retentioncan compensate for the adverse effects created by RT ( Abdollahi andMunkholm, 2017 ). DT is utilized in arid regions with ﬁne or medium-textured soil with high bulk density and soil compaction, while NT/DTrotation tillage bene ﬁts SOC sequestration levels ( Feng et al., 2020 ).In a semi-arid area on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China, DT reducedsoil bulk density at 0 –40 cm layer, favoring root growth and increasedgrain ﬁlling rate and maize grain yield ( Zhai et al., 2017 ). With im-proved soybean yields, the contribution of DT was substantial in a drysilt loam soil having low SOM in Arkansas, USA compared to CT dueto the breakage of the compact layer at 7 to 15 cm in the soil sub-surface, which makes the soil more favorable for plant growth ( Henryet al., 2018 ). and this practice has site-speci ﬁc positive and negative ef-fects on grain yield. Additionally, it is very dependent on environmentalconditions and agronomic management factors ( Feng et al., 2020 ).2.4. Impacts on soil hydrological parametersTillage practices may in ﬂuence soil hydrological parameters largely. Re-cent researches into the impact of NT activities found that, as opposed toother tillage schemes, NT may not facilitate water retention ( Blanco-Canquiet al., 2017 ;Deuschle et al., 2019 ), while other authors exposed increased hy-draulic parameters (e.g., greater saturated hydraulic conductivity) and wateravailability with improved in ﬁltration in NT systems ( Acharya et al., 2019 ;deAlmeida et al., 2018 ). Again, Bertolino et al. (2010) revealed soils under CTremained saturated for a longer time after each shower event. In the case oftorrents, it encouraged inter ﬂows while the NT system continued to drain.This phenomenon was identi ﬁed as the determining factor for increased ero-sion rate under CT systems compared to NT.RiT tends to reduce evapotranspiration and increase soil moisture in theupper soil pro ﬁle, water availability, water use ef ﬁciency, and grain yieldthan CT, especially in the dry season (low rainfall and N) when the wateris a limiting factor for crops ( Li et al., 2018 ). Cross-ridge tillage can beS.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541615used to replace downslope tillage on hilly regions to intercept the surfacerunoff volume, increase water in ﬁltration and reduce loss of topsoil. Thispractice greatly reduces the sediment and N and P losses during heavy rain-fall events in hilly regions from China. This is accomplished by shorteningthe slope length and retaining runoff ( Guo et al., 2019 ). In humidEthiopian Highlands, DT was found to break up the dense soil hardpan,thus, increasing in ﬁltration rates and soil moisture throughout the soil pro-ﬁle, reducing the bulk density, penetration resistance, and soil loss, havinghigh potential to improve degraded soils in that region. The objective of DTis to improve soil functions including water in ﬁltration capacity and rootpenetration, optimizing conditions for crop growth ( Hussein et al., 2019 ;Alcántara et al., 2016 ).3. Impacts of tillage practices on soil erosion and water pollution3.1. Impacts on soil erosionSOC is a primary indicator of soil health ( Krupenikov et al., 2011 ;Manlay et al., 2007 ), and highly sensitive to erosion losses as it remainsconcentrated in the proximity of soil surface. Soil hydrology, SCS, soilwater content, and soil erosion are in terlinked with each other, and till-age practices exhibit a signi ﬁcant impact on them ( Bertolino et al.,2010 ;Moreno-Casasola et al., 2017 ). For instance, in China's calcare-ous soils, Ye et al. (2020) calculated that tillage-induced SOC lossmight account for avg. 77% of total SOC loss during the initial tillageTable 1Impact of different tillage systems on SOC storage under different soil types.Reference(s)Type of TillagePractice(s)Cropping systems SOC/TOC(g kg−1)Total SOC Stock(ton ha−1)Soilclassi ﬁcationRegion/CountryObservation(s)Nath et al.,2017No-Tillage Wheat- mungbean ( Vigna radiata (L.)Wilczek)– 12.5 Inceptisol,mahauliNew Delhi,IndiaNo tillage with residue retentionand nitrogen managementincreased SOC stock.Conventional Tillage – 11.6Dimassiet al.,2014No-Tillage 1st period: maize/winter wheat rotation;2nd period: crop residues were removed;3rd period: winterwheat/barley/sugarbeet/pea; 4th period:catch crop (oats/vetch) after wheat crop8.25 45.1 HaplicLuvisolNorthernFranceNo difference between the tillagesystems from the layer of 27.9 cmafter 40 years with different cropsystems.Shallow Tillage 8.5 44.5Full inversion Tillage 11.0 44.2Rahmatiet al.,2020No-Tillage Rotation of vetch and wheat (one crop peryear)9.8 – Typiccalcixerepts(clay loamtextureMaragheh,EastAzerbaijanProvince,IranConservation tillage practices canincrease SOC by increasing themean residence time anddecreasing turn-over.Reduced-Tillage 9.2 –Conventional Tillage 7.3 –Jha et al.,2020No-Tillage Wheat – 20.9 Vertisol orUsticPellustertQueensland,AustraliaThe greatest increases in SOCoccurred with no tillage at higherrates of N fertilization.Conventional Tillage – 19.9Kumar andNath,2019No-Tillage Wheat/chickpea (winter) and mungbean(summer) after puddled transplanted ricein the rainy season5.2 – Inceptisol(TypicUstochrept,sandy loamtexture)UttarPradesh,IndiaNo tillage signi ﬁcantly differes fromconventional tillage in the 0 –20 cmlayer.Conventional Tillage 3.7 –Pinheiroet al.,2015No-Tillage Rotation of vegetables: tomato, greenpepper and beans15.2 17.6 DystrophicRed Latosol(TypicHaplortox)SoutheastBrazilIn tropical soils, no tillage is themain strategy for SOMaccumulation, even when low inputof vegetables crop residues occurs.Conventional Tillage 10.8 12.3Ramnarineet al.,2018No-Tillage Corn-soybean-wheat rotation 24.1 – TypicHapludalf(siltloam)SouthernOntario,CanadaSigniﬁcant differences observed in0–10 cm layer, but no signi ﬁcantdifferences of TOC in 10 –30 cm forboth tillage treatments.Conventional Tillage 21.0 –Liu et al.,2018Conventional Tillage Maize-soybean rotation 17.2 – Black soil/Hapudoll(clay loamtexture)NortheastChinaRidge tillage generated asigniﬁcantly higher SOC thanconventional tillage in the 0 –5 cm.Ridge-Tillage 26.10 –No-Tillage 25.0 –Alcántaraet al.,2016Deep Tillage Crop rotation: mayze, wheat, oilseed rape,potato,– 142 Cambisolsand PodzolsNorthern andcentralGermanyDeep tillage has a high potential forincreasing SCS through theincorporation of SOC-rich topsoilinto the subsoil.Conventional Tillage – 100JaskulskaandJaskulski,2020Strip-Tillage Winter wheat and barley 11.0 – Cambisol Central andEasternEuropeThe TOC in the 0 –20 cm soil layerincreased more than 1 g kg−1after6 years of ST.Conventional Tillage 9.9 –Endaleet al.,2017Strip-Tillage Cotton and peanut 86.00 – Ultisols SoutheasternUSATOC storage was greater for striptillage than CT, due to reducederosion and decreased runoff.Conventional Tillage 41.6 –S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541616period. A long-term comparative study of CT, NT, and RT revealed thatdepending on soil texture, annual erosion rates from CT, NT, and RTmight be average 20.9, 2.45, and 4.45 t ha−1,r e s p e c t i v e l y( Klik andRosner, 2020 ). SOC subjected to splash erosion may undergo theerosion-sedimentation process. Thus, SCS may be reduced by 0.6 –1.5Gt yr−1(Lal, 2005 ).Klik and Rosner (2020) observed different poten-tials of runoff of N and P from CT, NT, and RT practices. They quanti-ﬁed total N losses ranged from 13.3 –48.1, 1.6 –9.4, and 4.5 –18.7 Kgha−1, respectively, from CT, NT, and RT while total P losses were6.7–29.4, 0.7 –2.4 and 2.1 –3.7 Kg ha−1, respectively. Chowaniaket al. (2020) observed that NT soils might encourage 4% higher runoffover CT, whereas NT soils may have 67% lower soil loss. In addition,NT can reduce total organic C (TOC) loss and organic C loss throughsediments by 46% and 53%, respectively, over CT. NT may reduce run-off volume and sediment losses by 50% and 50% –95%, respectively, inFluvi-Calcaric Cambisol soils ( Carretta et al., 2021 ). Over CT, RT andNT may decrease soil loss from silty clay loam soil by 38 and 65%,a n df r o ms i l tl o a ms o i lv a l u e sr e m a i n7 0 –88% and 84 –93%, respec-tively ( Klik and Rosner, 2020 ).Olson et al. (2013) and colleagues re-ported substantial annual losses of C under different tillage practicesin the USA during 24 years. They revealed that soils under NT lostless amounts (1.2 Mgha−1) of C compared to chisel plow (9.9Mgha−1) and moldboard plow (8.2 Mg ha−1).Novara et al. (2019) es-timated that 9.5 ± 1.2 Mg C ha-1 may be lost annually due to tillagefrom a vineyard. Bogunovic et al. (2018) recorded typical yearly soilloss under NT (0.53 t ha−1), DT (3.11 t ha−1), and CT (13.11 t ha−1)in Croatia. These losses might occur due to soil erosion plus tillage-induced erosion and notably, responsible for decreased SCS ( Lal,2005 ) and water pollution by sedimentation-erosion processes.Again, water erosion may cause the formation of labile C, increasedmineralization-immobilization processes accompanied by elevatedCH4and N 2, consequently water pollution and air pollution mayoccur simultaneously ( Issaka and Ashraf, 2017 ). Intense tillage(e.g., CT) induced erosion may increase soil erosion ( Lal, 2005 ;Chalise et al., 2019 ). These studies suggest that tillage practices mayfacilitate soil erosion and decrease SCS through SOC losses. Moreover,nutrient (N and P) loss through leaching surface/sub-surface runoffmay cause water pollution or water quality degradation by causing eu-trophication or hypertrophication.3.2. Impacts on water pollution3.2.1. Tillage can translocate accumulated nutrients on soil surface to aquaticbodiesFarming intensi ﬁcation has caused greater agricultural input materials,e.g., N and P fertilizers ( Lu and Tian, 2017 )a n dp e s t i c i d e s( Kremer, 2018 ).Unwarranted use of these materials may lead to net anthropogenic imbal-ances in soil systems, in ﬂuencing leaching loss or surface runoff of nutri-ents/contaminants ( Fowler et al., 2013 ). Tillage disturbs the stored soilcontaminants/nutrients, causing them to be lost from the system and intosurrounding bodies of water. There is a strong link between tillage practicesand water contamination ( Chalise et al., 2019 ). Nitrate (NO 3−), for example,is primarily lost by leaching and is one of the most common causes of eutro-phic or hypertrophic conditions ( Lu and Tian, 2017 ;Reza et al., 2020 ;Hanrahan et al., 2019 ;Spiess et al., 2020 ;Syswerda et al., 2012 ). Studieshave shown that different tillage practices can control the leachate volumeand concentration of NO 3−(Khan et al., 2017a, 2017b ;Daryanto et al.,2017b ). Additionally, Endale et al. (2019) showed higher sediment lossesand nutrient runoff in ultisols under NT compared to CT. Residue retentionand soil compaction may enhance runoff volume, increased macroporesmay contribute to leachate volume, and SOM may contribute to runoffand leachate concentration ( Daryanto et al., 2017a, 2017b ). These studiesindicate that tillage systems can in ﬂuence nutrient loss trails and contributesubstantially to the deterioration of water quality and eutrophication.Khan et al. (2017a, 2017b) demonstrated that soils under CT, RT andDT tend to show varying capacities regarding leaching loss of NO 3−. For ex-ample, RT can signi ﬁcantly reduce NO 3−concentration at 0 –25 cm soildepth compared to CT and DT, but increased NO 3−concentration 17.34%observed at 25 –50 cm depth. That indicates CT and DT's potential to surfacewater contamination through NO 3−elimination from the soil system, whilethe deeper movement of NO 3−under NT may prevent ground water con-tamination. Spiess et al. (2020) revealed that NO 3−leaching rates are regu-lated by the quantity of soil NO 3−and they quanti ﬁed leaching loss of 50 kgNh a−1yr−1under NT and mouldboard plow practices in a diverse crop ro-tation system.Further, Hess et al. (2020) found that NT can create a buffer againstleaching loss of N. Daryanto et al. (2017b) showed in a meta-analysis thatalthough leachate NO 3−load and runoff NO 3−concentration from NT wasdetermined by water ﬂux, values were higher than CT. RiT has a greaterleaching potential of NO 3−in sandy soils, especially after rainfall ( Waddelland Weil, 2006 ). Contrarily, RiT reduced surface runoff and leaching lossof N in paddy soils compared to CT ( Qin et al., 2020 ). Ridge coupled withNT can slow down NH 4+oxidation, thereby reducing the leaching loss ( Liet al., 2015 ). Under simulated rainfall conditions in wheat-soybean rota-tion, Daverede et al. (2003) found the concentration of PO 42−leachatewas 0.40 and 0.24 mgL−1under NT and chisel plow tillage systems. Toﬁnd out why such a higher rate of leaching loss, Williams et al. (2018) ob-served that fertilization has a great impact under NT soils to induce higherleaching. They concluded that instead of broadcasting, injection or fertilizerplacement through tillage could reduce the volume associated with waterquality degradation. However, recent studies investigating the preventionof leaching and runoff from soils revealed that applying animal manurescoupled with nitrapyrin could reduce both N and P leaching ( Luo et al.,2017 ;Giacometti et al., 2020 ).3.2.2. Tillage can release soil stored pesticides/herbicides to aquatic bodiesSeveral studies have shown that applie d pesticides can cause malfunctionof soil biota and decay of soil structure ( Kremer, 2018 ;Yang et al., 2018 ),even accumulation of heavy metals in cultivated soils ( Soane et al., 2012 ),and they are major agents of eco-degradation. Soils act as a reservoir for con-taminants safeguarding them from leaching and entry to the aquatic systems,most importantly, translocation by plants ( Düring et al., 2002 ). Many studiesidenti ﬁed the persistent existence of several heavy metals in topsoils of rice(Abuzaid and Bassouny, 2020 ;Ali et al., 2018 ), maize, soybean, chihuasquash ( Dzul-Caamal et al., 2020 ), etc., even, sub-surface soils may also re-main subjected to extreme, high and moderate levels of contaminationTable 2Role of some selected tillage practices in improving soil structure.Tillage practices Role (s)No Tillage (NT) 1. The inclusion of plant residues and lack of disturbance to soilencourage NT to increase SOM, aggregate-induced SOC, stableaggregates, increased micropores, and smart connectivity,improving soil structural stability and resistance against rainfallevents near the soil surface ( Wang et al., 2019 ;Guo et al., 2020 ;Chenu et al., 2019 ).2. NT may induce greater bulk density and bearing capacity of soilcompared to CT and RT and alter water pathways bene ﬁcial forsoil microorganisms ( Soane et al., 2012 ).Reduced Tillage(RT)1. RT encourages lower bulk density, increased soil porosity, andair space, higher saturated hydraulic conductivity, highermacroporosity, and pore connectivity ( Schlüter et al., 2018 ).2. Contrarily, lack of soil disturbance may lead to decreased airpore space, increased bulk density, and penetration resistance inthe topsoil ( Abdollahi and Munkholm, 2017 ).Deep Tillage(DT)1. DT reduces higher bulk density and soil compaction, improvesSOM and favors good root growth ( Feng et al., 2020 ;Zhai et al.,2017 ;Henry et al., 2018 ), but might not be a good option forthe soils with poor structure ( Alcántara et al., 2016 ).Strip Tillage(ST)1. ST creates mechanical resistance, providing a good soil structurethat is capable of withstanding mechanical stress ( Pöhlitz et al.,2018 ).2. It may reduce nutrient mineralization in soils ( Laufer and Koch,2017 ).Strategic tillage(STR)1. STR lowers bulk density, improves aggregate stability and pen-etration resistance induced by NT ( Çelik et al., 2019 ).S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541617(Abuzaid and Bassouny, 2020 ). Additionally, several studies explicitlyshowed that SOM plays a leading role in the adsorption, binding, and storingof applied pesticides in soil ( Stevenson, 1972 ;Hayes, 1970 ;Hance, 1974 ;Payá-Pérez et al., 1992 ). Under such context, it's critical to ﬁgure out how dif-ferent tillage techniques affect surface/subsurface runoff processes, includingleaching by altering SOM or other soil qu alities, or how they affect pollutanttransport to aquatic bodies. Mottes et al. (2020) reported that tillage mightinduce leaching loss of pesticides through i) SOM dilapidation, ii) alteredwater pathways within soil systems, and iii) amorphous phyllosilicate(e.g., allophane clay) corrosion. In a 13-year ﬁeld trial, Babal et al. (2021) re-vealed that pendimethalin herbicide applied in an alluvial sandy loam soilunder NT may be ﬁltrated down to the subsoil compared to CT, althoughNT increased 69% higher SOC stock in 0 –5 cm soil while the leaching ratew a so b s e r v e da l m o s ts a m eb e t w e e nC Ta n dN T .As t u d yd i dn o t ﬁnd any ef-fect of NT on surface runoff of herbicides in a soybean-corn rotation. At thesame time, CT impacted the loss of herbicide due to the wash off of theintercepted herbicides on the plant residue ( Gonzalez, 2018 ). Contrarily,NT may increase glyphosate herbicide loss by surface runoff compared toCT, due to increased residue cover, reducing sorption ( Shipitalo andOwens, 2011 ). Glyphosate may exhibit signi ﬁcant residual levels in soilsunder NT, which may adversely impact soil microbiome ( da Silva et al.,2021 ) .T h eh e r b i c i d e sa t r a z i n ea n dm e t o l a c h l o ra r ea l s ol o s ti nh i g h e rq u a n -tity through surface runoff from NT compared to mulch tillage ( Ghidey et al.,2010 ). Residual herbicides bound to mineral and organic fractions in the soilcan be leached out through surface runoff, producing water pollution and ad-versely impacting human health ( Alletto et al., 2010 ). Compared to CT, ameta-analysis indicated that NT might have a modest effect in lowering pes-ticide load in the runoff. Still, it postul ated that soil properties, such as acidsoil pH, could modify pesticides' physicochemical properties (polarity, pKa)and affect their mobility to water bodies ( Elias et al., 2018 ). In moderatelyﬁne and medium-textured soils with less than 2.3% SOM, NT may enhancepesticide concentration and loads in runoff ( Elias et al., 2018 ).Potter et al.(2015) quanti ﬁed 2.5 folds greater sub-surface loss of pesticide ﬂuometuronunder ST, although ST may reduce surface runoff of this pesticide by 10 timescompared to CT. In addition, surface runoff volume under CT may be 2 timeshigher over ST.Kaur et al. (2016) showed clay particles facilitate adsorption and theSOM handles the desorption of pesticides in soils as observed for the fateof pretilachlor in Punjab soils. The releasing capacity of different soils isvariable. For instance, loamy sand soils favor more leaching loss of pesti-cides ( Kaur et al., 2016 ). Apart from these, the role of soil aggregates cannotbe overlooked. Soil aggregates play a pivotal role in capturing and accessi-bility of the accumulated heavy metal in cultivated soils ( Huang et al.,2017 ).Huang et al. (2017) observed reduced action of metals in the greatersoil depth, thus indicating the importance of maintaining CT or other tillagemethods except NT because CT or other tillage practices tend to invert thesoil pro ﬁle. Similarly, observations of long-term tiling impact on EutricCambisol and Luvisol revealed soils under NT accumulated more pollutantscompared to CT ( Düring et al., 2002 ).These studies indicate that waterbodies are at signi ﬁcant risk of pollu-tion by tillage practices worldwide. NT although facilitates condensationof pollutants in surface soils, organic amendments can help to a great extentto reduce the leaching loss of pollutants from the surface soil. For example,chlordecone is considered a major soil contaminant and threat to humanand crop health ( Clostre et al., 2014 ;Mottes et al., 2020 ). Organic amend-ments can act as a potential sequestration tool in this context. Clostre et al.(2014) observed seven times decrease in leaching, and only 5% organicusage led to a substantial reduction of contaminant uptake by crops.4. Tillage-induced synergies and trade-offs in greenhouse gasemissions4.1. Tillage induced GHG emissionsRegulation of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere is an impor-tant soil ecosystem service that is affected by tillage practices ( Table 3 )(Lal, 2019 ;Prado et al., 2016 ). Quantifying CO 2/C H 4output proportionis crucial because the net bene ﬁt from SCS could not be achieved due tothe excess releases ( Yu et al., 2008 ). But, contrasting research resultsmake tillage's role in GHG emissions questionable ( Table 4 ). For instance,decreases in GHG emissions in NT systems compared to CT were observed(Li et al., 2013 ;de Figueiredo et al., 2018 ;Fangueiro et al., 2017 ;Lu et al.,2016 ), while some reported no signi ﬁcant difference or increase on theGHG ( Oorts et al., 2007 ;Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2016a,2016b ). A global meta-analysis conducted by Shakoor et al. (2021) and col-leagues revealed that NT augmented global CO 2,N2O, and CH 4emissionsby 7.1%, 12%, 20.8%, respectively, compared to CT. More speci ﬁcally, asubstantial increase in N 2Oa n dC H 4discharges occurred globally in rainfedand irrigated agricultural areas. Another rigorous meta-analysis of 740paired observations showed that NT has a considerable potential to mini-mize GHG and the global warming potential (GWP); however, net bene ﬁtsrequire further understanding of the agroecological environment ( Huanget al., 2018 ). Additionally, life-cycle assessment of tillage practices revealedthat the impact order of GHG production is CT >NT>RT (Sørensen et al.,2014 ). The underlying cause was the higher mineralization rate in soils. NTwith legumes as cover crops can boost N 2O emission, but the SCS rate andSOC deposition rate can dominantly mitigate the CO 2amount of N 2O, andNT soils act as a potential sink for GHG ( Bayer et al., 2016 ). NT may reduceGHG indirectly via reduced fossil fuel usage and reduced demand for syn-thetic fertilizers ( Haddaway et al., 2017 ). A recent study in China suggeststhe combination of RiT and NT may act as a potential inhibitor of GHG com-pared to CT and NT ( Li et al., 2021a, 2021b ).4.2. Tillage induced methane emissionsStudies have shown that soils can act as a net source or sink of CH4de-pending on soil temperature, moisture, N level, soil microbial community,air-ﬁlled porosity, spatial heterogeneity of soil pro ﬁle, and so on(Gregorich et al., 2005 ;Bréchet et al., 2021 ;Díaz et al., 2018 ;Feng et al.,2021 ). Overall, drained agricultural soils are a small CH4 sink, while CH4emissions occur in irrigated paddy-rice systems. For example, Shang et al.(2021) evaluated CT and RT in a Chinese double paddy cropping system.They found that CT and RT were responsible for a huge volume of CH 4,yet, CH 4production was related to the SCS potential of the soils.In drained agricultural soils, tillage can alter the mechanisms that gov-ern the release or oxidation of CH 4through its impact on the soil water re-gime ( Feng et al., 2021 ). Moisture generally substantially in ﬂuences CH 4uptake rates ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Hence, structural deterioration, more specif-ically compaction prevalent in extensively tilled soils, can negatively in ﬂu-ence CH 4consumption ( Ball et al., 1999 ). For example, it was found thatCH4uptake was less under STR over NT due to the decreased soil bulk den-sity ( Melland et al., 2017 ). In addition, enhanced residue retention associ-ated with NT may also improve CH 4consumption, as observed in a maizemonoculture system in which NT combined with residue retention wasaround 3 and 1.5 times higher than CT and NT only, respectively ( Franco-Luesma et al., 2020 ). It has been found NT and RT, reducing soil compac-tion, may increase two-fold CH 4uptake compared to CT due to the greatersoil shear strength, pore connectivity, and niche availability. These proper-ties may also improve the functioning of soil methanotrophic population,which may increase CH 4oxidation resulting in lower CH 4emissions(Alskaf et al., 2021 ). In irrigated and/or ﬂooded soils, the impact of tillagepractices differs from drained soils Franco-Luesma et al. (2020) found thatshortly after water application in ﬂooded irrigation, no signi ﬁcant changeswere observed in CH 4ﬂuxes in a maize monocropping system under NTand CT practices. Contrarily, Kim et al. (2016) observed that continuousNT in rice monocropping enhanced soil physical properties and reducedCH4emission during the early years of NT establishment but increasedCH4emission over time. The cause is most likely due to increased labileSOC boosting methanogenic abundance. Overall, however, NT combinedwith residue retention on the soil surface likely lowers CH 4emission fromrice under different tillage practices. For instance, Zhang et al. (2013)showed that residue retention combined with NT enhanced soil porosityS.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1541618and raised the oxidation layer. Hence, CH 4emission appeared to be lowerfrom a Chinese paddy ﬁeld. Similarly, NT with residue retention increasedCH4consumption around 3 and 1.5 times higher compared to CT and NT,respectively ( Franco-Luesma et al., 2020 ). In a bioenergy cropping system,rotary tillage increased CH 4emission compared to NT if combined with soilameliorant or residue retention ( Liu et al., 2015 ).Table 3Overview of different tillage techniques on soil carbon sequestration and GHG emissions.Source Scale Type of tillagepracticesDuration Impact on GHGemissionsImpact on SOCstockImpact on SOC quantity(whole soil pro ﬁle)Impact order of tillage practicesfor SCSShakoor et al.

Tillage induced nitrous oxide emissions and mitigationNitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions from agricultural lands have become amajor concern since i) the global warming potential of N 2O is around 300times higher than CO 2thus, playing a direct role in global climate change,and (ii) it is currently the primary driver of stratospheric ozone layer deple-tion ( Ravishankara et al., 2009 ;Li et al., 2014 ).Li et al. (2005) acknowl-edged that 75 –100% obvious bene ﬁt from SCS could be balanced fromthe upsurge in N 2Oc o n c e n t r a t i o n s( Mei et al., 2018 ;Guenet et al., 2021 ).Nitriﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation predominantly are the main routes ofN2O releases from cultivated ﬁelds ( Braker and Conrad, 2011 ). Nitri ﬁcationis the aerobic biological oxidation of ammonium (NH 4+)t of o r mn i t r i t e(NO 2−), nitrate (NO 3−) as the main products, and N 2O as a byproduct accom-plished by the activities of auto and heterotrophic bacteria. Denitri ﬁcationis the anaerobic reduction of NO 3−to NO 2−,N O ,N 2O, and ﬁnally N 2(Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013 ;Braker and Conrad, 2011 ;Lognoul et al.,2017 ). Both of these processes are dependent on soil microbial metabolicactivities ( Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013 ;Congreves et al., 2017 ).Tillage systems exhibit a role in N 2Oe m i s s i o ne i t h e rb yf a v o r i n go rr e -ducing nitri ﬁcation and/or denitri ﬁcation and thus, soil N 2O emissionsdue to impacts on several factors, including soil texture, soil temperature,water- ﬁled pore space (WFPS), soil mineral nitrogen (NH 4+-N, NO 3—N) con-centration, and C:N ratio ( Davidson and Swank, 1986 ;Abalos et al., 2014 ;Liu et al., 2017 ;Chen et al., 2013 ).Empirical evidence thus shows that the introduction of no-till practiceson N 2O emissions can cause both increases and decreases in N 2Oe m i s s i o n s(van Kessel et al., 2013 ), since it affects the biophysical factors that in ﬂu-ence N 2O emissions in contrasting manners ( Snyder et al., 2009 ). There isgenerally an increase in soil moisture under NT, which is caused by higherwater in ﬁltration rates and reduced soil evaporation. In addition, no-tillpractices tend to increase bulk density and thus higher relative soil mois-ture contents affecting nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation rates and, thereforeN2O emissions ( van Kessel et al., 2013 ). In wet regions, as in the tropicaland humid areas, nitri ﬁcation is thus mostly reduced by no-till practices,whereas it increases in dryer regions. Furthermore, no-till can lower soiltemperature exchange between soil and atmosphere through the presenceof litter residues, which can reduce N 2O emissions ( Enrique et al., 1999 ).However, we lack a complete insight into the impacts of different tillagesystems on the emission of N 2O in dependence on on-site properties(Congreves et al., 2017 ). Studies showed that CT might release 1.4 –6.3folds higher N 2O over NT in cold soils ( Congreves et al., 2017 ).Zhanget al. (2013) showed rotary tillage had the highest potential of N 2Oe m i s -sions over CT and NT. Regina and Alakukku (2010) reported in variousNorthern European Boreal soils that there is indeed a chance of elevatedN2O over the ﬁrst years of NT compared to CT, which may remain almostconsistent in both types. Shakoor et al. (2021) demonstrated in a meta-analysis that NT is responsible for higher N 2O over CT. N 2O releases werehigher in irrigated sub-tropical rice-wheat wheat-maize systems under NTover CT ( Pandey et al., 2012 ;Niu et al., 2019 ). These studies indicate thatwhen tillage intensity is reduced, there remains a chance of higher N 2Oemissions. As per our discussion in Section 2 .0, it can be concluded thathigher N 2O discharges in NT systems might be linked up with increasedSOM, NH 4+plus NO 3−contents, and WFPS. Moreover, a robust meta-analysis comprising 323 observations concluded that activity and numberof denitri ﬁers and the abundance of denitrifying genes were proportionallyhigher in response to NT, however, thus enhancing N2O production as com-pared to CT ( Wang and Zou, 2020 ).Badagliacca et al. (2018) found almostsimilar results in the Mediterranean region. They stated that a substantialamount of N2O was associated with an abundance of denitrifying genes,bacterial activities, greater bulk density, and WFPS. These studies indicatethat soil structure and soil biota also control N 2O releases largely. Con-trarily, Plaza-Bonilla et al. (2018) reported that soils under NT had2.8–3.3 times lower N 2O emitting potential in the rainfed Mediterraneanregion compared to CT. This was because the unaccounted nitrifying andnon-denitrifying populations lacking nitrous oxide reductase might be a po-tential storage for the produced soil N 2O(Hallin et al., 2018 ;Philippotet al., 2011 ;Jones et al., 2013 ). These studies suggest that bene ﬁts fromNT should be evaluated in terms of N 2O production since the global areasunder NT are increasing. Apart from CT and NT, STR reduces N 2O emis-sions in dermosols and sodosols ( Melland et al., 2017 ). RiT has almost sim-ilar trend of N 2O emissions in paddy ﬁelds compared to CT, and even thedifferences were not statistically signi ﬁcant for paddy soils ( Qin et al.,2020 ). Ridge combined with NT can substantially lower N 2O emissionsthan CT in paddy soils ( Li et al., 2015 ).Besides, studies showed that nitri ﬁcation is responsible for most N 2Oemissions in well-aerated soil with less than 60% WFPS, while denitri ﬁca-tion is the major agent of N 2O emissions when soil moisture surpasses70% WFPS ( Pihlatie et al., 2004 ;Bateman and Baggs, 2005 ). In a meta-analysis, Chen et al. (2013) showed that crop residue retention might be fa-vorable for SCS ( Abalos et al., 2013 ), but it provides a congenial microenvi-ronment to denitri ﬁers if WFPS remains 60 –90%. Consequently, asubstantial volume of N 20 releases occur. But at >90% WFPS, it may actas a denitri ﬁcation inhibitor. Abalos et al. (2013) found 105% increasesin N 2O emissions in Mediterranean burley ﬁelds when crop residues areretained, but removal greatly cut off the N 2O level.Nitriﬁcation inhibitors ( Liu et al., 2017 ) such as dicyandiamide (DCD),nitrapyrin, pronitradine, etc., are proven to be the most promising means ofabating N 2O pollution from agricultural soils. For example, when nitroge-nous fertilizers are broadcasted, nitrapyrin can reduce N 2O emissionsfrom cold semiarid climatic soils by 41% and 32%, respectively, as foundin maize crop ﬁelds under both CT and RT practices ( Borzouei et al.,2021 ). Additionally, nitrapyrin addition can signi ﬁcantly slow down NH 4+oxidation ( Hayden et al., 2021 ;Giacometti et al., 2020 ).Liu et al. (2017) re-ported nitrapyrin plus urea addition in calcareous drip fertigated cottonsoils might signi ﬁcantly stabilize soil NH 4+-N content and decrease N 2Oemissions, but dependent on WFPS percentage. Combined application ofnitrapyrin and DMPSA (3,4-dimethylpyrazole succinic acid) substantiallyreduced N 2O emissions in both gray Luvisol 60% and 56% at 60% and80% WFPS, respectively ( Lin and Hernandez-Ramirez, 2020 ).Meng et al.(2020) found DCD, nitrapyrin, and N- (n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide(NBPT) as the potential N 2ﬁxer in paddy soils. These studies indicate thatsoil water content has a prominent role in both nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁca-tion processes also on the effectiveness of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors. These sub-stances can improve bene ﬁts from SCS by abating soil N 2O releases byincreasing the use ef ﬁciency of nitrogenous fertilizers under different till-age systems.5. Overall conclusions and perspectivesThis review compares and contrasts the co-bene ﬁts and trade-offs pro-duced from the impact of different tillage practices. We also highlightedseveral important soil ecosystem services (soil carbon sequestration, GHGregulation, water, and air quality) and their inter-and intra- relationshipswith different tillage practices. We con ﬁrm our hypothesis that improvedtillage practices can enable agriculture to contribute to soil carbon seques-tration (SCS) and mitigate GHG emissions and loss of accumulated nutri-ents and pesticides. Our signi ﬁcantﬁndings are:a) SOM is very prone to different tillage practices. Therefore, SOM protec-tion is crucial for maximized SCS. Although NT practices tend to enrichSOM in the upper surface of soils, our study indicated that its impact onthe whole soil pro ﬁle is still dubious. Therefore, DT is a good option forimproving continuous NT soils and mixing up the SOM across the entiresoil pro ﬁle since NT promotes greater bulk density.b) CT emits more CO 2than NT because of higher mineralization rates, mi-crobial activity, and soil temperature and moisture. Although NT andRT have a greater SCS than other tillage techniques, higher soil temper-atures may cause sequestered carbon to be lost. Higher N 2O emissionunder NT is related to soil moisture, increased denitri ﬁer activity, andhigher NO 3−levels in soils. Therefore, soil moisture management is cru-cial to prevent N 2O emissions from NT soils.c) The volume and magnitude of leaching loss of pesticides and nutrientsS.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 15416110are relatively low in the case of CT and DT compared to NT, as they canbury them deep inside of soils. For example, we observed that NT en-hances NO 3−leaching over CT because of improved soil structure, in ﬁl-tration capacity, and greater water ﬂux.d) Tillage erosion coupled with splash/wind erosion remains a signi ﬁcantproblem. These processes may decrease the rate of SCS and increase themagnitude of nutrient pollution (eutrophication) in water bodies.e) Nitri ﬁcation inhibitors such as nitrapyrin or DCD coupled with nitroge-nous fertilizers can potentially reduce N 2O emissions from soils. The ad-vantages of nitrapyrin should be evaluated more in ﬁeld settings ( Luoet al., 2017 ). Future research on how to improve the effectiveness ofnitrapyrin should be expanded. Despite preventing N 2O emissions,these substances are also quite capable of avoiding leaching loss of nu-trients (N and P). Our study suggests that improvement of tillage prac-tices in terms of mitigation of N 2O emission and preventing NO 3−pollution may be achievable if these inhibitors are applied.Apart from these, we also demonst rated that the accumulation ofSOC and associated SCS is highly correlated with adopted tillage sys-tems. All of the tillage practices have the potential to improve SCS, nev-ertheless, the role of NT over other practices on SCS is still unclear(Chatterjee and Lal, 2009 ), and also full potential is con ﬁned to certainpedo-climatic-regional conditions. Based on our current understanding,it can be concluded that if soil-climatic needs are not taken seriously,then it may produce erroneous estimates. The confounding factor thattriggers the uncertainties and variations in data might be heterogeneityin the adopted outlook regarding NT ( Meurer et al., 2018 ).Derpschet al. (2014) proposed to develop a systematic procedure based onspatio-temporal variations to avoid existing doubts regarding the SCSpotential of NT.Additionally, Xiao et al. (2020) andBlanco-Canqui et al. (2021)identi ﬁed the depth factor as the main reason for fueling debate regard-ing NT. Moreover, CT can improv e SOC contents, ultimatelyreallocating C content in the whole soil pro ﬁle. NT/RT practices im-prove soil moisture, water in ﬁltration, stable aggregates, increased mi-cropores, POC, MAOM, humin contents, TSN, MBC, TOC, etc. RT soilshave a lower bulk density over NT, higher macropore, and improvedaeration. RiT is associated with decreased evapotranspiration loss, im-proved water use ef ﬁciency, and greater SCS than CT and NT. Reducederosion and reduced runoff from ST system yield in improved SCS,TOC, and TON. STR improves aggregat e stability, bulk density, soilcompactions, and a smart quantity of sequestered C. DT effectivelyraises SOM contents and improves SCS. We found a dearth of researchinﬁnding out the GHG emissions caused by STR, ST, and RiT. It's criticaltoﬁnd a sustainable solution for limiting C losses under high soil tem-perature using various tillage techniques. In addition, evaluation of eu-trophication potential of different tillage practices (e.g., NT) should betaken into consideration. Current research is much focused on CT andNT, their SCS potential evaluation, and GHG producing capabilities. Fu-ture research on other forms of tillage practices needs to be undertakento have a clear insight into other practices.CRediT authorship contribution statementSiddhartha Shankar Bhattacharyya: Conceptualization, Data Analy-sis, Tables, Figures, Writing-Original Draft, Reviewing and Editing.Fernanda Figueiredo Granja Dorilêo Leite: Data Analysis, Tables,Writing-Original Draft.
