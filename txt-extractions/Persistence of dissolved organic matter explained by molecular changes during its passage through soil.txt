DOM, initially leached from decomposing plant material or exuded directly (for example, as carbohydrates and organic acids) from roots, changes its characteristics during its transport through the soil3,4. The study of DOM may thus provide information about a range of processes within the zone from vegetation down to groundwater, known as the Critical Zone5,6. Organic matter production, its degradation, repro -cessing, storage and its transport downward all take place in the Critical Zone7. These processes have been identified as the cause of rapid changes in terrestrial DOM properties as it passes through the soil profile and finally enters the groundwater. However, a general  consensus on how these processes affect the molecular DOM  properties during its downward transport is lacking. There has  been debate for many years about the chemical nature of DOM  molecules, namely whether there are molecules being intrinsically recalcitrant8,9. Recalcitrant molecules are assumed to be refractory and not easily decomposed because of their molecular properties. As a consequence of intrinsic recalcitrance, the same molecu-lar structures containing the same atoms remain in the system. However, recent findings suggest that the turnover of soil organic matter with soil depth is largely controlled by its accessibility10, concentration11, bioavailability and biodegradability12,13 but not pri -marily affected by any intrinsic recalcitrance of DOM molecules8,14. Instead, the concept of persistence15 suggests that DOM molecules are continuously found in soil because they are constantly recy -cled, transformed and assembled. As a consequence of persistence, the same molecular structures that contain atoms from different sources are found in the system. Vertical transport of DOM through the soil column is accompanied by a series of sorption and desorp-tion processes together with microbial processing4,12,16. Aspects of structural changes of DOM with depth are visible even to the naked eye owing to preferential loss of light-absorbing structures (that is, coloured organic matter), changing the colour of DOM from yellowish-brown to transparent7,17. These changes are independent of the decrease of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. At the level of the compound classes, the hydrophilic fraction and aromatic C and lignin phenols17,18—that is, plant-derived organic molecules19—decrease with soil depth. In turn, altered and repro -cessed microbial-derived molecules increase in abundance4,16. The stepwise degradation of lignin to water-soluble compounds20  and then possibly to extended aromatic compounds21 is therefore suggested to be an important contribution to DOM formation22.Sorption processes themselves change the composition of  DOM during soil passage: for instance, lignin degradation products Persistence of dissolved organic matter explained by molecular changes during its passage  through soilVanessa-Nina Roth1,2, Markus Lange   1*, Carsten Simon1, Norbert Hertkorn3, Sebastian Bucher1, Timothy Goodall4, Robert I.

Oram6,7, Alexandra Weigelt8,9, Thorsten Dittmar   10,11 and Gerd Gleixner   1Dissolved organic matter affects fundamental biogeochemical processes in the soil such as nutrient cycling and organic matter storage. The current paradigm is that processing of dissolved organic matter converges to recalcitrant molecules (those that resist degradation) of low molecular mass and high molecular diversity through biotic and abiotic processes. Here we dem-onstrate that the molecular composition and properties of dissolved organic matter continuously change during soil passage and propose that this reflects a continual shifting of its sources. Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the molecular changes of dissolved organic matter from the soil surface to 60 cm depth in 20 temperate grassland communities in soil type Eutric Fluvisol. Applying a semi-quantitative approach, we observed that plant-derived molecules were first broken down into molecules containing a large proportion of low-molecular-mass com-pounds. These low-molecular-mass compounds became less abundant during soil passage, whereas larger molecules, depleted in plant-related ligno-cellulosic structures, became more abundant. These findings indicate that the small plant-derived mole-cules were preferentially consumed by microorganisms and transformed into larger microbial-derived molecules. This suggests that dissolved organic matter is not intrinsically recalcitrant but instead persists in soil as a result of simultaneous consump-tion, transformation and formation.NATuRe Ge OSCIeNCe | VOL 12 | SEPTEMBER 2019 | 755–761 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 755Articles Nature GeoscieNceare more efficiently adsorbed than carbohydrates in, for example, clays and other reactive minerals23. Mineral-bound organic mole-cules can be remobilized by percolating surface-reactive plant-derived DOM4 or acidic root exudates24. These changes in DOM are accompanied by microbial processing of organic molecules4,16. Although the microbial community is potentially able to decom -pose the vast majority of DOM molecules, the molecular proper -ties of DOM strongly influence the efficiency of its degradation13. Thus, the microbial community adapts to and degrades key DOM components depending on their molecular properties at specific depths. This microbial degradation leads to changes in the DOM composition and structure with soil depth12. However, microbial processing involves not only consumption and degradation, but probably also the build-up of new molecules25–27. Applying non-targeted ultrahigh-resolution analytical techniques allows us to  capture molecular-level information about DOM for a vast vari -ety of molecules. This enhanced level of information describes the alteration of molecular functionalities and the molecular mass  of DOM along gradients and provides access to a more detailed molecular-level understanding of the processes than has been  previously available. This insight is needed to link processes that are shown to affect DOM degradation, transformation and (re)syn-thesis during passage through the Critical Zone and to reveal the relative importance of the proposed mechanisms.In this study we examine the molecular composition of soil DOM from 20 grassland communities from the surface to a depth of 60 cm using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (electrospray ioniza-tion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, ESI-FT-ICR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  (1H NMR). The composition and properties of DOM identified by these ultrahigh-resolution methods are related to known environ -mental drivers of DOM composition, namely: (1) root standing biomass, a proxy indicative of plant-derived inputs, (2) microbial biomass and genetic diversity as proxies for the community of decomposers and recyclers and (3) the clay, carbon and nitrogen contents in the soil as a proxy for soil physical constraints. We hypothesize that the key drivers of the formation and transforma-tion of DOM are mainly inputs from plants and their microbial conversion products, having even stronger effects than physical processes such as sorption to minerals.Chemical DOM characteristics at different soil depthsIn all soil profiles, DOC concentrations decreased with soil depth (R2 = 0.41; P value < 0.001), with the largest decrease observed at  depths between 30 cm and 60 cm (Supplementary Table 1). Concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) did not change with soil depth (P  value = 0.445), and consequently the DON/ DOC ratio increased.

Along the soil profile, the molecular com -position of DOM continuously changed as the relative abundance of low-mass DOM molecules (mass-to-charge ratio m /z = 150–275) decreased with depth in comparison with those in the mid-molec-ular-mass range (m /z = 300–450) (Fig. 1a–d). Thus, the molecular composition of DOM became more dissimilar with larger distance between sampling depths (Supplementary Table 2). However, most of the detected molecules occurred at all depths, but with varying relative abundance. Therefore, the shift of molecular properties dur-ing downward transport, as revealed by differential mass spectra (see Methods), was maximal between DOM at depths of 10 cm and 60 cm (Fig. 1e–g; Table 1 ). In the differential mass spectra, based on the complete spectra (‘ All compounds’ in Table 1 ), mainly aromatic CHO compounds (containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, with aromaticity index AImod > 0.54; refs. 28) of low molecular mass became considerably less abundant with depth. Compounds that were more abundant at 60 cm were mainly CHO compounds, too, but were characterized by remarkably similar, narrow O/C and H/C ranges in the mid-molecular-mass range (Fig. 1h), in which the num-ber of isomers for any given molecular compositions is maximal29. These trends were also observed when considering only CHNO compounds (containing nitrogen besides C, H and O atoms) and, less specifically, when considering only CHOS compounds (contain-ing sulfur besides C, H and O atoms; Table 1 ; Fig. 1i,j). The shift in abundances was remarkably consistent around m /z 300 for the com -plete spectra, the CHNO compounds and the CHOS compounds, although the CHOS compounds were less numerous (Table 1 ).1H solution NMR spectra confirmed the changes in DOM molecular composition with depth that had been demonstrated by FT-ICR-MS. The relative proportions of aromatic and olefinic as well as those of O-alkyl carbon (indicative of carbohydrates and methoxy functional groups) decreased with depth, whereas the amount of saturated groups (aliphatic, sp3-hybridized carbon) increased with depth (Supplementary Fig. 1). The relative propor -tions of acetate analogues and carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules were nearly constant along the depth profile.Drivers of the DOM transformation during soil passageThe decline of the low-molecular-mass compounds towards more prominent mid-molecular-mass compounds over depth (for the cat-egories in Table 1: all compounds, only CHNO compounds and only CHOS compounds) was reflected by a large increase in the weighted mean of m/z (Fig. 1k; Supplementary Table 3). The shift in molecu-lar mass was accompanied by a considerable decrease in abundance of unsaturated molecules, as indicated by the weighted mean of the H/C ratio and a decrease of the weighted mean of DOM aromaticity in all compounds and CHNO compounds (Fig. 1l,n). The satura-tion of CHOS compounds did not change with soil depth, whereas AImod increased substantially (Fig. 1l,n). The weighted mean of the O/C ratio of the CHNO compounds slightly increased with depth, whereas the weighted mean of the O/C ratio of all compounds and CHOS compounds did not change with depth (Fig. 1m).The effect of depth on the molecular properties and composi-tion of DOM has mostly been accounted for by the decrease of root biomass, soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen along the soil profile, but not by the soil clay content (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, the decrease of root standing biomass, organic carbon and nitrogen along the soil profile were highly inter-correlated (Supplementary Table 4). To estimate the relative importance of potential drivers of the DOM transformation, we compared the influences of (1) plant inputs (root standing biomass), (2) soil properties (contents of  clay, organic carbon, nitrogen) and (3) the microbial community (bacterial and fungal biomass and their respective genetic diversity). To eliminate the inter-correlation among the variables with depth, this estimation was performed for the topsoil. Variation partition-ing showed that the chosen parameters accounted for the molecu -lar DOM variation between 67% and 46% (Supplementary Fig. 3). The soil microbial community was the most important predictor (explaining on average 25% of the molecular DOM variation) fol-lowed by the soil properties (19%) and root biomass (10%, Fig. 2a). In addition, a large part of the variation (13%) was jointly explained by the microbial community and root biomass. Bacteria generally explained more of the variability than fungi (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 3). However, more than 40% of the DOM variation remains unexplained (Fig. 4, residuals), suggesting that other environmen-tal variables contribute to DOM variability. This unexplained DOM variability might be related to the chemical composition of soil clay, the exudate and root chemistry (influenced by plant composition and diversity) or to the composition of the community of decom-posers and higher trophic levels. Furthermore, a significantly posi -tive correlation of the chemodiversity with the bacterial diversity (r = 0.46, P = 0.048) but not with the fungal diversity (r = −0.36, P = 0.127) confirmed the strong relation of the bacterial commu -nity to molecular DOM composition. Interestingly, this important relationship was not related to the diversity of DOM compounds  (calculated as the Shannon index) but to the dominance structure of the DOM samples (Simpson’s index30). This positive relation indicates that a more diverse bacterial community results in a more evenly distributed DOM composition (Supplementary Fig. 4).A semi-quantitative approximation of the abundances of indi-vidual compounds was applied to evaluate whether the increased weighted mean of m/z with depth is a result of the disappearance of the low-molecular-mass compounds or of new formation of mid-molecular-mass compounds. Therefore, FT-ICR-MS signal intensities of individual molecular formulae were scaled to DOC concentrations31. This approximation indicated that the increase of the weighted mean of m/z with soil depth was caused by both an absolute decline in abundance of low-molecular-mass com-pounds and by an absolute increase in abundance of mid- and high-molecular-mass compounds (Fig. 3a). Although the abundance of low-molecular-mass compounds continuously decreased with soil depth, the mid- and high-molecular-mass compounds became more abundant between depths of 10 cm and 30 cm and declined below 30 cm. Unexpectedly, the shift in the ratio of intensities of low- to mid-molecular-mass compounds (Imid/Ilow) was strongly T able 1 | Molecular properties derived from differential mass spectra shown in Fig. 1e–gCompounds Depth m/z Number of formulae H/C ratio O/C ratio AImodAll 10 165–341 125 0.44–1.00 0.15–0.75 0.45–0.85All 60 335–507 77 1.10–1.40 0.35–0.56 0.14–0.39CHNO 10 154–370 251 0.42–1.22 0.13–0.71 0.36–1.00CHNO 60 320–494 104 1.05–1.41 0.35–0.56 0.16–0.45CHOS 10 247–275 5 1.40–1.80 0.50–0.70 0.00–0.23CHOS 60 369–471 31 1.22–1.50 0.39–0.56 0.00NATuRe Ge OSCIeNCe | VOL 12 | SEPTEMBER 2019 | 755–761 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 757Articles Nature GeoscieNcerelated to the degradation state of DOM (R2 = 0.71), described as the degradation index Ideg (see Methods32) (Fig. 3b). Thus, both DOM degradation increased (higher Ideg) and DOM molecular mass increased (higher Imid/Ilow) with soil depth.Mechanisms underlying the persistence of DOMThe results presented here strongly indicate that there is micro -bial processing, but not production of recalcitrant products, as  DOM moves through soils and sediments. The continual shift of molecular composition and properties of DOM during its soil  passage furthermore indicates an ongoing transformation of  DOM at the molecular level (Fig. 4). The most unexpected change along the soil profile was the shift from low-molecular-mass to mid-molecular-mass compounds, which seems to be a general  pattern, independent of land use and soil (see Supplementary Fig. 5  for supplementary grassland and forest sites). At 10 cm depth, the most abundant compounds are characterized by a high level of unsaturation, related to polycyclic aromatics (AImod ≥ 0.67), including condensed combustion-derived dissolved black carbon  (C atoms n > 15), and other highly aromatic compounds (0.69 ≥  AImod ≥ 0.54)22,28. The highly aromatic compounds may include polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics with aliphatic side chains28. Oxygen-poor black carbon (such as polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbon) as a precursor of these compounds may be of anthropogenic origin because the field site is close to an area that was formerly highly industrialized. Microbial alteration of these compounds  was shown in a recent study conducted at the same site33. Those authors reported considerable amounts of polycyclic aromatic compounds that undergo biodegradation, resulting in low-molec-ular-mass oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The most abundant compounds at 60 cm depth are characterized as highly unsaturated but not aromatic compounds (AImod < 0.54 and H/C < 1.5), which could include residues of microorganisms  and degradation products of soil organic matter as well as carbox -ylic-rich alicyclic molecules34. Plant-derived DOM is considered to be more unsaturated and aromatic than microbial-derived sub -stances because of the higher lignin content in plant tissues and other secondary aromatic plant metabolites35,36. In consequence, our data suggest that the observed changes in molecular properties are probably driven by a fast microbial turnover26 of plant-derived DOM during downward transport4,18, which has a high degree  of relative unsaturation and aromaticity (Fig. 4). The results  of both FT-ICR-MS and NMR spectra suggest that aromatic  substances are degradable20 and could be used as indicators of fresh, plant-derived organic matter, or early products of its decomposition. The even greater decrease in abundance of molecular functional groups similar to carbohydrates is as expected17. These functional groups might be derived from plant products, such as carbohydrates and cellulose.In our study, the soil clay content had only minor effects on the molecular properties of DOM during its soil passage. This contrasts  with many studies reporting a strong impact of soil mineralogy on a bResiduals: 67%Soil19%Micro-organisms25%Roots10%13%1%7%Bacteria19% Fungi8%Residuals: 43%Fig. 2 | Variation partitioning for potential drivers of DOM transformation. a, Variation explained by soil, roots and microbial community. b, Variation explained by bacteria and fungi only.

This discrepancy might be attributed to the fact that the soil clay content is a good proxy for mineral stabilization on regional or global scales15, but not on local scales as in our study. The scale-dependency of the mineral-DOM relation is supported when comparing the changes in the DOM mass spectra with soil depth between the Jena site and the supplementary sites (see Methods). Although the depth effect found at the Jena site (Fig. 1) was confirmed by DOM analyses from supplementary grassland and forest sites (Supplementary Fig. 5), the mass change from small compounds to mid-molecular-mass compounds was more pro-nounced at the Jena site. This might be due to a finer grain size  at the Jena site than at the supplementary site, which has a very sandy soil with probably low sorption capacity (see Methods). This indicates (1) a general pattern that the simultaneous decrease of small compounds (150–275 Da) and increase of mid-size com-pounds (300–450 Da) is independent of the soil properties, and  (2) that the soil properties affect the strength of this mass shift, indicating the microbial−mineral interaction during the DOM  soil passage4. The generality of the mass shift, independent of  soil properties, is in line with a recent study showing that the bio -chemical composition of mineral-retained organic matter was similar across four different classes of clay minerals37. However, describing the soil on the basis of its texture is a relatively broad parameter with which to assess mineral−organic interactions in soils. Given that the strength of mineral−organic interactions is  also reflected by the soil organic carbon content38, we have statisti -cally considered the soil organic carbon content in our analyses, as this probably controls the mineral−organic interactions. However, we acknowledge that additional laboratory experiments (such  as our incubation experiment, Supplementary Fig. 6) could also provide detailed mechanistic insights into the mineral−organic interactions to which DOM is exposed during its passage through the soil profile.Although plant-derived inputs in soil water decreased rapidly with soil depth16, we found that root standing biomass, which is a proxy indicative of belowground plant-derived carbon inputs, influenced DOM molecular properties along the entire soil profile. This finding supports the observation that microbial processing and reworking is responsible for changes in the molecular properties of DOM with depth4,16,19. The shared variation in DOM accounted for by the microbial community and root biomass, and the prominent role of the microbial community in explaining DOM variation indicate a strong microbial imprint and transformation of plant-derived inputs into the DOM pool. Recent findings have shown that the microbial community also adapts to changes in DOM characteristics at different soil depths12. This highlights the dual role of microorganisms in the carbon cycle in soils, decomposing organic matter while simultaneously recycling and producing new molecules. The shift in the abundance of DOM molecules around 300 Da further suggests a selective removal of molecules smaller than 300 Da. Such size-selective processes are well known from the transport of small molecules across membranes of plant roots and soil microorganisms. The outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as mitochondria and plastids, contain water-filled transport channels, so-called porins39. Molecules of <600 Da can diffuse through porins with a size-dependent diffusion rate that allows for faster uptake of smaller molecules40. Thus, the selective removal of small molecules from fresh DOM might be related to root and microbial uptake through porins41. However, because of the increased aliphaticity with soil depth, we propose that microbial uptake is the main driver of the shift in the molecular mass of DOM.

Our results indicate that chemical recalcitrance is not the primary mechanism that preserves small DOM molecules from decomposition. Instead we found that the decomposition of DOM molecules increases with depth. Our findings suggest that the persistence of DOM molecules in soil is due to microbial transformation and that DOM consumption is accompanied by formation of new microbial-derived compounds. The consumption, transformation and production by microorganisms initially lead to a preferential degradation of large plant-derived polymers (such as lignin), partial mineralization and transformation into a diverse suite of small molecules that are subsequently consumed by the soil microbial community. As indicated by the decreasing aromaticity and unsaturation with soil depth, DOM molecules found in deeper soils are mainly of microbial origin and are either decomposition products or remnants of bacterial necromass.NATuRe Ge OSCIeNCe | VOL 12 | SEPTEMBER 2019 | 755–761 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 759Articles Nature GeoscieNcein its concentrations with depth, while the concentrations of  DON remained at the same level17. This suggests a microbial recy -cling of N or preservation of N-containing molecular structures, while C is partly mineralized. In agreement with the absolute increase of the mid-molecular-mass compounds in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile (Fig. 3), this strongly points to the formation of new microbial DOM products with higher average masses during soil passage and not to simple dilution of plant-derived DOM in deeper soil layers because of decreased inputs of plant material. Recently, it has been demonstrated that fresh DOM from primary producers is also characterized by low-molecular-mass com-pounds, whereas the so-called ‘refractory’ DOM is clearly shifted to  higher masses42. The shift to higher molecular masses indicates  that the decline of small molecules is related to the progressive  degradation of plant-derived DOM and microbial resynthesis of new DOM molecules. These molecules might have high propor-tions of peptides or proteins, thereby explaining the approximately constant abundance of DON. We performed a supplementary plant decomposition experiment in which DOM extracted from fresh plant material (Supplementary Fig. 6) was dominated by large, source-specific compounds with a relatively high molecular mass ( >500 Da). These large plant-derived compounds decreased  during the first weeks of decomposition. In addition, the abundance of low-molecular-mass compounds and decomposition-related compounds increased.Increasing production of low-molecular-mass compounds  during the early decomposition of plant-derived carbon supports the common opinion that large biopolymers are rapidly degraded during decomposition43,44. Our results do not support the paradigm of the build-up of humic polymers15. Instead, we suggest that the plant material is extracellularly decomposed to smaller molecules, which are then consumed and in part mineralized or transformed to larger microbial-derived molecules that form a secondary pool of soil organic matter and DOM (Fig. 4). Our observations support the conclusion that low-molecular-mass compounds contain early decomposition products that might be closely related to the source materials45. The emerging higher-molecular-mass compounds  indicate the formation of new molecules from the decomposer community, namely microbial tissues, fragments or products and not random polymerization products. Consequently, the process-ing of DOM does not primarily lead to recalcitrant molecules,  but DOM persists in the Critical Zone because it is constantly decomposed, recycled and newly formed (Fig. 4). The vertical transport of DOM through the soil is assumed to be central to  the functioning of soil, for example, in the formation of soil organic carbon along the soil profile46. Many soil processes, important for soil functioning, are driven or mediated by microorganisms. DOM is therefore both a source of nutrients and energy for microorgan-isms in deeper soils12 and its molecular characteristics are shaped by the microorganisms above. However, DOM in deeper horizons might be primarily a function of the processes at that depth, that is, with depth DOM composition may become more independent of soil passage, reflecting instead the complex biogeochemical  processes at depth4. Therefore the interplay between soil micro-organisms and DOM denotes the key to understanding the functioning of the Critical Zone, and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry provides the means of disentangling this interaction.Online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0417-4.Received: 11 January 2019; Accepted: 26 June 2019;  Published online: 5 August 2019References 1.

Soil water samples were collected on a semi-natural grassland with different grassland communities, being part of The Jena Experiment47. The site, located in Jena, Germany (50° 55′ N, 11° 35′  E, altitude 130 m) close to the Saale River, was converted from grassland to arable field in the early 1960s and ploughed to a depth of about 30 cm. The field site with its current management as grassland was established in 2002. The soil of the field site is classified as Eutric Fluvisol (FAO-Unesco 1997), developed from loamy fluvial sediments up to 2 m thick, almost free of stones. As expected for a lowland river floodplain setting, sand content correlates with distance from the Saale river (r = 0.95). Close to the river, the topsoil consists of sandy loam, gradually changing into a silt loam with increasing distance to the river. Although soil texture varied considerably among the entire field site, the variation in pH (7.1–8.4), soil organic carbon (5–33 g C kg−1) and total soil nitrogen concentrations (1.0–2.7 g N kg−1) was smaller. This study was carried out on a subset (n  = 20) of all grassland communities (plots, n  = 80), that were fully equipped at depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm with glass suction plates (pore size 1− 1.6 µm, 1 cm thickness, 12 cm in diameter; from UMS, installed in April 2002)16. The investigated plots were aligned parallel to the river, with soil being dominated by silt (57.3 ± 5.0 s.d.), whereas the portions of clay (22.7 ± 2.8 s.d.) and sand (20.0 ± 7.5 s.d.) were relatively similar. Soil water was sampled on 7 May 2014 after two weeks of continuous sampling. The sampling bottles were evacuated to a negative pressure of 250 mbar, so that the suction pressure was approximately 50 mbar above the actual soil water tension. Thus, only the soil leachate48 was cumulatively collected for two weeks.In addition to the main site in Jena, soil water was analysed from a site located in the northeast of Germany (Linde, Brandenburg 52° 32′ N 12° 39′ E, altitude 45 m), with different soil and land-use properties. This site is characterized by a relatively acidic soil pH (forest 5.78 ± 0.3, grassland 5.05 ± 0.41). Soils have developed on aeolian sands and show mainly features of podzols and cambisols49. In November 2014, suction plates, identical to those at the Jena site, were installed on a grassland, and on stands of oak (Quercus robur) and pine (Pinus sylvestris ), at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm. Samples were taken in February 2016. Water sample treatment was conducted as described for Jena samples.Soil water sample preparation. On subsamples of the soil water samples pH, concentration of DOC (highTOC analyser, Elementar Analysensysteme) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were measured. DON was quantified by subtracting the amount of inorganic nitrogen NH4+ (ICS-5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), NO2− and NO3− (Dionex DX-500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) from the amount of total bound nitrogen (TN-100, a1 envirosciences). The remaining samples were acidified to pH 2 (HCl, pro analysi) and stored at 2 °C until DOM was concentrated and desalted by solid phase extraction50. In brief, we used Agilent Bond Elute PPL solid phase extraction cartridges (1 g) that were soaked in methanol overnight. Prior to extraction, the cartridges were rinsed with ultrapure water, methanol and ultrapure water acidified with HCl to pH 2. Considering the respective DOC concentrations determined from the subsamples, the volume of soil water for extraction was adjusted to load 2 mg organic carbon onto the columns. Acidified ultrapure water was stored in the same type of bottles as the soil pore water samples, to be used as procedural blanks. After loading the solid phase extraction cartridges with sample, the cartridges were rinsed with acidified ultrapure water and dried with nitrogen. The DOM extracts were eluted with methanol. At each day of extraction a process blank extract was produced. The average extraction efficiency for soil water DOM was 69% ± 6% s.d. on a carbon basis for the samples from the main side and 79% ± 7 s.d. for samples from the supplementary site. Redundancy analysis confirmed that the extraction efficiency had no influence on the molecular composition of DOM (explained variation = 0.7%, pseudo-F  = 0.6, P = 0.722).Assessment of soil carbon and nitrogen, roots and the microbial community. Soil samples were taken in April 2012 at each of the plots at the main site to a depth of 1 m using a machine-driven soil corer (inner diameter of 8.7 cm, Cobra, Eijkelkamp Agrisearch Equipment). Soil cores were segmented into 5 cm depth sections. Air-dried soil samples were milled and subsamples were analysed for organic C and total N with a Vario Max and a Vario EL (Elementar Analysensysteme), respectively. Organic C was determined as the difference between the total C content and the inorganic C content measured after heating the sample to 450 °C for 16 h in a muffle furnace51.Root standing biomass was sampled in 2014, following the protocol of previous years52. For the root sampling campaign, three soil cores (inner diameter 4.0 cm, Eijkelkamp Agrisearch Equipment) per plot were taken to a depth of 40 cm. Cores were segmented into five layers: 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm and 30–40 cm, which were pooled in the field. Samples were stored at 4 °C until they were washed over a 0.2 mm sieve, which took place within 7 days. Clean root biomass was dried at 70 °C for 72 h and weighed. Root biomass was calculated as milligrams dry mass per cubic centimetre52.The microbial community was assessed using the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) method of identifying bacterial and fungal biomass, and by sequencing for evaluating bacterial and fungal diversity. For both measures identical soil samples were used. In early May 2012, three soil samples per plot were taken with a corer (inner diameter 4.8 cm, Eijkelkamp Agrisearch Equipment) to a depth of 5 cm, and pooled. Within 48 h after sampling the soil was kept at 4 °C, sieved to 2 mm, remains of roots were manually removed and the samples were stored at −20 °C until further sample processing. PLFA were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer53 as modified by Kramer and Gleixner54,55. As indicator for fungal biomass PLFA 18:2ω6 was used56,57. The bacterial biomass was calculated as sum of the PLFA markers 15:0i, 15:0a, c15:0n, 16:0i, c16:1ω7c, c17:0br, 17:0i, 17:0a, 17:1ω8, 17:0cy, 18:1ω7 and 19:0cy56.For sequencing analyses of bacterial and fungal communities DNA was extracted from 0.3 g of soil using the MoBIO PowerSoil-htp 96 Well DNA Isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The dual indexing protocol of Kozich et al.58  was used for Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions  of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene (primers 341F59 and 806R60); and the ITS2 region for fungi (fITS7f and ITS4r primer sequences61). Amplicon concentrations were normalized using the SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq using V3 chemistry. Fungal ITS  sequences were analysed using PIPITS62) with default parameters as described. Similar approaches were used for analyses of bacterial sequences, using PEAR  (http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear) for merging forward and reverse reads, quality filtering using FASTX tools (hannonlab.cshl.edu), chimera removal with VSEARCH_UCHIME_REF and clustering to 97% operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with VSEARCH_CLUSTER (http://github.com/torognes/vsearch). Both bacterial and fungal OTU abundance tables were resampled to a minimum of 4,000 reads per sample prior to calculating indices of diversity (the Shannon index and Simpson’s index on the basis of OTUs) using the ‘diversity’ function in the ‘vegan’ package63.FT-ICR-MS. For the FT-ICR-MS measurements extract aliquots were diluted to 20 mg l−1 organic carbon in ultrapure water/methanol (1:1). The Bruker Solarix FT-ICR-MS (15 tesla) at the University of Oldenburg (Germany) was used. Samples were continuously injected into the ESI source with a flow rate of 120 µl h−1 and an ESI needle voltage of −4 kV in negative ionization mode. 500 single scans with an ion accumulation time of 0.2 s were recorded over a mass range of m/z 150 to 2,000 and added to one spectrum. An in-house mass reference list was used for internal calibration.To consider only those masses that had been measured to be relevant for statistical analyses, several criteria, also described in ref. 64, were applied. First, only m/z values with a signal-to-noise ratio of the maximum of each m/z value (S/Nmax,i > 5) were considered65. To determine S/Nmax,i the maximum relative intensity of each m/z value was divided by the noise. Second, only m/z values were kept that were detected in more than one sample. Third, all m/z values with an S/Nblanks ratio ≥ 20 were removed. To determine S/Nblanks the average of signal intensity across all measured blanks was divided by the noise. Fourth, m/z of low intensity (S/Nmax < 20) were removed if they were detected in less than 20% of the measurements. Mass-to-charge ratios with assigned molecular formulae meeting all the above criteria (4,264 different m/z values) were isolated from the remaining m/z list and normalized to the sum of intensities. For molecular formula assignment (C, H, O, N, S and P) an in-house algorithm that is based on Koch et al.66  and Stenson et al.67 was used. Ions with m/z > 660 were not detected in our samples. Only singly charged ions were considered. In consequence, the m/z values represent the molecular mass (in dalton) of the detected ions. Matlab R2013a (The MathWorks) and R68 were used for data preparation and evaluation.NMR. Solid phase extraction DOM was pooled depthwise to samples of 3.5 mg DOC, with equal shares of each individual sample (20 samples for 10−30 cm, 14 samples for 60 cm), resulting in one representative sample for each depth. 1H NMR spectra of solid phase extracted (Agilent Bond Elute PPL) DOM were obtained with a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (typically 0.5 mg in 300 μg deuterated methanol (CD3OD); Bruker 3 mm sealed MATCH (multiple adjustable tube clamp holder) tubes). Proton spectra were acquired at 283 K with a 5 mm z-gradient 1H / 13C / 15N / 31P QCI cryogenic probe (in CD3OD, Merck, 99.95% 2H). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded using the first increment of the presaturation-NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) sequence; solvent suppression with presaturation and spin-lock, 5 s acquisition time, 15 s relaxation delay, typically 64–512 scans, 1 ms mixing time, 1 Hz exponential line broadening.Data analysis. Weighted means of formula-based characteristics (m/z, AImod and H/C) were calculated as the sum of the product of the individual information (m/zi, AImod, i or H/Ci) and relative intensity Ii divided by the sum of all intensities (for example m/zwm = sum(m/ziIi)/Σ(Ii)). H/C provides information about the saturation and the modified aromaticity index (AImod) was used to estimate the aromaticity of individual formulae (AImod ≤ 0.54 non-aromatic, 0.54 < AImod < 0.69 aromatic, AImod ≥ 0.69 condensed aromatic)28. To relate mass changes to processes, the shift in masses were examined in relation to a degradation index (Ideg, ref. 32). Therefore the normalized intensities of formulae negatively related to degradation (Ideg,neg : C21H26O11, C17H20O9, C19H22O10, C20H22O10, C20H24O11) and formulae being positively related to degradation (Ideg,pos : C13H18O7, C14H20O7, C15H22O7, C15H22O8, C16H24O8) were summed. Ideg was calculated based on equation (1)Ideg¼XIdeg;neg�=XIdeg;negþIdeg;pos�ð1ÞNATuRe Ge OSCIeNCe | www.nature.com/naturegeoscienceArticles Nature GeoscieNceFurthermore, the median intensity maximum of the low-molecular-mass (m/z 150−275) Ilow and mid-molecular-mass (m/z 300−450) Imid range was introduced.  For this purpose 1% of the intensities ranked according to intensity for the low- and mid-molecular mass range was identified. The median of the identified intensities was set as Ilow and Imid, respectively. To avoid interference from overlap, the range m/z 275−300 was neglected. To compare spectra with respect  to the intensity of their low- and mid-molecular-mass ranges the ratio Imid/Ilow  was used.To display differences between the mass spectra of samples from depths of 10 cm and 60 cm, differential mass spectra were calculated. The differential mass spectrum is the result of subtracting the relative mass peak intensities of the 10 cm measurement from those of the 60 cm measurement. Resulting positive intensities represent formulae that are of higher abundance in 10 cm samples whereas negative intensities indicate formulae that are of higher abundance in 60 cm ones. To consider only formulae that were of much higher abundance for each depth, a threshold value (10% of the median of 1% of the highest absolute intensities)64 was introduced. This threshold value was determined for each differential mass spectrum individually and the average value (1.35, s.d. = 0.06) was applied to all differential mass spectra. The differential mass spectra were calculated for each plot separately. To focus on the common depth dependent trend of all plots, those formulae that occurred in 90% of all differential mass spectra were identified.The analyses for weighted means (m/z, H/C, AImod) and differential mass spectra were performed for all molecular formulae (4,264 different formulae) but also for subsets of formulae that either contained all formulae with at least 1 N (1,704 formulae) or 1 S (511 formulae). The datasets based on different formulae were named ‘ All compounds’ , ‘CHNO compounds’ or ‘CHOS compounds’ .To investigate the general differences in the molecular DOM composition at each soil depth, the Bray−Curtis distances69 between each depth for each plot were calculated. The averaged Bray-Curtis distances between each depth are given in Supplementary Table 2. Linear mixed-effects models were used considering the repeated measurements on the same plot along the soil profile to statistically test whether depth-dependent effects exist independently of the plot identity (the ‘lme’ function in the nlme package70).Variation partitioning analyses71 were performed based on the comparison of variance explained by linear models including every possible combination of variables being proxies for mineralogy (clay content), plant derived C (root standing biomass) and microbial communities (biomass and genetic diversity). A series of seven models was fitted for each bacterial and fungal community to extract the unique and shared variance for each combination of variables (mineralogy only, plant C only, microbial community only, mineralogy + plant C, mineralogy + microbial community, plant C + microbial community, and all predictors together). Venn diagrams with two factors were displayed using the compute.Venn function in Vennerable; Venn diagrams with three factors were displayed using Euler APE for Windows72.To relate the bacterial and fungal diversity to the chemodiversity of DOM compounds, the Shannon index and Simpson’s index were calculated based on the measured DOM compounds (molecular formulae) and their relative intensities (ion abundances) using the ‘diversity’ function in the ‘vegan’ package63. The relations between microbial diversity and chemodiversity were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient (the cor.test function68 in R68).Supplementary incubation experiment and Orbitrap DOM measurements. Incubation experiment. Dried and ground plant shoot material (Bromus erectus, Leucanthemum vulgare agg., Medicago varia ) were inoculated with a mixture of sand (Sigma-Aldrich, baked at 500 °C for 4 h), based on published experimental setups73,74. Plant and soil material were sampled in May 2016, at the Jena site47. Mineral soil from depth <10 cm was floated (200 g and 400 g soil per litre, depending on C content) in ultrapure water, for one hour and the supernatant suspension was filtered (0.7 µm, Whatman glass microfibre filters, grade GF/F) to obtain the aqueous inoculum. Incubations were done in 50 ml polyethene (PE) Falcon tubes filled with 5 g of pure sand (drainage) and 10.5 g of sand mixed with plant material (plant-to-sand ratio of 1:20). The contribution of inoculum solution to C stocks was <0.1%. Samples were kept at 80% water-holding capacity over the course of the experiment. Tube lids were closed but air exchange was allowed. Incubations were done in triplicate for each time point (0 weeks, 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after inoculation) and blank incubations were carried along. Samples were extracted three times with 30 ml ultrapure water and ultracentrifuged after each extraction step (3,500 min−1). The unified supernatant was vacuum-filtered (700 hPa, 0.7 µm GF/F), acidified to pH 2 (HCl, Roth) and extracted by solid  phase extraction50.DOM analyses of supplementary soil water samples and incubation experiment. Methanol extracts were diluted to 20 mg l−1 DOC with ultrapure water and directly infused into an Orbitrap Elite ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a negative-mode ESI source. Instrumental settings for the incubation sample set were: Flow rate, 7 µl min−1; spray voltage, 2.65 kV; source fragmentation, 40 eV; capillary temperature, 275 °C; S-Lens RF level, 70%; automatic gain control setting, 1E6; accumulation time, maximum 100 ms; scan range, 150–1,500 m/z; transient length, 0.8 ms; nominal resolution, 240.000, scans collected, 300. These settings were slightly changed to measure the soil water sample set from Linde (changed parameters: scan range, 150–1,000 m/z; transient length, 1.6 ms; nominal resolution, 480.000, scans collected, 100).All measurements were done within days and in random order. In-house reference samples75 were used to check instrumental stability. External calibration was done every day according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Raw data were averaged in Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific), transformed with Proteo Wizard76 and further processed in mmass77. Peak picking was done at 80% peak height  and S/N of 5. Further processing followed similar rules as described in Methods section ‘FT-ICR-MS’ . In addition, a peak occurrence filter was applied to the  data. In the Linde soil water sample dataset, only peaks were included that were detected in more than 10% of samples. In the incubation dataset duplicate measurements were used and only those signals were kept that had been detected in both measurements75.Data availabilityThe compiled dataset used in our analyses is available at https://doi.org/10.17617/3.28 and root standing biomass at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.880324.
