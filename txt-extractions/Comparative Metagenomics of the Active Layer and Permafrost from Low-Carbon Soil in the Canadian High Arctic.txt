This study investigated the taxonomic composition and geneticpotential of microbial communities at contrasting depths of the active layer (5, 35, and65 cm below surface, bls) and PF (80 cm bls). We showed microbial communities inPF to be taxonomically and functionally di ﬀerent from those in the active layer. 16SrRNA gene sequence analysis revealed higher biodiversity in the active layer than in PF,and biodiversity decreased signi ﬁcantly with depth. The reconstructed 91 metagenome-assembled genomes showed that PF was dominated by heterotrophic, fermentingBacteroidota using nitrite as their main electron acceptor. Prevalent microbes identi ﬁedin the active layer belonged to bacterial taxa, gaining energy via aerobic respiration.Gene abundance in metagenomes revealed enrichment of genes encoding the plant-derived polysaccharide degradation and metabolism of nitrate and sulfate in PF,whereas genes encoding methane/ammonia oxidation, cold-shock protein, and two-component systems were generally more abundant in the active layer, particularly at 5 cm bls. The results of this study deepen ourunderstanding of the low-carbon Arctic soil microbiome and improve prediction of the impacts of thawing PF.KEYWORDS: Arctic, permafrost, active layer, 16S rRNA, metagenome-assembled genome, metabolism1. INTRODUCTIONPermafrost (PF) regions of the Earth are considered importantlandscapes that serve as reservoirs for more than half of theestimated global soil organic carbon (SOC).1Soils in PFregions consist of two horizons; the active layer (AL), whichlies on top, contains soil that undergoes a seasonal freeze −thaw process, and PF, which lies beneath the AL, consists ofperennially frozen ground. It is generally accepted that thawingof PF as a result of global climate change will have long-termconsequences on the concentration of atmospheric carbon(primarily in the form of CO2and CH4)2due to microbialdegradation of sequestered carbon. Especially, the potentialpositive carbon-cycle feedback loops are of concern,3,4whichmay occur when SOC-rich PF regions thaw and become CH4-emitting wetlands.5,6However, SOC-rich PF regions are notthe dominant soil type in the Arctic; instead, an estimated 87%of the Arctic consists of SOC-poor mineral PF.7Because PF-aﬀected regions encompass a number of di ﬀerent types ofplant-dominated biomes8as well as SOC and mineral types,9,10the impact of geographical and ecological variability ongaseous emission and sequestration needs to be understoodbetter in order to more reliably predict the long-termconsequences of climate change.Biological carbon sequestration in the warming Arctic hasbeen proposed to occur primarily via increased photosyntheticactivity and transfer of ﬁxed carbon below ground (i.e., carbonsink).11In contrast, natural sources of carbon emission resultprimarily from respiration, which can be traced back to highereukaryotes or soil microbes. Multiple physical and biologicalfactors may in ﬂuence the carbon cycle including soil chemistry,the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen, and the structureof present microbial communities. Recent research suggeststhat microorganisms play key roles in global ﬂuxes of CO2,CH 4, and N 2O;12however, the response of microbes to PFt h a w i n gi sc o n s i d e r e da sa nu n k n o w nv a r i a b l e .13Ourunderstanding of the microbial community structures fromPF regions is relatively limited with a disproportionate focus onthe microbial communities in relatively high-SOC cryosolssuch as spruce forests in Alaska14or peatlands in Norway15rather than more prevalent SOC-poor mineral-rich cryosols.16It is well-documented that plants can shape microbialcommunity structures17but less is known about microbialcommunity structures in regions with little to no plant growth.Received: February 3, 2021Revised: July 27, 2021Accepted: July 28, 2021Published: September 2, 2021Article pubs.acs.org/est© 2021 American Chemical Society12683https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ.

This study compared themicrobial taxa and associated functions in SOC-poor samplesof ALs at various depths and PF using 16S ribosomal RNA(rRNA) gene amplicon and metagenome sequencing. Theprimary goal was to investigate the di ﬀerences between thephylogenetic pro ﬁle and the genetic potential of microbialcommunities in the active and PF layers.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Site Description, Sampling, and Geochemistry.The McGill Arctic Research Station (MARS) located at AxelHeiberg Island, Nunavut Canada (79 °24′54.4 ″N,90°44′35.6 ″W) represents a polar desert environment.18,19The SOC content ranged from 1 to 6% in the top 10 cm to<1% below 10 cm,19and it was lower than that in the peat andfen sites in Russia (3.6 −18.3%)20and Alaska (2 −20%).21Soilcores of 1 m length were collected as previously described,19and the details are provided in Supporting Information . Theupper 70 cm of the cores represents the AL that was subjectedto seasonal thaw, whereas the lower part (>70 cm depth)represents the PF that remained constantly frozen.19Fourdepths (5, 35, 65, and 80 cm samples de ﬁned as AL_5, AL_35,AL_65, and PF_80, respectively) were analyzed from each ofthe four cores, with the exception of PF_80 obtained only fromFigure 1. (A) Alpha diversity indexes, (B) principal coordinates analysis of the abundance of microbial communities, and (C) relative abundance ofsigniﬁcantly di ﬀerent taxonomy between depths using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The letters denote statistical di ﬀerences betweendepths. Samples with the same letter are not signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent. Color codes for the samples are shown as in (B).Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ. Sci. Technol. 2021, 55, 12683 −1269312684three cores ( Table S1 ). Chemical characteristics of the soilsused in this study were collected when soils started thawingand measured as described in the previous study.192.2. DNA Extraction, Cell Number Estimation, qPCR,and Sequencing. Total community genomic deoxyribonu-cleic acid (gDNA) (including both extracellular and intra-cellular DNA) was extracted using a FastDNA SPIN kit for soil(MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA).22An estimation of cell numbersusing ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses for 16S rRNAgenes was performed.22Both 16S rRNA gene amplicons andmetagenomic libraries of community gDNA were sequencedon an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Details of the above listedprocedures can be found in Supporting Information .2.3. Bioinformatics and Statistical Analyses. The 16SrRNA gene amplicon and metagenome sequencing data wereprocessed through established tools and pipelines. The detailsand statistical analyses are described in Supporting Informa-tion.2.4. Data Availability. Amplicon sequencing data andmetagenome raw reads were deposited under NCBI BioProjectaccession numbers PRJNA694190 and PRJNA261849, re-spectively ( Table S1 ).3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3.1. Geochemical Characteristics of the Soils. Geo-chemical analyses of the samples revealed soils originating fromdepths of 5, 65, and 80 cm to be slightly acidic with the lowestpH at 80 cm (pH = 5.5) and the highest at 5 cm (pH = 6). NopH measurements were available for 35 cm depth ( Table S2 ).Concentrations of Na, K, Fe, Mg, Si, Ni, and S weresigniﬁcantly higher at 80 cm than at 5 cm ( p< 0.05). Soilsat 35 cm had the highest concentration of Kcompared to otherdepths ( p< 0.05). There was no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence inFigure 2. Whole-genome phylogenetic tree and heatmap showing the recovered MAGs and their relative abundance from four depths. The bar plotshows the total percentage of reads mapped to the MAGs (A) and the number of MAGs recovered in the corresponding samples (B).Environmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ. Sci. Technol. 2021, 55, 12683 −1269312685concentrations of Ca, Al, Fe, Sr, Ba, Cr, Cd, Co, Acetate, Br−,Cl−,F−,N O 3−,P O 43−, and SO 42−between depths. Althoughnot deemed signi ﬁcant, principal component analysis (PCA)showed that di ﬀerent compounds exhibited slightly elevatedlevels at di ﬀerent depths, such as Cl−at 5 cm, Kat 35 cm,NO 3−at 65 cm samples, and SO 42−at 80 cm depth ( FigureS1).3.2. Estimation of Microbial Cell Numbers. Estimationof total cell numbers (including bacteria, archaea, andeukaryotes) using FISH showed 7.5 ×107cells g−1in PF.These numbers were lower compared to those in 5 and 65 cmAL samples (1.1 ×108and 9.5 ×107cells g−1, respectively)but higher than those at the 35 cm horizon (6.2 ×107cells g−1,Figure S2 ). This trend was also true for bacterial cells.Eukaryotic cells decreased from 1.9 ×107cells g−1at 5 cm to7.8×106cells g−1at 80 cm, whereas archaea increased from8.9×105cells g−1at 5 cm to 8.9 ×106cells g−1at 65 cm whilebeing below the detection level in PF samples. In general, themicrobial community was dominated by bacteria, followed byeukaryotes and archaea. As estimated by FISH, bacteriacomprised 81.17% of microorganisms in the 5 cm layer and89.57% in PF, while eukaryotes decreased from 17.98% in 5 cmto 10.43% in PF. The maximum percentage of archaea (9.34%)was observed at 65 cm.Bacterial cell numbers were also evaluated using qPCR,suggesting a maximum of ∼2.9×108cells g−1soil at 35 cm;assuming an average of 3.6 16S rRNA gene copies per cell,23adecreasing trend was seen for 16S rRNA genes with depth(Figure S2 ). However, for both FISH and qPCR-basedassessments of cell numbers, no statistically signi ﬁcantdiﬀerences were observed between di ﬀerent depths. Discrep-ancies in bacterial cell counts between the two measurementscould be related to biases from environmental properties (pH,metals, etc.), DNA extraction e ﬃciency, yield of nucleic acid,primer speci ﬁcity, stringency of hybridization, and so forth.24,25Thus, the high concentrations of K, Mg, Al, Sr, and Cu insamples collected at 35 cm ( Table S2 ) could bias FISHanalysis of microorganisms due to disruption of cellmembranes or DNA damage.26In the case of qPCR, theresults obtained for the 35 cm sample collected at the edge ofpolygon19were∼10 times higher than for samples from thepolygon interior.3.3. Microbial Community from 16S rRNA GeneAmplicon Sequencing and Metagenome Binning.Alpha diversity of the soil samples was highest at 5 cm(Shannon and Chao1, p< 0.05) and decreased signi ﬁcantlywith depth (Shannon, p<0 . 0 5 , Figure 1 A). Principalcoordinate analysis (beta diversity) of all sample ’s zero-radiusoperational taxonomic units (OTUs) (zOTUs, analogous toamplicon sequence variants)27showed that microbialcommunities also signi ﬁcantly di ﬀered between depths ( Figure1B, PERMANOVA, p< 0.05). One exception to this trend wasobserved in the ice-rich core collected near the rim of thepolygon (called edge/ice core).19The metagenome from 80cm PF of this core was closely related to microbialcommunities from 65 cm ( Figure 1 B) potentially due toperturbations of sedimentary material along an ice wedge.28Similar to the alpha and beta diversity analyses, there was adiﬀerence in taxonomic abundance between the active and PFlayers, with Actinobacteriota, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacter-oidota, Patescibacteria, and Firmicutes_I having a higherrelative abundance in PF ( p< 0.05), whereas a higherabundance of unclassi ﬁed bacteria, Verrucomicrobiota andGemmatimonadota was identi ﬁed in the ALs ( Figures 1 C andS3). Due to the high abundance of unclassi ﬁed bacteriaobserved in the ALs (averaging 32.32 −57.73%), in addition tothe genome taxonomy database (GTDB), the zOTUs werealso annotated using the SILVA rRNA database. Using thelatter reference, only 3.83 −16.76% of the sequences wereassigned to unclassi ﬁed bacteria, and Chloro ﬂexi was the mostabundant taxon in the ALs ( Figure S4 ). This discrepancy waslikely caused by the limited number of 16S rRNA genesderived from GTDB as 16S rRNA genes often failed toassemble in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).29−31Despite this shortcoming, GTDB is a phylogenetically moreconsistent, genome-based taxonomy that better re ﬂectsevolutionary relationships among microorganisms,32,33andwas therefore chosen for taxonomic classi ﬁcation of the MAGsrecovered in this study. Overall, our data were in line withprevious studies, showing that microbial communities in activelayers were more diverse and taxonomically di ﬀerent from theunderlying PF.34,35Despite the dissimilar phylogeneticdistribution between the active and PF layers, the majority oftaxa were detected at all depths.A total of 91 MAGs with a completeness ≥70% andcontamination ≤10% were reconstructed from the 15 PFmetagenomes, altogether contributing 1.45 −17.59% of se-quencing reads ( Figure 2 ). They spanned 13 bacterial phyla;no MAGs were a ﬃliated with archaea ( Figure 2 andTable S3 ),although archaeal genomes were previously recovered andreported from the same sampling sites.36Of the 91 recoveredMAGs, 57 MAGs were retrieved from all depths, whileBacteroidota and Patescibact eria MAGs were exclusivelydetected at 65 and 80 cm. In addition, the singlePlanctomycetota MAG was only identi ﬁed at 35, 65, and 80cm. Relative abundances of individual MAGs did not varysigniﬁcantly between depths in the AL and PF. Based on therelative abundance of the MAGs, the metagenomic datarevealed that the ALs were dominated by MAGs associatedwith the poorly characterized phylum Dormibacterota (29 −38.08% relative abundance of microbes binned into MAGs,Figure 2 ), in comparison to the low abundance of this phylumdetected in the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis(Figure S3 ). The mismatch abundance of Dormibacterota inthe ALs likely related to the fact that MAGs often lack 16SrRNA genes.29Phylogenetic analysis showed a predominanceof Bacteroidota MAGs in PF (43.18%), suggesting anadaptation of these bacteria to freezing conditions. However,this picture may be skewed as revealed by the con ﬂictingnumber of unassembled metagenomic reads and co-assembledcontigs (data not shown) and in particular by the 16S rRNAgene amplicon sequencing analysis. These methods insteadindicated that microbial communities from the PF weredominated by Actinobacteriota ( Figures 1 C and S3), whichrepresented only 11.74% of the recovered communities. Thiscontrast originated in our disproportionate inability to bincomplete or near-complete Ac tinobacteriota MAGs andunderlined the importance of not losing sight of the un-binned data in metagenomic analysis. Finally, di ﬀerencesbetween the two sequencing methods could have contributedto the phylogenetic di ﬀerences between the 16S rRNA geneamplicon and metagenome sequencing data as 16S rRNA geneamplicon sequencing can introduce biases from PCRampli ﬁcation. In general, the microbial community structureidenti ﬁed by both methods was similar to that found inpreviously studied PF soils14−16,37and was consistent withEnvironmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ. Sci. Technol. 2021, 55, 12683 −1269312686results, indicating that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, andAcidobacteriota were commonly found across soils of alltemperatures and independent of plant association.38,39Inaddition, our data showed that the poorly characterized phylawere present in the studied environments, such asDormibacterota, Eremiobacterota, and Patescibacteria. Thesephyla have been shown to be abundant in dry, bare soilenvironments40and have reduced redundant and nonessentialfunctions.413.4. Metabolic Potential in Active and PF Layers. Thereconstructed 91 MAGs were assessed for the presence ofspeciﬁc KEGG orthologies (KOs) associated with hydrolysis,fermentation, electron donor utilization, electron acceptors,ability to ﬁxC O2and N 2, motility, bacterial secretion, andstress response ( Tables S4 −S6). These data were used toidentify di ﬀerent suggested potential growth strategies ( Figures4and5). All quoted percentage values in the sections belowrefer to the averages of relative abundance of the MAGs fromthe replicated metagenomes (see Supporting Information ). Inaddition to the genomic analysis, the whole community genecontent present at a certain depth was also analyzed.Discrepancies between this analysis and MAG functionalanalysis originated from the fact that only a small portion ofreads were binned into MAGs (totaling 1.45 −17.59% ofmapped reads per sample, Figure 2 ). The purpose of the gene-centric analysis of un-binned metagenomic sequences was toinvestigate the previously “hidden ”portion of reads and toelucidate di ﬀerences between the two methods. In general,gene abundance in metagenomes of the whole community wasconsistent with the trends identi ﬁed by analysis of MAGs.Therefore, the results reported here will be limited to selectedkey functions or to discussion of instances where the twoanalyses stand in contradiction. The overall microbialmetabolic potential determined by assessing the diversity ofall KOs di ﬀered signi ﬁcantly between depths ( Figure 3 ,PERMANOVA, p< 0.05).3.4.1. Cellulose Degradation is a Common Feature in PF.Cellulose and xylan, derived from plant cell walls, make up alarge proportion of SOC in land ecosystems. Chitin originatesfrom fungi and insects and is another abundant polysaccharidein the terrestrial ecosystem.42The breakdown of thesepolysaccharides results in the release of short oligo/disaccharides which can be further processed to obtain energy(e.g., during glycolysis or fermentation).42The completedegradation of cellulose is a multi-step process.42Populationsthat could encode the capacity for the complete degradation ofcellulose to glucose, primarily belonging to the Bacteroidota,were particularly abundant at 80 cm (46.91% relativeabundance of microbes binned into MAGs, Figures 4 andS5), with signi ﬁcance when compared to 5 cm ( p< 0.05),suggesting that the potential ability to degrade cellulose was acommon feature in PF and thawing is likely to stimulatemicrobial decomposition and r espiration of sequesteredcarbon.21The lowest percentage of microorganisms encodingthese genes was identi ﬁed at 5 cm (4.09%), even though SOCwas up to 6% in upper 10 cm in comparison to <1% in lowerlayers.19Microorganisms containing only cellulase genescoding for the potential to convert cellulose to cello-oligosaccharide were identi ﬁed in 12 MAGs, with the highestabundance at 65 cm (19.10%) and the lowest at 80 cm(3.21%). 22 MAGs showed genes encoding β-glucosidase todegrade cello-oligosaccharides to glucose but lacked cellulasegenes for the initial steps in cellulose breakdown. β-Glucosidase encoding populations, primarily represented byAcidobacteriota, was signi ﬁcantly more abundant at 5 cm(36.44%) than at other depths ( p< 0.05), suggesting that amajority of the recovered communities from 5 cm wereopportunistic, taking advantage of cellulase-producing primarydegraders.Initial xylan degradation is carried out by xylanases, whilethe released xylobiose is further processed to xylose andsmaller oligosaccharides by β-xylosidases.42Only a smallfraction of recovered communities was suggested to carryout the complete degradation of xylan to xylose (0.68 −3.18%)with an exception of 24.11% of the PF populations from 80 cm(Figure 4 ). The overall lower incidence of pathways forcomplete xylan breakdown suggested that cellulose was themore commonly utilized polysaccharide for the recoveredpopulations. One MAG a ﬃliated with Actinobacteriotacontained xylanase genes but lacked β-xylosidases genes andwas enriched in the 80 cm PF layer (1.77%). MAG_CO_206and MAG_ME_43, aligning with Actinobacteriota andBacteroidota, respectively, which could potentially utilizexylobiose but not xylan, were also identi ﬁed. A relativelyhigh abundance of these xylobiose scavengers was detected at80 cm (2.93%) and decreased in more shallow, AL samples(2.40 and 0.05% at 65 and 35 cm, respectively). Approximately25.36−45.75% of the communities recovered from variousdepths included genes encoding chitinase ( Figure 4 ). Thesepopulations with the potential to degrade chitin were thelowest at 5 cm and the highest at 80 cm. MAGs a ﬃliated withBacteroidota were the dominating populations of chitinaseencoding microorganisms at 80 cm ( Figure S5 ). Previousstudies showed that cellulose- and chitin-degradation geneswere commonly retrieved from both the AL and PF.14,16,43Enrichment of hydrolysis genes, important for degradingcellulose and xylan, in PF was also con ﬁrmed by gene-centricanalysis in our study. In contrast, chitin degradation was shownin a signi ﬁcantly higher abundance in the ALs by geneabundance analysis ( p< 0.05, Figure S6 ), indicating asequestration of chitin and pl ant-derived polysaccharidedegradation.3.4.2. Populations Rely on Fermentation in PF. Carbondegradation can occur by respiration and/or fermentation, andmany organisms are capable of both processes. FermentationFigure 3.

Of the 91 MAGs recovered, 14 containedgenes involved in fermentation of pyruvate to acetate, lactate,and/or propanoate ( Figure 5 and Table S5 ). Thesepopulations, primarily belonging to Bacteroidota, wereparticularly abundant at 80 cm (42.09% relative abundanceFigure 4.

Acetate was theprimary fermentation product encoded by ActinobacteriotaMAGs at 5 cm, while it was propanoate for Dormibacterotaand Actinobacteriota MAGs at 35 and 65 cm, respectively.Fermentation of pyruvate to lactate was found to be morecommon in PF, primarily conducted by Bacteroidota-alignedMAGs. Overall, our data suggested that fermentation played animportant role in anaerobic degradation potential of SOC inPF, which was in line with a previous metagenome study ofAlaska PF.443.4.3. Methane, Nitrogen, and Sulfur Metabolism. Despiteno MAGs identi ﬁed which contained genes encoding CH4oxidation in this study, pmoABC /amoABC genes coding foraerobic CH 4oxidation were identi ﬁed at all depths with anoverall low abundance within the un-binned metagenome data(0.29−11.74 TPM). The occurrence of these genes was thelargest at 5 cm, signi ﬁcantly higher than in PF ( p< 0.05, FigureS7), suggesting the potential to oxidize a substantial amount ofCH4and thus potentially limiting the emission of CH 4into air.This was consistent with a report indicating High Arcticmineral cryosols to potentially serve as CH4sinks.18,45Itshould also be noted that these genes are involved in aerobicoxidation of both CH4and ammonia, which may explain theirhigher occurrence in the top layer. In contrast, genes encodingthe key enzyme in methanogenesis, methyl-coenzyme Mreductase, were not identi ﬁed in this study. This was inagreement with studies showing that methanogenesis wasextremely limited in the AL and PF soil in Alaska and NorthernSweden.35,46N2ﬁxation was also not shown to be present in the MAGs,although, the nif H gene (KO: K02588) involved in thisprocess was identi ﬁed at 65 and 80 cm within the un-binnedmetagenomic data, albeit at very low abundance (0.26 and 0.06TPM, respectively, p> 0.05, Figure S8 ). Nitrogen ﬁxationgenes were found to be highly abundant in the Canadian HighArctic16and at the carbon-rich PF site in Alaska;14however,the low abundance of the nif H gene indicated that thepotential for N 2ﬁxation was limited in the studied environ-ments. 19 MAGs linked organic carbon degradation todissimilatory nitrate reduction and/or denitri ﬁcation. Suchcommunities were identi ﬁed to be most enriched in PF(24.85% relative abundance of microbes binned into MAG),followed by the 65, 35, and 5 cm ALs (13.40, 9.88, and 8.70%,respectively, Figure 4 ). MAG_ME_223 and MAG_CO_220identi ﬁed as similar to Ramlibacter tataouinensis_A andAlphaproteobacteria, respectively, showed genes coding fordissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium and wereexclusively identi ﬁed in PF (1.92 and 1.42%, respectively,Figure S5 ). Furthermore, seven MAGs were suggested to belimited to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. These populations,most of which represented Actinobacteriota, exhibited theirhighest abundance at a depth of 65 cm (8.82%, Figure S5 ).Populations capable of reducing nitrite to ammonium, but notnitrate to nitrite, were identi ﬁed in nine MAGs. These strains,primarily classi ﬁed as Bacteroidota, were enriched at 80 cm(15.79%), consistent with the higher concentration ofammonium observed in PF ( Table S2 ). MAG_ME_223 wasalso suggested to carry out denitri ﬁcation by converting nitrateto nitrous oxide. A second population was represented byMAG_ME_43 (most related to the Bacteroidia class) that alsohad the ability to reduce nitrite to nitrogen gas. Althoughdenitrifying bacteria were previously reported to be active inthe ALs of this sampling location,47these two MAGs capableof near-complete steps of the denitri ﬁcation process were onlyidenti ﬁed in PF, representing 4.85% of the recoveredcommunities ( Figure S5 ).Another potential anaerobic electron acceptor is sulfate thatcan be converted to sul ﬁde by dissimilatory sul ﬁte reductase.The presence of microbes that use sulfate as a terminalelectron receptor in PF has been reported in previousstudies.35,44,48The Gammaproteobacteria MAG_CO_72contained one of the key genes ( dsrB) coding for dissimilaritysulfate reduction and represented a small fraction of thecommunity at 5, 35, and 65 cm (0.09, 0.88, and 0.73%,respectively, Figure 4 ). The low abundance of sulfate-reducingMAGs presumably illustrated the rarity of this pathway in thestudied environments, which was consistent with high levels ofsulfate in all layers ( Table S2 ) and was plausible consideringthe availability of other anoxic electron acceptors with a higherstandard reduction potential like nitrate. Thiosulfate oxidationvia the conserved soxoperon ( soxABCDXYZ ) results in theformation of sulfate, whereas the incomplete version(soxABXYZ ) results in incomplete oxidation of the substrateand leads to either intra-49,50or extracellular51accumulation ofelemental sulfur. Thiosulfate oxidation as a mean to gainenergy was identi ﬁed in three Gammaproteobacteria MAGs,including MAG_CO_72, MAG_CO_87, and MAG_CO_263,with a signi ﬁcantly higher abundance at 5 cm (6.45%) than atother depths ( p<0 . 0 5 , Figure 4 ). Although bothMAG_CO_87 and MAG_CO_263 exhibited the fullyconserved Sox pathway, MAG_CO_72 was limited tooxidizing thiosulfate to element sulfur. None of the MAGswere suggested to reduce sulfate in PF; however, gene-centricanalysis showed that the PF exhibited a generally higherabundance of dsrAB (K11180 and K11181) genes encodingsulfate reduction than the ALs but only reached signi ﬁcancecompared to 5 cm ( p< 0.05, Figure S7 ). Despite the higherpresence of potential sulfate-reducing bacteria, PCA indicatedan elevated level of sulfate in PF. This may be due to thegenerally low gene abundance of sulfate reductase (totaling5.97 TPM).3.4.4. Cytochrome c Oxidase is Widespread in theRecovered Communities. Despite the broad genetic potentialfor fermentation and anaerobic respiration across the MAGs, inparticular from the PF, genes coding for the key aerobicrespiration enzyme cytochrome coxidase were identi ﬁed in 58MAGs, with an overall large abundance of the recoveredcommunities from all depths. They were lowest at 65 cm(52.64% relative abundance of microbes binned into MAGs)and highest at 5 cm (77.99%, Figure 4 ). Genes for aerobicrespiration by low-a ﬃnity aa3-type cytochrome coxidase52,53were identi ﬁed in 42 MAGs. These populations were mostabundant at 5 cm (55.34%, Figure S5 ). A cbb3-typecytochrome coxidase was detected at 65 and 80 cm, althoughwith only marginal recovery from 65 cm (0.07 and 43.36%,respectively). This high-oxygen a ﬃnity terminal oxidase52,53was almost exclusively encoded by Bacteroidota, Alpha-, andGammaproteobacteria MAGs (totaling seven MAGs) in PF.Genes encoding cytochrome bdoxidases, which also exhibithigh O2aﬃnity,54were identi ﬁed in 37 MAGs and werelikewise most enriched at 80 cm (63.67%), although curiouslyfollowed by 5, 35, and 65 cm (55.95, 48.20, and 34.65%,respectively). The presence of genes encoding both low- andhigh-a ﬃnity cytochrome oxidase suggested that the recoveredEnvironmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ. Sci. Technol. 2021, 55, 12683 −1269312689populations were capable of operating under a range of O 2concentrations. Given the low abundance of fermentation andanaerobic respiration in the ALs, the widely distributedcytochrome coxidase suggested that aerobic respiration wasthe dominating energy acquisition pathway in the micro-organisms present in the ALs, in line with a recent study ofSvalbard PF population.55Genes encoding the high-O2aﬃnitycytochrome bdoxidases were also signi ﬁcantly enriched at 5and 80 cm compared to 35 and 65 cm using gene-centricanalysis ( p< 0.05, Figure S9 ). The abundance of these genesalso appeared to be higher at 5 cm than at 80 cm, albeit notsigniﬁcantly.3.4.5. Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Bio ﬁlm Formation.MAG_ME_168 a ﬃliated with Actinobacteriota containedgenes encoding carbon dioxide ﬁxation via the incompletereductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and was mostabundant at 80 cm (1.95% relative abundance of microbesbinned into MAGs, Figure 4 ). MAGs containing genes ( cbbLand/or cbbS) encoding ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase(RubisCO), the key enzyme in CO2ﬁxation via the Calvin −Benson −Bassham (CBB) cycle, were identi ﬁed in this study.Six MAGs, including members of Actinobacteriota, Chloro-ﬂexota_A, and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, containedboth cbbL and cbbS genes encoding form I Rubisco, whichoccurs in photo and chemoautotrophic organisms ( Figure S10and Table S3 ).56Two Dormibacterota MAGs and oneChloro ﬂexota_A MAG only included the cbbS gene likelydue to incompleteness of the reconstructed genomes (81.76 −90.58% completeness). These populations were more abun-dant in the ALs than in PF, particularly at 5 and 65 cm (21.14and 13.94%, respectively, p<0 . 0 5 , Figure 4 ). OneBacteroidota and Gammaproteobacteria MAG encoded thecbbL gene assigned to Rubisco-like proteins (RLPs; form IV),which is incapable of catalyzing RuBP-dependent CO2ﬁxation.57The function here was unknown; however, severalstudies indicated that RLPs may be involved in sulfurmetabolism, methionin e salvage pathway, andD-apiosecatabolism.58,59These two MAGs were only identi ﬁed in PF(8.52%), while the Bacteroidota MAG was also found at 65 cm(0.05%, Figure S10 andTable S3 ). Although the CBB cycle ismore energetically demanding compared to other CO2ﬁxationpathways,60our data suggested that the CBB cycle was thepredominant pathway for CO 2ﬁxation in the recoveredpopulations.Populations suggested to carry out surface attachment, and/or extracellular polymeric substance secretion were identi ﬁed.MAG_ME_223 and MAG_CO_87 (both related to Gam-maproteobacteria) were suggested to code for type IV pili-assisted motility and type II secretion that could potentially beinvolved in bio ﬁlm formation ( Table S6 ). MAG_CO_72 andMAG_CO_263, likewise closely aligning with Gammaproteo-bacteria, contained genes encoding type II secretion, whileMAG_CO_186 (most related to Alphaproteobacteria) wassuggested to have a type I secretion system. MAG_ME_274closely related to Methylotenera sp002429455 contained genesimplicated in ﬂagellar and type IV pili-driven motility. Finally,MAG_CO_127, most close to Acidobacteriota, showed geneswith the potential for motility via type IV pili. Thesep o p u l a t i o n sw e r em o s ta b u n d a n ta t3 5c m( 8 . 8 6 % ) ,signiﬁcantly higher than at 65 cm (1.66%, p< 0.05, Figure4). Bio ﬁlm formation has been suggested to enable micro-organisms to have higher resistance against extreme temper-ature61and thus may help these populations to survive underfreezing conditions. Under this hypothesis, however, it remainsunclear why the 5 cm sample, likely subjected to the harshesttemperature ﬂuctuations, does not display a large potential forbioﬁlm formation.3.4.6. Stress Responses. In order to survive freezingconditions, PF microorganisms were previously suggested tocontain genes encoding prot eins associated with coldadaptation, such as cold-shock proteins (CSP) and osmoticstress proteins.62Genes coding for CSP were identi ﬁed in 44MAGs and were signi ﬁcantly more abundant in PF (66.40%relative abundance of microbes binned into MAGs) than at 5and 65 cm (33.81 and 30.41%, respectively, p< 0.05), whileapproximately 48.54% of the recovered communities containedgenes encoding CSP at 35 cm ( Figure 4 ). Althoughsuper ﬁcially this appears to indicate less cold-adaptationpotential in the exposed 5 cm samples, there was in fact ahigher abundance of CSP genes detected in the totalcommunities at 5 cm (838 TPM, Figure S9 ), demonstratingthat a large proportion of uncovered populations at 5 cm wasadapted to the cold conditions. In contrast, Hultman et al.35found high numbers of CSPs in PF in comparison to the ALand bog soils in Alaska.Two-component systems (TCSs) are ubiquitous in natureand are part of regulatory system sensing and responding toalterations in environmental conditions, such as pH,osmolarity, or nutrient availability.63−65The populationsrecovered in this study were enriched in genes for TCSsinvolved in regulation of potassium ( kdpD /E)66and phosphatetransport ( phoR /B),67coping with osmotic stress ( envZ/ompR )68and maintaining membrane ﬂuidity ( desR/K,TableS6).6946 MAGs contained genes encoding kdpD /ETCSwhich is involved in regulating K+homeostasis and appears toplay a critical role in cha llenging environments.66Thea b u n d a n c eo ft h e s ep o p u l a t i o n sw a sh i g h e s ta t5c m(53.05%) and lowest at 80 cm (31.85%, Figure 4 ), suggestingkdpD /Ewas an important regulatory system in response to K+limitation and osmotic stress in particular for populationsrecovered from the ALs. It is conceivable that this was due tothe frequent occurrence of meltwater and coinciding changesin ion concentrations. Dominant contributors to the kdpD /Eexpression potential were Acidobacteriota at 5 cm, Dormi-bacterota at 35 and 65 cm, and Actinobacteriota at 80 cm(Figure S5 ). Genes coding for other TCSs, such as cell fate andcell cycle control, were also identi ﬁed in a low number ofMAGs. Within the un-binned metagenome data, the AL at 5cm had a signi ﬁcantly higher abundance in the total TCSpotential than at 65 and 80 cm (the sum of normalizedabundances of all TCS-related KOs per sample, p< 0.05,Figure S9 ). The occurrence of total TCSs was also higher at 5cm than at 35 cm, albeit not signi ﬁcantly. The overall highabundance of genes encoding CSP and TCSs in the ALsrevealed distinctive characteristics of the community, whichmust cope with extreme seasonal temperature shifts includingrepetitive freezing in order to survive.The genome-centric metagenome analysis enabled us to linkpopulations to their potential growth strategies; however, thediﬀerences in metabolic potential observed between therecovered MAGs and total communities suggested that geneticpotential of the recovered MAGs did not completely elucidatethe metabolic potential of the total communities, depending onthe abundance of recovered MAGs. Thus, microbialcomposition and genetic potential should be described withcaution and in consideration of all gene content when noEnvironmental Science & Technology pubs.acs.org/est Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802Environ. Sci. Technol. 2021, 55, 12683 −1269312690overwhelming majority of the microbial community wasbinned into near-complete genomes. This study revealedmicrobial communities in PF to be phylogenetically andfunctionally distinct from those in the ALs. Genomic analysisshowed that the PF was enriched in populations with theability to degrade plant-derived polysaccharides and grow viafermentation and nitrate/nitrite reduction. In contrast, thepopulations recovered from the ALs were shown to acquireenergy via aerobic respiration. Gene abundances in themetagenomes further demonstrated that microbial commun-ities from the AL had a tendency to contain a higherabundance of genes associated with methane/ammoniaoxidation, CSP and TCSs.■ASSOCIATED CONTENT*sıSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge athttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c00802 .Additional descriptions of the materials and methods,PCA, estimated number of cells per gram of soil, relativeabundance of signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent taxonomy, genome-enabled metabolic potential, normalized abundances ofKOs, phylogenetic analysis, sample and sequencinginformation, chemical composition of the permafrostsoils, sequence information for each selected MAG, keymetabolic pathways, and potential metabolic pathways(PDF)■AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding AuthorTatiana A.
