Soil Sci. 86: 465–471. In response to Kyoto Protocol commitments, countries can elect agricultural carbon sinksto offset emissions from other sectors, but they need to verify soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change. We summarize issues wesee as barriers to obtaining accurate measures of SOC change, including: soil depth, bulk density and equivalent soil mass, rep re-sentation of landscape components, experimental design, and the equilibrium status of the SOC. If the entire plow depth is not con-sidered, rates of SOC storage under conservation compared with conventional tillage can be overstated. Bulk density must bemeasured to report SOC stock on an area basis. More critical still is the need to report SOC stock on an equivalent mass basis tonormalize the effects of management on bulk density. Most experiments comparing SOC under differing management have beenconducted in small, flat research plots. Although results obtained from these long-term experiments have been useful to developand validate SOC prediction models, they do not adequately consider landscape effects. Traditional agronomic experimentaldesigns can be inefficient for assessing small changes in SOC stock within large spatial variability. Sampling designs are sugg estedto improve statistical power and sensitivity in detecting changes in SOC stocks over short time periods.Key words : Soil organic carbon change, agroecosystems, experimental design, sampling depthVandenBygaart, A.

Consécutivement aux engagements pris dans le cadre duProtocole de Kyoto, les pays peuvent choisir des puits de carbone agricoles pour compenser les émissions d’autres secteurs.Auparavant toutefois, ils doivent vérifier l’évolution des stocks de carbone organique du sol (COS). Les auteurs résument les f ac-teurs qui pourraient faire obstacle à une quantification précise des variations de COS, entre autres l’épaisseur du sol, la mas se volu-mique apparente et la masse équivalente de sol, la représentation des composants du relief, la méthode expérimentale et l’étatd’équilibre du COS. On pourrait surestimer le taux de stockage du COS lors du travail et du non-travail du sol si on ne tient p ascompte de la profondeur de labour. Il faut mesurer la masse volumique apparente pour rapporter les stocks de COS en fonction dela surface. Il est encore plus crucial de rapporter les stocks de COS d’après leur masse équivalente afin de normaliser les eff ets dela gestion des terres sur la masse volumique apparente. La plupart des expériences où l’on compare le COS résultant de diversespratiques culturales reposent sur de petites parcelles sans relief. Bien qu’ils aient eu leur utilité pour le développement et la vali-dation des modèles de prévision du COS, les résultats issus de ces travaux de longue durée ne tiennent pas assez compte de l’in -cidence du relief. Les méthodes expérimentales traditionnelles en agronomie pourraient manquer d’efficacité pour évaluer lespetites variations des stocks de COS quand il existe une importante variabilité spatiale. Les auteurs suggèrent des plans d’éch an-tillonnage susceptibles d’améliorer la qualité des statistiques et de permettre une détection plus fine des variations des stoc ks deCOS sur une courte période.Mots clés :Variation du carbone organique du sol, écosystèmes agricoles, dispositifs expérimentaux, profondeur d’échantillonnageThe Kyoto Protocol gives countries the option of electingagricultural carbon sinks as offsets to greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions from other sectors. However, this is con-tingent upon adequately verifying that there has been carbonsequestration occurring during the first commitment period.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance for Land Use,Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC 2004), verification ofGHG inventories is required and is defined as “the collec-tion of activities and procedures that can be followed duringthe planning and development, or after the completion of aninventory, that can help to establish its reliability for theintended application of the inventory”. Furthermore it isconsidered good practice to verify soil organic carbon(SOC) changes using data and methods that are independentof those used to prepare the inventory. Although it is feasi-ble to model SOC stock change at multiple scales (Post et al.2001), it is still a necessity to monitor it at the plot and fieldscale in order to obtain the highest accuracy (Ellert et al.2001, 2002) and to develop and validate SOC predictionmodels (Falloon and Smith 2003).The scientific literature suggests that improved manage-ment of agricultural soils can result in increases in SOCstock (Six et al. 2002; VandenBygaart et al. 2003).However, it is acknowledged by many that it is very diffi-cult to adequately detect a small change in SOC stocks overtime periods of less than 5 yr (Post et al. 2001; Ellert et al.2001). This is due to a number of factors including the dif-465Abbreviations : CT, conventional; GHG , greenhouse gas;NT, no-tillage; PET , potential evapotranspiration; SOC ,soil organic carbonCan. J.

The pur-pose of this paper is twofold: (1) to outline some deficien-cies in the existing methods, and consequently theinterpretation of data, to monitor SOC change, and (2) toidentify areas in which we may be able to improve our abil-ity to accurately observe small changes in SOC over shorttime periods.SOIL DEPTH AND TILLAGEA number of studies have derived rates of SOC sequestra-tion based on no-tillage trials from long-term experiments(Six et al. 2002; VandenBygaart et al. 2003). West and Post(2002) collated data from experimental trials comparingSOC from conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT). Theiranalysis showed that relationships between CT and NT SOCstocks were:SOCNT= 1.20(SOCCT) + 255.12, and SOCNT= 0.93 (SOCCT) + 181.36when the data were normalized to the 0–7 cm and the 7–15cm depths, respectively. These findings imply that there wasa loss of SOC in the 7–15 cm depth increment under no-till.This suggests that insufficient consideration of the entireplowing layer may result in overstating the rates of SOCstorage under no-till (Royal Society 2001, p. 26–27).To further emphasize the necessary consideration of soildepth, Fig. 1 shows the rate of SOC storage at successivedepths for a 25-yr no-till period compared with a springmoldboard plow in southern Ontario (Deen and Kataki2003). When the top 10 cm of the profile is considered thereis clearly a considerable gain of SOC of 135 kg ha–1yr–1after accounting for bulk density. However, if the soilbeyond the depth of tillage is included (about 18 cm), therate of sequestration is inverted resulting in a net loss ofSOC at a rate of about 120 kg ha–1yr–1to 20 cm. In this casethere was an actual gain of SOC after 25 yr when just the top10 cm was considered, yet when the entire depth of tillagewas considered there was an overall loss of SOC.The exercise in Fig. 1 emphasizes that the entire plowdepth should be considered, particularly if differences inSOC stratification develop among the management prac-tices. In other words, the SOC may simply be redistributedthrough the plow layer, and could yield no net change overtime, or could even yield a net loss.An analysis of the United States Department ofAgriculture Pedon Database (USDA 1997) indicates that alarge proportion (about 66%) of Ap horizons are greaterthan or equal to 15 cm. If many of these soils had beenmoldboard plowed and subsequently converted to no-till, aninversion of the SOC profile (as demonstrated in Fig. 1) ispossible. If no consideration is made for soils with plowdepths greater than 15 cm, there could be a very large over-estimation of the true rates of sequestration when they aretallied to a national scale. The dynamics of the organic mat-ter that had been placed at this depth under the moldboardplow would not be considered if only the top portion of theplow layer was sampled. A rapid change can occur at depthsapproaching the previous plowing depth when soils are con-verted to no-till. When a long-term no-till sandy loam insouthern Ontario was plowed once, there was a significantdecrease in SOC storage of about 3 Mg ha–1near the top-soil-subsoil interface after only two cropping seasons(VandenBygaart and Kay 2004).BULK DENSITY AND EQUIVALENT SOIL MASSIn addition to SOC concentration and soil depth, calculationof SOC storage requires determination of the bulk density.If the soil is stony, the mass and volume of large rock frag-ments must also be taken into consideration. Large physicalchanges often occur with change in soil tillage practice. Thedata presented in Fig. 2 show the temporal variation in bulkdensity after plowing a silty clay loam soil that had beenunder no-till for 22 yr (VandenBygaart and Kay 2004). Ifthese changes in bulk density are not accounted for in thecalculation of SOC storage, there can be errors in interpre-tation (Post et al. 2001; VandenBygaart and Kay 2004). There are still other cautions with respect to bulk density.For example, when soils are converted from CT to NT thereis generally an increase in bulk density when the entire plowlayer is considered (Kay and VandenBygaart 2002). As aresult, there will be a relative drop of the soil surface afterconversion to no-till (Fig. 3). Thus, if samples are taken tothe same depth within the plow layer, more mass of soil willbe taken from the no-till soil (Fig. 3). This could increase themass of SOC in the no-till and could widen the differencebetween the two systems if there is significant SOC beneaththe maximum depth of sampling. To circumvent this prob-lem, Balesdent et al. (1990) and Ellert and Bettany (1995)described methods to make comparisons based on equiva-lent soil mass. Ellert and Bettany (1995) also re-computeddata from a previous study of comparing SOC stocksbetween NT and CT. For all six comparisons made in thestudy, they showed a decrease in SOC accumulation withno-till using the equivalent soil mass procedure.In this paper, we evaluated studies published since Ellertand Bettany’s (1995) paper, which compared SOC storageon an equivalent mass basis in replicated NT and CT exper-imental plots in temperate agroecosystems. In the sevenstudies considered, only four of the 21 comparisons yieldeda significantly ( P< 0.05) larger SOC storage with no-tillage(Table 1). Although this data set is small and represents asporadic representation of climate-soil situations, oneshould be cautious in interpreting the rates of sequestrationquoted in studies not considering comparisons based onequivalent soil masses between treatments.It should further be noted, however, that consideration forequivalent mass in calculating SOC storage is only criticalwhen the entire topsoil is not sampled, when there is signif-icant amounts of SOC situated beneath the lowest samplingdepth. If standard depth measurements are made in whichthe entire topsoil is contained within the complete profilesampled, and there is little SOC below, any changes in bulkdensity affecting SOC storage calculations are accountedCan.

We cannot discount the possibility that the small numberof studies exhibiting a significant increase of SOC in no-tillwith equivalent mass measures could be due to inadequateexperimental plot and statistical designs. The inherent spa-tial variability in SOC could result in differences not beingdetected when there really were differences.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNMany studies that have been conducted to measure SOC stockchange over time have done so within existing long-term agro-nomic experiments. Agronomic experiments are often blockdesigns, and were developed, and thus optimized, to assessmanagement effects on crop production, not for changes inSOC over time. In this respect, researchers studying SOC stockchange have usually used comparisons between treatments as asurrogate for time. Also, many of these long-term agronomicresearch sites did not have adequate measures of SOC at theinitiation of the experiments. Ideally, assessing changes in SOCshould be done over time, but should also be compared with abaseline treatment such that there is confidence that anychanges that do occur are due to the actual management differ-ences, and not other confounding factors such as climate(Campbell et al. 2000). Due to the inherently large spatial variability in SOCstocks, small differences in SOC stocks among treatmentsare often masked by large variations in SOC across fieldplots. These differences in SOC may be due to pedologic orgeomorphologic differences and can mask any true changesin SOC due to treatment. Not considering this effect mayresult in Type II statistical errors in comparison testing(observing no differences when there really are differences).One solution to this problem for future initiation of moni-toring projects is for soil scientists to consider more appro-priate plot designs when initiating experiments formonitoring changes in SOC over time.Ellert et al. (2002) simulated changes of SOC stock byapplying a known amount of carbon as recalcitrant coal toassess the ability to detect a change due to management.They situated “microsites” at locations within the landscapein which six soil cores were sampled in a systematic grid,while subsequent cores samples were taken, nested withinthe initial core locations (Fig. 4a). They applied a knownamount of 3.64 Mg ha–1of carbon as coal and determinedthe statistical power of the microsite approach. When com-paring the differences after applying the coal, Ellert et al.(2002) showed that using the side-by-side spatial approachthe statistical power was less than if the comparisons wereFig. 1. Comparison of rates of SOC change when different depths are considered 25 yr after conversion to no-till from conventional till age(Deen and Kataki 2003).Fig. 2. Changes in mean bulk density with depth ( n= 30 per soildepth increment) after plowing a long-term no-till soil in southernOntario.Can. J. Soil. Sci. Downloaded from cdnsciencepub.com by 203.163.208.119 on 03/26/23468 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCEmade temporally within the same plots. They could confi-dently detect the added carbon ( P< 0.01) for equivalentmasses exceeding 60-cm depths when comparisons weremade in the same plots after applying the coal.VandenBygaart and Kay (2004) set out to determine thepermanence of SOC that had been stored after 22 yr of no-till in a field in southern Ontario. They devised a plot designin which cores were sampled in a regular systematic gridsimilar to Ellert et al. (2002), but with greater intensity ofsampling (Fig. 4b). However, subsequent soil cores weretaken at positions within 5 cm of the initial core locationsthat further minimized the effect of inherent SOC variabili-ty on statistical power (see VandenBygaart 2006). Usingpaired-core statistical testing, VandenBygaart and Kay(2004) were able to observe differences as small as 700 kgha–1over a period of three growing seasons at a 95% levelof confidence. These designs could be very useful for mon-itoring SOC stock change at varying positions in the land-scape in order to accurately observe small changes overshort time periods such as 4 or 5 yr.REPRESENTATION OF LANDSCAPE COMPONENTSExperimental plots in which SOC stock change has beenassessed over time are generally situated in level positionsof the landscape. This is a consequence of the purpose ofmost agronomic experiments, which is to minimize theeffects of external confounding factors. But there is evi-dence that the response of changing crop and soil manage-ment practices to SOC change varies across a variablelandscape. VandenBygaart et al. (2002) monitored the change inSOC stock after converting four farmer’s fields to no-tillfrom moldboard plow tillage. They situated soil coring loca-tions at varying positions in the landscapes, which each hada history of soil redistribution such that shoulder slopes pro-files were generally shallow with low SOC stock, while footand toeslope landscape positions generally had thick soilprofiles due to deposition of soil from upslope. After 15 yr,the shoulder-slope landscape positions generally showedsharp increases in SOC stock. However, this was counteredby most depositional landscape positions showing declinesin SOC after initiating no-tillage. At all four sites theresponse of SOC stock to converting to no-tillage was a lin-ear function of the SOC stock at the time of conversion;landscape positions that had a low SOC stock due to pasterosion generally showed gains in SOC, while positionswith large SOC stocks due to deposition showed losses after15 yr of no-till. In the central Great Plains of the United States, Sherrod etal. (2003) evaluated the effects of cropping frequency onSOC stocks over a 12-yr period. At three locations differingin potential evapotranspiration (PET), they situated sam-pling locations at summit, sideslope and toeslope positions.At toeslope landscape positions, the only site that showed anincrease in SOC in the top 20 cm after the 12 yr was the lowPET site (Sterling) but only if cropping intensity was 100%.The other two sites with medium and high PET (Strattonand Walsh, respectively) showed losses of SOC at toeslopepositions even if continuously cropped. This is even thoughcrop inputs were greatest at toeslope landscape positions,and suggests that enhanced mineralization due to increasedmoisture in the toeslope positions overrides any crop carboninput benefits (Campbell et al. 2005). Each of the sideslopeand summit landscape locations showed at least equal orlarger SOC storage when continuously cropped over the 12-yr period. Clearly there is a need to represent landscapeposition when assessing SOC stock changes. In particularacquiring data on rates of change of SOC at different land-scape positions is critical when upscaling is necessary forthe purposes of a country’s GHG inventory.EQUILIBRIUM STATUS OF SOCBefore plots are sampled, there should be sufficient knowl-edge of the land-use and management history of the site.This becomes particularly important for confidence that theSOC stock is in an equilibrium state when the managementor land-use change is implemented at the start of the exper-Fig. 3.

For example, Yang and Kay(2001) compared long-term (19 yr) NT with conventionalmoldboard plow tillage in a side-by-side transect design in afarmer’s field. In one portion of the field located in a low-lying area they showed an apparent gain of about 70 Mgha–1under no-tillage (top 30 cm), a difference that wasmuch greater than the net primary productivity of the crop-ping system. It was later discovered that at this landscapeposition tile drains were installed 30 yr previously. The no-till treatment prevented some loss of SOC due to mineral-ization compared with the CT system. In other words theno-till system did not result in a net gain in SOC, but pre-vented the loss of SOC relative to the CT system. This fur-ther emphasizes the caution required in interpretation ofresults when monitoring changes of SOC over time and theusefulness of comparing these changes to a business-as-usual or reference treatment. SUMMARYCountries electing agricultural soil carbon sinks as offsets toGHG emissions must be able to verify any significantincreases in SOC in their lands. But there are some issuesthat need to be resolved when sampling for verifying SOCchange. The erroneous interpretation of SOC change whenonly shallow depths are considered under conservationtillage management can inflate estimates of SOC change.The entire plow layer should be considered because thestratification of SOC can complicate the interpretation ofSOC stock data. The lack of consideration for equivalentmass of soil in comparisons could erroneously favor thosetreatments that show an increase in bulk density by includ-ing more soil in the sample (thus more SOC) within thesame depth. It is also not clear if what is represented inexperiments conducted on small, flat experimental plotscould be extrapolated to variable landscapes. In light of theinherently high variability in SOC stocks at the landscapescale, improvement in experimental design is needed toenhance statistical power and improve our ability to detecttrue differences or changes in SOC stocks over time andreduce the likelihood of type II statistical errors.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank Ed Gregorich, Martin Bolinder andCraig Drury for commenting on an earlier version of themanuscript.
