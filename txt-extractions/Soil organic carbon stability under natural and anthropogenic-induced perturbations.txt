Herein, we review perturbation types and SOC response mechanisms, aswell as new technologies to measure SOC stability, highlighting the resistance and resilience of SOC. Althoughthere is great controversy on the nature and structure of SOC, it has been recognized that the SOC stability notonly depends on physiochemical characteristics of SOC, but also on soil microenvironment, soil microbialcommunity composition, and types of perturbations. Based on ecosystem stability theories, the change of SOCstability under perturbation can be keeping stable states, changing to an alternative stable states or systemcollapse. For future studies, we suggest that understanding responses of soil biogeochemical processes to mul-tiple perturbations, well-designed experiments to quantify threshold and uncertainty of SOC, and integration ofnovel biological approaches besides physicochemical characterizations into SOC stability are needed. This re-view helps to better understand the process of SOC stabilization and reduce the uncertainties in assessments ofglobal carbon stocks, not only for mitigating the eﬀ ects of climate change through negative feedbacks but alsofor maintaining soil functions such as soil fertility, water quality, and resistance to erosion.1. Introduction: soil organic carbon stability and perturbationSoil is the largest terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool, where accu-mulation and stability of organic carbon contributes to soil quality andfertility ( Shahriari et al., 2011; Six et al., 2000 ). Soil organic carbon(SOC) thus plays key roles in determining soil properties, plant nu-trients, and land-atmosphere carbon exchange, yet is a ﬀected by var-ious natural and anthropogenic perturbations such as wild ﬁre, climatechange, land use change or soil pollution. Attributed to the importanceof soil carbon in the global carbon cycle and potential feedbacks toclimate change, how SOC responds to perturbations is of great interest(Falahatkar et al., 2014 ;Sistla et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018a ).Soil organic C stability is de ﬁned as the tendency of organic carbonin soil to resist change and/or loss ( Doetterl et al., 2016 ). Recent re-search on SOC stability has concentrated mainly on the response of SOCin diﬀerent ecosystems to warming ( Davidson and Janssens, 2006 ),increased atmospheric CO2(van Groenigen et al., 2011), nitrogen ad-dition ( Neﬀet al., 2002 ), and climate extremes ( Reichstein et al., 2013 ).Many researchers have used physical, chemical, or biological ap-proaches, such as spectroscopic methods, isotopic tracing and microbialcommunity analysis, to study the biogeochemical process of SOCaccumulation and loss ( Davidson and Janssens, 2006 ;Schmidt et al.,2011 ;Trivedi et al., 2013). Recent studies have rapidly improved ourunderstanding of carbon accumulation and decomposition processes insoils, and SOC stabilization mechanisms still requires further in-depthinvestigations.The physicochemical structure of SOC had long been considered asthe decisive factor of SOC stability. The role of humic substances instabilization of soil carbon drew attention as early as 1936 ( Waksman,1936 ). Over the next 70 years, the molecular structure of more SOCcomponents besides humic substance, including light fractions, mineralorganic carbon, and soil aggregate have been used for indicating SOCstability ( Sollins et al., 1996 ;Sutton and Sposito, 2005 ;Zech et al.,1997 ). Complex chemical composition and molecular characteristics,such as aromatic-, aliphatic-, alkyl aryl-, and biaryl-bonds could protectSOC from decomposition ( Zech et al., 1997 ). Progress in spectroscopicanalysis techniques, especially nuclear magnetic resonance spectro-scopy, provides information of SOC chemical characteristics at themicroscale, leading to more debates and controversies about the nature,structure and stability of SOC ( Baveye and Wander, 2019 ;Sutton andSposito, 2005; Zaccone et al., 2018 ). Whether humic substances couldbe extracted by alkali from soils and be important to SOC stability arehttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103199Received 26 May 2019; Received in revised form 23 April 2020⁎Corresponding authors.E-mail addresses: ligh@tsinghua.edu.cn (G.

All rights reserved.Tnow under debate ( Ohno et al., 2019 ). Compound-speci ﬁc isotopicevidence has demonstrated that molecular attributes are insu ﬃcient forexplaining the persistence of carbon in soils. For example, the meanresidence time of lignins or plant lipids that had been suggested topersist in soils, were found to be only 50 –100 years, with a fasterturnover than the bulk of the organic carbon ( Amelung et al., 2008). Bycontrast, proteins and saccharides that were considered to be labilecompounds persisted for decades ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ).Trumbore andCzimczik (2008) proposed that the SOC stability also depended oncomplex in ﬂuences from the spatial heterogeneity of biota and en-vironmental conditions, which could alter the likelihood of decom-position. In a seminal review article, Lehmann and Kleber (2015)claimed that the decomposition of SOC did not rely on its physico-chemical properties, but on the accessibility of carbon by microbes andenzymes.The physical stabilization of SOC through soil aggregates is attrib-uted to spatial inaccessibility and reduced oxygen di ﬀusion that protectagainst decomposition by microbes and enzymes ( Sollins et al., 1996 ).Soil organic carbon can also be stabilized by the interactions betweenSOC and mineral surfaces which form stable organic –mineral bondsthrough anion and inner-sphere ligand-exchange reactions ( Wiesmeieret al., 2019 ). Insoluble oxides of Al, Fe (III), Mn (IV) on mineral surfacescould protect SOC from decomposition by forming barriers againstenzymatic hydrolysis ( Torn et al., 1997). Till now, it is generally ac-cepted that there are three major mechanisms for protecting organiccarbon from decomposition, which are biochemical stabilizationthrough the formation of resistant SOC compounds, physical stabiliza-tion through microaggregation, and stabilization of SOC by formationof stable organic –mineral bonds on mineral surfaces ( von Luetzowet al., 2006 ). As a result, parameters of carbon physicochemical com-position have been selected to represent the carbon stabilization statusof soil in coupled climate ‑carbon models, which study the couplingbetween climate change and the carbon cycle ( Friedlingstein et al.,2006 ), such as CENTURY ( Parton et al., 1987 ) and ROTH-C ( Jenkinson,1990 ) models.Despite the controversy on the nature and fate of SOC, the con-sensus was that the soil biotic community and the soil microenviron-ment were key factors a ﬀecting the SOC stability ( Jastrow et al., 2007;Schmidt et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2018a ). Soil organic C accumulationand decomposition could be controlled by factors such as plant residuequality, spatial accessibility, and soil faunal and microbial communitycomposition ( Trumbore and Czimczik, 2008 ). Recent studies have re-cognized that SOC stability is an ecosystem property that varies attemporal scale from decades to centuries ( Fraterrigo and Rusak, 2008;Schmidt et al., 2011 ). The rates of plant litter inputs and SOC decom-position by microorganisms depend on the time scale, which leads tochanges of SOC stability response over time ( Trumbore and Czimczik,2008 ). Meanwhile, the sensibility and adaptability of plant and soilmicrobial community also re ﬂect diﬀerences over time with perturba-tion ( Hartmann et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2011 ). Therefore, stabili-zation mechanism of SOC need to consider biotic factor and time scalebesides carbon physicochemical structures.Presently, we are far from a clear understanding of the mechanismsbehind SOC stability, in particular, how natural and anthropogenicperturbations a ﬀect organic carbon in soils. Perturbation refers tobiological or environmental events that produce successional upset,disaster, stress or disturbance to organisms or systems ( Vogl, 1980 ). Insoil ecosystem, perturbation is deﬁ ned as an e ﬀect that causes the soilecological component to deviate from pre-perturbation state (pre-ex-isting state just before perturbation occurrence, as a reference point),including natural and anthropogenic events ( Rykiel, 1985 ). As theterms perturbation, stress, and disturbance are often used inter-changeably, we examine SOC stability studies that use any of thesethree terms to mean “perturbation ”.The main natural perturbations include wild ﬁre, debris ﬂow,warming, disease and pests, and other meteorological, geological andhydrological events. Wild ﬁres prevent the accumulation of SOC by al-tering the physical properties of the soil, soil water content, and themicrobial composition ( Mack et al., 2011 ). Meteorological events, suchas exceptional rainfalls ( Denef et al., 2001) and droughts ( Rivest et al.,2015 ), can change the quantity and quality of SOC input by in ﬂuencingthe biomass and productivity of vegetation and the population dy-namics of soil microbes. Geological and hydrological events, such asearthquakes and ﬂooding, can also directly or indirectly change localvegetation, soil, and topography, thus in ﬂuencing the SOC pools ( Caoet al., 2002 ;Hilton et al., 2011). Disease and pests can result in theexfoliation and death of plants (such as conifers, eucalypt trees anddeciduous trees), thus changing the biomass and productivity of localvegetation and ultimately in ﬂuencing SOC content ( Arasa-Gisbert et al.,2018 ).In addition to natural perturbation, anthropogenic perturbation hasbecome important for earth's carbon cycling with the increasing impacton soil ecosystems of a growing human population. Types of anthro-pogenic perturbation associated with SOC stability include land usechange, nitrogen deposition, and soil pollution (such as metal con-tamination and crude oil pollution). Land use change includes urbanexpansion ( Xu et al., 2012 ), transforming forested land to farmland(Don et al., 2011 ), grazing ( Ayoubi et al., 2014 ), and agriculturalmanagement (e.g., fertilization and tillage practices) ( Drosos andPiccolo, 2018 ). Land use change can in ﬂuence local SOC inputs and soilredistribution (spatial soil transportation) mainly by altering the localvegetation ecosystem and causing soil erosion ( Ayoubi et al., 2012;Doetterl et al., 2016). For example, the conversion from natural toagricultural land use may increase soil erosion and the decompositionof SOC by removing the protective cover of natural vegetation, whilethe use of fertilizers could induce additional carbon sequestration onagricultural ﬁelds ( Doetterl et al., 2016 ). Nitrogen deposition in ﬂuencesatmosphere-SOC cycles by changing litter decomposition, ﬁne rootturnover, and soil respiration, ultimately altering the SOC stock ( Neﬀet al., 2002 ). Acid rain in ﬂuences the metabolic activity and enzymeactivity of soil microorganisms through multifactor interactions ( Guoet al., 2003). Metal contamination could inhibit the activities of ureaseand catalase in soil, thus in ﬂuencing the accumulation of SOC ( Zhanget al., 2016 ). In areas polluted by organic contamination such as crudeoil, oil pollution changes the physical properties and functions of soil,and aﬀects soil microorganism community structure, functional genes,and metabolic processes ( Yang et al., 2018a, 2018b ). Hydrophobicpetroleum components can also a ﬀect soil water-retention capacity, gaspermeability, and potential adsorption of organic mineral matter(Khanna et al., 2013 ;Mills et al., 2004 ), which is likely to a ﬀect theformation of soil aggregates and the physical stability of SOC.Here, we review perturbation types and SOC response mechanismsto gain insights into SOC stability under environmental perturbations,and consider ecological theories to identify general principles under-lying SOC stabilization. We highlight the resilience and resistance ofSOC and then provide an overview of novel insights and approachesrelated to SOC stability, which could lead to a new generation of SOCmodels. We also used a bibliometric analysis to track historical trends of“SOC stability ”by the VOSviewer software and suggest future researchdirections to expand our ability to understand and predict SOC dy-namics under perturbations.2. The response to perturbation and calculation of SOC stability2.1. The response of SOC stability to perturbationBased on ecosystem stability theories (Pimm, 1984), the response ofSOC stability to perturbation can be classi ﬁed into three categories:keeping stable states, changing to an alternative stable state and systemcollapse. These depend on the soil ecosystem property and the type ofperturbation it experiences. Fig. 1 qualitatively illustrates the SOCstability response to a perturbation in the soil ecosystem.J. Yang, et al. Earth-Science Reviews 205 (2020) 1031992As an ecosystem property, stability can be viewed from two per-spectives: resistance (capacity to persist and maintain system state andfunctions during perturbation, Rs), and resilience (ability to recoverfrom the impact of perturbation, Re) (McCann, 2000 )(Fig. 1). Soilecosystem resistance and resilience are determined by the co-action ofbiotic and abiotic factors. Soil organic C may maintain stable states(Fig. 1 a), in which SOC indices return to its pre-perturbation state.During this process, resistance rate (quanti ﬁed by the deviation ofsystem from the pre-perturbation state per unit time after perturbation)and resilience rate (quanti ﬁed by the reverting of system to the pre-perturbation state per unit time after perturbation) jointly determinethe time needed for the system to return its pre-perturbation state. ForSOC stability, many studies have demonstrated that both abovegroundplants and underground faunal and microbial communities exhibittolerance and functional stability to perturbation ( Hartmann et al.,2014 ;Schmidt et al., 2011; Trumbore and Czimczik, 2008 ).Sistla et al.(2013) reported that warming restructured Arctic tundra but did notchange total SOC or nitrogen stocks over the two-decade experimentalperiod in an Alaskan tundra ecosystem. Other researchers have ob-served that initial increases in soil CO2eﬄux often disappeared withina few years and that total SOC content remained constant ( Eliassonet al., 2005; Luo et al., 2001; Melillo et al., 2002 ). These results could beinterpreted as ‘acclimation ’of the root microbial communities to en-vironmental changes ( Davidson and Janssens, 2006 ). In support of this,genomic information provides evidence that most soil microbial com-munities possess related genes to relieve stress and acclimate to en-vironmental changes with moderate perturbations ( Trivedi et al.,2013 ).Soil organic C systems may have alternative stable states ( Fig. 1b),in which the ﬁnal SOC state depends on the pre-perturbation state andthe resilience. If the resilience of the system is not strong enough toreturn to the pre-perturbation state, then SOC stability will decreasethrough carbon emissions. Many recent studies have demonstrated thatnatural and anthropogenic perturbations may result in changes to SOCincluding its physical and chemical structure, soil functional genes andmetabolic processes, which ultimately lead to carbon emission(Creamer et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016; Schuur et al., 2015 ). Alter-native stable states may also occur with positive accumulation of SOC.The ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis ’suggests that intermediatelevels of perturbation that are not biologically destructive may stabilizethe ecosystem ( Connell, 1978 ;Rykiel, 1985 ). Studies of trees, shrubs,forbs, and grasses have showed that native species diversity and rich-ness may be maximized by moderate disturbance ( Mayor et al., 2012 ;Molino and Sabatier, 2001 ). The shifts in the stable states of a systemcould be used to measure SOC stability when alternative stable statesoccur ( Ives and Carpenter, 2007).Perturbations might also lead to soil ecosystem collapse and loss ofresilience ( Fig. 1c), if they exceed its catastrophic threshold (tippingpoint) ( Dai et al., 2012). When system collapses and loses resilience,stability can be measured by calculating the resistance of a system toperturbation through time ( Ives and Carpenter, 2007 ). For example, amore resistant SOC system is less a ﬀected by perturbation and canwithstand greater interference. The inherent characteristics of thesystem and the intensity of perturbation that the system experiencesboth determine the stability ( Ives et al., 2003).2.2. Calculations of resistance and resilienceThe deﬁ nition of stability in ecology are based on a system's abilityto defy change (resistance and resilience). Resistance refers to the de-gree to which a variable changes after a perturbation has occurred.Resilience is deﬁ ned as the return time to the equilibrium of a systemafter a perturbation. The metrics of resistance and resilience of eco-system response to perturbation within a soil stable system can begrouped into three major types of simple stability, relative stability andintegrated stability according to their attributes. In the present study,we follow the terminology used by Ingrisch and Bahn (2018) reportedinTable 1.Thereare several criteria to calculate resistance and resilience in-cluding a monotonic increase, identical values for equal perturbations(positive/negative), and undisturbed soil for the reference ( Orwin andWardle, 2004 ). The ecosystem characteristic, type of perturbation, andecosystem state were important factors for calculating stability(Ingrisch and Bahn, 2018). Category I stability (simple stability) iscalculated by simply comparing the stability indices between disturbedsoil and undisturbed soil samples (pre- and post-perturbation). Theperturbation impact can be quanti ﬁed by the change between the preperturbation state of SOC system and the state after perturbation. TheFig. 1. Base on ecological theory, soil organic carbon (SOC) stability depend onthe soil ecosystem property and the type of perturbation it experiences ( Ivesand Carpenter, 2007 ). (a) Maintained stable state: SOC stability that returned toits previous level after perturbation. Resistance rate ( Rs) and resilience rate ( Re)jointly determine the time (t) it takes for the system to return to its pre-per-turbation state. The furthest distance from the equilibrium state is indicatedwith black dashed lines. (b) Alternative stable states. Pre-perturbation state isshown with blue dashed line. Orange line shows increased SOC stability duringcarbon sequestration and red line shows decreased SOC stability during carbonemission. (c) System collapse, in which resilience loss leads to system collapse.(For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader isreferred to the web version of this article.)J. Yang, et al. Earth-Science Reviews 205 (2020) 1031993smaller impact or change suggested smaller perturbation or more sta-bilization of the SOC system ( Ingrisch and Bahn, 2018 ). Recently, mostSOC stability studies have used this category to quantify a system'scapacity to resist and recover from perturbation. However, such ap-proach does not consider the time scale of observation. More complexcategories (Category II and III) focus on changes occurring in un-disturbed and disturbed soil over time. Category II (relative stability)emphasizes recovery from perturbation and indicates the percentage ofpre-perturbation state that has recovered, while category III (integratedstability) emphasizes the perturbation impact and indicates the in-tegrated changes of stability ( Ingrisch and Bahn, 2018). Category II andIII have been mainly used for calculating the resistance and resilience ofmicrobial community structures, food webs, and enzyme activities insoils ( de Vries et al., 2012 ;Jain et al., 2016 ;Meola et al., 2014 ).3. Indicators and approaches to quantify SOC stabilityChanges in SOC are directly estimated in two ways: quantifying thesoil total carbon by dry combustion or potassium permanganate oxi-dation, and measuring soil CO2and CH 4concentrations using an in-frared gas analyzer or gas chromatograph ( Plante et al., 2011 ). Changescan also be estimated indirectly based on the turnover rate of carbon bymeasuring the carbon stable isotopic ratio and using radiocarbondating, which are both e ﬀective tools to investigate SOC dynamics ondecadal to millennial timescales ( Gaudinski et al., 2000 ;Hobley et al.,2013 ). Here, we detail approaches used to estimate the chemical andphysical stability of SOC ( Fig. 2). These indicators and approaches allcould be used in SOC stability measurement during laboratory in-cubations and in situ experimental observations.3.1. Chemical stabilityChemical stability of SOC could be analyzed by chemical fractio-nation procedures, spectroscopic methods, and thermal analysis(Fig. 2a). Many chemical fractionation procedures have been used togenerate soil organic fractions and assess the stability of SOC ( Fig. 2a).Classic methods for humic substance extraction by alkaline solutions(e.g., NaOH and Na4P2O7), followed by acidi ﬁcation with hydrochloricacid, were used to separate humic and fulvic acids ( Olk, 2006). Thechloroform-fumigation method is used to extract soil microbial biomasscarbon ( Vance et al., 1987). Acid hydrolysis and potassium perman-ganate (KMnO 4) oxidation e ﬀectively remove labile carbon (sugars,proteins, and amino acids) to determine the resistant fraction (alkyl andaryl materials) ( Blair et al., 1995 ). Hydro ﬂuoric acid (HF) can be usedto destroy the mineral phase and isolate SOC from organo-mineralcomplexes ( Parsons, 1983 ).Spectroscopic methods, such as13C-nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy, near infrared (NIR), and di ﬀuse reﬂectance in-frared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy are relatively advancedtechniques that can be used to characterize SOC.13C NMR spectroscopycan identify and quantify important organic functional groups of SOCwith little sample preparation. Soil samples only need to be pre-treatedwith HF to remove Fe3+and Mn2+from the soil to increase the signalto noise ratio ( Li et al., 2017 ). The13C NMR spectra can delineate fourcommon chemical shift regions corresponding to alkyl (0 –50 ppm), O-alkyl (50 –110 ppm), aromatic (110 –160 ppm), and carbonyl(160 –200 ppm) C atoms. It is possible to further divide some otherchemical shift regions, such as dividing O-alkyl C into methoxyl C(50 –60 ppm), carbohydrate C (60 –90 ppm), and di-O-alkyl C(90 –110 ppm); aromatic C into aryl C (110 –142 ppm) and phenolic C(142 –160 ppm) ( Knicker, 2007). NIR and DRIFT can be used to quicklyquantify SOC content, and NIR is primarily a molecular technique bestsuited for rapid in situ soil carbon content ( Bricklemyer, 2012 ). DRIFTcan be combined with NMR to quantify alkyl-C, aromatic-C, and car-boxyl-C ( Rumpel et al., 2001 ).As spectroscopic methods could not provide information regardingchemical compounds of SOC, thermal analyses including thermo-gravimetry, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC/MS) has been used for SOC structure analysis ata more detailed level ( Leinweber et al., 2008 ;Plante et al., 2011;Saenger et al., 2013). Thermogravimetry is a technique that recordsmass changes in SOC as a function of temperature ( Plante et al., 2011).Rock-Eval pyrolysis is originally used for obtaining information onamounts of hydrocarbons and types of kerogen present in sedimentaryrocks, which also provides information on the composition of the SOCthrough the Hydrogen and Oxygen Index values ( Disnar et al., 2003). Inthe pyrolysis-GC/MS, pyrolysis products are separated using a pyrolyserby setting di ﬀerent pyrolysis temperatures and then identi ﬁed by GC/MS. About 131 SOC fractions have been identi ﬁed and quanti ﬁed usingpyrolysis-GC/MS ( Schellekens et al., 2017), including n-alkanes, bran-ched aliphatics, n-fatty acids, diterpenes, PAHs, indenes, benzofurans,aromatics, phenols, lignin phenols, N-containing compounds, and car-bohydrate products.For chemical fractionation procedures, spectroscopic and thermalmethods, solid soil samples are prepared by air drying, grinding andsieving. Generally, chemical fractionation procedures could extractTable 1Overview of currently used calculations for resistance and resilience indices, grouped into three categories according to their attribute.Category Attribute ofstabilityResistance Resilience ExplanationaReferenceI Simple stability PC00PxC0C0measured in the undisturbed soil (control) and P0measured in the disturbedsoil at time 0 after disturbance (immediately); Pxmeasured in the disturbed soilat time xafter disturbance.(Kaufman, 1982 )I Simple stability PC00PxCxC0,P0, and Pxare as above.

Yang, et al. Earth-Science Reviews 205 (2020) 1031994speciﬁc components of SOC, such as humic substances, soil microbialbiomass carbon and labile carbon. However, most of the extractionschemes are complex, tedious, and of low e ﬃciency, with only a portion(20 –60%) of the total SOC being extracted ( Mathers et al., 2000 ).Chemical fractionation procedures often destroy the natural state ofSOC, resulting in a loss of information about its stabilization process.The advantages of spectroscopic methods and thermal analyses are that,being non-destructive, they do not alter the original physiochemicalstructural of SOC ( Peltre et al., 2013), providing more information ofSOC structural chemistry than chemical fractionation procedures. Al-though spectroscopic and thermal methods can identify and quantifyover a hundred chemical compositions of SOC ( Zaccone et al., 2018 ),they cannot be used to analyze soil microbial biomass carbon andhumic substance.3.2. Physical stabilitySoil aggregation is a key physical indicator of SOC stability.According to the aggregate hierarchy theory proposed by Tisdall andOades (1982) ,d iﬀerent aggregates within a hierarchical order havediﬀerent types of organic binding. Organo-mineral microaggregates(< 250 μm) are formed by associations among soil amorphous mineralcomponents, crystalline particles and microbial cells ( Tiessen andStewart, 1988 ). These microaggregates are temporarily held together asmacroaggregates (> 250 μm) by roots and fungal hyphae. As a result,SOC in macroaggregates may readily decompose and SOC in micro-aggregates is more stable ( Tisdall and Oades, 1982 ).The methods of aggregate size fractionation are used to isolatediﬀerent organic fractions and measure the stability of soil aggregate inmany studies ( Angst et al., 2017 ;Le Bissonnais, 2016 ;Legout et al.,2005 ). The sieve-based methods often separate aggregates into mac-roaggregates (> 250 μm) and microaggregates (< 250 μm) throughdiﬀerent mesh sizes of sieves. Six et al. (2002) suggested that a frac-tionation procedure using wet sieving and slaking could obtain micro-aggregates (53 –250 μm). The ultrasonic treatment breaks up macro-aggregates and releases microaggregates < 20 μm, but has little e ﬀecton aggregates < 2 μm(Christensen, 2001). To further measure thebreakdown mechanism of aggregate, Le Bissonnais method could beused for size fractionation with three treatments of fast wetting, slowwetting and wetting stirring ( Le Bissonnais, 2016). In addition, ag-gregate density fractionation could be used to separate aggregate tolight and heavy fractions by density cut-oﬀ and sonication intensity,helping in clarifying the SOC physical structure in carbon turnover andstabilization ( Cerli et al., 2012 ;Rabotet al., 2018).Recently, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) have been used to analyze the intra-aggregate mi-crostructure and aggregate dynamics in relation to SOC distribution.Papadopoulos et al. (2009) found with X-ray CT that the intra-ag-gregate pore size distribution did not signi ﬁcantly a ﬀect aggregatestability. By using CT and the Pore-Cor network model, Dal Ferro et al.(2012) demonstrated that aggregate porosity and hydrophobicity a ﬀectaggregate stability and that SOC stability increased with increasingwater retention capacity. Based on recent studies, physical decom-position of residues and the formation of microaggregates might beaﬀected by the ratio of carbon: nitrogen (C:N) of plant residues ( Blanco-Canqui and Lal, 2004 ), lignin concentration ( Martens, 2000 ), soilFig. 2. Soil organic carbon (SOC) intrinsicstability methods that are related to soilphysical structure and molecular attributes.(a) Chemical stability methods includedchemical fractionation procedures that ex-tract soil organic fractions (e.g., humic,microbial biomass carbon (MBC), labile C,and resistant C) and non-destructive char-acterization techniques (e.g., thermal ana-lysis and spectroscopy methods). (b) Classicmethods of aggregate size fractionation in-cluded sieving, sieving combined withslaking, and ultrasonic vibration. Recently,studies applied scanning electron micro-scopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomo-graphy (CT) to analyze aggregate micro-structure and dynamics.J. Yang, et al. Earth-Science Reviews 205 (2020) 1031995moisture retention capacity ( Zibilske and Bradford, 2007), and con-centration and mineralogy of clay minerals ( Jimenez and Lal, 2006 ).The integration of 3D image evaluation with CT and SEM have beenused to understand the highly heterogeneous intra-aggregate micro-structure on the submicron scale, and model biogeochemical reactionsof soil interfaces at the pore scale ( Dal Ferro et al., 2012 ;Khan et al.,2012 ).While physical, chemical, spectroscopic and thermal approacheshelp us to much better understand the characterization of SOC stability,single method or proxy only provide limited information of physical orchemical structure changes of SOC with perturbation ( Zaccone et al.,2018 ). Physical chemistry and molecular biology techniques could becombined to assess the stability and dynamics of SOC, and theseindicators could be used to quantify the resistance and resilience of SOCin response to perturbation.4. Future directionsWe used a bibliometric analysis to track historical trends of “SOCstability ”by the VOSviewer software (see Fig. 3) and suggested futureresearch directions. Before 2015, the important terms included “carbonturnover ”,“CO2”,“sequestration ”,“temperature ”,“climate” ,“microbialbiomass ”,“aggregate ”(Fig. 3a). Due to the importance of SOC turnoverand stability in global CO 2emissions ( van Groenigen et al., 2011), itwas not surprising that these words emerged as the highest occurringterm within the text corpus, because most studies are geared towardsFig. 3.

This indicatesthat recent studies on SOC stability tended to improve the under-standing of biological mechanisms, ecological property and un-certainty.4.1. Biological mechanisms in SOC stabilitySoil organisms, including invertebrates and microorganisms, play avital role in SOC accumulation and decomposition ( Tajik et al., 2019;Trivedi et al., 2013). Generally, four biotic strategies are considered toinﬂuence SOC dynamics ( Ekschmitt et al., 2005 ): (1) release of exo-enzymes by microorganisms to breakdown the organic substrate, (2)mechanical crushing of organic residues by soil fauna, (3) disintegra-tion of soil aggregates and relocation of soil mass by fauna, and (4)carbon ﬁxation in the living biomass. Although biomass carbon of soilmicroorganisms accounts for a very small portion of the total SOC, it isconsidered that microbial residues, including murein, chitin, and lipids,are the main sources of stable SOC ( Kallenbach et al., 2016 ).As microbial community structure and activity could impact theprocess of SOC decomposition, recent ecosystem models have started toincorporate microbial communities ( Creamer et al., 2015). Wieder et al.(2013) created a new soil biogeochemistry module to improve globalsoil carbon predictions in the Community Land Model (CLM) by mod-elling microbial processes. Trivedi et al. (2013) reviewed microbialmodulators of soil carbon storage and how data related to microbialcomposition and activities can be incorporated into mechanistic andpredictive models. The contribution of microorganisms to SOC mighthave been underestimated in previous researches, thus it's necessary toconsider biological factors in conceptual and quantitative SOC modelsand integrate new microbiological techniques in the future study ofSOC stability.4.2. SOC stability uncertainty and thresholdsFor resistance and resilience, soil ecosystems need a balance be-tween stabilizing and destabilizing forces. If these forces are balancedthrough natural feedback loops, the SOC pool will naturally retain itsstable state ( Fraterrigo and Rusak, 2008 ). During the growing season,gross primary productivity and litter input increase, thus soil oftenshows net carbon uptake in summer. However, in spring, autumn, andespecially winter, soil carbon loss might occur due to seasonal varia-tions without perturbation ( Schuur et al., 2009 ;Sistla et al., 2013). Thesuccession of soil communities and the oscillating densities of predatorsand prey could also lead to the natural variation of the SOC pool(Ekschmitt et al., 2005). Schuur et al. (2009) found that soil CO2ﬂuxfrom tundra soil to the atmosphere ranges from −40 to 80 (g C m−2)i ndiﬀerent seasons. Another study in northeast Spain showed that totalcarbon and glomalin (i.e. a glycoprotein produced by mycorrhizal fungithat may bind aggregates) varied signi ﬁcantly in di ﬀerent seasons(Emran et al., 2012 ). The overlay of natural variation of SOC and im-pact of perturbation, result in the uncertainty of SOC stability.The key issue is whether natural and/or anthropogenic perturbationleads to irreversible damage by pushing the soil ecosystem over criticalthresholds. When these thresholds are crossed, the system cannotmaintain its natural feedback loops and a loss of resilience can occur.This loss of resilience can lead to the degradation of soil ecologicalfunction, and prevent soil recovery ( Kleinen et al., 2003). The criticalthreshold depends on the population dynamics of underground andaboveground species, intrinsic soil properties, and the frequency andseverity of the perturbation ( Ingrisch and Bahn, 2018 ). Other studieshave investigated soil microbial resistance and resilience thresholds toperturbation, such as during a drought ( Rivest et al., 2015 ), simulatedrainfall ( Steenwerth et al., 2005 ), and heavy metal pollution ( Mertenset al., 2007 ). However, the exact tipping points of SOC stabilitythresholds and uncertainty to di ﬀerent types of perturbation remainunclear. Therefore, assessing these critical thresholds in future studies isneeded.4.3. The response of SOC stability to multiple perturbationsMany soil ecosystems are disturbed by multiple natural and/or an-thropogenic events ( Moreno-Mateos et al., 2017 ;Vinebrooke et al.,2004 ). Multiple types of perturbation occurring simultaneously oftenhave diverse impacts on SOC stability compared to a single type ofperturbation, resulting in complex responses. For instance, warmingcan accelerate the decomposition of SOC (including light fractions,heavy fractions and mineral organic carbon) ( Fang et al., 2005; Knorret al., 2005). However, there is evidence suggesting that rising tem-peratures restructure Alaskan tundra ecosystems without changing SOCstorage due to increasing nitrogen availability, plant biomass, anddominance of woody plants ( Sistla et al., 2013 ). In New South Wales,Australia, Creamer et al. (2015) examined the e ﬀects of litter additionand higher temperature on SOC decomposition in woodland ecosystemsand found that these may increase long-term stability of SOC.Soil organic C stability variations are often only considered with asingle type of perturbation in many incubation experiments, which maylead to inconsistencies between laboratory-based studies and ﬁeld ob-servations. Studies estimating carbon loss in soil heating experimentshave detected major increases in carbon decomposition rates with in-creasing temperature ( Oberbauer et al., 2007). However, in situ ob-servations by measuring changes in the13C/12C ratio and total SOCcontent revealed that SOC stability does not vary with temperature(Giardina and Ryan, 2000 ;Schmidt et al., 2011; Sistla et al., 2013 ). Anexplanation for the discrepancy may be that other factors (e.g.,moisture, change of plant type, and other sources of perturbation) actalongside warming to alter long-term SOC stability ( Giardina and Ryan,2000 ), which is rarely re ﬂected in short-term laboratory studies. Thereare other multiple and compounding perturbations, such as ﬁring withglobal warming in forest and pasture, land use change with agriculturalmanagement, which could appreciably in ﬂuence the ecosystem andcause the change of SOC stability ( Knicker, 2007 ;Mack et al., 2011).Understanding the response of soil biogeochemical processes to mul-tiple types of perturbation will therefore be vital for accurate predic-tions of global SOC dynamics.5. ConclusionsBased on ecosystem stability theories, SOC stability responses toperturbations as either keeping stable states, changing to an alternativestable states or system collapse. The understanding of SOC stabilitywith perturbations has evolved using more advanced characterizationtechniques. Relatively new non-destructive characterization techniquessuch as spectroscopic methods, thermal analysis, X-ray computed to-mography (CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) could provideSOCﬁne chemical and structural characteristics as well as SOC dy-namics at the submicrometer scale. To accurately quantify changes inSOC stability, the resistance and resilience of SOC can be calculatedbased on the pre- and after-perturbation state of SOC and the temporalscale of perturbation impact. We suggest that biological mechanismneed to be considered in the future research in addition to physical andchemical processes, threshold and uncertainty of SOC stability, impactof multiple and compounding perturbations. This will advance ourunderstanding of SOC stabilization processes and reduce the un-certainties in assessments of global carbon stocks.Declaration of Competing InterestAll the authors have read and approved the manuscript.
