Microbial Genes of AgriculturalImportance in Maize RhizosphereUnveiled Through ShotgunMetagenomicsOluwadara Pelumi Omotayo, Ozede Nicholas Igiehon and Olubukola Oluranti Babalola*Food Security and Safety Focus Area, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Science, North-West University, Mmabatho, SouthAfricaGenes possessed by microbes in the rhizosphere in ﬂuence the metabolic activities thatoccur in this zone. Although the maize rhizosphere has been reported to be a hotspot ofgenes, these genes remain under-investigated. Hence, this study aimed at identifyingputative microbial genes with plant bene ﬁcial functions in the underexplored maizerhizosphere microbiome using a shotgun metagenomics approach. Sampling wasdone at the ﬂowering stage of the maize plants and both the rhizosphere and bulksoils were collected in triplicates. The metagenomes of the examined rhizosphere and bulksoils revealed genes involved in carbon ﬁxation, nitrogen ﬁxation, iron acquisition, heat andcold shock, phosphorus solubilization and utilization, sulfur cycling, and siderophoreproduction. The beta diversity analysis showed signi ﬁcant variations ( p<0.05) in thesegenes across the examined rhizosphere and bulk soils which was further con ﬁrmed by thedistinct separations between the samples as seen on the principal coordinate analysis(PCoA) plot. Contrarily, no signi ﬁcant difference was observed in diversity within thehabitats ( p= 0.99). The predominance of signi ﬁcant genes of agricultural importancesuch as the nifH,nifA, groES, andcspA in the rhizosphere metagenomes signi ﬁes that thisregion is endowed with bene ﬁcial organisms with potential for improving plant growth,mitigating stress, and reducing the effect of extreme temperatures, which can beoptimized in developing biofertilizers. Therefore, the development of strategies that willhelp in cultivating these organisms, which are mostly unculturable, is encouraged. Thiswould make them readily available for use as bio-inoculants and in other biotechnologicalapplications.Keywords: maize rhizosphere, microbes, microbial genes, sulfur cycling, iron acquisition, rhizosphere microbiome,heat and cold shock, shotgun metagenomicsINTRODUCTIONMaize ( Zea mays ) is one of the largest cultivated grain crops g lobally and an important staple crop withgood nutritional value widely consumed in diverse processed forms ( Huma et al., 2019 ). It is not onlyvaluable for food consumption and indigenous pur poses but highly applicable as raw material inindustries for manufacturing various products ( Rajoo 2021 ). Like any other crop, the community ofmicrobes present in the maize rhizosphere makes up the food web network which uses the root exudatesto regulate the diversity of microbes and activities going on in the region ( Mendes et al., 2013 ).Edited by:David Fernández Calviño,University of Vigo, Spain*Correspondence:Olubukola Oluranti Babalolaolubukola.babalola@nwu.ac.zaReceived: 11 February 2022Accepted: 24 May 2022Published: 05 July 2022Citation:Omotayo OP, Igiehon ON andBabalola OO (2022) Microbial Genes ofAgricultural Importance in MaizeRhizosphere Unveiled ThroughShotgun Metagenomics.Span.

The organisms in therhizosphere perform various activities that induce nutrientcycling, promote a healthy plant, prevent biotic and abioticstresses, and serve important functions in the developmentalprocesses and well being of plants and crops like maize(Atkinson and Watson 2000 ;Sylvia and Chellemi 2001 ;Xuet al., 2009 ;Igiehon et al., 2019 ). Some of thesemicroorganisms also act as defense for plants againstphytopathogens, enhance growth through phytohormonesproduction, and perform overall ecosystem functioning(Aremu et al., 2017 ).It is imperative to acquire better understanding of themicrobial genes that contribute to plant growth in therhizosphere. The study of these genes will help us to know theecological role which they play in the plant and the soilenvironment, realize their potential in sustainable agriculture,and also help to decipher their suitability in biotechnologicalapplications ( Li et al., 2014c ). To date, studies are being carriedout to identify and characterize microbial functional genes inagricultural soil environments, so as to unveil their input inagroecosystems ( Li H. et al., 2014 ;Akinola et al., 2020b ;Babalolaet al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, with regards to the maize rhizosphereenvironment, especially in semi-arid regions, little or no studieshave been conducted. This could be attributed to the limitationsin the use of culture dependent techniques.The emergence of high throughput sequencing methods, such asthe shotgun metagenomic approach, which are culture independenthave brought about more ef ﬁciency in analyzing variousenvironments compared to the former culturing techniques. Thisis because of the accuracy of this technique in detecting a broadrange of microbes and functional genes in a habitat ( Enagbonma andBabalola 2019 ). In addition, the shotgun metagenomic approach isnotable for eliminating the bias which may arise from using thetraditional culturing methods ( Lan et al., 2016 ).Due to the need of characterizing functional genes of vitalimportance in the maize rhizosphere, efforts were made in thisstudy to identify putative microbial genes which are bene ﬁcial tomaize production in the underexplored maize rhizosphere andbulk soils using a shotgun metagenomic approach. Genomicanalysis of these could further provide insight into thepotential novelty of the genes. Moreover, awareness of therelationship between soil microbial distribution and functionwould contribute to and help in genetic engineering. Wehypothesize that the rhizosphere soil will possess moreabundant genes than the bulk soil and there will be variationsin the gene composition of the rhizosphere soils due to differencesin the microbial community structures and soil properties.MATERIALS AND METHODSSampling Site HistoryThe selected sampling sites in Lichtenburg (25°59′40.8 ″S,26°31′46.6 ″E) and Randfontein (26°11′51.3 ″S, 27°33′18.6 ″E)are maize growing areas in South-Africa which have beenunder intensive cultivation continuously for more than10 years. They are both characterized with shrubs and grassesbeing a semi-arid region, the maize cultivar WE 3128 was plantedon both sites. The average annual temperature and rainfall isaround 16.9°C and 601 mm respectively in Lichtenburg while inRandfontein, it is around 15.3°C and 742 mm respectively. Thetype of soil found on the two farm sites can be classi ﬁed as theLuvisol type based on the World reference base for soil resourcesclassi ﬁcation ( Anjos et al., 2015 ).Sampling and Analysis of Soil PropertiesAfter careful excavation of the maize plants, the roots wereshaken by hand to remove soil loosely adhering to the roots,while the soil tightly attached to the roots was collected asrhizosphere soil. Bulk soils were collected from 0 –15 cm depth,10 m away from the cultivated area through a soil auger(Castañeda and Barbosa 2017 ;Enagbonma et al., 2019 ).Samples were collected in triplicates for both rhizosphere andbulk soils and were transported on ice (so as to preventdehydration and degradation) to the laboratory immediatelyafter collection for analysis. Soil samples were passed througha 2 mm sieve to remove unwanted particles and stored at −20°Cuntil use for downstream applications.The soil properties were measured using 20 g of air-dried soilfrom each sample, pH meter (EutechTMpH 150/Ph450 series)was used in measuring the soil pH in 1:2.5 soil water ratio(Springer 2014 ). A Gravimetric technique was used todetermine the soil moisture as described by Shukla et al.(2014) , and Morche ’s (2008) method was used to determinesulfur concentration following extraction with 0.1 Mhydrochloric acid (HCl). Total carbon and soil organic carbonwere determined using the Santi et al. (2006) method, and theWalkey-Black procedures ( Walkley and Black 1934 ) respectively.The concentration of potassium in samples was measuredfollowing extraction with 1M ammonium acetate at pH of 7.0(Jackson 1973 ). Bray and Kurtz ’sp r o t o c o l( Bray and Kurtz 1945 )was used in measuring phosphorus concentration in samples, thedescribed methods of Mussa et al. (2009) was used in determiningsoil nitrate, Potassium chloride (KCl) extraction method was usedto analyze soil nitrate and ammonium ( Reis et al., 2017 ), and theLoss-on-Ignition method was used to determine soil organic mattercontent following the procedure of Schulte and Hopkins (1996) .Molecular AnalysesFollowing manufacturer ’s protocol, QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoilIsolation Kit was used for the extraction of total DNA using 0.5 gof each soil sample. Following standard protocol, theconcentration of DNA in samples were ﬁrst examined usingthe Life Technologies Qubit®dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Nextera DNAFlex library preparation kit (Illumina) was used to prepare thelibraries using about 50 ng DNA. Simultaneous fragmentationand addition of adapter sequences were done on the extractedDNA. The ﬁnal concentrations of the prepared libraries weremeasured using the Qubit®dsDNA HS Assay Kit (LifeTechnologies), and the average library size was determinedusing the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).Spanish Journal of Soil Science | Published by Frontiers July 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 10427 2Omotayo et al. Microbial Genes in Maize RhizosphereThe libraries were pooled and diluted to 0.6 nM and sequencedpaired end for 300 cycles using the HiSeq system (Illumina).Sequencing was done at the Molecular Research Laboratory (MRDNA) LP, Shallowater Texas, USA.Metagenomics Sequence Annotation andData AnalysesUnassembled DNA sequences were annotated with theMetagenomics Rapid Annotation (MG-RAST) pipeline version3.3 following the prescribed lead of Meyer et al. (2008) . Rawsequences were uploaded to the MG-RAST online server athttps://www.mg-rast.org ( Meyer et al., 2008 ). Following qualitycontrol, sequence annotation was done using BLAT algorithmagainst the M5NR database ( Wilke et al., 2012 ) which provides anon-redundant incorporation of numerous databases such asKEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes),UniProtKB (UniProt Knowledgebase), and GenBank.Microbial taxonomic and gene pro ﬁling were performed usingthe M5NR and SEED level Subsystems respectively. BlastX withan e-value cutoff of E <1×1 0−5, the minimum identity of 60%and a maximum alignment length of 15 base pairs was used todetect hits. Data normalization was applied on the MG-RASTpipeline so as to suppress the experimental noise effect. Sequencesthat failed annotation were left out in the analysis procedures.Carbon ﬁxation, sulfur cycling, phosphorus utilization, nitrogenﬁxation, and other plant bene ﬁcial genes were categorized fromthe entire metagenomes obtained.Statistical AnalysisThe average values of the relative abundance of genes obtainedfrom the three replicate samples from each sampling site wereused for data analysis. Following normalization of the dataset,the rarefaction curve was plotted using the analysis tool in theMG-RAST server. The differences in the soil propertiesbetween the soil samples were analyzed using one-wayanalysis of variance with Tukey ’sp a i r w i s ec o m p a r i s o nt e s tfor signi ﬁcance level ( p<0.05) ( Gunsalus et al., 2016 ).Assumptions (normality and homogeneity of variance) weredetermined and met. PAST (Paleontological Statistics)statistical software version 3.2 was used to evaluate thealpha diversity indices (Evenness, Simpson and Shannonindices) and Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine thesigniﬁcance level ( Hammer et al., 2001 ). Beta diversity wasanalyzed using one-way analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) via999 permutations and further illustrated by principalcoordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Euclidean distance-matrix. ( Lee et al., 2016 ). Data representation on thePrincipal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot was done usingthe Canoco 5.12 software. Circos online software (www.circos.ca) was used in generating the chart for the geneabundance ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 ). Representation andvisualization of microbial taxonomy at the family level wascarried out with a graph made using the Microsoft Excelsoftware, version 2013. Qual ity sequences are deposited andavailable from NCBI SRA dataset under the accession numberPRJNA678469 and PRJNA678475.RESULTSPhysical and Chemical Properties of SoilAs indicated in Table 1 , the pH of R1 (Rhizosphere soil samplesfrom Randfontein) and R2 (bulk soil samples from Randfontein) are6.54 and 5.89 respectively, which differ signi ﬁcantly from that of F1(rhizosphere samples from Lichtenburg) and F2 (bulk soil samplesfrom Lichtenburg) which are 6.76 and 6.70 respectively. Sulphur andtotal carbon concentration did not differ signi ﬁcantly between R1and R2, while a signi ﬁcant difference was seen in these two betweenF1 and F2. Potassium (K), N-NO3and N-NH 4were signi ﬁcantlyhigher in the rhizosphere soils than their corresponding bulk soils.The concentration of organic carbon varied signi ﬁcantly between F1and F2, while no signi ﬁcant difference was seen between R1 and R2.No signi ﬁcant difference was seen in the moisture content across thesamples, however in the concentration of organic matter there was asigniﬁcant difference between F1 and F2, while R1 and R2 did notdiffer signi ﬁcantly. There was no signi ﬁcant variation in thephosphorus content of F1 and F2, while in R1 and R2, thesediffer signi ﬁcantly.The majority of the sequence read reached saturation, signifyingthat adequate data was obtained from the samples ( Figure 1 ). Theaverage number of sequences uploaded was 18, 942,494, 18,442,769,15,666,716, and 15,045,869 for the rhizosphere soil samples fromLichtenburg (F1), bulk soil samples from Lichtenburg (F2),rhizosphere samples collected in Randfontein (R1), and bulk soilsamples collected in Randfontein (R2) respectively. After qualitycontrol (QC), quality sequences that were retained in samples were17,309,422, 16,779,302, 14,404,078, and 13,867,146 in F1, F2, R1, andR2 respectively with GC (Guanine-Cytosine) content of 65% in F1,F2, R1, and 66% in R2. Sequences with known protein functionswere 5,391,241, 5,549,864, 4,763,335, and 4,954,381, for F1, F2, R1,and R2 respectively.Distribution of Microbial Communities inSamplesThe dominant microbial class observed in the samples includeActinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Planctomycetacia,Gemmatimonadetes, Solibacteres, Verrucomicrobiae, andBacilli ( Figure 2A ). The dominant microbial families in thesamples include Conexibacteraceae, Nitrospiraceae,Rubrobacteraceae, Nocardioidaceae, Planctomycetaceae,Nocardiaceae, Solibacteraceae, Rhizobiaceae, Burkholderiaceae,Pseudomonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae(Figure 2B ). No signi ﬁcant variation was seen in the relativeabundance of the microbes in the samples ( p>0.05).Plant Growth Promoting/Nutrient CyclingGenes Identi ﬁed in SamplesThe metagenomic sequences obtained from the samples consistof genes involved in nutrient cycling (carbon ﬁxation anddegradation, nitrogen cycling, phosphorus utilization, andsulfur cycling) and other plant bene ﬁcial genes such as thoseinvolved in siderophore production, iron acquisition, phosphateSpanish Journal of Soil Science | Published by Frontiers July 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 10427 3Omotayo et al. Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizospheresolubilization, heat and cold shock ( Figures 3 ,4A,B ). These genesaid plant growth and development and the presence of these inthe maize rhizosphere indicated their contribution to maizegrowth.Diversity Estimation of Genes in theSamplesThe alpha diversity analysis (diversity within the habitats) of themicrobial genes showed no signi ﬁcant difference ( p>0.05) in therhizosphere and bulk soil ( Figure 5 ). However, the beta diversityanalysis showed signi ﬁcant variations between the habitats ( p<0.05), this was further illustrated by the principal coordinateanalysis which shows distinct separation between the samples onthe PCoA plot ( Figure 6 ).DISCUSSIONSome classes of microbes observed in the metagenomes such asBacilli are notable for aiding plant growth ( Ali 2021 ). Theypossess genes that are of immense bene ﬁts to plants ( Li et al.,2014c ) like those involved in the process of carbon ﬁxation,nitrogen ﬁxation, sulfur cycling, phosphate solubilization, ironacquisition, siderophore production and those responsible forreducing stress from environmental factors such as extremeTABLE 1 | Showing the physical and chemical properties of soil samples.F1 F2 R1 R2Moisture (%) 8.17 ± 0.34a8.02 ± 0.17a7.17 ± 0.29a7.20 ± 0.49aPH 6.76 ± 0.28a6.70 ± 0.16a6.54 ± 0.59b5.89 ± 0.36cS (mg/kg) 5.46 ± 7.28a0.44 ± 0.62c2.56 ± 2.66b2.71 ± 3.82bTotal % C 1.34 ± 0.24b0.9 ± 0.01a1.14 ± 0.13a1.04 ± 0.18aP (mg/kg) 66.67 ± 23.70a34.01 ± 14.7a35.31 ± 2.57b11.7 ± 1.68aK (mg/kg) 243.00 ± 0.82a167.00 ± 11.63b240.00 ± 2.94a149.50 ± 34.95bN-NO 3(mg/kg) 17.09 ± 0.74a16.47 ± 0.89b8.52 ± 2.68b7.39 ± 3.98aN-NH 4(mg/kg) 3.47 ± 0.23a2.39 ± 0.33b2.91 ± 1.12b4.84 ± 1.99cOrganic Carbon (%) 0.95 ± 0.22a0.6 ± 0.01b1.09 ± 0.09a0.89 ± 0.13aOrganic Matter (%) 3.94 ± 0.37a3.25 ± 0.01b3.43 ± 0.39a2.96 ± 1.16aLegend: Values = mean ± Standard deviation ( n= 3), means within a row with different letters are signi ﬁcantly different ( p≤0.05).

Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizospheretemperatures and drought ( Akinola et al., 2020b ). Moreover,some of these microbes are able to enhance the secretion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) which in ﬂuences plantgrowth while some ( Figures 2A,B ) like Burkholderia cepaciawhich belongs to the Burkholderiaceae family contributes toplant growth indirectly by impeding plant disease andpathogens through production of siderophores and antibiotics(Kong et al., 2019 ).Although diverse kinds of genes were unmasked in themetagenomes, our study focused on those involved in carbonﬁxation and degradation, nitrogen ﬁxation, phosphorusutilization, sulfur cycling, phosphate solubilization,siderophore production, iron acquisition, and thoseresponsible for heat and cold shock which are paramountand bene ﬁcial to the growth and development of maize plantin a semi-arid region.Carbon Fixation and DegradationAmong the genes detected in this category are those which codefor Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPco/RUBISCO, which is one of the enzymes involved in Calvincycle), Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Pcc, which catalyzes thecarboxylation reaction of Propionyl CoA), and carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase (CODH, involved in the reductiveacetyl-CoA pathway in carbon cycle which allows organismsto make use of carbon monoxide as a source of energy andcarbon (IV) oxide as a source of carbon ( Li et al., 2014d )).Genes associated with Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( cbbX, cbbRm ), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase(coxF, coxG, coxM, cooC, coxE ) and Propionyl-CoAcarboxylase ( pccB, pccX ) were seen to be more abundant inthe rhizosphere soil samples (F1 and R1) than the bulk soils(Figures 3 ,4A). In the rhizosphere samples, it howeverpredominates F1 than R1 signifying a higher capacity forcarbon ﬁxation in this sample ( Figures 3 ,4A)(Li et al., 2014c ).Mechanisms of carbon ﬁxation have been identi ﬁed in the past indifferent species of Rhodobacteraceae ( Rhodobacter sphaeroides ,Rhodobacteraceae bacterium KLH11) ,Thermoproteaceae(Thermoproteus tenax), Thermococcaceae ( Thermococcusonnurineus ),Halobacteriaceae (Haloquadratum walsbyi),Pseudomonadaceae, and Vibrionaceae ,(Dijkhuizen andHarder 1984 ;Berg et al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2014c ;Pujalte et al.,2014 ), therefore the prevalence of these organisms in F1(Figure 2B ) justi ﬁes the abundance of these genes observed inthe sample.Phosphorus UtilizationAs shown in Figures 3 ,4A, Genes associated with inorganicpolyphosphate degradation ( ppx, ppgk ), polyphosphatebiosynthesis ( pgk 1, ppk, thiD ), dephospho-coenzyme Akinase (dpck), which catalyzes the ATP-dependentphosphorylation of dephospho-CoA in the biosynthesis ofcoenzyme A (CoA) were well represented in all the samples.The prevalence of these genes in F1 can be linked with theprevalence of Thermococcaceae, Rhizobiaceaea in this than R1(Schut et al., 2014 ;B e c h t a o u ie ta l . ,2 0 1 9 ;Shimosaka et al., 2019 ).Also, the prevalence of ppx and ppgk in F1 suggests an intensepolyphosphate transformation and more abundance ofinorganic phosphorus ( Li et al., 2014c )i nt h es a m p l e .Bacillariaceae was seen to predominate F1 rather than R1,some species of this bacteria family like the Bacillus cereusare known to be active in phosphorus metabolism. Bacilluscereus secretes different phospholipases which helps inphosphate retrieval metabolisms, it has been noted also forits ability to produce polyphosp hate through the biodegradationof the herbicide glyphosate ( Guddal et al., 1989 ;Acosta-Cortéset al., 2019 ).Sulfur CyclingThe occurrence of siRA,suoX ,papsS1 , and dsrAB in the studiedenvironments signi ﬁes the presence of microbes capable ofmetabolizing sulfur. siRA, genes were profound in F1 thanother samples, thus indicating a high rate of sulfurtransformation in F1 than R1 and other samples ( Li et al.,2014c ). Contrarily, genes involved with Sul ﬁte oxidase andSulﬁte reductase for oxidation and reduction of sulfur such asthesuoX, papsS1 anddsrAB were more dominant in the R1 thanF1 samples ( Figure 4A ).Nitrogen FixationGenes involved in nitrogen ﬁxation like the nitrite and nitratereductase genes ( nifN, nifA ,nirD,napH ,napC ,napF ) and thoseresponsible for nitrite and glutamase transport ( nirC,gltkandgltj), nitric and nitrous oxide ( norQ and nosX ), as well as thenirM, nirH, nirL were also revealed in the metagenomes ( Figures3,4A). This can be af ﬁliated with the occurrence ofRhodobacteraceae, Rhizobiaceae, Nitrospiraceae,Methanocellaceae, and Burkholderiaceae in the samples(Figure 2B ). Species of these bacteria families such asBurkholderia vietnamiensis , Burkholderia cepacia ,Agrobacterium fabrum (strain C58 ), Bradyrhizobiumdiazoef ﬁciens (strain JCM 10833 )Azotobacter vinelandii , andKlebsiella pneumoniae are associated with nitrogen ﬁxation.The richness of F1 in nifH andnodA genes could be linked tothe abundance of Rhizobiaceae, Burkholderiaceae in this sampleas some species of this bacteria family like the Rhizobiumleguminosarum, Paraburkholderia xenovorans, Cupriavidusbasilensis, Cupriavidus necator are known for ﬁxing nitrogenFIGURE 3 | Plant bene ﬁcial genes in the maize rhizosphere and bulk soilsamples.

Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizosphere(Bournaud et al., 2017 ;da Silva et al., 2012 ;Estrada-de los Santoset al., 2011 ).Genes Involved in Phosphate Solubilization,Heat Shock, Cold Shock, ACC Deaminase,and Siderophore ProductionFurthermore, the metagenomes contain genes pqqABCDEFand gcd which play active roles in the biosynthesis ofpyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and transformation ofinsoluble phosphate to dissol ved phosphate (soil phosphatesolubilization), thus making it available for plant use ( Otienoet al., 2015 ). According to Li L. et al. (2014) the abovementioned genes perform important roles in plant growthand biocontrol of crown gall disease caused by Agrobacteriumtumefaciens.Phosphate limitation in the soil triggers theautophosphorylation of histidine residue on sensory kinase,thus the presence of phoH and phoU complex which isinvolved in response to phosphate starvation and transportFIGURE 4 | (A) Functional microbial genes in maize rhizosphere and its bulk soil.

Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizospherehelps to control the metabolism and uptake of phosphate inresponse to phosphate limitation to active target sites ( Akinolaet al., 2020a ). Occurrence of phoHU genes in all the metagenomesshows the ability of the resident soil microbes in enhancinglimited soil phosphate. This is in line with the study of Myoet al. (2019) which showed that the effect of Streptomyces lividansTK24 in reshaping phosphate limited soil was as a result of thephocomplex possessed by the organism. The occurrence of highafﬁnity phosphate transporter pstA gene was also discovered inthe metagenome.Another hormone which is signi ﬁcant and essential for propergrowth in plants is the Indoleacetic acid (IAA) ( Myo et al., 2019 ).The ppdC and ipdC genes which code for phenylpyruvatedecarboxylase and Indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase which arethe enzymes that produce Indole acetic acid from tryptophan(Jijón-Moreno et al., 2015 ) were found in the soil samples. Indoleacetic acid assists in modulating numerous physiologicalprocesses like cell division, geotropisms, phototropism, rootinitiation, apical dominance and growth rate in plants ( Singhand Dubey 2018 ;Carrión et al., 2019 ). The occurrence of the ipdCgenes in the metagenomes can be associated with Enterobactercloacae , a species of the Enterobacteriaceae family which occurredin the samples.In the relationship between plant and bacteria, ACCdeaminase reduces plant ethylenes notable for hinderingthe nodulation process ( Kang et al., 2019 ). Genes thatencode for ACC deaminase enzymes such as rimM werefound more in the rhizosphere than bulk soil samples, thisagrees with previous ﬁndings in which abundance of this genewas discovered in the rhizosphere than the bulk soil ( Li et al.,2014c ;Franco 2015 ).Furthermore, stress alleviating genes such as the cspA, cspB,cspC, cspD, cspE, cspF, cspI, responsible for reducing cold-shockand groES, grpE, yegD, yciM, dnaJ which mitigates heat-shockwere also discovered with more abundance in the rhizospheresoils. The higher abundance of heat shock genes in R1 shows thatits microbiota demonstrates higher resistance to heat and stresscaused as a result of drought. Drought is a major abiotic stress forplant especially in dry/arid regions like South Africa, it reducesplants potentials for growth and productivity ( Nicolaes et al.,FIGURE 5 | Alpha diversity indices of nutrient cycling genes in samples. F1 = maize rhizosphere samples from Lichtenburg, F2 = bulk soil samples fromLichtenburg, R1 = Rhizosphere soil samples from Randfontein, R2 = bulk soil samples from Randfontein.Spanish Journal of Soil Science | Published by Frontiers July 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 10427 8Omotayo et al. Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizosphere2014 ;Aydin et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the higher abundance of coldshock genes observed in the F1 than R1 sample shows the higherability of its inherent microorganisms in cushioning plantsagainst the harsh effect of downshift in temperature, thusaiding plant cells to adapt ( Keto-Timonen et al., 2016 ). Theoccurrence of these stress reducing genes in our metagenomesshows the potentials of the sampling sites in reducing/alleviatingthe threat posed by heat and cold stress on plant/crop.The fhuA gene which is a Ferrichrome-iron receptor inEscherichia coli and also a family of outer membraneproteins was seen in the samples. This gene together with theTonB-ExbB-ExbD which are the energy transducing complex ofthe cytoplasmic membrane ar e important in mediating theactive transport of vitamin B12,siderophores and hemeacross the outer membrane of bacteria (especially gram-negative bacteria) ( Zeng et al., 2013 ). In addition, the fhuAgene acts as a receptor for numerous bacteriophages, antibioticsand toxins which are harmful to bacterial cells. Rhizobiumleguminosarum which belongs to the Alphaproteobacteriaclass are known to possess this gene ( Carson et al., 2000 ;Akinola et al., 2020b ), therefore the greater abundance of thisclass of bacteria in F1 than R1 and other samples, can beassociated with the larger abundance of this gene in F1 thanother samples.ThesbnF andsbnC genes are important in staphyloferrin Bbiosynthesis and are both associated with Staphylococcusaureus. The sbnF catalyzes the condensation of L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (L-Dap) and citryl-diaminoethane toform L-2,3-diaminopropionyl-c itryl-diaminoethane while thesbnC catalyzes the condensation of L-2,3-diaminopropionyl-citryl-diaminoethane and 2-oxoglutarate to formstaphyloferrin B. The prevalence of these genes in F1 thanR1 can be linked to the prevalence of Bacilli in this sample,since Staphylococcus aureus b e l o n g st ot h i sb a c t e r i ac l a s s(Barka et al., 2016 )Environmental variables such as pH and the concentrationof phosphorus, sulfur, total carbon and potassium, explainsthe distribution of plant bene ﬁcial microbes with plant growthpromoting/bene ﬁcial genes in soil samples ( Finn et al., 2020 ).As seen in this study, there were differences in the pH valuesFIGURE 6 | Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) depicting the beta diversity in samples. F1 = maize rhizosphere samples from Lichtenburg, F2 = bulk soil sample sfrom Lichtenburg, R1 = Rhizosphere soil samples from Randfontein, R2 = bulk soil samples from Randfontein.Spanish Journal of Soil Science | Published by Frontiers July 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 10427 9Omotayo et al. Microbial Genes in Maize Rhizosphereo fF 1 ,F 2 ,R 1 ,a n dR 2( Table 1 ), sulfur concentrations variedsigni ﬁcantly between F1 and F2, phosphorus differsigni ﬁcantly between R1 and R2, while between F1 and F2,signi ﬁcant difference was seen in potassium concentrationand also between R1 and R2. The concentration of N-NO 3inthe rhizosphere soils (8.52 and 17.09 in R1 and F1respectively) showed that the biological processes whichoccur in these region are capable of improving growth inmaize ( Tale and Ingole 2015 ).The substantial concentration of phosphorus and potassiumin the rhizosphere samples indicated that immense physiologicalprocesses that are vital in the metabolism and biosynthesis of vitalnutrients necessary for optimum growth in plants occur in theirenvironments ( Peralta et al., 2013 ;Akinola et al., 2020a ).The dissimilarities observed in the rhizosphere samplesexamined in this study could be linked to the peculiarities ofthe sampling location. Lichtenburg, where the F1 samples werecollected is an agricultural area, while Randfontein, where R1samples were collected comprises engineering industries and agold mine. Thus, waste and residues such as heavy metals couldhave in ﬁltrated into the soil, therefore, altering thephysicochemical properties, community structure, anddiversity of the soil microbes. Uranium extracted from goldores is known for negatively impacting the soil microbialcommunity structure and affecting genes such as thoseresponsible for carbon and nitrogen cycling as seen in thisstudy ( Sutcliffe et al., 2017 ). Chromium is another metalassociated with gold mines and has been known to alter thesoil’s bacterial diversity ( He et al., 2016 ). These heavy metalsaffect the soil microorganisms and interfere with soil microbialmetabolisms.The knowledge of soil microbial metabolisms is important inunderstanding interactions which enhance the ecosystem andimprove plant growth and production ( Jiménez et al., 2016 ;Igiehon and Babalola 2017 ;Enagbonma and Babalola 2020 ).This study revealed an ecologically diverse microbiome withnutrient cycling/plant growth-promoting traits. In themetagenomic reads, microbes such as Rhizobiaceae,Burkholderiaceae, Frankiaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae,Vibrionaceae were discovered .Certain strains of these bacteriafamilies harbor genes which carry out nitrogen ﬁxation, sulfurcycling, production of phytohormones (such as cytokinins,auxins, and gibberellins which help plants in nutrient uptake),inhibition of harmful pathogens and other growth anddevelopment processes in plants ( Li et al., 2014d ;Omotayoet al., 2019 ).The alpha diversity indices showed that the microbial genesdid not differ signi ﬁcantly within the habitats as revealed byKruskal-Wallis test ( p=0.99). However, signi ﬁcant variation(p= 0.01) was seen in the beta diversity analysis which wasdetermined using analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) .This wasfurther illustrated on the principal coordinate plot ( Figure 6 )on which there was a distinct separation between the soilsamples. The strength of the separation (R) is 0.58, whichdepicts a clear difference between the samples. A notabledistance was seen between the two rhizosphere soils (F1and R1) which were also clearly distinguished from theircorresponding bulk soils. The distance between eachsample as revealed by the PCoA plot with a cumulativevariation of 97.35% between the two axes ( Figure 6 )showed that the metagenomes are distinctly different ingenetic structure.The metadata obtained from this study showed and supportsthe notion that maize rhizosphere is a hotspot of genesaccountable for converting labi le and organic carbon, sulfur,nitrogen, and phosphorus compounds ( Li et al., 2014c ;Omotayo and Babalola 2020 ;Omotayo et al., 2021 ). This canbe linked to the release of root exudates into the rhizosphere, asthese rhizodeposits have a major in ﬂuence on the rhizospheremicrobiome, thus impacting its microbial diversity andfunctional pro ﬁle, consequently affecting the microbial genes(Hu et al., 2018 ). Root exudates also possess the capacity toenhance latent soil organisms and activate their potentials. Awide range of compounds such as amino acids, lipids, andenzymes are present in the root exudates which in ﬂuencesthe availability and wealth of potent genes in this region ( Huet al., 2018 ).More potential to catabolize complex aromatic compoundswas shown in the rhizosphere soils, especially R1 due to theabundance of Pseudomonadaceae in this sample ( Jiménezet al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2014c ). Strains of bacteria belonging tothis family such as the P. putida KT2440, P. putida CSV86 areknown for its ability to colonize the rhizosphere of variousplants and degrade aromatic compounds ( Basu et al., 2006 ;Jiménez et al., 2010 ).CONCLUSIONThe complex relationship that exists between the root and soilmicroorganisms propels the processes that occur within therhizosphere. This study unveiled genes that express proteinproducts needed for metabolizing carbon, nitrogen,phosphorus, iron, and sulfur. Other genes that perform crucialroles in phosphate solubilization, stress resistance, ironacquisition, heat, and cold shock were also discovered in therhizosphere metagenomes. The distribution of the functionalgenes in the soil microbiomes considered in this study showedthat variation exists between maize rhizospheres, which could beattributed to differences in the microbial structure which couldhave been in ﬂuenced by the varying soil nutrient and majorly theroot exudates. The abundance of genes vital for plant growth andproduction in the maize rhizosphere portrays this region to beendowed with microbes applicable as inoculants and inbiofertilizer development, hence isolation of the microbeswhich possess these bene ﬁcial genes is hereby recommendeddue to their potential for improving soil quality, plant growth,and crop production.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe datasets presented in this study can be found in onlinerepositories.
