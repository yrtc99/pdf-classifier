IntroductionRice  paddy  contributes  toward  the  emissions  of  the  mostimportant  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  responsible  for  globalwarming:  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2),  methane  (CH 4)  and  nitrous  oxide(N2O).  Soil  is  one  of  the  important  sources  and  sinks  for  GHGs  thatcause  global  warming  and  climate  change  (Janseens  et  al.,  2003 ).Soil  contributes  about  20%  to  the  total  emission  of  CO2through  soiland  root  respiration,  12%  of  CH4and  60%  of  anthropogenic  N2Oemissions  (IPCC,  2007 ).  Global  warming  may  affect  the  globalcarbon  cycle,  thereby  distorting  the  structure  and  functions  ofecosystems.  Organic  matter  concentration,  which  is  quite  low(<1.0%)  in  tropical  soils,  would  become  still  lower  and  climaticchange  may  also  affect  its  quality  (Smith  et  al.,  2008 ).  Soil  biologyand  microbial  populations  are  expected  to  change  with  changes  inclimatic  conditions  (Baker,  2004 ).  Currently,  biotic  carbonsequestration  is  being  considered  a  viable  option  for  mitigatingcarbon  emissions  in  the  form  of  CO2and  CH4to  the  atmosphere.Agricultural  activities  have  profound  short-  and  long-terminﬂuence  on  soil  organic  carbon  (SOC).  Mitigation  of  CO2emissionfrom  agriculture  can  be  achieved  by  increasing  carbon  sequestra-tion  in  the  soil,  which  implies  storage  of  carbon  as  soil  organicmatter  (Lal,  2004 ).  Judicious  nutrient  management  is  crucial  to  SOCsequestration  in  tropical  soils  (Bhattacharyya  et  al.,  2007 ).Adequate  supply  of  nutrients  in  the  soil  can  enhance  biomassproduction  and  SOC  content  (Van  Kessel  and  Hartley,  2000 ).Attainable  carbon  sequestration  is  essentially  limited  by  thequantity  of  carbon  input  into  the  soil  system.  The  estimatedpotential  of  agricultural  intensiﬁcation  on  SOC  sequestration  inIndian  soils  ranges  between  12.7  and  16.5  Tg  carbon  year/C01(Lal,2003 ).  A  recent  report  by  Benbi  and  Chand  (2007)  describesincreased  productivity  under  improved  SOC  density  (SOC  contentin  the  0–15  cm  soil  volume)  in  the  0–15  cm  soil  layer.  There  is  astrong  need  to  increase  SOC  density  to  improve  the  quality  ofnatural  resources  for  sustainable  crop  productivity  and  to  mitigateglobal  warming.  However,  with  the  rapid  economic  and  socialdevelopment,  tropical  paddy  soils  are  subject  to  degradation  ascharacterized  by  low  organic  carbon  content  and  low  cropproductivity.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  investigate  soil  carbondioxide  (CO 2)  evolution  from  paddy  soils  to  better  understand  themechanisms  that  regulate  carbon  storage  and  loss  in  extensivelycultivated  paddy  ﬁelds.  Furthermore,  the  effects  of  nitrogenfertilization  and  rice  growth  on  variation  in  CO2emission  underanaerobic  conditions  from  paddy  soils  needs  to  be  betterunderstood.  Many  studies  reported  that  the  application  ofSoil  &  Tillage  Research  124  (2012)  119–130A  R  T  I  C  L  E  I  N  F  OArticle  history:Received  17  April  2012Received  in  revised  form  21  May  2012Accepted  22  May  2012Keywords:Green  house  gasesCarbon  storageRice  soilSoil  carbon  fractionsSoil  enzymes  and  microbial  populationA  B  S  T  R  A  C  TEffects  of  four  years  of  inorganic  and  organic  nitrogen  (N)  management  on  the  emission  of  three  majorgreenhouse  gases  (GHGs):  methane  (CH 4),  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2)  and  nitrous  oxide  (N2O),  and  on  soillabile  carbon  fractions  such  as  water-soluble  carbon  (C,  WSC),  microbial  biomass  carbon  (MBC),  KMnO 4oxidizable  organic  carbon  (KMnO 4-C),  carbon  management  index  (CMI)  and  soil  carbon  storage  wereinvestigated  in  a  ﬂooded  rice  (Oryza  sativa  L.)  ﬁeld  in  India.  The  treatments  included  an  unfertilizedcontrol,  inorganic  nitrogen  fertilizer,  rice  straw  +  inorganic  nitrogen  fertilizer  and  rice  straw  +  greenmanure.  Maximum  global  warming  potential  (GWP)  (10,188  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01)  was  determinedfor  the  combined  application  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure.  Total  carbon  content  and  carbon  storage  inthe  topsoil  were  signiﬁcantly  increased  for  the  rice  straw  +  inorganic  nitrogen  fertilizer  treatment.  Thecombined  application  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure  was  more  effective  in  increasing  WSC,  MBC,KMnO 4-C  concentrations  and  CMI  than  the  inorganic  fertilizer  treatments,  although  it  increased  gaseouscarbon  emission.  The  combined  application  of  rice  straw  and  an  inorganic  fertilizer  was  most  effective  insequestrating  soil  organic  carbon  (1.39  Mg  ha/C01),  resulting  in  a  higher  grain  yield.  Therefore,  it  could  bethe  best  option  for  improving  productivity  and  carbon  storage  in  the  rice–rice  cropping  system./C223  2012  Elsevier  B.V.

The  application  of  straw  in  combination  withinorganic  fertilizer  is  an  attractive  alternative  to  burning  becauseit  can  provide  essential  nutrients  for  crops  (Edmeades,  2003 ),  whilereducing  carbon  release  to  the  atmosphere.  To  realize  the  vast  SOCsequestration  potential  for  national  beneﬁt,  adoption  of  recom-mended  management  practices,  including  the  integrated  use  oforganic  and  inorganic  fertilizer,  is  necessary.  The  main  focusshould  be  on  GHG  ﬂuxes  in  relation  to  fertilizer  managementpractices.  The  present  investigation  was  conducted:  (a)  to  estimateGHG  emissions  in  the  form  of  CH4,  CO2,  N2O  and  global  warmingpotential  (GWP)  from  soils  in  a  rice–rice  ecosystem  using  fertilizerapplications,  (b)  to  estimate  soil  carbon  pool,  carbon  storage  andmicrobial  activity  in  relation  to  GHG  emissions  and  (c)  to  identifythe  most  adoptable  treatment  that  offers  high  SOC  storage,increased  yield  and  the  lowest  GHG  emission.2.  Materials  and  methods2.1.  Experimental  siteThe  study  site  is  situated  in  the  experimental  farm  of  the  CentralRice  Research  Institute,  Cuttack  (20 8250N,  858550E;  24  m  abovemean  sea  level)  in  the  eastern  part  of  India.  The  climate  is  basicallytropical.  The  mean  annual  precipitation  is  around  1500  mm.  Thesoil  is  an  Aeric  Endoaquept  with  sandy  clay  loam  texture  (25.9%clay,  21.6%  silt,  52.5%  sand),  bulk  density  1.41  Mg  m/C03,  percolationrate  <  10  mm  d/C01,  pH  (H2O)  6.16,  cation  exchange  capacity15  c  mol  (p+)  kg/C01,  electrical  conductivity  0.5  dS  m/C01,  total  carbon0.49%,  total  nitrogen  0.049%,  Olsen  extractable  P  18  mg  kg/C01andavailable  K  286  mg  kg/C01.2.2.  Crop  establishment  and  treatmentsThe  ﬁeld  experiment  was  carried  out  for  four  years  (2008–2011kharif  season,  July–November  in  each  year)  under  rice  paddycultivation.  The  ﬁeld  was  ploughed  thoroughly  and  ﬂooded  2–3days  before  transplanting  for  puddling  and  leveling.  Sesbaniaaculeata  (Table  1)  (green  manure)  and  rice  straw  (Table  1)  wereincorporated  in  the  ﬁeld.  The  ﬁeld  was  plowed  by  moldboardplough  to  20  cm  depth,  puddled  thoroughly  and  leveled  before  thestarting  of  the  cropping  period.  Twenty-ﬁve  days’  old  rice  seedlings(cv.  Gayatri ,  crop  cycle  of  155  days)  were  transplanted  at  a  spacingof  20  cm  /C2  15  cm  with  one  seedling  assigned  to  each  hill.  Urea  wasapplied  as  three  split  doses:  in  basal  application,  in  maximumtillering  and  in  the  panicle  initiation  stage  of  crop  development.The  treatment  plots  were  laid  out  in  a  randomized  block  designwith  three  replications  for  each  treatment  plot.  All  the  ﬁeld  plotsremained  continuously  ﬂooded  to  a  water  depth  of  6  /C6  2  cm  duringthe  entire  period  of  crop  growth  and  were  drained  12  days  before  theharvest.  The  crop  was  raised  as  per  the  locally  recommendedagronomic  practices  except  for  the  fertilization,  which  was  done  asper  the  treatments.  The  treatments  in  rice  included:T1–  Control  (without  any  fertilizers  or  organic  amendments);T2–  Urea  (60  kg  nitrogen  ha/C01);T3–  Rice  straw  +  urea  (1:1  nitrogen  basis)  (30  kg  nitrogen  ha/C01+  30  kg  nitrogen  ha/C01);T4–  Rice  straw  +  green  manure  [Sesbania  aculeata ]  (1:1  nitrogenbasis)  (30  kg  nitrogen  ha/C01+  30  kg  nitrogen  ha/C01).2.3.  Soil  sampling  and  storageSoil  samples  were  collected  at  different  crop  growth  stages  ofthe  rice  crop  by  a  sample  probe  from  depths  of  0–15,  15–30,  30–45and  45–60  cm.  Individual  soil  cores  were  taken  at  four  differentgrowth  stages:  maximum  tillering  (50  days  after  transplanting),panicle  initiation  (75  days  after  transplanting),  grain  ﬁlling  (102days  after  transplanting)  and  harvest  (126  days  after  transplant-ing).  Sampling  was  done  with  a  sample  probe  from  ﬁve  differentplaces  within  individual  replicated  plots  (three  replicated  plots  in  arandomized  block  design  for  each  treatment)  and  these  ﬁvesamples  were  mixed  together  to  prepare  a  composite  sample  forthe  plot.  All  the  samples  were  collected  from  in  between  theplanted  rows  for  better  comparison.  Immediately  after  sampling,excess  water  was  allowed  to  drain  off,  visible  root  fragments  andstones  removed  manually  and  transferred  to  the  laboratory  foranalyses.  Moisture  content  of  individual  samples  was  determinedgravimetrically  in  10  g  portions  after  drying  at  105  8C  for  48  h.  Thefresh  soil  samples  were  kept  in  the  refrigerator  at  4  8C  forbiochemical  and  microbial  population  analyses.  The  fresh  soil  wasair-dried  for  7  days,  sieved  through  a  2  mm  mesh,  mixed  andstored  in  sealed  plastic  jars  for  analyses  of  soil  carbon  and  nitrogenfractions.2.4.  Soil  carbon  fraction  analysisSoil  microbial  biomass  carbon  (MBC)  was  measured  by  using  amodiﬁed  chloroform  fumigation–extraction  method  with  fumiga-tion  at  atmospheric  pressure  (Witt  et  al.,  2000a ).  Readilymineralizable  carbon  (RMC)  content  of  the  soil  samples  wasestimated  after  extraction  with  0.5  M  K2SO4(Inubushi  et  al.,  1991 ),followed  by  wet  digestion  of  the  soil  extract  with  dichromate(Vance  et  al.,  1987 ).  Oxidizable  organic  carbon  was  estimated  bydichromate  digestion  of  the  soil  (Walkley  and  Black,  1934 ).  Acidhydrolyzable  carbohydrate  carbon  (AHC)  was  measured  by  takingthe  equivalent  weight  of  2  g  of  soil  extracted  with  20  ml  of  1.5  Msulfuric  acid  (H2SO4)  (Angers  and  Mehuys,  1989 )  for  24  h  withregular  shaking  and  ﬁltered  through  glass  ﬁber  ﬁlters  (WhatmanGF/C).  The  carbohydrate  content  of  the  extracts  was  determined  byusing  the  anthrone  method  (Yoshida  et  al.,  1976 ).  Water  solublecarbohydrate  carbon  (WSC)  content  was  estimated  by  followingthe  procedure  of  Haynes  and  Swift  (1990) .  Permanganateoxidizable  carbon  (KMnO 4-C)  was  determined  by  following  themethod  described  by  Blair  et  al.  (1995)  with  a  few  modiﬁcations.Dry  soil  (3  g)  was  weighed  into  50  ml  centrifuge  tubes  and  30  ml  of20  mM  KMnO 4was  added.  The  centrifuge  tubes  were  shaken  for15  min  and  centrifuged  for  5  min  at  2000  rpm.  The  absorbance  ofthe  supernatant  and  standards  was  read  at  565  nm.  The  change  inthe  concentration  of  KMnO 4was  used  to  estimate  the  amount  ofcarbon  oxidized;  assuming  that  1  mM  KMnO 4is  consumed  in  theoxidation  of  0.75  mM  or  9  g  of  carbon.  Ammonium-nitrogen  (NH 4+-N)  in  the  soil  extract  was  estimated  by  Nesslerization  (Jackson,  1973 )and  nitrate-nitrogen  (NO 3/C0-N)  by  using  the  2,4-phenol  disulphonicTable  1Composition  of  different  organic  amendments  and  initial  soil  samples  before  adding  treatments  (dry  weight  basis).Organic  amendments  Carbon  (g  kg/C01)  Nitrogen  (g  kg/C01)  Carbon:nitrogen  Phosphorous  (P)  (g  kg/C01)  Potassium  (K)  (g  kg/C01)Green  manure  (Sesbania  aculeata )  370  25.5  14.5  2.2  23.5Rice  straw  383  6.2  61.7  1.4  19.4Initial  soil  4.9  0.49  10.1  0.018  0.286P.

Ninhydrin-reactive  nitrogen  (NRN)  in20-g  soil  samples  was  extracted  with  0.5  M  potassium  sulfate(K2SO4)  and  estimated  colorimetrically  after  mixing  the  soil  extractswith  ninhydrin  (Badalucco  et  al.,  1992 ).  Total  carbon  (TC)  and  totalnitrogen  contents  were  estimated  by  dry  combustion  in  a  carbon–hydrogen–nitrogen  analyzer  (CHN  analyzer)  (FLASH  2000  OrganicElemental  analyzer,  M/S  Thermo  Scientiﬁc).2.5.  Soil  carbon  storage,  carbon  management  index  (CMI)  analysisCarbon  storage  was  calculated  in  terms  of  the  increase  in  carbonstock  in  soil.  Data  on  initial  and  ﬁnal  organic  carbon  concentrationsin  the  urea,  rice  straw  +  urea,  rice  straw  +  green  manure  andunfertilized  (control)  treatments  were  collected.  The  mass  of  SOCin  the  soil  was  calculated  as  described  by  Pathak  et  al.  (2011)MSOC  =  SOC  /C2  BD  /C2  T;  where  MSOC  is  the  mass  of  total  carbon(Mg  ha/C01),  SOC  is  the  change  in  percentage  of  total  carbonconcentration  in  soil  in  a  given  period  of  time,  BD  is  bulk  density(Mg  m/C03)  and  T  is  the  thickness  of  the  soil  layer  (cm).  Carbonmanagement  index  (CMI)  was  calculated  for  each  treatment  byusing  a  reference  sample  value  according  to  the  method  of  Blairet  al.  (1995) .  The  mean  of  the  three  control  samples  (unfertilizedcontrol  plot)  was  used  as  the  reference  in  the  experiment  (Gonget  al.,  2009 ).  Based  on  changes  in  the  total  carbon  content  betweenthe  reference  and  sample  sites,  a  carbon  pool  index  (CPI)  wascalculated  as  follows  as  described  by  Lou  et  al.  (2011) :CPI  =  [sample  TC/TC  of  reference  soil];  based  on  the  changes  inthe  C  lability  (L)  =  [(KMnO 4-C/(TC  /C0  KMnO 4-C)]  the  lability  indexwas  determined  as:  LI  =  [sample  L/reference  L]  and  CMI  =[CPI  /C2  LI  /C2  100].2.6.  Soil  enzymatic  activities  and  microbial  populationsDehydrogenase  activity  was  determined  by  the  reduction  of2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium  chloride  (TTC)  (Casida  et  al.,  1964 ).Fluorescein  diacetate  (FDA)  hydrolysis  activity  measurementswere  made  by  following  the  method  of  Adam  and  Duncan  (2001) .b-Glucosidase  activity  was  assayed  by  following  the  procedure  ofEivazi  and  Tabatabai  (1988) .  Urease  activity  was  measured  byfollowing  the  method  of  Tabatabai  and  Bremner  (1972) .  Five  gramsof  soil  were  incubated  with  5  ml  of  0.05  M  tris  (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane  (THAM)  buffer  (pH  9.0)  and  1  ml  of  0.2%  of  ureasolution  at  37  8C  for  2  h.  Excess  urea  was  extracted  with  apotassium  chloride-phenyl  mercuric  acetate  (KCl–PMA)  solutionand  estimated  colorimetrically  at  527  nm.  Heterotrophic  microbialpopulations  were  cultured  by  using  the  media  of  Rand  et  al.  (1975) .The  methanogenic  bacterial  population  was  enumerated  by  usingthe  anaerobic  culture  tube  technique  (Kasper  and  Tiedje,  1982 ).Culturable  NH 4+and  NO 2/C0-oxidizing  autotrophs  were  enumeratedby  following  the  most  probable  number  (MPN)  method  (Schmidtand  Belser,  1982 ).  Populations  of  denitrifying  bacteria  wereestimated  by  method  of  Abd-el-Malek  et  al.  (1974) .2.7.  Methane  and  nitrous  oxide  ﬂux  measurementsMethane  and  nitrous  oxide  ﬂux  from  the  rice  ﬁeld  plots  wasmonitored  by  using  the  manual  closed  chamber  method  (Dattaet  al.,  2009 ).  Sampling  for  CH4and  N2O  ﬂux  measurements  wasdone  from  all  the  replicated  plots  in  the  morning  (09:00–09:30  h)and  afternoon  (15:00–15:30  h),  and  the  average  of  the  morningand  afternoon  ﬂuxes  was  used  as  the  ﬂux  for  the  day.  The  gassamplings  were  done  soon  after  the  transplanting  of  the  rice  cropat  closed  intervals  throughout  the  cropping  season.  The  samplingswere  done  at  3,  7,  17,  21,  26,  33,  38,  42,  47,  54,  58,  62,  69,  76,  81,  88,95,  102,  107,  112,  118,  123  and  128  days  after  transplanting  (DATs)of  the  rice  crop.  The  sampling  days  encompassed  the  greenhousegas  ﬂuxes  from  ﬂooded  rice  paddy  starting  from  initial  growthphase  of  the  crop  to  its  vegetative,  reproductive  phase  till  itsphysiological  maturity  during  the  cropping  season.  For  measuringCH4and  N2O  emissions,  six  rice  hills  were  covered  with  a  locallyfabricated  Perspex  chamber  (53  cm  /C2  37  cm  /C2  51  cm,  length  /C2width  /C2  height  from  seedling  to  tillering,  and  53  cm  /C237  cm  /C2  71  cm,  length  /C2  width  /C2  height  from  maximum  tilleringto  maturity  stages).  A  battery-operated  air  circulation  pump  withan  air  displacement  of  1.5  L  min/C01(M/s  Aerovironment  Inc.,Monrovia,  CA,  USA)  and  connected  to  polyethylene  tubing  wasused  to  mix  the  air  inside  the  chamber  and  draw  the  air  samplesinto  Tedlar  gas-sampling  bags  (M/s  Aerovironment  Inc.)  at  ﬁxedintervals  of  0,  15  and  30  min.  Gas  samples  from  the  sampling  bagswere  analyzed  for  CH4by  gas  chromatography.  Methane  con-centrations  in  the  air  samples  collected  from  the  crop  canopy  wereanalyzed  in  a  Chemito  2000  gas  chromatograph  (M/s  ThermoScientiﬁc)  equipped  with  a  ﬂame  ionization  detector  (FID)  andPorapak  Q  column  (6  feet  long,  1/8  inch  outer  diameter,  80/100mesh  size,  stainless  steel  column).  The  temperature  of  the  injector,column  and  detector  was  maintained  at  150,  50  and  230  8C,respectively.  The  carrier  gas  (nitrogen)  ﬂow  was  maintained  at15  ml  min/C01.  The  gas  chromatograph  was  calibrated  before  andafter  each  set  of  measurements  by  using  5.38,  9.03  and10.8  mL  CH4L/C01in  N2(Scotty  II  analyzed  gases,  M/s  Altechassociates  Inc.,  USA)  as  the  primary  standard  and  1.95  mL  L/C01inair  as  the  secondary  standard  to  provide  a  standard  curve  that  waslinear  over  the  concentration  range  used  in  this  study.  N2Oconcentrations  in  the  air  samples  collected  in  the  Tedlar  samplingbags  were  analyzed  in  a  Chemito  2000  gas  chromatograph  (M/sThermo  Scientiﬁc)  equipped  with  an  electron  capture  detector(ECD)  and  a  Porapak  Q  column  (6  feet  long,  1/8  inch  outerdiameter,  80/100  mesh,  stainless  steel  column).  The  injector,column  and  detector  were  maintained  at  200,  60  and  340  8C,respectively,  and  the  carrier  gas  (nitrogen)  ﬂow  was  maintained  at15  ml  min/C01.  The  gas  chromatograph  was  calibrated  before  andafter  each  set  of  measurements  by  using  100  parts  per  billion  (ppb)N2O  in  N2(Scotty  II  analyzed  gases,  M/s  Altech  Associates  Inc.,  USA)as  the  primary  standard  and  316  ppb  N2O  in  N2(National  PhysicalLaboratory,  New  Delhi)  as  the  secondary  standard.  Fluxes  of  CH4and  N2O  were  calculated  by  successive  linear  interpolation  of  theaverage  emissions  on  the  sampling  days,  assuming  that  theemissions  followed  a  linear  trend  during  the  periods  when  nosampling  was  done  (Datta  et  al.,  2009 ).  Cumulative  CH4and  N2Oemissions  for  the  entire  cropping  period  were  computed  byplotting  the  ﬂux  values  against  the  days  of  sampling  calculatingand  was  expressed  as  kg  ha/C01.2.8.  Carbon  dioxide  ﬂux  measurementCO2ﬂux  was  measured  with  an  environmental  gas  monitorchamber  attached  to  a  data  logger  (model  EGM-4,  PP  system,Haverhill,  MA).  A  ﬂag  was  placed  as  a  marker  in  the  plot  where  CO2ﬂux  was  measured  throughout  the  study  period.  The  chamber  was15  cm  high,  10  cm  in  diameter,  and  had  the  capacity  to  measureCO2ﬂux  from  0  to  9.99  g  CO2-C  m/C02h/C01.  The  chamber  was  placedat  the  soil  surface  for  2  min  in  each  plot  until  CO2ﬂuxmeasurements  were  recorded  in  the  data  logger.  The  CO2ﬂuxwas  recorded  in  the  inter-row  positions  of  the  rice  plants.  Allmeasurements  were  taken  between  09:00  and  12:00  h  andbetween  15:00  and  17:00  h.  The  average  of  the  morning  andevening  ﬂux  was  considered  as  the  daily  ﬂux.2.9.

It  is  used  to  compare  the  effectiveness  of  eachGHG  to  trap  heat  in  the  atmosphere  relative  to  some  standard  gas,by  convention,  CO2.  Integrated  evaluation  of  GHG  emissionsexpressed  as  global  warming  potential  (GWP)  was  computed  byusing  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)factors  for  calculating  the  combined  GWPs  for  100  years[GWP  =  24.5  /C2  CH4+  CO2+  320  /C2  N2O  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01]from  CH4,  N2O  and  CO2efﬂux  values  under  different  treatmentconditions  (IPCC,  2007 ).  Carbon  equivalent  emissions  (CEE)  andcarbon  efﬁciency  ratios  (CERs)  of  the  treatments  were  calculatedby  using  the  following  equations  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2005 ):CEE  =  [GWP  /C2  12]/44  and  CER  =  [grain  yield  (in  terms  ofcarbon)  of  the  rice/CEE];  the  carbon  concentration  in  the  grainwas  measured  and  found  to  be  43%.2.10.  Statistical  analysisIndividual  character  datasets  were  subjected  to  analysis  ofvariance  and  the  means  were  separated  by  Duncan’s  MultipleRange  Test  (DMRT)  at  the  0.05  level  of  probability  by  using  thestatistical  software,  SPSS  (Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences),version  7.5.  Pearson  correlation  (r)  was  applied  to  analyze  thesimple  correlations  between  CH4,  CO2-C,  N2O  ﬂux,  select  soilparameters,  enzymatic  activities  and  the  microbial  populations.3.  Results3.1.  Methane  (CH 4)  emissionFertilizer  application  had  signiﬁcant  (p  <  0.05)  effects  onmethane  emission.  Methane  ﬂux  varied  signiﬁcantly  between1.9  and  5.7  mg  m/C02h/C01[Fig.  1(a)]  during  the  entire  croppingperiod.  The  highest  ﬂux  was  observed  in  76  days  after  transplant-ing  (76  DAT)  irrespective  of  the  treatment  and  a  statisticallysigniﬁcant  (p  <  0.05)  maximum  value  of  5.7  mg  m/C02h/C01[Fig.  1(a)]was  observed  in  the  case  of  the  combined  treatment  with  ricestraw  and  urea.  Methane  emission  followed  almost  similarpatterns  in  control  as  well  as  fertilizer-treated  plots  althoughthe  magnitude  of  emissions  varied.  On  a  seasonal  basis,  cumulativeemission  of  methane  was  lowest  (69.7  kg  ha/C01)  in  the  controltreatment  and  was  the  highest  (122.7  kg  ha/C01)  after  the  combinedFig.  1.

Error  bars  are  the  standard  deviations  of  threereplicate  observations.  Arrow  indicates  time  of  fertilizer  applications.P.  Bhattacharyya  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  124  (2012)  119–130 122application  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure  (Table  2).  However,methane  emission  after  application  of  rice  straw  and  green  manurewas  at  par  with  the  combined  application  of  rice  straw  +  urea(115.4  kg  ha/C01)  on  a  seasonal  basis  (Table  2).  Cumulative  methaneemissions  were  in  the  order  of  rice  straw  +  green  manure(122.7  kg  ha/C01)  =  rice  straw  +  urea  (115.4  kg  ha/C01)  >  urea(92.6  kg  ha/C01)  >  control  (69.7  kg  ha/C01)  (Table  2).  Application  ofrice  straw  +  urea  and  rice  straw  +  green  manure  increased  themethane  ﬂux  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  by  66  and  75%  over  thecontrol,  respectively,  on  a  seasonal  basis.3.2.  Carbon  dioxide-carbon  (CO 2-C)  emissionSoil  carbon  dioxide  ﬂux  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  increased  soonafter  the  transplantation  of  the  rice  crop  and  reached  themaximum  at  76  days  after  transplanting  (76  DAT)  irrespectiveof  the  treatment  [Fig.  1(b)].  The  CO2ﬂux  after  the  treatmentsvaried  between  10.5  and  87.8  mg  CO2-C  m/C02h/C01[Fig.  1(b)].  Thehighest  CO2ﬂux  (87.8  mg  CO2-C  m/C02h/C01)  was  observed  in  the  caseof  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure[Fig.  1(b)].  Cumulative  seasonal  emissions  of  CO2-C  ranged  from1100.3  kg  ha/C01in  the  control  treatment  to  1858.5  kg  ha/C01in  therice  straw  +  green  manure  treatment  (Table  2).  Cumulative  CO2-Cemissions  were  in  the  order  of  rice  straw  +  green  manure(1858.5  kg  ha/C01)  >  rice  straw  +  urea  (1680.6  kg  ha/C01)  >  urea(1447.7  kg  ha/C01)  >  control  (1100.3  kg  ha/C01)  (Table  2).  Applicationof  rice  straw  +  urea  and  rice  straw  +  green  manure  increased  themethane  ﬂux  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  by  53  and  69%  over  thecontrol,  respectively,  on  a  seasonal  basis.3.3.  Nitrous  oxide  emission  (N2O)  emissionSigniﬁcantly  lower  N2O  emissions  were  recorded  following  theapplication  of  rice  straw  +  green  manure  when  compared  to  theother  treatments.  In  contrast,  distinctly  higher  N2O  emissions  wererecorded  when  urea  either  in  a  single  dose  or  combined  with  ricestraw  was  applied  to  the  ﬁeld  [Fig.  1(c)].  A  peak  of  N2O  was  initiallyrecorded  immediately  after  urea  application  in  the  urea  treatment[Fig.  1(c)].  On  the  other  hand,  the  initial  peak  of  N2O  was  delayed  inthe  rice  straw  +  urea  and  rice  straw  +  green  manure  treatments[Fig.  1(c)].  Cumulative  N2O-N  emissions  were  in  the  order  of  urea(1.0  kg  ha/C01)  >  rice  straw  +  urea  (0.84  kg  ha/C01)  >  rice  straw  +  -green  manure  (0.72  kg  ha/C01)  >  control  (0.23  kg  ha/C01)  (Table  2).3.4.  Global  warming  potential  (GWP)  and  carbon  equivalent  emission(CEE)Global  warming  potential  in  terms  of  gaseous  carbon  emissionvaried  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  with  various  treatments  between5862  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01in  the  control  to  10,163  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01after  the  composite  application  of  rice  straw  andgreen  manure  treatment  (Table  2).  GWP  on  CO2equivalent  basis  wasin  the  order  of  rice  straw  +  green  manure  (10,188  kg  CO2equiva-lent  ha/C01)  >  rice  straw  +  urea  (9418  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01)  >urea  (8084  kg  CO2equivalent  ha/C01)  >  control  (5862  kg  CO2equiv-alent  ha/C01)  (Table  2).  CEE  was  the  lowest  (1599  kg  carbon  ha/C01)  inthe  control  (Table  2).  Among  the  treatments,  the  highest  CEE(2779  kg  carbon  ha/C01)  was  observed  in  the  rice  straw  +  greenmanure  treatment  (Table  2).3.5.  Yield  of  rice  and  carbon  efﬁciency  ratio  (CER)Yields  of  rice  ranged  from  3.53  to  5.57  Mg  ha/C01(Table  2).  Theyields  after  treatment  with  rice  straw  +  urea  (5.57  Mg  ha/C01),  ricestraw  +  green  manure  (5.30  Mg  ha/C01)  and  urea  alone(5.13  Mg  ha/C01)  were  similar  but  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  thecontrol  (3.53  Mg  ha/C01,  Table  2).  During  the  previous  three  years  ofstudy,  the  grain  yield  of  rice  ranged  from  3.50  to  3.87  (SD  /C6  0.19),5.10  to  5.23  (SD  /C6  0.07),  5.47  to  5.54  (SD  /C6  0.04)  and  5.28  to  5.34(SD  /C6  0.03)  Mg  ha/C01under  the  control,  urea,  rice  straw  +  urea  andrice  straw  +  green  manure  treatment,  respectively.  The  CER,  i.e.,  thecarbon  ﬁxed  in  grain  by  rice  per  unit  of  carbon  emitted,  was  thehighest  (1.0)  in  the  urea-treated  plots,  followed  by  the  control  (0.95),and  then,  ﬁnally  the  rice  straw  +  urea  treatment  (0.93)  (Table  2).  Thelowest  CER  (0.82)  was  observed  in  the  rice  straw  +  green  manuretreatment  (Table  2).3.6.  Soil  carbon  pools3.6.1.  Soil  carbon  fractionsMicrobial  biomass  carbon  (MBC)  ranged  from  192.7  to416.9  mg  kg/C01and  accounted  for  3.9–5.7%  of  the  total  carbon  inthe  soils  under  study  (Table  3).  The  application  of  rice  straw  +  -green  manure  resulted  in  a  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  higher(416.9  mg  kg/C01)  accumulation  of  microbial  biomass  carbon  (Table3)  than  the  other  treatments.  The  application  of  urea  and  ricestraw  +  urea  showed  signiﬁcant  increase  in  MBC  by  65  and  75%,respectively,  when  compared  to  the  control  (Table  3).  Thecombined  application  of  rice  straw  +  urea  signiﬁcantly  increasedthe  total  carbon  content  (7.49  g  kg/C01)  compared  to  the  othertreatments  (Table  3).  The  ratio  of  MBC  to  organic  carbon  wassigniﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  higher  in  the  rice  straw  +  green  manure(9.50)  treatment  than  in  the  other  treatments  (Table  3).  The  readilymineralizable  carbon  (RMC)  content  was  highest  (188.8  mg  kg/C01)in  plots  receiving  the  rice  straw  +  green  manure  and  the  lowest  inunamended  control  plots  (37.8  mg  kg/C01,  Table  3).  The  water-soluble  carbohydrate  carbon  (WSC)  and  acid-hydrolyzable  carbo-hydrate  carbon  (AHC)  contents  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  variedamong  the  different  treatments  from  11.1  to  48.3  mg  carbon  kg/C01and  396.5  to  604  mg  carbon  kg/C01,  respectively,  and  the  highestvalue  was  obtained  for  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  straw  andgreen  manure  (Table  3).  WSC  and  AHC  accounted  for  0.29–0.88%and  10.3–11.1%  of  organic  carbon,  respectively.  Permanganate-oxidizable  carbon  (KMnO 4-C)  varied  from  315.2  to472.7  mg  carbon  kg/C01for  the  different  treatments  and  the  highestvalue  (472.7  mg  carbon  kg/C01)  was  recorded  for  the  combinedtreatment  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure  (Table  3).

There  were  nosigniﬁcant  differences  in  the  carbon  fractions  from  the  lower  soildepths  (data  not  shown).  Different  applications  of  fertilizers  hadsigniﬁcantly  affected  total  nitrogen,  carbon:  nitrogen  ratio  andnitrogen  fractions  such  as  ammonium  nitrogen  (NH 4+-N),  nitratenitrogen  (NO 3/C0-N)  and  ninhydrin-reactive  nitrogen  (NRN)  con-tents  (Table  4).  Total  nitrogen  content  was  found  to  be  signiﬁcantlyhigher  (0.64  g  kg/C01)  in  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  straw  +  ureatreatment  compared  to  the  other  treatments  under  study  (Table  4).The  carbon:nitrogen  ratio  was  found  to  be  signiﬁcantly  higher  (12.3)in  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  straw  +  green  manure  (Table  4)than  in  any  of  the  other  treatments.  The  ammonium  nitrogen  (NH 4+-N)  and  nitrate  nitrogen  (NO 3/C0-N)  were  signiﬁcantly  increased  insoil  treated  with  urea  (Table  4).  Like  ammonium  nitrogen  and  nitratenitrogen  contents  in  the  soil,  signiﬁcantly  higher  (10.5  mg  g/C01soil)ninhydrin-reactive  nitrogen  (NRN)  content  was  recorded  in  the  soilsfrom  plots  treated  with  urea  followed  by  rice  straw  +  urea(8.8  mg  g/C01soil),  rice  straw  +  green  manure  (6.9  mg  g/C01soil)  andcontrol  (3.3  mg  g/C01soil,  Table  4).3.6.2.  Soil  organic  carbon,  bulk  density  and  carbon  storageSoil  organic  carbon  (SOC)  was  found  to  be  signiﬁcantly(p  <  0.05)  higher  (4.42  g  kg/C01)  in  rice  straw  +  urea  treatment  thanin  the  control  (3.82  g  kg/C01)  (Table  5).  There  was  signiﬁcantdecrease  in  the  carbon  content  in  the  subsurface  soil  (depths  of15–30,  30–45  and  45–60  cm)  (Table  5).

Total  SOC  storage  in  the  60-cm  soil  proﬁle  in  therice–rice  cropping  system  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  (1.39  Mg  ha/C01)after  the  combined  application  of  rice  straw  and  urea,  followed  byrice  straw  +  green  manure  (0.88  Mg  ha/C01),  and  then  urea(0.29  Mg  ha/C01)  (Table  5).  Interestingly,  there  was  no  build-up  ofcarbon  in  the  control  plots  (Table  5).  Carbon  storage  rate  was  alsofound  to  be  signiﬁcantly  higher  (0.35  Mg  carbon  ha/C01yr/C01)  in  thecombined  application  of  rice  straw  +  urea  (Table  5).3.7.  Soil  enzyme  activities  and  microbial  populationsSoil  enzyme  activities  and  microbial  populations  were  stronglyaffected  by  the  application  of  inorganic  or  combined  doses  ofinorganic  and  organic  fertilizers.  Application  of  manure  increaseddehydrogenase  activity,  which  is  an  index  of  microbial  activity  ofsoil.  Soil  dehydrogenase  activity  was  enhanced  signiﬁcantly(p  <  0.05)  on  the  application  of  rice  straw  +  urea  when  comparedto  the  other  treatments  throughout  all  crop  growth  phases[Fig.  2(a)].  Dehydrogenase  activity  ranged  from  191.1  to681.4  mg  TPF  g/C01d/C01[Fig.  2(a)]  and  maximal  activity  was  obtainedin  the  panicle  initiation  stage  of  crop  development.  The  highest  FDAactivity  was  found  after  the  combined  application  of  rice  straw  andurea  (7.8  mg  ﬂuorescein  g/C01h/C01),  followed  by  rice  straw  and  greenmanure  (7.0  mg  ﬂuorescein  g/C01h/C01)  [Fig.  2(b)].  The  b-glucosidaseactivity  ranged  from  10.6  to  52  mg  p-nitrophenol  g/C01h/C01through-out  different  crop  development  stages,  the  maximal  activity(52  mg  p-nitrophenol  g/C01h/C01)  being  observed  in  the  plots  receivingboth  rice  straw  and  urea  in  the  panicle  initiation  stage  [Fig.  2(c)].  Theactivity  of  urease  followed  the  same  trend  as  those  seen  for  the  otherthree  enzymes  under  study.  Interestingly,  a  single  application  ofurea  in  the  recommended  dose  inhibited  urease  activity.  On  anaverage,  urease  activity  ranged  from  177.4  to  251  mg  urea  g/C01h/C01[Fig.  2(d)],  with  the  maximal  activity  (251  mg  urea  g/C01h/C01)  ofurease  being  found  after  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  straw  andurea  [Fig.  2(d)].  The  abundance  of  heterotrophs  was  signiﬁcantly(p  <  0.05)  enhanced  by  different  fertilizations  in  comparison  withthe  control  condition  [Fig.  3(a)].  The  highest  log  colony  forming  units(cfu)  (9.29)  value  was  observed  in  the  rice  straw  +  green  manuretreatment  in  the  panicle  initiation  stage  [Fig.  3(a)].  Methanogenicpopulations  were  in  the  range  of  3.07–3.95  log  MPN,  and  the  largestpopulation  was  observed  in  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  strawand  green  manure  in  the  panicle  initiation  stage  [Fig.  3(b)A].Ammoniﬁer,  nitriﬁer  and  denitriﬁer  populations  increased  steadilyup  to  the  panicle  initiation  stage  and  decreased  moderatelythereafter  [Fig.  3(b)  B,  C  and  D].  The  log  MPN  values  of  ammoniﬁers,nitriﬁers  and  denitriﬁers  were  found  to  be  maximal  (3.64,  3.45and  5.12,  respectively)  in  the  urea-treated  plots  compared  to  theother  treatments  [Fig.  3(b)  B,  C  and  D],  which  gave  rise  to  high  ratesof  N2O-N  ﬂux.3.8.  Correlation  analysisSigniﬁcant  and  positive  correlations  were  found  between  CH4,CO2-C  as  well  as  N2O  ﬂux  and  different  soil  carbon  pools  (MBC,RMC,  TC),  global  warming  potential,  carbon  storage  and  the  carbonmanagement  index.  Soil  enzyme  activities  (dehydrogenase,  FDA,b-glucosidase  and  urease)  of  the  microbial  populations  showedsigniﬁcant  positive  correlations  with  soil  organic  carbon,  indicat-ing  that  soil  functional  and  microbial  population  dynamics  (withrespect  to  GHG  emission)  depends  upon  the  soil  carbonconcentrations.  The  CH4and  CO2-C  ﬂux  positively  correlated  withMBC  (r  =  0.92**,  0.92**),  RMC  (r  =  0.97**,  0.96**),  TC  (r  =  0.96**,0.93**),  GWP  (r  =  0.98**,  1.00**),  carbon  storage  (r  =  0.93**,  0.91**)and  CMI  (r  =  0.97**,  0.97**)  (Table  6).  In  this  study,  the  organiccarbon  content  of  soil  correlated  positively  with  activities  ofdehydrogenase  (r  =  0.99**),  FDA  (r  =  0.95**),  b-glucosidaseTable 5Soil organic carbon, bulk density and carbon storage in different inorganic and organic manure-treated soil planted with rice ( cv.

Discussion4.1.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  methane  (CH 4)  emissionRice  cultivation  is  an  important  anthropogenic  source  ofatmospheric  CH4.  In  the  present  study,  the  application  of  ricestraw,  nitrogen  fertilizer  and  organic  manures  resulted  in  anincrease  in  CH4emission.  Under  submerged  conditions,  emissionof  CH4resulted  from  carbon  mineralization  (Kimura  et  al.,  2004 ),which  was  enhanced  by  fertilization.  Microbial  biomass  andenzyme  activity  increased  due  to  SOC  mineralization  but  thepredominant  pathway  of  CH4formation  was  generally  consideredto  be  unchanged  after  different  fertilizer  treatments.  The  capacityof  CH4production  was  likely  to  depend  on  the  available  carbonresources  for  microbes.  Application  of  different  fertilizers,  espe-cially  in  combination  with  manure,  has  been  shown  to  enhance  theFig.  3.

Diurnal  variationof  methane  ﬂux  under  ﬁeld  conditions  showed  that  the  emissionwas  maximum  at  mid  day  or  early  afternoon  12:00–15:00  h  andminimum  at  midnight  (24:00  h)  at  tillering,  panicle  initiation  andmaturity  stage  of  rice  crop  (Satpathy  et  al.,  1997 ).  It  wasstandardized  and  well  established  that  under  this  agro-ecologicalregion  the  gas  samplings  at  9:00–9:30  h  and  15:00–15:30  h  werethe  most  representable  one  for  daily  ﬂux  measurement  andnulliﬁed  the  diurnal  variation  of  ﬂux  (Das  et  al.,  2011;  Datta  et  al.,2009;  Nayak  et  al.,  2006 ).  Estimation  of  seasonal  CH4emissionsduring  the  crop  season  was  done  by  successive  linear  interpolationof  average  emission  on  the  sampling  days  assuming  that  emissionfollowed  a  linear  trend  during  the  periods  when  no  sample  wastaken  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2011 ).  Extrapolation  of  daily  ﬂux  datameasured  at  closed  frequency  throughout  the  cropping  periodto  seasonal  ﬂux  is  well  established  as  reported  by  Bhatia  et  al.(2005) ,  Das  et  al.  (2011) ,  Datta  et  al.  (2009) .  The  peaks  of  themethane  ﬂux  were  observed  in  76  days  after  transplanting  (76DAT)  of  the  rice  crop  irrespective  of  the  treatments.  The  76  DATcorresponds  just  after  the  panicle  initiation  stage  of  cropdevelopment.  The  higher  methane  ﬂux  in  the  panicle  initiationstage  was  also  reported  by  Gogoi  et  al.  (2005) .  It  was  evident  fromour  study  that  the  microbial  activity  both  in  terms  of  extracellularenzyme  activity  and  populations  (for  example  methanogens,heterotrophs)  were  the  highest  during  panicle  initiation  stage  ofcrop  development.  The  application  of  green  manure  and  cropresidues  enhanced  emission  of  methane  by  providing  additionalcarbon  substrates  in  comparison  to  the  unfertilized  conditions  (Luet  al.,  2000 ).  The  signiﬁcantly  (p  <  0.05)  different  ﬂuxes  of  CH4inthe  various  treatments  can  be  explained  by  the  soil  biomasscarbon/organic  carbon  (MBC/OC)  ratio.  It  has  been  suggested  thatthe  biomass  carbon/organic  carbon  ratio  reﬂects  the  potential  formineralization  of  soil  organic  matter  after  the  addition  of  organicmaterials;  the  higher  the  ratio,  the  higher  is  the  tendency  of  theorganic  matter  to  mineralize  (Garcla-orenes  et  al.,  2010 ).  Based  onthis  concept,  soil  treated  with  both  rice  straw  and  green  manurewould  be  characterized  by  the  high  mineralization  potential  of  itsorganic  matter,  which  in  turn,  corresponds  to  high  gaseous  carbonﬂux  from  the  soil.  In  this  study,  all  labile  pools  such  as  RMC,  WSCand  AHC  in  the  soil  show  signiﬁcantly  higher  values  in  the  ricestraw  +  green  manure  treatment,  which  promoted  the  growth  ofmethanogens  and  produced  higher  methane  emissions.  Substratessuch  as  green  manure  or  rice  straw  decompose  to  produce  acetate,which  is  the  key  component  for  the  growth  of  the  methanogens.4.2.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2)  emissionThe  supply  of  nutrients  via  organic  products  would  be  expectedto  affect  CO2ﬂux  in  the  soil  by  increasing  carbon  input  fromenhanced  plant  productivity  and  crop  residue  returned  to  soil.  Theapplication  of  organic  amendments  can  affect  mineralization  ratesof  soil  organic  matter  and  contribute  to  increases  in  soil  organicmatter  content  by  increasing  residue  input  with  increased  cropproduction  (Iqbal  et  al.,  2009 ).  Few  datasets  are  currently  availableto  characterize  the  effects  of  the  application  of  inorganic  fertilizer,inorganic  fertilizer  with  organic  manure  or  organic  manure  aloneon  soil  CO2ﬂux  from  the  ﬂooded  rice  paddy.  In  this  study,  thehighest  CO2ﬂux  was  observed  in  the  rice  straw  +  green  manuretreatment,  probably  due  to  the  efﬁcient  use  of  carbon  for  microbialgrowth  in  response  to  the  application  of  the  fertilizers  (Fisk  andFahey,  2001 ).  The  peaks  of  the  CO2ﬂux  were  observed  in  76  daysafter  transplanting  (76  DAT),  i.e.  just  after  panicle  initiation  stage.The  higher  ﬂux  was  due  to  the  availability  of  the  C  substrates  inthat  period  and  higher  microbial  activity  as  reported  by  Iqbal  et  al.(2009)  and  Campbell  et  al.  (2001) .  All  the  measurements  weretaken  between  09:00  and  12:00  h  and  between  15:00  and  17:00  hof  the  day  to  reduce  variability  in  CO2ﬂux  due  to  diurnal  changes  intemperature  and  considered  as  the  representative  time  as  reportedby  Sainju  et  al.  (2008)  and  Iqbal  et  al.  (2009) .  Extrapolation  of  dailyCO2ﬂux  data  measured  at  closed  intervals  throughout  thecropping  period  to  seasonal  CO2ﬂux  is  well  known  (Bhatiaet  al.,  2005 ).  Microbial  biomass  tends  to  be  dynamic  in  soil  withlimited  nutrient  availability  (Fontaine  et  al.,  2004 ).  Under  suchconditions,  net  soil  carbon  loss  increases  due  to  the  enhancementin  soil  organic  carbon  mineralization.  Rice  straw  with  a  highcarbon/nitrogen  ratio  tends  to  decompose  slowly  due  to  limitednitrogen  availability  caused  by  net  immobilization  (Khalil  et  al.,2001 ).  Rice  straw  in  combination  with  urea  resulted  in  a  loweremission  rate  than  rice  straw  in  combination  with  green  manure,possibly  due  to  low  turnover  rates  of  the  more  stable  microbialbiomass.  The  rice  straw  when  becomes  associated  with  greenmanure,  the  labile  carbon  source  supports  the  growth  of  microbialbiomass,  which  is  dynamic  and  promotes  the  priming  effect  of  soilorganic  matter  resulting  into  higher  CO2-C  ﬂux  (Singh  et  al.,  2009 ).Table  7Correlation  matrix  among  soil  organic  carbon,  select  soil  labile  fractions  soil  enzyme  activities  and  microbial  populations  in  different  inorganic  and  organic  manure-treatedsoil  planted  with  rice  (cv.

Effects  of  fertilization  on  nitrous  oxide  (N2O)  emissionUrea  application,  either  singly  or  in  combination  with  ricestraw,  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  N2O  ﬂux.  Nitriﬁcation  anddenitriﬁcation  are  the  two  major  microbial  processes  responsiblefor  N2O  emission  from  ﬂooded  rice  soils.  Denitriﬁcation  also  acts  asthe  sink  for  N2O,  especially  under  the  submerged  conditions  ofﬂooded  rice  soil.  Although  nitriﬁcation  is  an  aerobic  process  anddenitriﬁcation  is  an  anaerobic  process,  both  processes  have  beenknown  to  occur  in  tandem  in  ﬂooded  rice  soils.  Like  nitriﬁcation,denitriﬁcation  is  a  major  source  of  N2O  emission,  especially  underanaerobic  conditions  with  higher  carbon  availability  (Kyaw  andToyota,  2007 ).  Extrapolation  of  daily  N2O-N  ﬂux  data  measured  atclosed  intervals  throughout  the  cropping  period  to  seasonal  N2O-Nﬂux  is  also  well  studied  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2010;  Das  et  al.,  2011;  Dattaet  al.,  2009;  Malla  et  al.,  2005 ).  Correlation  analysis  betweenammoniacal  nitrogen,  nitrate  nitrogen  and  N2O-N  showed  a  highlysigniﬁcant  positive  relationship  (r  =  0.96**,  0.98**),  indicating  thatN2O  emission  is  a  microbial  process  that  depends  on  availablecarbon  and  nitrogen  sources  available  to  microorganisms.  Ninhy-drin-reactive  nitrogen  (NRN)  content,  an  index  of  labile  nitrogenavailable  from  microbial  biomass  in  the  rhizosphere  soil  (Nayaket  al.,  2007 ),  was  seen  to  increase  signiﬁcantly  in  soils  treated  withurea.  Furthermore,  NRN  contents  of  the  soils  showed  signiﬁcantcorrelation  with  N2O  emission  (r  =  0.99**),  demonstrating  theutilization  of  the  readily  available  nitrogen  source  by  microorgan-isms  in  response  to  the  application  of  urea  to  produce  N2O.  In  thisstudy,  the  lower  emissions  in  the  rice  straw  +  green  manuretreatment  were  due  to  the  slow  decomposition  of  nitrogen  due  tothe  higher  carbon:nitrogen  ratio  associated  with  this  combinationwhen  compared  to  the  other  fertilizers  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2005 ).4.4.  Global  warming  potential  (GWP)  and  carbon  equivalent  emission(CEE)It  is  notably  important  that  fertilization  through  the  incorpo-ration  of  organic  manures  or  inorganic  fertilizers  signiﬁcantly(p  <  0.05)  increased  the  total  GWP  of  paddy  soil.  Correlationanalysis  showed  that  GWP  of  different  manurial  treatments  weresigniﬁcantly  (p  <  0.01)  correlated  with  the  CH4ﬂux  (r  =  0.98**),CO2-C  ﬂux  (r  =  1.00**)  and  N2O-N  ﬂux  (r  =  0.68*).  This  indicatesthat  the  increase  or  decrease  in  GWP  and  CEE  values  would  followthe  same  trend  followed  by  CH4,  CO2and  N2O  ﬂuxes  under  thedifferent  treatment  conditions.4.5.  Yields  of  rice  and  carbon  efﬁciency  ratio  (CER)In  this  study,  yields  of  rice  were  similar  for  the  different  treatedplots,  although  a  comparatively  higher  yield  was  obtained  in  therice  straw  +  urea  treatment,  possibly  due  to  the  availability  ofnutrients.  In  agreement  with  the  results  reported  by  Goyal  et  al.(1997) ,  our  results  also  showed  a  higher  crop  yield  with  theaddition  of  Sesbania  in  the  form  of  green  manure.  The  carbonefﬁciency  ratio  (CER)  was  the  largest  in  the  urea  treatment  due  tolower  gaseous  carbon  emission  but  similar  to  the  control  and  ricestraw  +  urea  treatment,  and  was  the  smallest  in  the  rice  straw  +  -green  manure  treatment  due  to  the  high  gaseous  carbon  emission.4.6.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  soil  carbon  pools4.6.1.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  soil  carbon  fractionsThe  application  of  inorganic  fertilizers,  by  themselves  or  incombination  with  organic  manures,  has  been  reported  tosigniﬁcantly  affect  SOC  and  its  fractions  due  to  the  signiﬁcantincrease  in  carbon  input  after  manure  application  (Ma  et  al.,  2011 ).Soil  MBC  regulates  soil  organic  matter  decomposition  and  nutrientcycling,  and  thus  plays  a  key  role  in  maintaining  function  andsustainability  of  terrestrial  ecosystems.  MBC  has  been  included  incurrent  soil  monitoring  concepts  due  to  its  rapid  response  and  highsensitivity  to  management  practices  and  environmental  changes.Green  manuring  provides  a  potent  source  of  labile  carbon  content.Hence,  the  application  of  green  manure  in  combination  with  othermanures,  such  as  rice  straw,  leads  to  a  high  degree  of  gaseouscarbon  ﬂux,  a  greater  labile  carbon  pool  and  a  low  reserve  of  totalcarbon.  Total  nitrogen  content  was  the  highest  in  the  ricestraw  +  urea  treatment  because  of  the  slow  release  of  organicallybound  N  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2005 ),  leading  to  accumulation  of  totalnitrogen  in  the  soil.  The  soluble  carbon  fraction  is  an  importantpool  with  respect  to  soil  organic  matter  turnover  in  agriculturalsoils,  as  it  acts  as  a  readily  decomposable  substrate  for  soilmicroorganisms  and  as  a  short-term  reservoir  of  plant  nutrients(Garcla-orenes  et  al.,  2010 ).  Labile  carbon  fractions,  such  as  RMC,WSC,  AHC  and  KMnO 4-C,  all  increased  after  the  addition  of  greenmanure  in  combination  with  rice  straw.  There  was  a  signiﬁcantcorrelation  between  RMC  and  total  carbon  content  (r  =  0.93**).WSC  consists  of  an  array  of  molecules  that  generally  reﬂect  thecomposition  of  total  SOC  due  to  the  equilibrium  between  thesoluble  and  solid  phases  of  SOC,  and  is  regarded  as  an  indicator  ofsoil  quality  and  functioning.  Application  of  inorganic  fertilizer  in  asingle  dose  or  in  combination  may  contribute  more  labile  carbonthat  can  act  as  a  source  of  energy  and  nutrients  (Manna  et  al.,2007 ).  Whitbread  et  al.  (1998)  suggested  that  the  soil  carbonmanagement  index  (CMI)  be  used  to  describe  soil  fertility  as  it  is  amore  sensitive  indicator  of  the  rate  of  change  in  SOC  in  response  tosoil  management  changes,  than  single  measures  such  as  the  totalSOC.  In  our  study,  CMI  was  more  signiﬁcantly  enhanced  by  theorganic  treatments  than  by  the  nitrogen  treatment.  This  wasprobably  due  to  the  increase  in  annual  carbon  input  and  thevariations  in  organic  matter  quality,  thus  modifying  the  liability  ofcarbon  to  KMnO 4oxidation.  These  results  are  similar  to  thosereported  by  Blair  et  al.  (2006)  who  reported  that  manure  alone  andmanure  with  inorganic  fertilizer  signiﬁcantly  increased  CMI  incomparison  to  any  other  chemical  fertilizer  treatment.4.6.2.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  organic  carbon  and  carbon  storageSoil  organic  carbon  (SOC)  generally  increases  with  carbon  inputbefore  the  soil  becomes  carbon  saturated.  Inorganic  fertilizer,alone  or  in  combination  with  organic  manures,  has  been  widelyshown  to  increase  SOC  content  (Blair  et  al.,  2006;  Purakayasthaet  al.,  2008 ).  This  reﬂects  the  considerable  carbon  supplementationto  soil  with  the  applied  fertilizers.  Balanced  fertilization  isexpected  to  increase  SOC  because  of  greater  carbon  inputassociated  with  enhanced  primary  production  and  crop  residuesreturned  to  the  soil.  High  rate  of  carbon  sequestration  in  the  ricesystem  is  due  to  the  soil  being  under  a  unique  ﬂooded  moistureregime  for  3–4  months  under  the  rice  crop,  and  secondly,  due  tohigh  biomass  production  in  rice.  Inadequate  amounts  of  oxygenunder  submerged  conditions  lead  to  even  modest  oxygen  demandfor  microbial  activity  not  being  met  if  large  pores  are  ﬁlled  withwater,  resulting  in  decreased  rates  of  decomposition  (Kukal  et  al.,2009 ).  Sahrawat  (2004)  described  preferential  accumulation  oforganic  matter  in  submerged  rice  soils  as  compared  to  aerobic  soilsdue  to  the  incomplete  decomposition  of  organic  materials  anddecreased  humiﬁcation  of  organic  matter  under  ﬂooded  condi-tions.  Consequently,  the  overall  organic  matter  decompositionrates  are  slower  in  submerged  soils  than  in  aerobic  soils.  Thisresults  in  a  net  accumulation  of  organic  matter  in  soils  that  remainﬂooded  for  several  years.  Witt  et  al.  (2000)  also  reported  11–12%greater  carbon  sequestration  in  soils  that  were  continuouslycropped  with  rice  for  two  years  than  in  maize–rice  rotationsystems  with  higher  amounts  sequestered  in  nitrogen  fertilizertreatments.  In  this  study,  application  of  rice  straw  along  with  ureaP.  Bhattacharyya  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  124  (2012)  119–130 128as  inorganic  nitrogen  fertilizer  led  to  higher  accumulation  ofcarbon  in  the  soil.  The  high  lignin  content  in  rice  straw  has  beenshown  to  lead  to  slow  decomposition  (Bhatia  et  al.,  2005 ),  whichprobably  results  in  the  accumulation  of  total  carbon  contentobserved  in  the  present  study.4.7.  Effects  of  fertilization  on  soil  enzymes  and  microbial  populationsThe  activities  of  assayed  enzymes  were  generally  wellcorrelated  with  the  organic  carbon  content  because  all  theseparameters  were  increased  substantially  by  increasing  returns  oforganic  residues.  Indeed,  in  general,  there  is  a  signiﬁcantcorrelation  between  the  activity  of  soil  enzymes  and  organiccarbon  content  (Graham  and  Haynes,  2005 ).  In  this  study  also,there  were  positive  correlations  between  organic  carbon  content  insoil  and  dehydrogenase  (r  =  0.99**),  FDA  (r  =  0.95**),  b-glucosidase(r  =  0.98**)  and  urease  (r  =  0.97**)  activity  in  the  soil.  Soil  organicmatter  is  the  substrate  for  many  soil  enzymes  and  protects  themthrough  the  formation  of  enzyme  complexes  with  clay  and  humus(Tabatabai,  1994 ).  Dehydrogenase  activity  basically  depends  onthe  metabolic  state  of  the  soil  biota.  A  signiﬁcant  increase  indehydrogenase  activity  occurred  in  the  organically  treated  plots,especially  the  ones  treated  with  urea.  Total  microbial  activity,  interms  of  ﬂuorescein  diacetate  hydrolysis,  has  been  used  todetermine  amounts  of  active  microﬂora  producing  extracellularenzymes  (Adam  and  Duncan,  2001 ).  These  enzymes  can  persist  insoil  as  parts  of  inorganic  complexes  or  in  association  with  organiccolloids.  b-Glucosidase  is  widely  abundant,  and  is  synthesized  bysoil  microorganisms  in  response  to  the  presence  of  suitablesubstrates.  The  highest  b-glucosidase  activity  was  recorded  in  theplot  treated  with  urea  +  rice  straw,  probably  due  to  the  enrichmentin  fresh  plant  materials  of  a  cellulolitic  nature,  which  acted  assubstrates  for  the  b-glucosidase  enzyme.  Urease  activity  decreasedwith  the  increasing  application  of  NH 3based-nitrogen  fertilizers,as  seen  in  the  urea-treated  plots,  probably  due  to  the  presence  ofthe  end  product  of  the  enzymatic  reaction  (NH 4+)  that  suppressedthe  synthesis  of  urease  (Dick  et  al.,  1988 ).  Urease  activity  wasfound  to  be  the  highest  for  the  combined  treatment  of  rice  strawand  urea.  Heterotrophic  microbial  populations  were  larger  in  thecombined  treatment  of  rice  straw  and  green  manure  due  to  thebioavailability  of  growth-promoting  substances,  and  showedpositively  correlation  with  soil  labile  carbon  pools.  Similarly,signiﬁcant  (p  <  0.05)  correlations  were  observed  between  metha-nogen  populations  and  labile  carbon  pools  such  as  WSC  (r  =  0.96**),AHC  (r  =  0.96**)  and  KMnO 4-C  (r  =  0.94**).  Nitriﬁcation  anddenitriﬁcation  are  the  two  major  microbial  processes  responsiblefor  N2O  emission  from  ﬂooded  rice  soils.  Ammoniﬁers  andnitriﬁers  are  involved  in  the  nitriﬁcation  process  whereasdenitriﬁers  are  involved  in  the  denitriﬁcation  process.  Highlysigniﬁcant  positive  correlations  existed  among  these  organisms,which  suggested  that  these  two  processes  occurred  simultaneous-ly  in  the  rice  ﬁeld  to  give  rise  to  N2O  ﬂux.5.  ConclusionsThe  application  of  inorganic  fertilizers  in  combination  withorganic  manures  for  four  years  to  a  rice–rice  tropical  agroecosys-tem  resulted  in  soil  carbon  build  up  and  increase  in  cropproductivity.  However,  carbon  storage  and  carbon  sequestrationcapacity  were  inﬂuenced  by  both  the  recalcitrant  and  labile  natureof  the  inputs,  varied  signiﬁcantly  among  the  different  treatments.The  combined  application  of  urea  or  green  manure  with  rice  strawresulted  in  higher  GHG  emissions,  and  also  helped  to  build  upcarbon  in  the  soil.  Thus,  the  combination  of  an  inorganic  fertilizer,such  as  urea,  with  rice  straw  on  a  1:1  nitrogen  basis  that  resulted  ina  signiﬁcant  build-up  of  soil  carbon,  enhancement  of  crop  yield  andlower  GHG  emission  when  compared  to  rice  straw  and  greenmanure,  could  be  a  viable  option  to  mitigate  global  warming  andmaintain  soil  health.AcknowledgmentsThis  work  has  been  supported  by  a  grant  from  the  IndianCouncil  of  Agricultural  Research-National  Agricultural  InnovationProject  (ICAR-NAIP),  Component-4  (2031)  for  the  project  entitled,‘‘Soil  organic  carbon  dynamics  vis-a`-vis  anticipatory  climaticchanges  and  crop  adaptation  strategies’’,  National  Initiative  onClimate  Resilient  Agriculture  (NICRA)  and  Central  Rice  ResearchInstitute  (CRRI).
