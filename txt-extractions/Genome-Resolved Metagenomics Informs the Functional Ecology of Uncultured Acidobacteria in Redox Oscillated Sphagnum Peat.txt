Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Informs the FunctionalEcology of Uncultured Acidobacteria in Redox OscillatedSphagnum PeatLinta Reji ,a,bXinning Zhanga,baDepartment of Geosciences, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USAbHigh Meadows Environmental Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USAABSTRACT Understanding microbial niche differentiation along ecological and geo-chemical gradients is critical for assessing the mechanisms of ecosystem response tohydrologic variation and other aspects of global change. The lineage-speci ﬁc biogeo-chemical roles of the widespread phylum Acidobacteria in hydrologically sensitiveecosystems, such as peatlands, are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate thatAcidobacteria sublineages in Sphagnum peat respond differentially to redox ﬂuctua-tions due to variable oxygen (O2) availability, a typical feature of hydrologic variation.Our genome-centric approach disentangles the mechanisms of niche differentiationbetween the Acidobacteria genera Holophaga and Terracidiphilus in response to thetransient O2exposure of peat in laboratory incubations. Interlineage functional diver-siﬁcation explains the enrichment of the otherwise rare Holophaga in anoxic peat af-ter transient O2exposure in comparison to Terracidiphilus dominance in continuouslyanoxic peat. The observed niche differentiation of the two lineages is linked to differ-ences in their carbon degradation potential. Holophaga appear to be primarily relianton carbohydrate oligomers and amino acids, produced during the prior period of O2exposure via the O2-stimulated breakdown of peat carbon, rich in complex aromaticsand carbohydrate polymers. In contrast, Terracidiphilus genomes are enriched indiverse respiratory hydrogenases and carbohydrate active enzymes, enabling thedegradation of complex plant polysaccharides into monomers and oligomers for fer-mentation. We also present the ﬁrst evidence for the potential contribution ofAcidobacteria in peat nitrogen ﬁxation. In addition to canonical molybdenum-based diazotrophy, the Acidobacteria genomes harbor vanadium and iron-onlyalternative nitrogenases. Together, the results better inform the different func-tional roles of Acidobacteria in peat biogeochemistry under global change.IMPORTANCE Acidobacteria are among the most widespread and abundant membersof the soil bacterial community, yet their ecophysiology remains largely underexplored.In acidic peat systems, Acidobacteria are thought to perform key biogeochemical func-tions, yet the mechanistic links between the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity withinthis phylum and peat carbon transformations remain unclear. Here, we employ genomiccomparisons of Acidobacteria subgroups enriched in laboratory incubations of peatunder variable O2availability to disentangle the lineage-speci ﬁc functional roles of thesemicroorganisms in peat carbon transformations. Our genome-centric approach revealsthat the diversi ﬁcation of Acidobacteria subpopulations across transient O2exposure islinked to differences in their carbon substrate preferences. We also identify a previouslyunknown functional potential for biological nitrogen ﬁxation in these organisms.

They often account for up to 50% of the soil bacterial com-m u n i t y( 3 ,6 ,7 )a c r o s saw i d er a n g eo fh a b i t a t s ,i n c l u d i n gr h i z o s p h e r es o i l s ,s u b s u r f a c ea q -uifer sediments, grassland soils, and wetland environments (4, and references therein). Yet,relatively little is known about the ecophysiological traits that contribute to their success inthese environments, largely due to the paucity of cultured representatives.The physiological characterization of available isolates and community metagenomicinvestigations suggest vast metabolic diversity within this phylum, ranging from complexcarbon transformations to the ability to respire diverse substrates, such as O2,s u l f a t e ,nitrite, nitrate, and trimethylamine N-oxide (4, 5, 8, 9). Also notable is the extensive phylo-genetic diversity within the phylum, with 26 different subdivisions (SD) of Acidobacteriahaving been de ﬁned based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (10), which corresponds to15 taxonomic classes (11). The majority of the characterized members are within SD 1(class Acidobacteriia ,o r d e r Acidobacteriales )a n dS D3( c l a s s Acidobacteriia , order Bryobac-terales ) (4, 11, 12). Heterotrophy appears to be a conserved metabolic strategy across allsubdivisions. Facultatively and obligately aerobic (including microaerobic) as well as anaer-obic members have been described (4, 8, 9, 13 –15). Although most of the characterizedanaerobic lineages are predominantly fermentative, some are capable of alternativerespiration using sulfate or nitrate (5, 8). The isolation conditions for Acidobacteria havegenerally included the addition of xylan or cellulose as a carbon source, based on the dem-onstrated ability of many Acidobacteria to utilize these carbohydrates for growth (4, andreferences therein).Acidic, sphagnum-dominated peatlands are among the preferred habitats for manyAcidobacteria lineages (16 –22), and this could be attributed to their vast hydrolytic capabil-ities, which are associated with the degradation of complex plant-derived polysaccharides(18, 22). Peat organic matter (OM) is predominantly composed of condensed aromaticsand plant-derived polymers, such as cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose, the degradationof which is the primary step toward the anaerobic decomposition of peat OM (23 –26).Various hydrolytic extracellular enzymes produced by microorganisms are the key catalyticagents mediating these degradation pathways (24). Their activities, however, may be inhib-ited by phenolic compounds that are typically abundant in peat systems (27, 28), leadingto a mechanistic control on the growth and activity of microbial decomposers, althoughthe evidence for this “enzyme latch ”theory is variable (26, 29).Compared to stable anoxic conditions, the exposure of peat to O2leads to moreefﬁcient degradation of complex peat carbon due to the thermodynamic favorabilityof O2as a highly positive terminal electron acceptor and the requirement of molecu-lar O2in the enzymatic breakdown of phenolic compounds by aromatic compoundoxygenases (30 –34). Therefore, ﬂuctuating O2levels due to changes in water tableposition can be a major control on peat carbon stability. In this regard, it is importantto consider the effects of projected changes in peat hydrology (28) due to climatechange as well as anthropogenic water management strategies on peatland carbonﬂows. The typically acidic nature of Sphagnum p e a ts y s t e m si sa l s oc o n s i d e r e dt ob ean important control on the complete remineralization of peat OM and methanogen-esis (35, 36).Another major geochemical factor considered to be limiting to microorganisms in or-ganic-rich peat is the low availability of biologically active forms of nitrogen (N), whichmakes them dependent on atmospheric deposition of N and other biologically importanttrace metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Ni, Mo) (37, 38 and references therein), particularly in ombrotrophicsystems (39, 40). Diazotrophy has been attributed to Sphagnum -associated microorganismsas well as to free-living Cyanobacteria, methanotrophs, and heterotrophic bacteria acrosspeat systems (38, 39, 41 –47), although the relative contribution from each functional guildremains largely unknown. Despite their dominance in peat systems, Acidobacteria have notbeen implicated in biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF), and experimental validation for N ﬁxa-tion by the isolate Holophaga feotida , which possesses genes for molybdenum-based diazo-t r o p h y ,i sl a c k i n g( 4 ) .Niche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 2Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.Recent studies implicate Acidobacteria as key degraders of complex OM in Sphagnumpeatlands, as many are capable of utilizing glucuronic and galacturonic acids released dur-ingSphagnum moss decomposition (17). Acetate is the typical end product of these fer-mentative reactions, which are mediated by various glycoside hydrolases (20, 21, 48).Metagenomic analyses suggest that many Acidobacteria may further couple acetate oxida-tion with the reduction of O2or humic substances and may thereby play a key role in thecomplete mineralization of Sphagnum -derived carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2) (22). Whetherthe carbon ﬂow from complex OM to CO2is mediated by all Acidobacteria or by distinctsubgroups within the phylum remains unclear, as we lack a lineage-resolved characteriza-tion of these organisms. Ecological niche differentiation has previously been observedamong Acidobacteria in tundra soil, as the classes Blastocatellia and Acidobacteriia werefound to prefer distinct niche spaces de ﬁned by varying pH and carbon substrates (12). Anysuch niche partitioning along phylogenetic boundaries among peat Acidobacteria, whichwould result in ecological and metabolic differentiation between lineages, remains largelyunknown.The majority of the phylogenetic diversity within peat Acidobacteria is partitionedamong three class level lineages: Acidobacteriia (primarily SD 1), Blastocatellia (SD 4),and Holophagae (SD 8). Within Acidobacteriia , the SD 2 and SD 3 lineages are alsodetected in acidic peat bogs, albeit less frequently (17, 49, and references therein).Even though several cultivated representatives exist within these subdivisions, particu-larly within SD 1 and SD 4 (e.g., Granulicella sp. in SD 1 and Blastocatella famiduransA22 in SD 4; see [4] for a recent compilation of cultivated isolates), no representativeisolates of peat Acidobacteria exist. This limits inference on their ecophysiologicaladaptations.One way to probe the lineage-resolved ecophysiology of uncultivated microbes isto assess if an environmental change elicits differential responses among subpopula-tions. Given the documented diversity in O2preferences among even closely relatedpopulations of Acidobacteria (4), we hypothesized that changes in peat redox will leadto differential enrichment of sublineages. Indeed, when anoxic peat soils were sub-jected to a temporary increase in O2levels, an increasing dominance of Acidobacteria,speci ﬁcally the genus Holophaga , was observed across incubation time points after an-oxia was reestablished (26). The signi ﬁcant restructuring of the microbial community inresponse to O2exposition ultimately led to a large ( ;2000-fold) increase in the methaneyields of O2-shifted samples compared to continuously anoxic controls (26). Geochemicaland molecular evidence pointed to O2facilitating the breakdown of complex aromatic ligninand tannin-like carbon compounds, followed by hydrogen (H2)-evolving and CO2-evolvingfermentation, and eventually leading to the proliferation of the genus Methanobacterium ,which utilized this higher substrate ﬂux (i.e., H2and CO2) to generate methane (26). WhileAcidobacteria, particularly Holophaga that were enriched in the O2-pretreated incubations,appeared to be key members of the microbial community following oxygenation, their spe-ciﬁc roles in the biogeochemical response to transient oxygenation remained unclear.Here, we apply genome-centric metagenomic approaches to better constrain thefunctional roles of individual microbial lineages/populations in biogeochemical trans-formations driven by transient O2exposure in peat incubations. By examining thegenomic features of populations enriched across various stages of the incubation (26),we obtain an improved mechanistic understanding of the community succession pat-terns underlying redox-associated biogeochemical responses, particularly the func-tional roles of speci ﬁc Acidobacteria lineages in eliciting these responses.RESULTSDifferential enrichment of uncultured Acidobacteria lineages in oxygen-oscillatedpeat. To better understand the functional ecology of peat Acidobacteria, we performedgenome assemblies of metagenomic data sets ( n= 20) obtained from laboratory incuba-tions of Sphagnum peat subjected to variable redox oscillations that were associated withshifts in O2levels (26). These peat incubations consisted of triplicate slurry microcosms repre-senting the unsaturated (UNS), above water table (AWT), and below water table (BWT) peatNiche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 3Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.layers. The control slurries were incubated under anoxic conditions throughout the courseof the experiment (232 days), while the treatment incubations were pretreated with 5 or10% O2in the bottle headspace (vol/vol; 98 days), followed by continuously anoxic condi-tions (134 days).Pronounced changes in the overall community composition were observed betweenthe different peat layers at the ﬁn a lt i m ep o i n t( F i g .S 1 ) .H e n c e ,m e t a g e n o m ed a t as e t sc o r -responding to each peat layer at T5 (day 232) were coassembled to improve binning accu-racy. Acidobacteria comprised more than 50% of the overall microbial community in eachmetagenome, and their relative abundance increased in each peat layer, post O2exposure(Fig. S1; Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a P-value of ,0.05). In total, 12 medium-qualityto high-quality (i.e., .70% complete with ,10% redundancy) metagenome-assembledgenomes (MAGs) of Acidobacteria were obtained (Table 1). Five of these were classi ﬁed asthe genus Terracidiphillus , and the remaining seven were classi ﬁed as Holophaga .T h e s etwo genera fall within SDs 1 and 8, classes Acidobaceriia and Holophagae , respectively.The Terracidiphillus MAGs were obtained from the UNS and BWT peat layers, predomi-nantly from the continuously anoxic incubations. One of the ﬁveTerracidiphilus genomes(i.e., 10BWT4) was obtained from a redox-oscillated (i.e., 10% O2pretreatment) BWT layermetagenome. In contrast, all seven Holophaga MAGs were obtained from O2-pretreatedincubations of the three peat layers. We adopt the following naming convention for theMAGs: “oxygen pretreatment-peat layer-MAG ID ”;f o re x a m p l e , ‘0BWT1 ’refers to MAGnumber 1 obtained from a BWT metagenome coassembly from the continuously anoxic(0% O2pretreatment) incubations.On a concatenated ribosomal protein phylogenomic tree, the SD 8 Holophaga MAGsformed a monophyletic sister clade to the previously described Holophaga , which suggeststhat the MAGs assembled here represent novel, uncharacterized Holophaga lineages(Fig. 1A). Six of these MAGs represent a species-level cluster, sharing .97% average nucle-otide identity (ANI) among them (Fig. 1B). The seventh MAG, 5AWT5, shares up to 82% ANIwith the remaining Holophaga genomes (Fig. 1B), and, therefore, likely represents a closelyrelated species. To avoid redundancy in functional comparisons, we limit later analyses tothree MAGs within the Holophaga cluster, namely, 5AWT5, 5AWT2, and 5UNS4, chosenbased on genome quality estimates (Table 1) and phylogenetic novelty (i.e., likely repre-senting distinct, uncharacterized lineages) (Fig. 1A).The SD 1 Terracidiphilus MAGs were more phylogenetically diverse than the HolophagaMAGs (Fig. 1A) and shared a relatively lower ANI of 78% with each other (Fig. 1B). Similarto the Holophaga MAGs, the Terracidiphilus MAGs represent uncultivated lineages, as indi-cated by their relative phylogenetic divergence from cultivated members within SD 1(i.e., Terracidiphilus gaucii SbA5, Terracidiphilus savannae ,a n d Terracidiphilus gabretensis )(Fig. 1A). The majority of the reference genomes within the Terracidiphilus genus clusterare MAGs assembled from permafrost metagenomes from the Stordalen Mire in Sweden(21). Three MAGs assembled in our study, 0BWT2, 0UNS4, and 0UNS5, represent particu-larly undersampled lineages within Terracidiphilus as a single reference genome, UBA1307(assembled from a wetland surface sediment metagenome in [50]; JGI project ID:1079308), clustered with these MAGs in the phylogenomic tree (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1 Metagenome-assembled genome statistics and taxonomic classi ﬁcationsaMAG Contigs Completion % Redundancy % Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species0BWT1 42 99.56 0 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Acidobacteriae Acidobacteriales Acidobacteriaceae Terracidiphilus ND0BWT2 747 86.17 5.36 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Acidobacteriae Acidobacteriales Acidobacteriaceae Terracidiphilus ND0UNS4 36 97.84 0.862 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Acidobacteriae Acidobacteriales Acidobacteriaceae Terracidiphilus ND0UNS5 274 93.53 1.873 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Acidobacteriae Acidobacteriales Acidobacteriaceae Terracidiphilus ND10AWT2 551 94 6.213 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND10BWT3 936 83.5 1.754 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND10BWT4 718 75.29 3.663 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Acidobacteriae Acidobacteriales Acidobacteriaceae Terracidiphilus ND10UNS1 1067 80.7 0 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND5AWT2 143 95.33 0.877 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND5AWT5 348 79.4 2.85 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND5BWT7 948 92.21 4.191 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga ND5UNS4 305 96 1.151 Bacteria Acidobacteriota Holophagae Holophagales Holophagaceae Holophaga NDaND, not determined.Niche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 4Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.In order to understand ﬁner-scale variations in the abundances of the Acidobacteria subli-neages, we recruited metagenomic reads against each MAG and compared the percentagesof mapped reads across sampling time points as crude proxies for their relative abundances(Fig. 1C). In the continuously anoxic incubations, Terracidiphilus MAGs recruited 13 to 16% ofthe total metagenomic reads at the ﬁnal time point, representing an approximately 900%increase in relative abundance from the beginning of the incubation, when these MAGs to-gether recruited only ;1.5% of the total reads across all peat layers (Fig. 1C). In stark contrastto the anoxic control incubations, the peat samples pretreated with O2yielded a differenttaxonomic pro ﬁle, as these latter incubations were progressively enriched in Holophaga .Accordingly, the Terracidiphilus MAGs recruited a considerably lower proportion of readsfrom the redox-oscillated metagenomes compared to the anoxic controls (Fig. 1C).While a redox-related differential enrichment of the Terracidiphilus and Holophaga wasevident in each peat layer tested, there were notable differences in the population struc-tures of the two groups between peat layers. The continuously anoxic UNS and BWTlayers appeared to harbor phylogenetically distinct Terracidiphilus populations at the endof the experiment (Fig. 1C). In the unsaturated layer, over 12% of the total mapped readsrecruited against the MAGs 0UNS4 and 0UNS5 at the ﬁnal time point (Fig. 1C). In contrast,the BWT layer appeared to be dominated by the lineages 0BWT1 and 0BWT2 (Fig. 1C).Moreover, a different Terracidiphilus lineage, represented by the MAG 10BWT4 (Fig. 1A),appeared to dominate in the O2-pretreated samples (Fig. 1C). This genome recruited 2 to3% of the total reads in each layer in the O2-shifted incubations while only recruiting,1% of the reads in the anoxic control incubations. The O2-pretreated BWT layers stillharbored the Terracidiphilus lineages found to be abundant in the anoxic BWT metage-nomes (i.e., 0BWT1 and 0BWT2), albeit at notably lower abundances (Fig. 1C). Interlayerdifferences were much less pronounced for Holophaga , even though the relatively diver-gent 5AWT5 appeared to be more abundant in the AWT layer than in the UNS and BWTlayers, particularly in the incubations that were pretreated with 5% O2in the headspace(Fig. 1C).FIG 1 (A) Maximum likelihood phylogenomic tree inferred using a concatenated alignment of select ribosomal proteins.

MAG metabolicreconstructions suggest a clear distinction between Holophaga and Terracidiphilus interms of their carbon degradation potential. Carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) pro-ﬁles (Fig. 2; Table S1) reveal the preponderance of various polysaccharide lyases andglycosyl hydrolases (GHs) in the Terracidiphilus genomes, suggesting the relative enrich-ment of cellulolytic capabilities in this genus compared to Holophaga (Fig. 2). The pre-dicted CAZyme functions for Terracidiphilus include the ability to degrade pectin, chitin,hemicellulose (including xylan), glucan, pullulan, and starch (Fig. 2; Table S1). While theHolophaga MAGs also harbor several hydrolytic enzymes that potentially target starch,glucan, and xylan (Fig. 2), the corresponding GH families appear to be distinct fromthose found in Terracidiphilus (Table S1). Polysaccharide lyases are only annotated in theTerracidiphilus genomes, putatively targeting alginate, pectin, hyaluronan, glucuronan,and chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 2). CAZymes with auxiliary activities (AA) appear to have arelatively patchy distribution among the two groups (Fig. 2).Both Holophaga and Terracidiphilus populations appear to utilize various polysaccharideoligomers; however, notable differences exist in their genomic potential for carbohydrateuptake and utilization. For example, the ability to utilize mannose and trehalose appears tobe restricted to certain Terracidiphilus lineages, while fucose and fructose utilization potentialis patchier within this lineage compared to the Holophaga (Fig. 2). Transporter genes identi-ﬁed within each MAG further support the carbon-based niche differentiation between thetwo genera. Holophaga genomes are particularly enriched in membrane transporters (11 to13% of the total predicted protein coding genes, compared to ,7% in the Terracidiphilusgenomes), most of which are predicted to be various carbohydrate and sugar transporters(Fig. S2). Notably, several of the monosaccharide and oligosaccharide transporters with pre-dicted substrate speci ﬁcities (e.g., ribose, rhamnose, xylose, and glucan transporters) identi-ﬁed across the Holophaga genomes are not present in the relatively divergent Holophagag e n o m e ,5 A W T 5( F i g .2 ) .I nc o n t r a s t , Terracidiphillus MAGs contain relatively fewer carbohy-drate transporters and generally have fewer amino acid transporters with speci ﬁc predictedsubstrate af ﬁnities (Fig. S2). Both groups, however, appear to be capable of taking up aminoacids, oligopeptides, and dipeptides (Fig. S2).AllHolophaga MAGs, except the relatively distant lineage 5AWT5, contain a homo-log of AA6 benzoquinone reductase, which is potentially involved in the intracellularreduction of aromatic compounds. In contrast, a putative vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (AA4)is solely found in the 5AWT5 genome (Fig. 2), and it is potentially involved in the oxi-doreduction of phenolic compounds derived from lignin degradation. A homolog ofthe laccase-like polyphenol oxidase previously characterized in Acidobacteria (51) wasfound in the Terracidiphilus MAG 10BWT4. Notably, this MAG was particularly enrichedpost-oxygenation in the treatment incubations (Fig. 1C).Consistent with the predicted fermentative lifestyle of the Holophaga ,v a r i o u sc l a s s e so fputatively hydrogen-evolving [FeFe] hydrogenases were detected in these genomes(Fig. S3). These include the group A3 and group B fermentative hydrogen-evolving hydroge-nases, as well was the group C putatively sensory hydrogenases typically found in anaerobic,fermentative bacteria (52). Terracidiphilus MAGs generally lack these [FeFe] hydrogenasesand instead encode various [NiFe] hydrogenases (Fig. S3). These include group 1 respiratoryhydrogen-oxidizing hydrogenases (Groups 1c and 1d), group 3 putatively bidirectionalhydrogenases (3b and 3d), and group 4 respiratory hydrogenases (4b and 4d). A formate de-hydrogenase was found in the group 4b hydrogenase gene cluster, suggesting the potentialfor coupling formate oxidation to proton reduction (Table S2).The capacity for O2respiration is found within both Terracidiphilus and Holophaga .High-af ﬁnity, cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases are found in some of the TerracidiphilusMAGs, while all of the Holophaga genomes encode low-af ﬁnity, aa3-type cytochrome coxidases (Fig. 2). The genomes of both genera also encode several genes for dealingwith oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase, catalase peroxidase, and alkylhydroperoxidase.Niche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 6Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.FIG 2 Selected metabolic features across the assembled genomes.

The genetic potential for N2ﬁxation ispresent in 5 of the Holophaga genomes (excluding the relatively divergent MAG 5AWT5)and in 3 of the Terracidiphilus genomes. Particularly intriguing is the presence of alternativenitrogenase systems in several MAGs, which use a vanadium-iron (V-Fe) or an iron-iron (Fe-Fe) cofactor instead of the canonical molybdenum-iron (Mo-Fe) cofactor. The vanadiumnitrogenase (Vnf) sequences encoded in the Holophaga genomes cluster nearest to Vnfproteins from Paenibacillus durus , a diazotrophic Firmicute (sharing 80.6%, 80.3%, and69.4% identities with the P. durus VnfH, VnfD, and VnfK sequences, respectively) (Fig. 3A).The Vnf neighborhoods in these MAGs include a dinitrogen reductase ( nifH), the Vnf-spe-ciﬁcvnfG subunit alongside the nitrogenase alpha and beta subunits (i.e., vnfD and vnfK),as well as several genes involved in V-Fe cofactor biosynthesis ( vnfE,N,a n d B)( F i g .3 B ) .I naddition to the V-nitrogenase system, multiple copies of the molybdenum nitrogenase(Mo-Nase) genes, nifK,nifD,a n d nifB, are found scattered along the Nif-positive Holophagagenomes. Only two of these clusters contain a nifH gene. Therefore, these two were usedin phylogenetic analyses. The longest of the two clusters includes the nifK,nifD,nifB,nifH,andnifXgenes in close proximity. When placed within the Nif/Vnf/AnfHDK protein phylog-eny, the nifH,nifD,a n d nifKsequences from this neighborhood clustered with sequencesfrom Holophaga foetida NifHDK within the Nif-II cluster (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, sequences inthe second NifHDK cluster (which does not include any of the additional structural genes)form a deeply rooted clade that is basal to the uncharacterized, putatively nonfunctionalNif sequences reported previously (53) (Fig. 3A). Given the missing cofactor biosynthesisgenes and the deeply resolving phylogenetic placement, we suspect that these genes maynot produce a functional nitrogenase.In contrast to the Holophaga , the nitrogenase-positive Terracidiphilus MAGs are missingthe canonical Mo-Nases. This is unusual, as alternative nitrogenases have thus far onlyFIG 3 (A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of a concatenated alignment of the nitrogenase reductase (NifH), and nitrogenase alphaa n db e t as u b u n i t s( N i f / V n f / A n f D K ) ,a l o n gw i t ht h er e f e r e n c es e q u e n c e sc o m p i l e di nG a r c i ae ta l . ,2 0 2 0( 7 8 ) .N i fc l u s t e ri d e n t i ﬁcations arebased on Garcia et al., 2020 (78).

Lacking evidence that the Mo-Nase is trulymissing in these genomes, we attribute the absence of Mo-Nase to genome fragmentationand incompleteness (Table 1). However, the Anf and Vnf gene clusters in these genomesappear to be suf ﬁcient to produce a functional nitrogenase enzyme, as indicated by thepresence of various genes required for cofactor biosynthesis (Fig. 3B). The TerracidiphilusMAG 0BWT1 harbors Vnf subunits (subunits D, G, and K) in a continuous gene cluster thatincludes a nifH and several genes required for Ve-Fe cofactor assembly. An organizationallysimilar gene cluster is also found in two other Terracidiphilus genomes (0UNS4 and 0UNS5),except that the D, G, and K subunits appear to represent the Fe-only Nase (Anf) gene subu-nits (Fig. 3A). Thus, our data posits the presence of either V-based or Fe-based diazotrophicpotential within Terracidiphilus , potentially alongside the canonical Mo-based diazotrophy.The presence of the alternative nitrogenase systems in Terracidiphilus might belinked to the phylogenetic relatedness of these genomes, as the two Anf-positive MAGs(0UNS4 and 0UNS5) are more closely related to each other than to the Vnf-containing0BWT1 (Fig. 1A). The Holophaga genomes also contained Vnf genes; however, theVnfHDK sequences in the Terracidiphilus MAG 0BWT1 are phylogenetically distinct fromthose found within the Holophaga genomes; the former forms a sister lineageto proteobacterial Vnf sequences, whereas the Holophaga sequences cluster withFirmicute-derived and methanogen-derived Vnf sequences (Fig. 3A). The AnfHDKsequences found in the Terracidiphilus genomes form a basal cluster to all of the charac-terized Anf sequences included in the phylogenetic analysis, except for the more deeplydiverging sequences from Clostridium pasteurianum (Fig. 3A).DISCUSSIONMicrobial community succession patterns following redox shifts in peatlands are im-portant in determining the fate of the peat carbon stock, which accounts for ;20 to30% of the soil carbon reservoir (54). As demonstrated in (26), the restructuring of mi-crobial communities can have signi ﬁcant impacts on peat biogeochemistry, particularlyon the emissions of greenhouse active gases, such as CO2and CH4. While O2-inducedchanges in the peat microbial community and the resulting enhancement of CH4ﬂuxeswere demonstrated based on 16S rRNA gene abundances and geochemical measure-ments (26), the mechanisms explaining the differential enrichment of the dominantacidobacterial lineages remained unclear. Our genome-centric approach enabled adetailed resolution of the mechanisms of niche differentiation within this abundantphylum across the O2treatments.The distinct carbon substrate preferences of Holophaga and Terracidiphilus ,a sinferred based on the MAG metabolic reconstructions in this study, point to the vitalrole that O2levels play in the ecophysiology of these two lineages in peat systems.The apparent enrichment of Terracidiphilus lineages within continuously anoxic peatcontrol incubations is likely linked to their metabolic ﬂexibility, which includes theability to ferment a variety of plant polymers, as evidenced by the diverse CAZymeproﬁle. The Stordalen Mire genomes (21), which constitute the majority of the pres-ently available Terracidiphilus reference genomes (Fig. 1A), also harbored the abilityto degrade diverse polysaccharides. Moreover, Acidobacteriales , which fall within thesame class ( Acidobacteriia )a s Terracidiphilus ,h a v eb e e nf o u n dt ob ea b u n d a n ti nanoxic peat layers in the ﬁe l d( 2 2 ) ,s u g g e s t i n gt h a tt h i sl i n e a g em a yb eak e yp l a y e rin peat OM degradation under anoxic conditions. The Holophaga , in contrast, appearto have a limited ability to directly degrade large biopolymers (Fig. 2) and mayinstead bene ﬁt from the breakdown products of polysaccharide hydrolysis that canbe acquired using the diverse repertoire of transporters found in these genomes(Fig. S2).The presence of high-af ﬁnity and low-af ﬁnity terminal oxidases in Terracidiphilusand Holophaga , respectively, suggests that each lineage may be able to respire O2under aerobic or microaerobic conditions. However, these terminal oxidases, particu-larly the low-af ﬁnity aa3-type, can function in O2scavenging in addition to respirationNiche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 9Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.(5). Indeed, the Holophaga isolate H. foetida harbors a low-af ﬁnity terminal oxidase, de-spite being described as obligately anaerobic (5). The potential for aerobic respirationin these lineages therefore requires further experimental validation. The various respi-ratory uptake hydrogenases within Terracidiphilus point to a potentially broader rangeof respiratory strategies for this genus, including the ability to couple proton reductionwith energy conservation (group 4d hydrogenases) and respiration involving formate,fumarate, and O2(groups 4b, 1d, and 1c) (Table S2) (52).The differential enrichment of the Acidobacteria lineages in response to the O2treat-ment (Fig. 1C) appears to result largely from the O2stimulating the degradation of poly-phenolic and other complex plant compounds (26), which provides additional carbon andenergy ﬂux for anaerobic carbon conversions, possibly supported by the removal of thephenolic inhibition of hydrolase activity (27, 55). The subsequent increases in the ﬂuxes ofcarbohydrate oligomers will fuel fermentation, ultimately increasing the substrate ﬂux tomethanogenesis (Fig. 4). Metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene data previously indicated anenrichment of phenol oxidase-harboring Novosphingobium in peat incubations followingoxygenation (26). Wilmoth et al. (26) previously noted that the enhanced consumption ofphenolics by these organisms in the presence of O2may have contributed to the enrich-ment of Holophaga during the subsequent anoxic period, as the latter were likely able toutilize the greater ﬂuxes of carbohydrate oligomers, as demonstrated by our analysis, reveal-ing diverse substrate uptake and utilization strategies in the Holophaga genomes. We wereable to assemble two Novosphingobium MAGs that encode a putative polyphenol oxidase, acatechol dioxygenase, and several polyphenol oxidoreductases which putatively target phe-nolic compounds in the presence of O2. In addition, some aromatic compounds may bedirectly broken down by Holophaga , as the genomes encode enzymes with predicted intra-cellular aromatic degradation activity. The MAG analysis further suggests fermentative H2production by the Holophaga , which potentially contributes to the elevated methane pro-duction by the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium .T h e Terracidiphilus , de-spite sharing several fermentative metabolic pathways with the Holophaga ,y e th a r -boring a lower diversity of oligomer transporters, were likely outcompeted by thelatter due to the elevated oligosaccharide ﬂuxes during the anoxic phase after the O2exposure period. While the anoxic UNS and BWT layers had distinctly differentTerracidiphilus lineages at the end of the experiment in the anoxic incubations, anysuch distinction in the O2-exposed peat was largely eclipsed by the enrichment ofHolophaga ,a sw e l la st h ed i s t a n t Terracidiphilus lineage 10BWT4, across all layersFIG 4 (A) Schematic showing the role of Acidobacteria subpopulations in carbon ﬂow in the peat slurryincubations in response to the O2shift treatments, inferred based on genomic data. In the continuouslyanoxic incubations, Terracidiphilus -mediated carbon ﬂow is predominantly from plant polymers to CO2,H2,and, ultimately, CH4.E x p o s u r et oO2stimulates the breakdown of aromatic compounds, predominantlymediated by the aerobic bacterial genus Novosphingobium . This promotes the enrichment of Holophaga ,which are specialized in sugar oligomer degradation. The higher CO2and H2ﬂuxes due to the Holophaga -mediated fermentation of sugar oligomers leads to enhanced CH4production in peat pretreated with O2.Panels (B) and (C) summarize key metabolic features of the Terracidiphilus and Holophaga MAGs, respectively.VFAs, volatile fatty acids; Nase, nitrogenase; cbb3, cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase; aa3, aa3-type cytochromeco x i d a s e ;M o ,m o l y b d e n u m ;V ,v a n a d i u m ;F e ,i r o n .Niche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 10Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.(Fig. 1C). Notably, the enrichment of the relatively divergent lineage 10BWT4 in theO2-shifted peat (Fig. 1C) may be explained by the presence of a laccase-like phenoloxidase in this genome (51), which is missing in the remaining Terracidiphi-lusgenomes.Sphagnum carbon degradation and nitrogen ﬁxation. Sphagnum-derived organicmatter forms the basis of the microbial food chain in sphagnum-dominated peatlands (17).Consistent with recent work identifying Acidobacteria as the major degraders of sphag-num-derived polysaccharides in peat bogs (21, 22), the Terracidiphilus GH pro ﬁles suggesthydrolytic capabilities that speci ﬁcally target sphagnum-derived polysaccharides, includingrhamnogalacturonan or “sphagnan ”(22). Our data indicate a larger role for Terracidiphiluslineages in sphagnan breakdown than for Holophaga , indicated by the preponderance ofrhanogalacturonan-speci ﬁc CAZymes (both GHs and carbohydrate esterases) in theTerracidiphilus genomes (summarized under “pectin ”in Fig. 2, with detailed annotationspresented in Table S1). Sphagnan degradation releases various monosaccharides, such asarabinose, mannose, and rhamnose, and both Holophaga andTerracidiphilus MAGs encodedegradative enzymes that putatively target these compounds (Fig. 2).The microbial degradation of the relatively nutrient-poor sphagnum litter yields littlenitrogen (17), and the external input of nitrogen into acidic peatlands is primarily fromatmospheric deposition (47). Biological nitrogen ﬁxation in sphagnum-dominated peatsystems has been attributed to sphagnum-associated methanotrophs, with potentialcontributions from Cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria (38, 39, 47, 56, and referen-ces therein). The relative importance of methanotrophs as nitrogen ﬁxers in peat systemshas been challenged in recent years based on observations suggesting the lack of diazo-trophy stimulation by higher levels of methane (38). At least in surface peat, diazotrophyappears to be mediated by Alphaproteobacteria (38, 57). To the best of our knowledge,diazotrophy in peatlands has yet to be linked to Acidobacteria. Even more intriguing isthe presence of alternative nitrogenase systems in the MAGs described here. Alternativenitrogenases (alt-Nases) containing vanadium (V) or iron (Fe) only are typically used asbackup systems when the molybdenum (Mo) supporting the more comprehensively ef ﬁ-cient Mo-Nase system is limited (58, 59). Biogeochemical processes, including BNF, inpeatlands can be affected by trace metal limitation (37). A previous study examining thenitrogenase diversity and activity in peat soils reported that the alt-Nases comprise ,5%of the overall nitrogenase abundance across soil depths, although the Mo concentrationsin surface peat were over 3-fold lower than the levels of V (38). The alt-Nase sequences pre-viously recovered in (38) clustered with vnfD/anfD sequences from Proteobacteria, whilethose found in our MAGs were phylogenetically most similar to Firmicute alt-Nases, sug-gesting potential lateral gene acquisition (Fig. 3A). Given the notably high relative abun-dance of Acidobacteria observed in peat systems, their potential for contributing to BNFand the trace metal conditions supporting those contributions in these habitats warrantfurther investigation.Conclusions. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of peat carbon degrada-tion to CO2and CH4,s p e c i ﬁcally the controls imparted by microbial functional guilds, iscritical for climate change mitigation efforts. A genome-centric approach that comple-ments conventional amplicon-based analyses is particularly instrumental in constrainingpopulation-speci ﬁco rl i n e a g e - s p e c i ﬁc metabolic strategies that ultimately govern carbonﬂuxes in complex systems. Our genome-centered metagenomic analysis of peatAcidobacteria supports the previously identi ﬁed roles of these microbes as key car-bon degraders and also provides additional phylogenetic and metabolic resolutionon lineage-speci ﬁc contributions to peat carbon transformations under varyingredox regimes. We ﬁnd that different Acidobacteria populations are differentiallyinﬂuenced by the redox oscillations resulting from O2ﬂuctuations. The metabolicallyversatile Terracidiphilus dominate under anoxic conditions, while O2exposure leadsto the enrichment of Holophaga , which has a more limited polysaccharide degrada-tion potential but an enhanced potential for oligosaccharide utilization. Consistentwith previously outlined microbially-driven carbon ﬂows (26), under elevated oligo-saccharide ﬂuxes resulting from the O2-stimulated breakdown of complex aromaticNiche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 11Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.and carbohydrate-bearing biopolymers in peat, the Holophaga appear to outcom-pete Terracidiphilus , ultimately leading to an enhanced substrate ﬂow toward meth-anogenesis. Importantly, our data also suggest a previously unrecognized role ofAcidobacteria in peat nitrogen cycling, as the potential for diazotrophy was found inboth the Holophaga and the Terracidiphilus genomes. Particularly intriguing is thepresence of divergent forms of both canonical and alternative nitrogenase systems inthese lineages. Our results map out a more phylogenetically and metabolically resolvedview of the ecophysiology of peat Acidobacteria in relation to O2-driven redox ﬂuctuationsand invite further investigation into their roles in carbon and nitrogen transformations inpeat and other soil systems that are sensitive to global change.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample collection, incubation set up, and metagenome sequencing. Detailed descriptions of samplecollection, processing, and sequencing are provided in (26). Brie ﬂy, peat samples of three distinct layers (i.e.,unsaturated, below water table, and above water table) collected from the Ward Reservation (Andover, MA,USA) were ground into layer-speci ﬁc slurries with ﬁltered porewater (10% vol/vol) while continuously beingﬂushed with nitrogen gas (N2). For each layer type, 90 mL of slurry material were added to 160 mL serumvials that were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum seals. The vials were either incubated undercontinuously anoxic conditions for 232 days, or exposed to O2for 98 days, followed by anoxic incubation for134 days. The O2pretreatment involved either a 5% or 10% vol/vol addition of O2in the incubation head-space via ﬂushing with a mixture of analytical grade air and 100% N2. Anoxic conditions were established byﬂushing the serum vials that contained the peat slurries with 100% N2gas. The samples for molecular analy-ses were subsampled from the incubation slurries using a sterile needle attached to a Leur-lock syringe,which was ﬂushed with 100% N2gas prior to sampling to preserve the anoxic conditions. The slurry sampleswere collected on days 21, 98, 126, 198, and 232, which we sequentially denote as time points 1 to 5 (T1 toT5). Total nucleic acids from the slurry subsamples were extracted with the RNeasy PowerSoil Total RNA Kit(Qiagen). Puri ﬁed DNA was eluted with the PowerSoil DNA Elution Kit (Qiagen) and used for metagenomicsequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform at Molecular Research LP (MR DNA). The RNA extracts were notused in sequencing due to poor quality.Metagenome assembly, genome binning, and taxonomic classi ﬁcation. Raw sequence librariesdeposited in the Sequence Read Archive (accession no. PRJNA551662), as indicated in (26 ), were usedfor assembly and binning. Paired-end reads were quality- ﬁltered by using Trimmomatic (v0.39) (60). Asliding window of size 10 was used to remove bases with a Phred quality score of ,28. Reads that wereat least 75 bp long were retained for downstream processing. Read quality metrics obtained via FastQC(v0.11.9) (61) were used to guide the quality- ﬁltering step. Assembly was performed using MEGAHIT(v1.2.9) (62, 63), using the k-mers 21, 33, 55, 77, 99, and 127. The read libraries originating from eachpeat layer at the ﬁnal time point were coassembled. DNA from earlier time points were pooled forsequencing owing to low yield (26), and the resulting read libraries were assembled individually. Contigslonger than 2,000 bp were subsequently binned using MetaBAT2 (v1.12.1) (64) and MaxBin2 (v2.2.7) (65,66). The bin re ﬁnement module in metaWRAP (v1.2) (67) was used to re ﬁne the assembled bins, whichinvolved reassembly using SPAdes (v3.13.0) (68) to improve the assembly quality. Genomes were furtherreﬁned by removing outlier contigs identi ﬁed based on tetranuleotide frequencies, GC content, knowncontaminants, and clade markers, using default parameters for each module in the MAGpurify package(v2.1.2) (69). CheckM (v1.0.13) (70) was used to assess genome completion and redundancy, and thosewith an estimated completeness of $70% and a contamination of ,10% were retained for downstreamanalyses. The Genome Taxonomy Database toolkit (GTDB-tk) Release 05-RS95 (71) was used to obtaintaxonomic classi ﬁcations for the assembled genomes.Genome annotations and functional inference. Prodigal (v2.6.3) (72) was used to predict protein-coding genes, followed by initial functional annotations using Prokka (v1.14.5) (73). GhostKOALA (74) andeggNOG-mapper (75, 76) were used to obtain KO annotations, which were then used for metabolicreconstructions via the “Reconstruct Pathway ”tool in KEGG Mapper (77). SEED annotations wereobtained from the online Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) server (78). Annotationsfor genes of interest were compared across the various annotation tool outputs and double-checked byBLASTP searches against the NCBI nonredundant protein, RefSeq, and UniprotKB/Swiss-port databases.Neighborhood comparisons were also employed to improve con ﬁdence in annotations (e.g., nitroge-nases). TransportDB (v2.0) (79) was used to predict transporters and their putative substrates. CAZymeannotations were obtained via the dbCAN meta server (80), using amino acid sequences for each genomeas queries. The dbCAN runs were conducted using both HMMER and DIAMOND searches with default pa-rameters, and the results were interpreted using the CAZy database (81). CAZyme annotations agreedupon by both HMMER and DIAMOND were retained for downstream analysis.Phylogenetic analyses. Reference Acidobacteria genomes were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank data-base, based on the Acidobacteria reference tree in GTDB R202 (82). Conserved ribosomal marker genes wereextracted from both the reference genomes and the MAGs using the phylogenomics module in Anvi ’o( v 7 )(83). The following marker genes were included in the analysis: ribosomal proteins S12_S23, L1, L13, L14, L16,L17, L18p, L19, L2, L20, L21p, L22, L23, L27, L27A, L28, L29, L3, L32p, L35p, L4, L5, L6, L9_C, S10, S11, S13, S15,S16, S17, S19, S2, S20p, S3_C, S6, S7, S8, and S9. A concatenated alignment was generated using MUSCLE(v3.8.1551) (84), and trimAL (v1.4.rev15) (85) was used to trim the alignment using the ﬂags “-gt 0.80 ”and “-stNiche Differentiation among Peat Acidobacteria mSystemsSeptember/October 2022 Volume 7 Issue 5 10.1128/msystems.00055-22 12Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.0.001 ”. The trimmed alignment was used as the input in IQ-TREE (v2.1.3) (86) to generate a maximum likeli-hood phylogenomic tree, using 1,000 bootstrap replicates with ultrafast bootstrap approximation (87). Thetree was visualized in FigTree ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ ﬁgtree/)a n dm o d i ﬁed in Inkscape ( https://inkscape.org ) to highlight clusters of interest.The amino acid sequences compiled in (53) were used as the references for a nitrogenase phylogeneticanalysis. Sequences of nitrogenase reductase (NifH), along with nitrogenase alpha and beta subunits (i.e.,NifD and NifK, respectively), retrieved from the MAGs, were aligned with corresponding reference sequencesusing MAFFT (v7.475) (88). The three individual alignments were concatenated and used for phylogenetic in-ference using IQ-TREE (v2.1.3) (86) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic clusters were identi ﬁedbased on the classi ﬁcation presented in (53).Hydrogenase homologs were identi ﬁed in each genome using a DIAMOND BLASTP search (89) of trans-lated sequences against a protein database generated by using the reference hydrogenase sequences com-piled in (52). Hits with a minimum E value of 1E 2100 were retained for downstream analyses. Sequenceswere aligned using MAFFT (v7.475) (88) and trimmed using trimAL (v1.4.rev15) (85) with the ﬂags “-gt 0.8 ”and “-cons 60 ”. Finally, IQ-TREE (v2.1.3) (86) was used to generate a maximum likelihood tree using thetrimmed alignment. The tree was visualized and edited in iTol (v6) (90).Data availability.
