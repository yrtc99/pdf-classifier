The good news is that anincreased understanding of the nature and extent of microbial diversity innatural habitats coupled with the application of new technologies inmicrobiology and chemistry is opening up new strategies in the search for newspecialized products with therapeutic properties. This review explores thepremise that harsh environmental conditions in extreme biomes, notably indeserts, permafrost soils and deep-sea sediments select for micro-organisms,especially actinobacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi, with the potential tosynthesize new druggable molecules. There is evidence over the past decadethat micro-organisms adapted to life in extreme habitats are a rich source ofnew specialized metabolites. Extreme habitats by their very nature tend to befragile hence there is a need to conserve those known to be hot-spots of novelgifted micro-organisms needed to drive drug discovery campaigns andinnovative biotechnology. This review also provides an overview of microbial-derived molecules and their biological activities focusing on the period from2010 until 2018, over this time 186 novel structures were isolated from 129representatives of microbial taxa recovered from extreme habitats.IntroductionMicro-organisms remain the most promising source ofnovel specialized (secondary) metabolites as the chemicaldiversity of these compounds cannot be matched cur-rently by that of chemical libraries (Krug and M €uller2014) hence the continued interest in the search for newnatural products (NP) needed to drive innovativebiotechnology (Katz and Baltz 2016). In recent times, thequest for novel bioactive molecules, especially those thatcan be developed to control multidrug-resistant patho-gens and treat chronic conditions such as cancer,dementia and epilepsy has been focused on the isolation,characterization (taxonomy) and dereplication (assign-ment of isolates to taxonomically meaningful groups) ofpreviously unknown micro-organisms isolated from theextremobiosphere (Bull 2011; Horikoshi and Bull 2011;Bull and Goodfellow 2019).The extremobiosphere encompasses a broad range ofbiomes that include hyperarid deserts, deep-sea sedimentsand permafrost soils, as well as acid and high-tempera-ture environments. Such extreme habitats are character-ized by combinations of environmental variables such asanoxia, aridity, extreme temperatures, low concentrationsJournal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 630Journal of Applied Microbiology ISSN 1364-5072Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 2023of organic matter, high salinity and intense irradiation.The search for new bioactive compounds from theextremobiosphere rests on the premise that harsh abioticconditions select for novel micro-organisms that expressnew chemistry (Okoro et al. 2009). Micro-organismswhich live optimally under extreme conditions are con-sidered to be extremophiles (Macelroy 1974), whereasthose that can tolerate such conditions are described asbeing extremotolerant.It is well known that actinobacteria from the phylumActinobacteria ( sensu Goodfellow 2012) have a uniquecapacity to synthesize new drug leads (B /C19erdy 2012; Genil-loud 2017). These organisms, notably Streptomyces ,account for around 70% of known antibiotics, includingmost of those in clinical use (Newman and Cragg 2016).The recent discovery that ﬁlamentous actinobacteria withlarge genomes contain many NP-biosynthetic gene clusters(NP-BGCs) which express for unknown drug leads partlyaccounts for the increased focus on these micro-organismsin bioprospecting campaigns (Bull and Goodfellow 2019).Especially gifted actinobacteria that have moderate or largegenomes ( ~5/C10–7/C19a n d >8/C10 MB respectively) harbourmany NP-BGCs (20 –19 and >30 respectively) (Baltz 2017,2019; Nouioui et al. 2019) are at the premium in thesearch for new chemical leads using state-of-art-technolo-gies, such as genome mining (Harvey et al. 2015; Goodfel-low et al. 2018). Other micro-organisms with largegenomes laden with NP-BGCs include cyanobacteria(Vijayakumar and Menakha 2015), ktedonobacteria (Zhenget al. 2019), myxobacteria (Hoffmann et al. 2018) andfungi (Keller et al. 2005). Indeed, members of all of thesetaxa have been highlighted as potential candidates for drugdiscovery programmes (Dixit and Suseela 2013; Micallefet al. 2015; Baltz 2019; Keller 2019). In light of these devel-opments, it clearly makes good sense to focus bioprospect-ing campaigns on micro-organisms with moderate to largegenomes. Another important development is the realiza-tion that in some actinobacterial taxa, such as the generaAmycolatopsis ,Frankia andMicromonospora , there is a linkbetween the distribution of NP-BGCs and phylogeny(Adamek et al. 2018; Carro et al 2018a; Nouioui et al.2019). In addition, information drawn from whole-gen-ome sequences is providing fascinating insights into howmicro-organisms adapt to extreme habitats, as witnessedby the ability of members of the actinobacterial familyGeodermatophilaceae to withstand extreme environmentalconditions that prevail in hyperarid desert habitats (Castroet al. 2018a, 2018bb).The steps involved in culture-dependent NP discoverypipelines are outlined in Fig. 1. The initial step, the selectionof environmental samples is followed by the selective isola-tion, dereplication and generation of microbial strainlibraries. Subsequent steps involve the detection of bioactivecompounds from representatives of strain libraries, primaryscreening of fermentation broths and associated biomassextracts, and chemical dereplication of extracts followed bysecondary fermentation using production media. Structuraldetermination of drug leads and biological testing of puri-ﬁed compounds is the ﬁnal stage in this process. At all ofthese stages, the application of technological developmentsand associated bioinformatic procedures in microbiology,molecular biology and chemistry minimizes the costly redis-covery of known compounds which until recently bedevilledbioprospecting campaigns (Baltz 2017).This review is designed to determine the extent towhich micro-organisms, notably actinobacteria, cyanobac-teria and fungi isolated from diverse extreme habitats area rich source of new drug leads of potential value in agri-culture, industry and medicine. To this end, we not onlydiscuss the microbiology of speciﬁc extreme habitats butalso relationships between dereplicated micro-organismsand their ability to synthesize diverse chemical classes ofspecialized metabolites.DesertsUntil recently, deserts received little attention frommicrobiologists even though they account for around20% of the landmass on the planet (Laity 2009). Deserthabitats are challenging for micro-organisms, notably thescarcity of water. Several pilot studies have been carriedout to establish the microbial ﬂora of nonpolar deserts(Kurapova et al. 2012; Tiwari et al. 2015; Ouchari et al.2018) but the most extensive studies of cultivable micro-bial diversity in desert biomes have been focused on sitesin the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile (Bull et al.2016, 2018a; Bull and Goodfellow 2019). The locationand abiotic conditions associated with this temperate,nonpolar desert have been the subject of several reviews(Azua-Bustos et al. 2012; Cordero et al. 2018) and itsuniqueness highlighted (Bullet al. 2016). Microbial sur-veys of Atacama Desert soils and regoliths have beenfocused on the isolation and characterization of micro-organisms, notably actinobacteria, from hyperarid andextreme hyperarid regions where the mean annual rainfallto mean annual evaporation is 0 /C105 and 0 /C102% respec-tively (Houston 2006). These conditions are compoundedby other factors such as the presence of inorganic oxi-dants, very low levels of organic carbon, extreme temper-ature ﬂuctuations and intense solar radiation; the lattercontributes, in a synergistic way, with desiccation to limitthe growth and survival of microbial life (G /C19omez-Silva2018). Until recently, it was believed that such harsh abi-otic conditions made any form of life in the core regionof the Atacama Desert virtually impossible (Navarro-Gonz /C19alez et al. 2003). However, it is now known thatJournal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 631A.M. Sayed et al. Micro-organisms from extreme environmentsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 2023different groups of micro-organisms have adapted to theextreme environmental conditions that prevail in thedesert (Schulze-Makuch et al. 2018), so much so that ahighly unusual rain event in the hyperarid core of thedesert led to the decimation of surface microbial commu-nities (Azua-Bustos et al. 2018).ActinobacteriaIn recent times innumerable ﬁlamentous actinobacteriahave been isolated from desert soils and assigned not onlyto the ubiquitous genus Streptomyces but also to rare andpoorly studied taxa, such as the genera Actinomadura,Amycolatopsis, Nocardiopsis, Nonomuraea, Saccha-ropolyspora and Saccharothrix (Okoro et al. 2009; Good-fellow et al. 2018). The application of cutting edgetaxonomic and screening methods, especially those basedon whole-genome sequence data; show that such ﬁlamen-tous actinobacteria are a signiﬁcant source of novel spe-cialized metabolites (Bull et al. 2016; Carro et al. 2018a;Carro et al. 2018b). In this context, especially gifted iso-lates from Atacama Desert habitats have been classiﬁed asnovel species of Streptomyces , such as Streptomycesasenjonii (Goodfellow et al. 2017), Streptomyces deserti(Santhanam et al 2012a), Streptomyces atacamaensis(Santhanam et al 2012b), Streptomyces bullii (Santhanamet al. 2013) and Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii (Busarakamet al. 2014). Recently, presumptively gifted isolates from ahigh-altitude Cerro Chajnantor gravel soil in northernChile have been validly named as Micromonosporaacroterricola (Carro et al. 2019), Micromonospora aridaand Micromonospora inaquosa (Carro et al. 2018a). Simi-larly, novel dereplicated isolates belonging to less well-known genera have been validly named, as exempliﬁed byAmycolatopsis vastitatis (Idris et al. 2018), Lentzea chaj-nantorensis (Idris et al. 2017a) and Pseudonocardia nigra(Trujillo et al. 2017). The genomes of some of these iso-lates have the capacity to synthesize many novel special-ized metabolites and contain stress-related genes thatprovide an insight into how actinobacteria adapt to theextreme environmental conditions found in AtacamaDesert habitats (Idris et al. 2018; Carro et al. 2018b).A steady ﬂow of ﬁlamentous actinobacteria recoveredfrom other nonpolar deserts have been validly named asnew species, they include Amycolatopsis desertii (Busara-kam et al. 2016a), Desertiactinospora gelatinilytica (Sayginet al.2019), Nakamurella deserti (Liu et al. 2018a,2018bb), Prauserella isguensis (Saker et al. 2015), Saccha-rothrix algeriensis (Zitouni et al. 2004), Saccharothrixtharensis (Ibeyaima et al. 2018) and Streptosporangiumbecharense (Chaouch et al. 2016).Actinobacteria that are amycelial or form rudimentaryhyphae have received less attention though they areknown to be common in desert soils (Idris et al. 2017b;Bull et al. 2018b). Members of the family Geoder-matophilaceae have received the most attention, notablythe genera Blastococcus, Geodermatophilus and Modesto-bacter ; members of these taxa are known to be resistantto desiccation, ionizing radiation, UV-light and heavymetals (Sghaier et al. 2016). Dereplicated Geodermatophi-laceae strains from Atacama Desert habitats have beenvalidly named as Blastococcus atacamensis (Castro et al.Microbial Diversity Detection of novel compounds Selective isolation & colony selectionChemical diversityDereplication of rare & novel isolatesScale up of interesting new specialised metabolitesExtreme habitatsBiosynthetic potential of strain librariesNovel structural families Preparation of extracts of selected isolatesNovel biological activitiesFigure 1 Culture-dependent bioprospectingstrategy (modiﬁed from Goodfellow andFiedler 2010).

Sayed et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 20232018a), Geodermatophilus chilensis (Castro et al. 2018b)and Modestobacter caceresii (Busarakam et al. 2016b) andshown to have moderately large genomes (3 /C19–5/C19 Mb).Representatives of these taxa not only contain NP-BGCsbut also stress-related genes that encode for propertiessuch as carbon starvation, temperature ﬂuxes, osmoticstress and UV-light. Other novel c-radiation-resistantgeodermatophili have been isolated from the SaharaDesert, as exempliﬁed by Geodermatophilus pulveris (Hez-briet al. 2016). In addition, radiation-resistant actinobac-teria belonging to the genera Agrococcus, Arthrobacter,Cellulomonas, Kocuria, Knoella and Nocardioides havebeen recovered from the Taklamakam Desert (Yu et al.2015). Amycelial actinobacteria isolated from otherdeserts include Arthrobacter deserti (Hu et al. 2016),Citricoccus alkalitolerans (Liet al. 2005) and Kocuriaaegyptia (Liet al. 2006). A particularly interesting devel-opment was the discovery that the sole member of thenovel taxon Desertimonas ﬂava , which was recoveredfrom the Gurbant €ungg€ut Desert, a desert which occupiesa large part of the Dzungarian Basin in northern XinjiangProvince, China, belongs to the newly proposed familyIlumatobacteraceae of the order Acidomicrobiales (Asemet al. 2018).Alkali-halotolerant actinobacteria retrieved from saltyhyperarid soils have been shown to be adapted to alka-line, drought and extreme temperatures (Mohammadi-panah and Wink 2016). Streptomyces aburaviensis, anisolate from saline arid desert soil in Kutch, India growswell at pH 8 /C15 in the presence of 15% w/v NaCl (Thumaret al. 2010). Mycetocola manganoxydans, a unique non-sporulating alkaliphilic actinobacterium isolated from theTaklamakan Desert can oxidize manganese ions (Luoet al. 2012). In addition, several alkalihalophilic acti-nobacteria have been isolated from the Qinghai-TibetPlateau, including members of the genera Cellulomonas,Saccharothrix and Streptosporangium (Ding et al. 2013)whereas Actinomadura and Nocardiopsis strains have beenrecovered from alkaline arid soils adjacent to salty lakesin Buryatiya (Lubsanova et al. 2014). A novel alkaliphilicStreptomyces strain isolated from an alkaline soil in thearid area of Boho, Northern Ireland was found to growunder intense c-radiation (4 kGy) at pH 10 /C15, and shownto be a potential source of novel specialized metabolitesthat inhibit ESKAPE pathogens (Terraet al. 2018).CyanobacteriaThese oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes, which form asingle taxonomic and phylogenetic group, produce abroad range of bioactive compounds including ones thatshow anti-microbial, anti-protozoal and anti-inﬂamma-tory activity (Micallef et al. 2015; Vijayakumar andMenakha 2015). Endolithic (rock-inhabiting) cyanobacte-ria dominated by Chroococcidiopsis species were ﬁrstreported from the Negev Desert (Potts and Friedmann1981), but are now known to be common in desertbiomes given their remarkable ability to cope withextreme aridity and solar radiation (Lacap-Bugler et al.2017). Indeed, cyanobacteria dominate hypolithic (underrock) desert communities and may be major drivers ofcommunity assembly and function (Bahl et al. 2011).Microbial communities dominated by Chroococcidiposisstrains inhabit halite deposits in the hyperarid core of theAtacama Desert (Wierzchos et al. 2006). It has also beenshown that cyanobacteria and associated heterotrophicbacteria reside within pore spaces in nodule-shaped halitecrusts (R /C19ıoset al. 2010; Rold /C19anet al. 2014). These lithicmicrobial communities have developed adaptive strategiesto withstand the extreme environmental conditions thatprevail in the Atacama Desert (G /C19omez-Silva 2018), as isthe case with similar communities in the Namib Desert(Stomeo et al. 2013). It is evident that green hypoliths inthe hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert are dominatedbyChroococcidopsis and Nostocales species and red hypo-liths by Chloroﬂexi (Lacap et al. 2011), whereas Noctoco-phycideae and Synechococcophycideae species are presentin lower numbers (V /C19ıtek et al. 2014). Cyanobacteria alsoproduce pigments which may protect them against lethaldoses of UV-radiation in hyperarid habitats (Powell et al.2015).FungiLike actinobacteria and cyanobacteria, fungi show a rangeof adaptive mechanisms which allow them to withstandenvironmental extremes found in desert ecosystems(Onofri et al. 2007; Stevenson et al. 2017; Santiago et al.2018), as shown by their ability to synthesize melaninpigments that provide protection against high levels ofUV-radiation (Gessler et al. 2014). Early isolation studieson soils from the Negev and Sonoran deserts revealedextensive fungal diversity (Taylor-George et al. 1983),results now known to square with the view that fungi arethe most stress-resistant eukaryotes (Sterﬂinger et al.2012), a point especially apt with respect to microbialrock fungi (Palmer et al. 1987; Gonc /C223alves et al. 2016).To date, fungi isolated from desert habitats have fea-tured rarely in bioprospecting campaigns even thoughfungal taxa, including novel species, are common indesert landscapes. A preliminary survey of AtacamaDesert soils by Conley et al. (2006), for instance, recorded13 distinct fungal genera, notably Alternaria and Ulocla-dium species; it is now clear that fungal communities inthis desert represent an unknown element of global fun-gal diversity (Santiago et al. 2018). Furthermore, a surveyJournal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 633A.M. Sayed et al. Micro-organisms from extreme environmentsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 2023of fungi from Makhtesh Ramon desert soil found 135novel species dominated by ascomycetes (Grishkan andNevo 2010). In addition, 77 lichenoid fungal speciesdetected along two altitudinal transects at Alto Patache inthe Atacama Desert included four new species, Amandi-nea efﬂorescens, Diploicia canescens, Myriospora smarag-dula and Rhizocarpon simillimum (Castillo and Beck2012), whereas high-altitude rocks in the desert were asource of fungi belonging to the genera Cladosporium,Neucatenulostroma and Penicillium (Gonc /C223alves et al.2016). Furthermore, two novel halophilic fungi isolatedfrom a cave in the Coastal Range of the Atacama Desertwere designated as Aspergillus atacamensis and Aspergillussalisburgensis (Martinelli et al. 2017). Extensive fungaldiversity has been recorded in Middle East desert sand(Murgia et al. 2018) and three novel fungal species,Diverispora omaniana, Septoglomus nakheelum and Rhi-zophagus arabicus, were recorded from a desert in Oman(Symanczik et al. 2014).Desert-associated specialized metabolitesThe range of micro-organisms found in deserts arepotential sources of new chemical diversity but have beenunderstudied chemically, partly reﬂecting a view thatdesert micro-organisms were likely to synthesize bioactivemetabolites due to limited numbers of competing micro-bial species present in extreme biomes (Pettit 2011).However, over the last 20 years, actinobacteria, cyanobac-teria and fungi isolated from unusual or extreme deserthabitats have been shown to have evolved unique meta-bolic pathways for the synthesis of novel bioactive spe-cialized metabolites (Peng et al. 2011; Jan /C20ci/C20cet al. 2016;Rateb et al. 2018). Indeed, by 2008, more than 100 spe-cialized metabolites had been isolated and identiﬁed frommicro-organisms isolated from such habitats (Wilson andBrimble 2009).N-containing compoundsSince 2010, most investigated bioactive molecules havebeen reported from actinobacteria recovered from hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils, as shown in Fig. 2. Strepto-myces leeuwenhoekii strain C34Tproduces ansamycin-typemacrocyclic polyketides, the chaxamycins A –D( 1–4)together with the aminoglycoside antibiotics hygromycinA(5), 500-dihydrohygromycin A ( 6), deferrioxamine E(nocardamine, 7) as well as desferrioxamine B ( 8), thelatter were isolated from the same strain using theOSMAC (One Strain Many Compounds) approach(Rateb et al. 2011a, 2011bb). Further examples of novelbioactive molecules from Atacama Desert streptomycetesinclude the aminobenzoquinones, abenquines A, B1, B2,C and D ( 9–13) which showed inhibitory activity againstbacteria and dermatophytic fungi (Schulz et al. 2011).Fermentation of S. leeuwenhoekii strain C58 led to theisolation of chaxapeptin ( 14), a novel ribosomally-synthe-sized and posttranslationally modiﬁed lasso peptide whichexhibits signiﬁcant in vitro inhibitory activity againsthuman lung cancer cells (Elsayed et al. 2015). Recently,bio-guided fractionation of a culture broth extract of S.asenjonii strain 42.f (Goodfellow et al. 2017) led to theisolation of new bioactive polyketides of the rare b-dike-tone family, asenjonamides A –C(15–17) which showedpotent antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacte-ria., it is particularly interesting that asenjonamide C ( 17)shows comparable activity to that of tetracycline(Abdelkader et al. 2018). In the same study, a series ofbioactive acylated 4-aminoheptosyl- b-N-glycosides, spi-camycins A –E(18–22), were isolated in a pure form forthe ﬁrst time. These antibiotics were initially found as anonseparable mixture of seven compounds extractedfrom Streptomyces alanosinicus (Hayakawa et al. 1983).There is evidence that this unique class of nucleosideantibiotics may provide a promising lead for the develop-ment of new anticancer drugs (Gadgeel et al. 2003).Cyanobacteria are widely distributed in both arid andhyperarid ecosystems, and are the source of many bioac-tive compounds (Singh et al. 2005; Micallef et al. 2015).They produce pigments like scytonemin ( 23) and themycosporine-like amino acids shinorine ( 24) and por-phyra-334 ( 25) which may absorb potentially lethal dosesof UV-radiation found in hyperarid environments., thesecompounds are being evaluated as a source of potentsunscreens (Powell et al. 2015). Scytonemin ( 23), whichis produced by a Chroococcidiopsis strain, has potential asa chemical marker for endolithic cyanobacterial coloniesin halite crusts which are common in the hyperarid zoneof the Atacama Desert (V /C19ıtek et al. 2014) .This com-pound is of considerable interest as it causes attenuationof mitogen-induced inﬂammatory hyperproliferationthrough inhibition of polo-like kinase hence its uniquedimeric structure may prove to be a potential scaffold forthe development of potent kinase inhibitors (D’Orazioet al. 2012). Recently, the mycosporine-like amino acids,shinorine ( 24) and porphyra-334 ( 25) were found toexhibit anti-inﬂammatory effects by interference with NF-jB activation (Becker et al. 2016).Cyanobacteria found in extreme habitats, such as alka-line lakes, hyperarid desert soils, hypersaline environ-ments and polar regions, produce cyanotoxins, diversespecialized metabolites (e.g., alkaloids, amino acids andcyclic peptides) which can be classiﬁed into hepatotoxins,neurotoxins and cytotoxins (Metcalf and Codd 2012).Cyanotoxins detected in habitats such as these includethe neurotoxins anatoxin-a ( 26), anatoxin-a(S) ( 27),b-methylaminopropionic acid ( 28) and 2,4-diaminobutyricJournal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 634Micro-organisms from extreme environments A.M.

Biosynthesis of these toxins ismainly attributed to the cyanobacterial genera Arthros-pira, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus (Cir/C19eset al. 2017).Apart from their toxicological properties, cylindrosper-mopsin ( 31) and anatoxin-a ( 26) show estrogenic activityin vivo andin vitro assays (Liu et al. 2018a, 2018bb).Recent studies on fungi from desert ecosystems under-lines their potential as a proliﬁc source of novel chemicalentities which show interesting bioactivities (Santiagoet al. 2018). Members of the genus Wallemia, a taxonwhich encompasses seven species, were previously consid-ered to be halophilic (Zalar et al. 2005). However, Walle-mia sebi , the sole representative of the genus isolatedfrom the Atacama Desert produces a range of specializedmetabolites such as wallimidione ( 32) (Desroches et al.2014), 15-azasterol ( 33) and 24,28-dihydro-15-azasterol(34) (Jan /C20ci/C20cet al. 2016). Molecules 33and 34, alsoknown as UCA1064-A and UCA1064-B, respectively,exhibit in vivo antitumor activity against a mouse mam-mary tumour model and in vitro antiproliferative activityagainst HeLa S3 cells; they also show antifungal activityagainst Saccharomyces cerevisiae and inhibit Gram-positivebacteria (Jan /C20ci/C20cet al. 2016). Furthermore, the alkaloidcyclopentanopyridine ( 35) isolated from a halophilicstrain of W.sebi inhibits Enterobacter aerogenes (Penget al. 2011).MacrolidesStreptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34Tfrom Atacama Desertsoil produces chaxalactins A –C(36–38), a rare class of22-membered macrolactone polyketides which showantibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria(Rateb et al. 2011a, 2011bb). In turn, S. leeuwenhoekiistrain C38, isolated from the same desert location, syn-thesizes 22-membered macrolactone antibiotics, the ata-camycins A-C ( 39–41) (Nachtigall et al. 2011).Other metabolitesChemical investigation of L. chajnantorensis strain H45recovered from a high-altitude Atacama Desert soil (Idriset al. 2017a) led to the characterization of new diene gly-cosides, lentzeosides A –F(42–47) which show inhibitoryactivity against HIV integrase (Wichner et al. 2017). Fur-thermore, the Atacama Desert-derived fungus, W. sebiproduces two unique terpenes, walleminone ( 48) andwalleminol ( 49) (Jan /C20ci/C20cet al. 2016).Permafrost soilsPermafrost is the layer below the earth’s crust that hasremained at or below 0 °C for at least two consecutiveyears (Jansson and Tas /C2232014). It is estimated thatapproximately 25% of the landmass of the planet isunderlayen by permafrost soils. These soils, together withoverlying (naturally thawing) layers, provide unique habi-tats for active, cold-adapted, microbial communities(Bakermans et al. 2014; De Maayer et al. 2014; Hu et al.2015)., as well as for cells that have remained viable formillions of years (Gilichinsky et al. 2008). Indeed, accord-ing to the Snow Ball Earth hypothesis, the planet hasbeen completely or almost completely frozen at least oncewithin the last 650 million years suggesting that micro-organisms would have had to adapt to subzero tempera-tures to survive (Schopf and Klein 1992). Permafrost canbe distinguished from other low-temperature biomes,such as sea ice and deep oceans, by its structural hetero-geneity given horizontal and vertical differences in soil,ice and organic matter content (Jansson and Tas /C2232014).Micro-organisms adapted to temperatures that rangefrom /C017 to +10°C are referred to as cryophiles (Fellerand Gerday 2003). Water availability and temperature arethe most important abiotic factors inﬂuencing microbialdiversity in cold environments though high viscosity andlow thermal energy offer additional challenges (Janssonand Tas /C2232014). Nucleic acid replication, transcriptionand translation are inhibited under such conditions,whereas proteins can denaturate causing loss of cell mem-brane ﬂuidity (Chattopadhyay 2006; D’Amico et al.2006). Micro-organisms adapted to life in such cold envi-ronments have developed several strategies for survival,such as initiating dormant states and generating special-ized metabolites and proteins (Bakermans et al. 2009).Cryophilic micro-organisms can also reduce their meta-bolism and nutrient uptake by storing energy aspolyphosphates, triglycerides, wax esters and glycogen(Bowman 2008) and can adapt their cellular structure byregulating branched and saturated fatty-acid productionto maintain cell membrane ﬂuidity at freezing tempera-tures (Unell et al. 2007).ProkaryotesArctic permafrost soils tend to be dominated by Aci-dobacteria ,Actinobacteria,Cyanobacteria , as well as byProteobacteria belonging to the Burkholderiales ( b-pro-teobacteria), Myxococcales ( d-proteobacteria), Rhizobiales(a-proteobacteria) and Xanthomonadales ( c-proteobacte-ria) (Malard and Pearce 2018). These authors suggestedthat biogeographic variation may be a feature of Arcticsoils as actinobacteria occurred in lower numbers inGreenland and Finland, whereas much higher populationsofBacteroidetes were evident in Alaskan, Canadian andSvalbard permafrost., these abundant groups alsoincluded Chloroﬂexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmati-monadetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia.

Sayed et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 2023the dominant taxa found in Chinese permafrost soilswere Actinobacteria ,Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (Huet al. 2015). The dominant cyanobacterial orders in Arcticsoil crusts were found to be the Nostocales, Oscillatorialesand Synechococcales (Steven et al. 2013; Pushkareva et al.2015). Indeed, cyanobacteria are mainly responsible forthe uptake of CO2and N 2as plants in Arctic ecosystemsare unable to ﬁx nitrogen (Malard and Pearce 2018).Regional populations of cyanobacteria may also be afeature of Antarctic soils (Namsaraev et al. 2010).Archaea have also been isolated from permafrost (Janssonand Tas /C2232014). Archaeal communities in Arctic soilsseem to be variable through Methanobacteria and Metha-nomicrobia (Euryarchaeota ) are abundant in Alaskan andGreenland soils (Ganzert et al. 2014; Malard and Pearce2018), whereas isolates related to the genera MethanolobusandMethanomethylovorans have been recovered from fro-zen ground in the Zoige wetland of the Qinghai —Tibetplateau (Zhang et al. 2008). The methane released bythese organisms can be used as a sole carbon source bymethanotrophic bacteria, such as a- and c-proteobacteria(Coolen et al. 2011) and members of the Methanococ-cales (Martineau et al. 2014).FungiIn general, fungal communities in Arctic permafrost aredominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Chytrid-iomycota (Gittel et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016a,2016bb), through the survival of associated shrubs aredependent on ectomycorrhizal fungi (Deslippe et al.2011; Fujiyoshi et al. 2011). In turn, common generainclude Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Geomyces and Penicil-lium (Ozerskaya et al. 2009). Over 400 taxonomicallydistinct genera have been recovered from Antarctic soilsystems suggesting that fungi may be the most diversebiota in this mileau (Bridge and Spooner 2012); isolatesfrom Cape Royds, Antarctica keyed out to the generaCadospora, Geomyces and Thielava (Blanchette et al.2010). Indeed, the ascomycete genera Cadospora andGeomyces may be endemic to Antarctic soils (Arenz andBlanchette 2011). Fungal diversity in Antarctic lichensfrom King George Island was shown to include theArthonimycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leoanoromycetes, Leo-tiomycetes and Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota ) and theCystobasidiomycetes and Tremellomycetes of the Basid-iomycota (Park et al. 2015).Permafrost soil-associated specialized metabolitesN-containing compoundsTheir rapid growth rate and ability to metabolize a widearray of substrates have enabled fungi to become thedominant micro-organisms in polar habitats (Fig. 3).Two new epipolythiodioxopiperazines, the chetracins Band C ( 50,51), together with ﬁve new diketopiperazi-nes, oidioperazines A –D(52–55) and chetracin D ( 56)were isolated from the Antarctic psychrophilic fungusOidiodendron truncatum . Chetracin B ( 50) shows potentanticancer activity at a nanomolar concentration againsta panel of human cancer cell lines, whereas chetracin C(51) displayed a signiﬁcant effect at a micromolar con-centration suggesting that the sulphide bridge is anessential structural feature for the activity of these com-pounds (Li et al. 2012). Another psychrophilic fungus,Eutypella sp. D1, isolated from an Arctic soil on LondonIsland of Fongsfjorden, yielded the new cytochalasinsZ24,Z 25,Z 26(57–59). Cytochalasin Z 24(57) showedmoderate cytotoxicity toward human breast cancerMCF-7 cells (Liu et al. 2014). Further chemical proﬁlingof the Eutypella strain led to the isolation of two newN-containing diterpenes; libertellenone G ( 60) andeutypenoid B ( 61). The former exhibited signiﬁcantantibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the latter potent immunosuppres-sive activity (Lu et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016a,2016bb). Lindgomycin ( 62), an unusual polyketide witha novel carbon skeleton, and ascosetin ( 63) were recov-ered from an Arctic sponge-derived fungal strain andclassiﬁed in the family Lindgomycetaceae . All thesemetabolites exhibited potent antimicrobial activitiesagainst several pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria,including MRSA and the pathogenic yeast Candida albi-cans (Ondeyka et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2015).The new benzoxazine glycosides, arcticoside ( 64) andC-1027 chromophore-V ( 65) derived from an Arcticmarine Streptomyces strain showed inhibitory activityagainst Candida albicans isocitrate lyase and breast andcolorectal carcinoma cells. Additionally, C-1027 chro-mophore-III ( 66) and ﬁjiolides A and B ( 67,68) wereisolated from the same strain (Moon et al. 2014). AnArctic freshwater-derived bacterium, Pseudomonas ﬂuo-rescens BD5 produced unusual cyclic lipopeptide biosur-factants, namely pseudofactin I and II ( 69,70), thestructure of which is unique as a palmitic acid is con-nected to a terminal peptide moiety of eighth aminoacids. Interestingly, the stability and emulsiﬁcation activ-ity of these metabolites were greater than those of theconventional synthetic surfactants Triton X-100 andTween 20 suggesting that they may be of potential valuein bioremediation and biomedicine (Janek et al. 2010).PolyketidesTwo highly oxygenated polyketides, penilactones A and B(71,72), isolated from an Antarctic deep-sea-derived fun-gus, Penicillium crustosum , inhibited the nuclear factor-Journal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 637A.M. Sayed et al.

Furthermore, a psy-chrophilic fungal strain isolated from an Antarctic marinesponge and assigned to the genus Pseudogymnoascus pro-duced four new nitroasterric acid derivatives, pseudogym-noascins A –C(73–75) and 3-nitroasterric acid ( 76); thesepolyketides are the ﬁrst nitro-derivatives of the knownfungal metabolite asterric acid. In general, most reportedasterric acid derivatives have been found to show antibac-terial and antifungal activity but the present nitro-deriva-tives were inactive possibly due to the presence of thenitro group (Figueroa et al. 2015). Bio-guided fractiona-tion of the culture broth of the Antarctic soil-derivedAspergillus ochraceopetaliformis strain led to the isolationof ﬁve new highly oxygenated polyketides, ochraceoponesA–E(77–81), along with a new double bond isomer ofasteltoxin ( 82), isoasteltoxin ( 83), as well as asteltoxin B(84). Among these metabolites, ochraceopones A ( 77)and isoasteltoxin ( 83) showed promising antiviral activityagainst the inﬂuenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2 (Wanget al. 2016).TerpenesA psychrophilic fungal Eutypella strain isolated from anArctic soil on London Island was the source of four newditerpenes; scoparasin B ( 85), libertellenone H ( 86) andeutypenoids A and C ( 87,88) (Liu et al. 2014). In turn,the meroterpenoids chrodrimanins I and J ( 89,90) andﬁve known structurally related chrodrimanins were puri-ﬁed from the culture broth of the Antarctic moss-derivedfungus Penicillium funiculosum , the novel chrodrimaninsshowed week inhibitory activity against inﬂuenza A virusH1N1 (Zhou et al. 2015).LipidsScreening for new anti- Burkholderia cepacia complex com-pounds from bacteria isolated from the Ross Sea (Antarc-tica) led to the isolation of three new rhamnolipids ( 91–93)from Pseudomonas strain BNT1 (Tedesco et al. 2016).Deep-sea sedimentsTaxonomically diverse micro-organisms able to synthesizebioactive metabolites are common in marine habitats(Goodfellow and Fiedler 2010; Wang et al. 2016). In con-trast, partly for logistics reasons, less attention has beengiven to the microﬂora of deep-sea sediments, notablythose in polar regions and oceanic trenches. However, itis now becoming apparent that bacteria and fungiadapted to extreme conditions in these habitats, notablylow temperatures ( /C01t o4 °C), dearth of nutrients andhigh hydrostatic pressure, provide interesting targets forbioprospecting campaigns (Zhang et al. 2014a, 2014bb;Dickinson et al. 2016; Gonc /C223alves et al. 2017).BacteriaArctic marine sediments contain diverse actinobacterialcommunities including representatives of putatively novelspecies (Zhang et al. 2014a, 2014bb) whereas samplestaken along a transcend between the Atlantic Peninsulaand South America were dominated in terms of geneticdiversity by ɣ-proteobacteria and euryarchaeota (L /C19opez-Garc/C19ıaet al. 2001). Furthermore, subsea ﬂoor core sam-ples from the Nakau and Okinawa Troughs showed arange of halotolerant actinobacteria related to well-knownantibiotic producing genera, such as Nocardia ,Pseudono-cardia and Streptomyces (Ulanova and Goo 2015). Theseresults are in good agreement with those of earlier studieson actinobacteria isolated from deep-sea sediments,including ones recovered from the Challenge Deep of theMariana Trench (Pathom-aree et al. 2006). Neithercyanobacteria nor archaea are common in polar marinedeep sediments (Dickinson et al. 2016).FungiTaxonomically diverse marine fungi are a feature of colddeep-sea sediments. Seawater sediments taken from acrossthe northern Antarctic penunsula, for instance, containeddiverse fungal assemblages despite the harsh environmen-tal conditions (Gonc /C223alves et al. 2017), as is the case withdeep-sea sediments from the East Indian Ocean (Zhanget al. 2014a, 2014bb). Dominant cold-adapted yeasts fromthe deep Polar Sea include Candida ,Cryptococcus ,PichiaandRodotorula spp. (Nagano et al. 2013). In addition, ﬁl-amentous yeasts and fungi belonging to the Ascomycotahave been isolated from deep-sea sediments from theCentral Indian Basin (Singh et al. 2010, 2012). ManyGraphium sp. that displayed barotolerance at 100-barpressure were recovered from Northern Antarctic Penin-sula (Gonc /C223alves et al. 2017).Deep-sea sediment-associated specialized metabolitesN-containing compoundsRegulatory genes such as whiB -like ( wblA50) play signiﬁ-cant roles in actinobacterial specialized metabolism. Inac-tivation of wblA50and vioB from a cold deep-sea-derivedStreptomyces somaliensis strain led to spectacular changesin the production of specialized metabolites (Fig. 4),notably in the synthesis of the new antimycin-type dep-sipeptide, somalimycin ( 94) and two analogues, USF-19Aand urauchimycin D ( 95,96) (Li et al. 2017). Chemicalinvestigation of Marinactinospora thermotolerans, Strepto-myces scopuliridis and Streptomyces drozdowiczii strainsrecovered from deep-sea samples collected off SouthChina (3865 m) led to the isolation of the cyclic peptides,Journal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 638Micro-organisms from extreme environments A.M.

Additionally, three spirotetronate polyketides,lobophorin E ( 108), F ( 109) and H ( 110) extracted fromtwo Streptomyces strains isolated from the same locationat a depth of 2134 m, were shown to have antibacterialactivity against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria (Niuet al. 2011; Pan et al. 2013). Furthermore, a novel piezo-tolerant actinobacterium, Dermacoccus abyssi , isolatedfrom Mariana Trench sediment produced novel phena-zine metabolites, dermacozines A-J ( 111–120); dermaco-zines F ( 116) and G ( 117) showed interestingantiproliferative activity towards the leukaemia cell lineK562 with IC50values of 9 and 7 mmol l/C01(Abdel-Mageed et al. 2010; Wagner et al. 2014). Chemical inves-tigation of the Antarctic deep-sea fungus Penicillium sp.PR19N-1 led to the isolation of a new rare lactam-typemetabolite, eremophilane ( 121) (Lin et al. 2014). Fermen-tation of another deep-sea fungus, Aspergillus westerdi-jkiae DFFSCS013, led to the isolation of two newbenzodiazepine alkaloids circumdatins K and L ( 122,123), and two new indole alkaloids, 10-epi-sclerotiamideand 5-chlorosclerotiamide ( 124,125) together with thenovel amide, aspergilliamide B ( 126) (Peng et al. 2013).TerpenesA novel chloro-trinoreremophilane sesquiterpene ( 127)and three new chlorinated eremophilane sesquiterpenes(128–130) were also obtained from the Antarctic deep-sea fungus Penicillium sp. PR19N-1, these compoundsshowed moderate cytotoxic activity against the cancer celllines HL-60 and A549 (Wu et al. 2013). Further chemicalinvestigation on this strain led to the isolation of ﬁvenew cytotoxic eremophilane-type sesquiterpenes ( 131–135) (Lin et al. 2014).PolyketidesFive new a-pyrone derivatives, violapyrone A –C, J and H(136–140), which showed anti-MRSA activity were iso-lated from a Streptomyces somaliensis strain isolated froma deep-sea sediment (Huang et al. 2016). Extensive chem-ical proﬁling of the Antarctic deep-sea fungus Penicilliumcrustosum PRB-2 resulted in the identiﬁcation of penilac-tones A and B ( 141,142), two novel polyketides withunusual highly oxygenated structures, along with knownphenolic metabolites (Wu et al. 2012).Highly acidic habitatsIn general, extreme acidophiles can be deﬁned as micro-organisms that grow optimally at pH values below 3(Johnson and Quatrini 2016). These micro-organisms arecommon in acid lakes, acid sulphate soils and acid minewastes (Druschel et al. 2004; Mirete et al. 2017). Moststudies have been focused on the structure and functionof microbial communities in acid mine drainage (AMD)systems given their simplicity from a biological and geo-chemical perspective (Denef et al. 2010). Primary envi-ronmental variables that shape AMD habitats aredissolved metal concentrations, total organic carbon, dis-solved oxygen, pH and temperature (M /C19endez-Garc/C19ıaet al. 2015). These factors, notably pH, help to drivemicrobial diversity patterns in acid mine wastes (Kuanget al. 2013). Acidophilic algae, archaea, bacteria and fungihave developed ways of thriving or tolerating conditionsin acidic biomes (Baker-Austin and Dopson 2007; Denefet al. 2010), as exempliﬁed by roles played by cell mem-branes in archaea and bacteria (Konings et al. 2002; Fal-teisek and /C20Cepi/C20cka 2012).ProkaryotesIndividual acidic habitats tend to be dominated by one or afew species (Mueller et al. 2010), as illustrated by the domi-nance of Acidithiobacillus thioxydans on the ceilings ofacidic caves (Ziegler et al. 2013); this extreme acidic che-molithotroph, which is a member of the order Acidoth-iobacilliales (Williams and Kelly 2013), is a feature of acidmine wastes across the world (Hedrich and Johnson 2013).Furthermore, acidic, warm ferruginous mine wastes aredominated by Ferroplasma andLeptospirillum spp. (Denefet al. 2010) and their cold counterparts by Acidithiobacillusthiooxidans (Liljeqvist et al. 2015). In turn, Leptospirillumspecies are common members of acidophilic communitiesthat catalyse the oxidation of ferrous ion (Goltsman et al.2013). However, the primary bacterial lineages found inacid mine wastes are Acidobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Aquiﬁcae ,Firmacutes ,Nitrospora ,Proteobacteria andCandidatus division TH7 (Chen et al. 2016). Predominantsulphate-reducing bacteria detected in AMD systemsinclude Desulfurella ,Desulfomonile ,Syntrophobacter andThermodesulfolobium spp. (S /C19anchez-Andrea et al. 2012).Taxomonically diverse archaea present in acid mine wastesinclude Acidianus ,Metallophaera ,Sulfolobus and Sulfu-risporae spp. (phylum Crenarchaeota) and the genus Ferro-plasma of the phylum Euryarchaeota (Chen et al. 2015,2016). Extremely acidophilic archaea are classiﬁed withinthe Euryarchaeota (such as a Picrophilus sp. which is con-sidered the most acidophilic of all known life-forms) andCrenarchaeota phyla have been regarded as thermoaci-dophiles (Aguilera et al. 2016).EukaryotesRelatively little is known about algae and fungi in acidichabitats even though they are an integral part ofJournal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 641A.M.

Berkazaphilones B and C ( 144,145) andpenisimplicissin ( 151) exhibited selective inhibitory activ-ity against leukemia cancer cell lines through inhibitionof caspase-1 (Stierle et al. 2012a). An extremophilic fun-gus assigned to the genus Pleurostomophora isolated fromthe same acid mine lake produced three new azaphilones,berkchaetoazaphilones A –C(152–154) and the red pig-ment berkchaetorubramine ( 155), berkchaetoazaphiloneB(153) showed in vitro anti-inﬂammatory activity byinhibiting of the production of IL-1 b, TNF aand IL-6inﬂammatory mediators, and exhibited potent cytotoxiceffects against human retinoblastoma, leukaemia and mel-anoma cell lines (Stierle et al. 2015).TerpenesThe P. rubrum strain mentioned above also producedinteresting meroterpenoids, namely berkeleyones A –C(156–158), berkeleydione ( 159) and berkeleytrione ( 160),as well as preaustinoid A and A1(161,162)., thesemetabolites inhibited the in vitro production of inter-leukin 1- b(Stierle et al. 2011). Moreover, two new dri-mane sesquiterpene lactones, berkedrimanes A and B(163,164) and a new tricarboxylic acid ( 165) were iso-lated from another extremophilic fungal strain isolatedfrom the Montana acid mine lake and identiﬁed as Peni-cillium solitum , berkedrimanes A and B ( 163,164)showed in vitro anti-inﬂammatory activity as they inhib-ited the enzymes caspase-1 and 3 (Stierle et al. 2012b).Saline and hypersaline habitatsSaline habitats can be considered as ones where salt con-centrations correspond to the level found in seawater(3/C15% w/v of total dissolved salts, D /C19ıaz-C /C19ardenas et al.2017), whereas high salt environments haveconcentrations of salts >100 g l/C01. (Enache et al. 2017) asfound in Antarctic biomes and hypersaline lakes. Halo-philic micro-organisms thrive under harsh environmentalconditions that prevail in such habitats as they haveevolved molecular and cellular mechanisms to cope withfactors such as osmotic pressure and low water activity(Oren 1999; Gunde-Cimerman and Zalar 2014; Waditee-Sirisattha et al. 2016), whereas their halotolerant counter-parts generally grow in the absence of salt but can toler-ate high salt concentrations. Halophilic micro-organisms,in particular, are being seen as a source of novel bioactivecompounds (Waditee-Sirisattha et al. 2016; D /C19ıaz-C /C19arde-naset al. 2017).ProkaryotesPhylogenetically diverse halophilic and highly halotolerantarchaea are common in hypersaline systems and includemembers of the class Halobacteria (Andrei et al. 2012).Extreme halophilic archaea have been isolated from hyper-saline lakes in the Transylvanian Basin close to the saltminos of Turda (Baricz et al. 2014, 2015). Novel archaeaisolated from commercial salt include Halarchaeum aci-dophilum (Minegishi et al. 2010) and Natronoarchaeummannanilyticum (Shimane et al. 2010). Common bacteriarecovered from hypersaline habitats have been assigned tothe phyla Actinobacteria (Streptomyces ),Bacteriodetes(Flavobacteria ),Cyanobacteria ,Firmacutes (Bacilli andClostridia ) and Proteobacteria (aand c-proteobacteria)(Enache et al. 2017). Archaea and bacteria are also com-mon in ancient halite (Jaakkola et al. 2016).EukaryotesExtremely halotolerant and halophylic fungi have beenisolated from biomes in solar salterns across the world, asexempliﬁed by melanized members of the genera Aspergil-lus,Cladosporium and Penicillium spp., and Emericellaand Eurotium spp., nonmelanized yeasts and Wallemiaspp. (Gunde-Cimerman and Zalar 2014).

Chemical proﬁling of bioactive special-ized metabolites from a Bacillus strain isolated from asaltern in Incheon, Korea led to the isolation of threenew lipopeptides, iturin F1(168), iturin F 2(169) anditurin A 9(170), together with iturin A 8(171). All of thesecompounds showed potent activity against pathogenicfungi and moderate antiproliferative activity against HeLaand srcts-NRK cell lines. Moreover, an in vitro enzymaticassay of iturin A8(171) demonstrated signiﬁcant inhibi-tory activity towards indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Sonet al. 2016).CarotenoidsAHalobacterium salinarium strain was found to producea group of potent antioxidant carotenoids, namely bacte-rioruberin ( 172), bisanhydrobacterioruberin ( 173) andtrisanhydrobacterioruberin ( 174) (Mandelli et al. 2012).High-temperature environmentsThermophilic and hyperthermophilic micro-organismsare common in hot-springs and deep-sea hydrothermalvents, but are also found in artiﬁcial habitats such ascompost (Rastogi et al. 2010; Urbieta et al. 2015). Theoptimal growth temperature for thermophiles is around55°C and that for hyperthermophiles is above 80 °Cthough other extreme variables, such as low pH and highsalt concentrations may affect their distribution. Hyper-thermophilic micro-organisms contain polyamines, theselong chain functional polymers contribute to their sur-vival at high temperatures (Hidese et al. 2018). Heat lov-ing micro-organisms continue to attract the interest ofbiotechnologists, notably as a source of liquid biofuelsand thermostable enzymes (de Miguel Bouzas et al. 2006;Rastogi et al. 2010; Goh et al. 2013; Urbieta et al. 2015;Zeldes et al. 2015). Urbieta and her colleagues have speltout the advantages of using thermophilic micro-organ-isms in biotechnological processes.ProkaryotesArchaea and bacteria are common in high-temperatureenvironments, notably hot-springs. Common ther-mophilic bacteria include members of the genera Anoxy-bacillus ,Geobacillus ,Miobacillus and Thermus whereastheir hyperthermophilic counterparts belong to the gen-eraAquiﬁcae and Thermatoga of the families Aquiﬁcaceaeand Thermatogaceae respectively (Urbieta et al. 2015).The majority of hyperthermophiles are archaea, as exem-pliﬁed by the genera Desulfurococcus ,Pyrodiotum ,Pyro-coccus ,Pyrolobus ,Sulfolobus ,Thermophylum andThermoproteus of the Crenarchaeota (de Miguel Bouzaset al. 2006; Zeldes et al. 2015). Actinobacteria have beendetected in hot springs, including representatives of thegenera Couchiplanes ,Glycomyces and Mycobacterium(Valverrde et al.2012) and Actinospica ,Amycolatopsis andRhodococcus strains (Kusuma & Goodfellow, pers. com.).FungiThermophilic fungi received little attention though strainskeyed out as Aspergillus clavatus (Jiang et al. 2013) andTalaromyces thermophilus (Chu et al. 2010; Guo et al.2011) have been reported.High-temperature environments-associated specializedmetabolitesN-containing compoundsClavatustides A and B ( 175,176, Fig. 5), two unusualcyclodepsipeptides containing an anthranilic acid dimer0·0020·0040·0060·0080·00100·00120·00Fungi Actinobacteria Bacteria CyanobacteriaFigure 6 Distribution of specializedmetabolites synthesized by micro-organismsisolated from extreme habitats before andafter 2010 (( ) till 2010; ( 2010 –2018)).[Colour ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]Journal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 644Micro-organisms from extreme environments A.M.

Chemical investigation of the ther-mophilic fungus T. thermophilus afforded two new preny-lated alkaloids talathermophilins A and B ( 177,178)which showed nematicidal toxicity against the parasiticworm Panagrellus redivevus (Chu et al. 2010). Subse-quently, four talathermophilins ( 179–182) were isolatedfrom the same fungus (Guo et al. 2011).CarotenoidsThe thermophilic bacillus, Thermus ﬁliformis was foundto produce a group of potent antioxidant carotenoids,the all-trans-zeaxanthin ( 183), zeaxanthin monoglucoside(184), thermozeaxanthins ( 185) and thermobiszeaxan-thins ( 186) (Mandelli et al. 2012).ConclusionsThe microbiological and chemical data drawn from therecent literature on bioprospecting in selected extremebiomes provide strong backing for the premise that theharsh environmental conditions which prevail in theextreme biomes select for micro-organisms that expressnew chemistry thereby opening up opportunities for ther-apeutic drug process development.

However, over asubsequent 8-year period, taxonomically diverse extremo-philic and extremotolerant micro-organisms were thesource of nearly 200 new specialized metabolites (Fig. 6),the most frequently isolated classes of specialized metabo-lites were N-containing compounds and polyketides,many of which were produced by ﬁlamentous actinobac-teria and fungi (Fig. 6). It is also encouraging that thesemicro-organisms synthesized a broad range of bioactivecompounds with a skew towards the production ofantibacterial and anticancer agents (Fig. 7). In turn,micro-organisms isolated from permafrost soils synthe-sized a broader range of chemical compounds than thosefrom the other extreme habitats (Fig. 8). In contrast,strains isolated from all of the extreme biomes, apartfrom the highly acidic habitats, were the source of manyN-containing metabolites such as alkaloids and peptides.However, relatively little activity was shown by micro-or-ganisms isolated from saline and hypersaline habitats orfrom high-temperature environments. In this context, itwould be interesting to establish the extent of microbialdiversity within and between diverse extreme biomesusing culture-dependant procedures to determine theTable 1 Examples of actinobacteria isolated from selected extreme biomes and assigned to established genera and associated novel or validlynamed species *Hyper/extreme hyperarid, Atacama Desert soils Deep-Sea sediments Saline/hypersaline habitats Hot springsGenera Genera Genera GeneraActinomadura Dermacoccus Micromonospora ActinospicaAmycolatopsis Micromonospora Nocardia AmycolatopsisArthrobacter Rhodococcus Pseudonocardia CouchiplanesBlastococcus Streptomyces Streptomyces GlycomycesGeodermatophilus Tsukamurella MycobacteriumKribbellabWilliamsiaLentzeaModestobacterMicrolunatusMicromonosporabMycobacteriumNocardiabNocardioidesbNonomuraeabPseudonocardiabSaccharopolysporabSaccharothrixbStreptomycesbTerrabacterSpecies SpeciesAmycolatopsis desertii Dermacoccus abysiicAmycolatopsis vastitatis Dermacoccus barathriBlastococcus atacamensis Dermacoccus profundiGeodermatophilus chilensis Williamsia marianensisLentzea chajnantorensiscMicromonospora acroterricolaMicromonospora aridaMicromonospora inaquosaPseudonocardia nigraModestobacter caceresiiStreptomyces asenjoniicStreptomyces atacamensisStreptomyces bulliicStreptomyces desertiiStreptomyces leeuwenhoekiic*Uncharacterized members of the phylum Actinobacteria (sensu Goodfellow 2012) have been isolated from highly acidic habitats and per-maforest soils.aFilamentious actinobacteria.bNovel specialized metabolites produced by members of these species.Journal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 646Micro-organisms from extreme environments A.M. Sayed et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/128/3/630/6714745 by National Cheng Kung University, Medical Library user on 21 March 2023distribution of gifted microbial taxa sensu Baltz (2017,2019).The results of this survey provide further evidence ofthe value of the taxonomic approach to the discovery ofnew drugs, as outlined in Fig. 1. It is evident from Tables1 and 2 that novel species of ﬁlamentous actinobacteriaand fungi, particularly those isolated from AtacamaDesert habitats, are a very good source of new bioactivecompounds thereby underpinning the view that thesemicro-organisms should feature strongly in bioprospect-ing campaigns (Bull and Goodfellow 2019). Substantialimprovements in the taxonomic approach to drug dis-covery can be expected given developments in the classiﬁ-cation and identiﬁcation of eukaryotes and prokaryotesdriven by advances in whole-genome sequencing proce-dures and associated improvements in bioinformatics asexempliﬁed by Nouiou et al . (2019), increased under-standing of the extent of microbial diversity in naturalhabitats (Bull et al. 2018b) coupled with developmentsdesigned to provide chemical dereplication (Bull andGoodfellow 2019).It can also be anticipated that improvements in searchand discovering pipelines will be promoted in no smallmeasure by focusing heavily on novel culturable micro-organisms with large genomes, as advocated by Baltz(2017, 2019). In this context, future bioprospecting cam-paigns should not only be focused on micro-organismslike actinobacteria and fungi that are known to have aprosperity to synthesize antibiotics of therapeutic value(B/C19erdy 2012; Newman and Cragg 2016; Zhang et al.2018), but also on representatives of under-exploredmicro-organisms with genomes rich in NP-BGCs, such ascyanobacteria, frankiae, ktedonobacteria and myxobacte-ria, representatives of all of these taxa are known to beattractive candidates for drug discovery programmes(Dixit and Suseela 2013; Micallef et al. 2015; Baltz 2019;Nouioui et al. 2019).It can be concluded that there are strong grounds forbelieving that microbial NPs will continue to be a sourceof new therapeutic agents, an optimism we share withothers (Genilloud 2017; Baltz 2017, 2019; Bull and Good-fellow 2019). In particular, there are good reasons forbelieving that extremophilic and extremotolerant micro-organisms will have pride of place in the provision of anew generation of clinically signiﬁcant drugs thereby pre-venting a return to preantibiotic days of medicine. How-ever, the success of future bioprospecting campaigns willdepend upon access to extreme biomes, notably ones likethe Atacama Desert, that are known to be reservoirs ofgifted micro-organisms, especially Actinobacteria andCyanobacteria (Bull et al. 2016; Goodfellow et al. 2018;Bull and Goodfellow 2019). However, extreme habitats bytheir very nature are fragile and hence vulnerable tohuman activities such as mining and to climateTable 2 Examples of fungi isolated from selected extreme biomes and assigned to established genera and associated novel or validly named spe-ciesaAtacama Desert soils Permaforest soils Deep-sea sediments Saline/hypersaline habitatsGenera Genera Genera GeneraAlternaria Aspergillus Aspergillus AspergillusAmandinea Cladospora Cryptococcus CladosporiumAspergillus Cladosporium Pichia EmericellaBuellia Geomyces Graphium EurotiumCaloplaca Oidiodendron Penicillium HorteaCladosporium Penicillium Rhodotorula PenicilliumDiploicia Thielavia TrimmatostromaFusarium WalleniaMyriosporaNeucatenulostromaPenicilliumRhizocarponUlocladiumSpeciesbSpeciesbSpeciesbSpeciesbAmandinea efﬂorescens Aspergillus ocraceo Aspergillus westerdijkiae Hortea werneckiiAspergillus atacamensis Diploicia etaliformis Penicillium crustosum T. salinumAspergillus salisburgensis Oidiodendron truneatumDiploicia canescens Penicillium crustosumMyriospora smaragula Penicillium fumiculosumRhizocarpon simillunumaLittle is known about fungi in highly acidic and hot springs habitats.bNovel specialized metabolites produced by members of these species.Journal of Applied Microbiology 128, 630- -657 ©2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology 647A.M.

Although concernsalong these lines are revisited from time to time (Cockelland Jones 2009; Bull and Goodfellow 2019), there is acrying need for microbiologists and associated institu-tions to ensure that policy makers promote microbialconservation, especially in habitats known to be thesource of gifted micro-organisms.Conﬂict of InterestThe authors have no conﬂict of interest.ReferencesAbdelkader, M.S., Philippon, T., Asenjo, J.A., Bull, A.T.,Goodfellow, M., Ebel, R., Jaspars, M. and Rateb, M.E.(2018) Asenjonamides A-C, antibacterial metabolitesisolated from Streptomyces asenjonii strain KNN 42.f froman extreme hyper-arid Atacama Desert soil.
