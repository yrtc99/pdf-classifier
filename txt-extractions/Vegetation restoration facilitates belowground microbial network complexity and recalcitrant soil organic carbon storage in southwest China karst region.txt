IntroductionThe 540,000 km2karst region including Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxiprovinces of southwest China is the core of east Asia karst areas, which isone of three major karst areas in the world ( Fan et al., 2011 ). Karst land-scape typically has its own particularities, such as soluble rock, calcium-rich, double-layer structure and so forth ( Yuan, 1997, 2001 ). These distinctgeological and hydrological characters make it extremely vulnerable to an-thropogenic interference and lead to ecological environmental degradation(Jiang et al., 2014 ). From 1949 to 1970s, under the pressure of 1.7 millionpeople living there, deforestation to reclaim land for food production, con-sequently, led to severe rocky deserti ﬁcation in these areas ( Song et al.,2019 ). To remediate land degradation and restore degraded soils, severalnationwide ecological restoration projects, such as ‘Grain to Green Project ’and ‘Karst Rocky Deserti ﬁcation Restoration Project ’were implemented byChinese government ( Bai et al., 2019 ). With the enforcement of these pro-jects, large amount of farmlands were returned to forests. Thus, the manualintervention or reforestation provides us a unique model to observechanges in the content and quality of soil organic matter and microbialcomponents ( Wang et al., 2011 ;Lu et al., 2018 ).Soil microorganisms, possessing tremendous physiological and func-tional versatility, are ubiquitous and essential to the biogeochemical cyclingprocesses in terrestrial ecosystems, including plant nutrient assimilation, lit-ter decomposition, material transformation, carbon cycling, and nutrientavailability ( Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018, 2019 ). Several studies pro-vided evidence that the growth of vegetation will in ﬂuence soil physicaland chemical conditions through organic inputs from litters and roots,and soil microbial communities were largely determined by the diversity,composition and production of vegetation ( Zhu et al., 2012 ;Qiu et al.,2020 ;Li et al., 2021 ). Thus, the response of the soil microbial communityto vegetation changes can increase our understanding of the above- andbelow-ground interaction ( Qu et al., 2020 ). To better understanding theirinteractions, the new generation of high-throughput sequencing technologywas emerged. Compared with traditional micro-organism culture methodand PCR-DGGE, clone library and other methods, high-throughput sequenc-ing provides an extraordinary scienti ﬁc and practical tool to understand mi-crobial community structures, diversities, interactions and co-occurrencepatterns ( Liang et al., 2017 ;Schmidt et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2021 ).The restoration or rehabilitation of vegetation in degraded environ-ments has been studied extensively in recent years. Previous studies havefocused largely on soil bacterial community during vegetation restorationprocess. For example, Qu et al. (2020) found that bacterial communityand function shift drastically in the early stages of forest succession causedby forest disease, and the soil pH, total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic car-bon (SOC) were the dominant factors affecting the bacterial community.Cui et al. (2018) found that soil nutrients (SOC, TN, and NH4+) increasedwhile the soil bacterial community structures did not show any changesduring vegetation succession process in Loess Plateau, China. However,there is a paucity of studies discussing the changes in bacterial and fungalcommunity simultaneously, especially in fragile karst ecosystem. It is essen-tial to synchronously study the bacterial and fungal communities in soil tofully understand microbial response to ecosystem processes, because thesecommunities mediate different ecological functions in soil ( Romanowiczet al., 2016 ). In addition, current research has gradually moved from ex-ploring the distribution patterns of microbial communities in different hab-itats to the intrinsic community assembly mechanisms ( Dini-Andreoteet al., 2015 ). Then, clarifying the relationship between community ecolog-ical construction processes and microbial community structure has been ahot topic in microbial ecology in recent years ( Knelman and Nemergut,2014 ). The assembly processes of the microbial community are generallyinﬂuenced by two types of ecological process, including deterministic andstochastic processes ( Stegen et al., 2012 ;Zhao et al., 2019 ). Extensivedata demonstrate that a range of factors, such as nutrition, resource avail-ability, successional stage, and perturbations, can in ﬂuence the relative im-portance of different community assembly processes ( Zhao et al., 2019 ).Gao et al. (2021) found that long-term fertilization of agricultural ﬁeldsled to a targeted enrichment of microbial taxa and enhanced the determin-istic process of community assembly. How karst soil microbial communityassembly process responding to vegetation restoration currently remainselusive, which limits our understanding of microbial community ecologyin karst soils.SOC is an important component of soil ecosystems, providing essentialnutrients for plant growth and improving soil fertility. The chemical struc-ture and stability of organic carbon is the key to study soil fertility and car-bon cycling ( Paul, 2016 ). Nevertheless, current knowledge of the speci ﬁcassociation between SOC molecular properties and microbiota is limited,since most previous studies focused on analysis of quantitative changes inorganic carbon pools. How SOC quality changes with time series is still lack-ing a general consensus. Recent evidence suggests that microbes can pro-gressively exploiting leaf litter and alter its chemical compounds which inturn affects microbial community composition during leaf litter decomposi-tion process ( Bonanomi et al., 2018 ). In this regard, we speculated that SOCchemical dynamics during vegetation restoration were associated with thechanges of soil microbial community composition. Microbial processing oforganic matter involves not only consumption and degradation, but also theaccumulation of new molecules ( Hu et al., 2021 ). The relationship betweensoil microbe and SOC chemical compounds could be more sophisticatedthan expected. Hence, understanding the relationship between SOC chem-ical compounds and soil microbial community is of paramount signi ﬁcancein predicting the C fate in soil following vegetation restoration.In order to ﬁll the knowledge gap, the soil samples from ﬁve typical veg-etation types, including corn land, grassland, shrub land, secondary forestand primary forest, representing a spontaneous successional sequence insubtropical karst rocky deserti ﬁcation control ecosystems at national obser-vation and research station in Baise, China were selected as the research ob-jects by using ‘space for time ’substitution ( ‘Chronosequence ’) method.Despite its drawbacks, the ‘space for time ’substitution approach is widelyacknowledged as the sole means to determine long-term ecological pro-cesses ( Li et al., 2021 ). High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA andITS gene combined with13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy(13C NMR hereafter) analysis were used to investigate the structural charac-teristic and interactions between microbial communities, characterize theSOC chemical compounds, and determine the speci ﬁcr e l a t i o n s h i pb e t w e e nSOC chemical compounds and microbial community across the restorationchronosequence. Given vegetation variations contributing signi ﬁcantly toshaping the microbial community ( Zhao et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2021 ;Khalid et al., 2022 ), we hypothesized that both bacterial and fungal com-munities and their assembly mechanisms would change with vegetationrestoration process in karst area. Due to soil microorganisms determiningthe fate of soil organic matter ( Hu et al., 2021 ), we then hypothesizedthat the dominant microbial functional groups are interlinked with SOCchemical compounds in revegetation processes. Brie ﬂy, our study focuseson investigating microbial community change pattern during vegetationrestoration and the driving of soil microorganisms on C fate in karst rockydeserti ﬁcation area by addressing the following questions: 1. Does vegeta-tion restoration alter the soil microbial community? 2. What are the domi-nant community assembly mechanisms at different successional stages? 3.How do soil physicochemical and organic carbon chemical compounds re-spond to vegetation restoration, and do these changes associate with themicrobial community? This research will advance our understanding ofL. Hu et al. Science of the Total Environment 820 (2022) 1531372the relationships among microbes and soil environment under the in ﬂuenceof vegetation restoration in karst area.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study sitesThe national observation and research station in Baise (104°26 ′-107°54 ′E, 22°51 ′-25°07 ′N) is located in the western part of Guangxi Zhuang Auton-omous Region, which is situated in the transition zone from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the Guangxi Hilly Basin. Its rocks are mainly composedof pure limestone and siliceous limestone. Moreover, this area is dominatedby subtropical monsoon climate with abundant light and heat. The averageannual temperature is 19.0 –22.3 °C, and the average annual precipitation is1113 –1713 mm. In the past, the rocky deserti ﬁcation was severe, the vege-tation coverage was limited, the composition of tree species was monoto-nous, and there were invasive exotic species such as Eupatorium odoratumL. After almost 30 years' rocky deserti ﬁcation control, the forest coveragerate has risen from 35.5% to 66.62%, which not only successfully curbedthe further aggravation of rocky deserti ﬁcation but also protected part ofthe forest ecosystem ( Yin and Yin, 2010 ).2.2. Field measurement and bulk soil samples collectionField measurements and sample collections were carried out in August2020. In the transition zone from corn land to primary forest, we selectedﬁve different habitat types: corn land (YM) covered with Zea mays , grass-land (CD) mainly covered with Achnatherum splendens (Trin.) Nevski,shrub land (XG) mainly covered with Vitex negundo L. and Pennisetumalopecuroides (L.) Spreng., secondary forest (CSL) mainly covered withSchizophragma integrifolium (Franch.) Oliv., Derris fordii ,Acacia concinna(Willd.) DC., Mallotus tenuifolius ,Cipadessa baccifera andFicus erecta , andprimary forest (YS) mainly covered with Photinia komarovii ,Xylosmaconqesta andSloanea hemsleyana to represent the different stages of the typ-ical vegetation successional process in this area. The distance between dif-ferent successional stage sample plots was approx. 1000 m. Three 10 m2quadrats were established along the “S”type for each sample plot, andeach quadrat was approx. 10 m apart. Due to the high spatial heterogeneityfeatures of karst soil ( Li et al., 2021 ),ﬁve sampling cores with 5 cm diame-ter and 20 cm depth in each quadrat were hybridized to obtain a compositesoil sample, and a total of 15 soil samples were collected. Soil samples werepacked in sterile plastic bags and immediately transferred to the laboratoryto remove plant roots, gravel and other external intruder. After that, eachsample was homogenized and divided into two sub-samples. One fresh sub-set was passed through 2.00 mm sieve and then stored at −80 °C for 16SrRNA and ITS gene sequencing. The remaining subset was further separatedinto two portions. One portion was screened through 2.00 mm sieve andstored at 4 °C to determine soil moisture (SM), microbial biomass carbon(MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, while the otherportion was air-dried and passed through 0.15 mm or 2.00 mm sieve forthe measurement of pH, SOC, TN, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), totalphosphorous (TP), exchangeable calcium (E-Ca), exchangeable magnesium(E-Mg) and available potassium (AK).2.3. Soil physicochemical analysisSOC content was determined by potassium dichromate ‑sulfuric acid ox-idation method ( Bremner and Jenkinson, 2010 ). TN content was deter-mined by Kjeldahl method ( Baethgen and Alley, 1989 ). TP content wasdetermined by acid solution ‑molybdenum antimony colorimetric method(Parkinson and Allen, 2009 ). SM content was determined by gravimetricanalysis. Potentiometric method was used for measuring soil pH value(soil/water ratio = 1:5, M/V) ( Li et al., 2015 ). E-Ca, E-Mg and AK were ex-tracted from 6 g of soil using 40 mL 0.1 mol/L BaCl 2solution after 2 h ofoscillation, and the extracted solution was determined by ICP-AES(Hendershot and Duquette, 1986 ). DOC content was extracted by highpurity deionized water, and the supernatant was ﬁltered through 0.45 μmmembrane, then measured by total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-VCPH,SHIMADZU, Japan) ( Lu, 1999 ). MBN and MBC contents were determinedby chloroform fumigation-K 2SO4extraction method ( Lu, 1999 ).SOC chemical data were obtained from13C NMR analysis. The NMR in-strument used for analysis is Bruker Avance 400 at Nanjing University ofScience and Technology. The test conditions were spectral frequency - 100MHz, contact time - 1 ms, delay time - 0.5 s, sampling time - 0.05 s, and num-ber of scan - 30,720 times. The chemical displacement and integration rangeof various organic carbon functional groups selected in this study were alkylC( 0 –45 ppm), methoxyl C (46 –60 ppm), O-alkyl C (61 –90 ppm), di- O-alkylC( 9 1 –110 ppm), H- and C- substituted aromatic C (111 –140 ppm), O-substituted aromatic C (141 –160 ppm) and carboxylic C (161 –190 ppm).2.4. DNA extraction and bioinformatic analysisDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil samples with the Power Soil DNAIsolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following themanufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of the extractedDNA were determined by using Quawell Q5000 (Quawell Technology,Inc., San Jose, USA). The primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA)and 907R (CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT) were used for PCR ampli ﬁcationof the 16S rRNA V4-V5 variable region ( Caporaso et al., 2011 ), and ITS1F(CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) combined with ITS2R (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) were used for PCR ampli ﬁcation of the ITS rRNA region(Limon et al., 2017 ). Speci ﬁc barcode sequences were added to the aboveprimers 907R and ITS2R to differentiate the different samples. The ampli ﬁ-cation products were sequenced on the next-generation Illumina Novaseqplatform at Guangdong Meige Gene Technology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou,China). The obtained sequencing downstream data were divided into dif-ferent sample data according to barcode sequence, and the barcode se-quence was truncated. Flash version 1.2.11 software was used to spliceeach sample sequence ( Mago and Salzberg, 2011 ). Primer sequences andsequences less than 200 bp were removed using Cutadapt version 1.9.1 soft-ware ( Martin, 2011 ). Usearch version 8.1.1861 software was used to re-move chimeras and perform cluster analysis on the processed sequences,and sequences >97% similarity levels were grouped into an OTU (opera-tional taxonomic unit). Bacterial and fungal OTU taxonomic informationwere obtained by comparing the representative sequences of OTUs withSilva version 132 16S rRNA and UNITE version 8.0 databases, respectively,using Uclust version 1.2.22 software ( Edgar, 2010 ). To avoid biases causedby the different sequencing depths, OTU tables were rare ﬁed to the lowestnumber of sequences per sample (47,704 and 48,732 for bacteria and fungi,respectively) using single_rarefaction.py script. Based on the rare ﬁed OTUtables, QIIME version 1.9.1 software was used to calculate alpha diversityindex (Chao1, Simpson, Shannon, and Observed OTUs) and beta diversitydistance (Weighted UniFrac) matrices ( Caporaso et al., 2010 ). The 16SrRNA and ITS genes sequences were deposited into the NCBI SequenceRead Archive (SRA) database with the number of PRJNA778339 andPRJNA778453.2.5. Statistical analysisSPSS version 25.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) were usedfor statistical analyses of soil physicochemical property parameters,13C-CPMAS NMR-derived parameters and microbial diversity indices in differ-ent successional stages. One-way-analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA)followed by least-signi ﬁcant difference (LSD) multiple comparison test at0.05 level was used for signi ﬁcance analysis. The NMR functional grouparea integration was carried out with the MestReNova software version14.0 to obtain the relative abundance of different C-types. The Origin ver-sion 8.5 software was used to map the abundance of bacterial and fungalcommunities at the phylum level. R environment ( http://www.r-project.com) with version 3.6.1 was also used to perform statistical computation.Venn diagrams were generated to explore the distribution patterns of bac-teria and fungi at OTU level by using Venn package in R. Principal co-L. Hu et al. Science of the Total Environment 820 (2022) 1531373ordinates analysis (PCoA) (based on Bray-Curtis distance algorithm) andanalysis of similarity (ANOSIM) plots were drawn to assess the similarityof soil bacterial and fungal community structures by applying the Veganpackage in R. Heat maps of dominant OTUs ( >0.5%) and the Pearson cor-relations between edaphic variables and dominant OTUs with Pvalues<0.05 were created by Pheatmap package in R to determine the in ﬂuenceof environmental factors on the change in relative abundance of microbialtaxa. The β-mean nearest taxon distance ( βMNTD) and β-nearest taxonindex ( βNTI) were calculated by Picante package in R following the proto-col outlined by Stegen et al. (2012) to shed light on whether deterministicor stochastic processes shaped the microbial community along vegetationrestoration processes. If | βNTI|≥2, then a deterministic process accountsfor differences between microbial communities in two samples, conversely,if |βNTI|<2, then a stochastic process explains observed differences in mi-crobial community composition between two samples. Subsequently, de-terministic and stochastic processes can be further categorized into ﬁveecological processes according to βNTI and Bray-Curtis-based Raup-CrickIndex (RC Bray) values, including homogeneous selection ( βNTI>2), hetero-geneous selection ( βNTI<−2), dispersal limitation (| βNTI|<2a n dR C Bray>0.95), homogenizing dispersal (| βNTI|<2 and RC Bray<−0.95), andundominated (| βNTI|<2 and |RC Bray|<0.95). Redundancy analysis(RDA) of dominant OTUs and soil physicochemical parameters was madeby CANOCO for Windows 5.0 (Ithaca, NY, United States) to detect thestrength of edaphic drivers upon bacterial and fungal communities' struc-ture. Gephi version 0.9.2 software was used to plot the Pearson correlationnetworks to characterize the interactions with Pvalues <0.05 among thedominant OTUs and between soil physicochemical factors and dominantOTUs ( Li et al., 2021 ). Based on the reference of Barberan et al. (2012) ,the OTUs with more than 5 sequences in each group were selected for fur-ther analysis, and the co-occurrence networks of soil bacteria and fungiacross ﬁve successional stages were mapped via Gephi version 0.9.2 soft-ware. To determine the potential microbial ecological functions in soils indifferent successional stages, the dominant OTUs obtained were comparedwith the FAPROTAX (script version 1.1) and FUNGuild v1.1 databases topredict the potential metabolic functions of soil bacterial and fungal com-munities. Finally, Pearson correlation matrix was calculated to determinethe speci ﬁc relationships between the dominant microbial functionalgroups and resulted C-types.3. Results3.1. Bulk soil physicochemical and SOC chemical compound characteristicsSigniﬁcant differences of soil physicochemical properties in vegetationrestoration processes were observed ( Table 1 ). SOC, TN, MBC, MBN,DOC, AK, E-Ca and SM contents generally increased along with the restora-tion chronosequence. High spatial heterogeneity in soil TP and E-Mgcontents emerged among the ﬁve successional stages. Interestingly, the var-iation of pH ranged from 6.41 to 7.25, with YS having a considerable lowerpH than that in YM, CD and CSL, but no signi ﬁcant difference appeared be-tween YS and XG.13C NMR spectra revealed the dynamics in the relativeabundance of different C chemical compounds during vegetation restora-tion ( Table 1 ). It is notable that the relative abundance of Alkyl C and O-alkyl C showed an increasing trend with vegetation recovery, althoughthe change of Alkyl C was not signi ﬁcant. Conversely, the relative abun-dance of Methoxyl C followed an opposite trend, with signi ﬁcant differencesbetween YM and other successional stages. The relative abundance of Car-boxylic C did not change substantially in vegetation restoration processes.3.2. Soil microbial community compositionThe distribution of microorganisms d iffered at the phylum level across allof the soil samples ( Fig. 1 A and C). The dominant bacterial phyla in the stud-ied soil samples were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. Thetotal proportions of the three dominant bacteria were YM (53.32%), CD(69.98%), XG (62.06%), CSL (65.62%) and YS (68.11%) (Table S1). Ascomy-cota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota were the dominant fungal phyla, andthe total proportions of the three dominant fungi were YM (92.81%), CD(78.99%), XG (76.36%), CSL (90.97%) and YS (89.52%) (Table S1). It is re-markable that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was signi ﬁcantlower in YM and XG than that in CD, CSL and YS, the relative abundance ofBasidiomycota was highest in YS, and the relative abundance of Ascomycotawas lowest in XG. In addition, the relative abundance of soil bacterial and fun-gal communities varied in each soil sample, which in turn re ﬂected the highlyheterogeneous characteristics in karst soils ( Fig. 1 Ba n dD ) .Venn diagrams demonstrated that OTUs of soil bacteria and fungi var-ied in vegetation restoration processes (Fig. S1A and S1B).

The ratios of bacterial to fungalOTUs in different soils were 1.74, 1.47, 1.44, 1.45 and 1.56, respectively.Generally, the site-shared bacterial and fungal OTUs are de ﬁned as general-ists, which were assigned into Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Ascomycotaand Basidiomycota. Moreover, the heat map showed the distribution ofthe 29 dominant bacterial and 41 dominant fungal OTUs ( Fig. 2 A and B)in different successional stages, indicating that vegetation restorationexerted a greater effect on most frequent OTUs occurrences. The dominantOTUs differed across the ﬁve successional stages, e.g., YM was dominatedby OTUs 21 ( Gaiellales ), 18 ( Rokubacteriales ), 1 ( Mortierella ), and 8(Nectriaceae ), whereas CD was dominated by OTUs 6 ( Methylobacterium ),4(Sphingomonas ), 3 ( Dongia ), 177 ( Luedemannella ), 9 ( Derxomyces ), 20(Candida ), 49 (Fungi unidenti ﬁed), 38 ( Hortaea ), 3 ( Mycoarthris ), 7 (Fungiunidenti ﬁed), 47 (Fungi unidenti ﬁed), 26 ( Paecilomyces ), and 27 (Fungi un-identi ﬁed).3.3. Soil microbial diversityThe microbial alpha diversity varied among the studied samples(Table 2 ). According to OTU diversity estimated by Shannon index, thegreatest bacteria diversity was in XG, followed by CSL, YM and YS, whereasCD showed the lowest bacteria diversity. The greatest fungi diversity was inCSL, followed by YM, XG and YS, likewise, the lowest fungi diversity was inCD. The richness of bacteria (estimated by Chao1 index) ﬂuctuated and themaximum result was in YS, whereas fungal richness tended to increase fromCD to YS. The overall change in diversity and richness of bacteria was notsigniﬁcantly different with the revegetation duration, and fungi did notalso, except for CD.The beta diversity of soil microbial communities in different succes-sional stages was analyzed by PCoA based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to vi-sualize the effects of vegetation restoration on soil microbial communities.There was a certain distance between different soil samples, indicating thatthe bacterial and fungal community varied in different successional stages(Fig. 3 A and B). Notably, the magnitude of the shift in fungal communitywas greater than that in bacterial community. Moreover, the ANOSIM anal-ysis tested signi ﬁcant differences of soil bacterial ( R= 0.346, P= 0.001)and fungal ( R= 0.228, P= 0.031) community structure among the ﬁvesuccessional stages ( Fig. 3 C and D). Further ANOSIM analysis betweenevery two successional stages showed the more different of CSL/YM andless different of CSL/YS in bacterial community, whereas CD/YM showedless different and CD/YS showed more different in fungal community(Fig. S2A and S2B). Additionally, a higher relative contribution of deter-ministic processes mainly belonging to heterogeneous selection was ob-served for bacterial community assembly, while stochastic processesbelonging to homogenizing dispersal dominated the assembly of soil fungalcommunities in different successional stages according to the resultingβNTI and RCBrayvalues (Fig. S3A and S3B).3.4. The relationship between edaphic characters and microbesRDA plots on the most abundant OTUs ( >0.5%) (29 and 41 for bacteriaand fungi, respectively) were performed to explore the key drivers shapingsoil microbial communities ( Fig. 4 C and D). According to the RDA plots, theﬁrst two axes explained 59.64% and 44.92% of the variability of the bacte-rial and fungal community structure respectively. The major edaphic vari-ables driving soil bacterial community composition were SOC ( F= 3.9,Fig. 1. Soil bacterial (A) and fungal (C) dominant phyla in vegetation restoration processes and in every single soil samples (B and D). Sequences not classi ﬁed to any knownphylum are included as unassigned bacteria. In each sample, bacterial phyla with relative frequency of less than 0.1% are included as others.

Pearson correlation-based heat maps graphically demonstrated that the distribution of29 most abundant bacterial OTUs and 41 most abundant fungalOTUs was strongly affected by edaphic variables ( Fig. 4 Aa n dB ) .N e t -work analysis showed associations between highly connected generaand edaphic parameters ( Fig. 4 E and F). The nodes in the networkwere assigned to six bacterial phyla and ﬁve fungal phyla, of whichAcidobacteria, Actinobacteria, P roteobacteria, Ascomycota and Ba-sidiomycota were widely distrib uted, accounting for more than 50%of total nodes. Noteworthy, the relative abundances of most frequentOTUs from Proteobacteria, Acidoba cteria, Actinobacteria, Ascomy-cota and Basidiomycota had a signi ﬁcant negative or positive relation-ship with SOC content.Fig. 2.

Microbial co-occurrence network analysisCo-occurrence network and its topological properties were generated tobetter decipher the potential interactions between soil bacterial and fungalcommunities ( Fig. 5 ). The formed soil microbial interaction networks inYM, CD, XG, CSL and YS included 240, 247, 234, 326 and 230 nodes(OTUs) as well as 24,246, 26,947, 20,342, 40,166 and 18,990 edges, re-spectively. The average degree or node connectivity in YM, CD, XG, CSLand YS was 101.025, 109.097, 86.932, 123.209 and 82.565, respectively.The clustering coef ﬁcient in YM, CD, XG, CSL and YS was 0.998, 0.998,0.996, 0.997 and 0.996, respectively, and the modularity index in YM,CD, XG, CSL and YS was 0.438, 0.503, 0.565, 0.441 and 0.547, respectively.Interestingly, the ratio of bacterial nodes was the highest across all soil sam-ples, whereas the proportion of fungal nodes did not differ signi ﬁcantly inYS and XG and were both higher than that in CD and CSL, indicating thatthe vegetation restoration process promotes the growth of fungi to someextent. However, the highest percentage of fungal nodes in YM maybe re-late to anthropogenic disturbances such as fertilizer/tillage. It should benoted that all the top four bacteria and two fungi in the network wereassigned into Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloro ﬂexi,Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Meanwhile, Bryobacter ,Haliangium , andMND1 were identi ﬁed as the top three genera in the co-occurrence net-work.3.6. The potential microbial ecological functionsSoil microbial communities in vegetation restoration processes havevarious ecological functions. Five main bacterial ecological functionswere identi ﬁed in the studied samples ( Fig. 6 A-6E), which were aerobicammonia oxidation, nitri ﬁcation and nitrate reduction involved in Ncycle, and aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy involvedin C cycle. Among them, the abundance of aerobic ammonia oxidationFig. 3.

Science of the Total Environment 820 (2022) 1531378and nitri ﬁcation functional groups were highest in YM, and tended to in-crease from CD to YS, while aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrate reductionand chemoheterotrophy groups showed a decreasing trend with the resto-ration process. With respect to fungal communities, they can be distinguishedinto six trophic types ( Fig. 6 F-K), which were Pathotroph, Saprotroph,Symbiotroph, Saprotroph-Symbiotroph, Pathotroph-Symbiotroph, andPathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora. Among them, Pathotroph ﬂorahad the highest abundance in XG, and tended to decrease with the restorationprocess. Saprotroph ﬂora was more abundant in YS, followed by YM and CD,while XG and CSL showed the lowest abundance. The groups of Symbiotrophﬂora were mostly distributed in XG, wit h extremely lower abundance in othersuccessional stages. The groups of Saprotroph-Symobiotroph ﬂora showedthe lowest abundance in YS, and ﬂuctuated in abundance from YM to CSL.As to Pathotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora, higher abundance was found in CSLand YS, with the lowest abundance in CD and XG. Additionally, there werehigher abundances of Pathotro ph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora in YM, XGand YS soils.The above mentioned different microbial functional groups had signi ﬁ-cant correlations with the measured SOC chemical compounds (Table S2).Speciﬁcally, the aerobic ammonia oxidation, nitri ﬁcation and Pathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora were positively correlated with Carboxylic C.Nitrate reduction ﬂora was negatively correlated with di- O-alkyl C and O-alkyl C. The groups of Saprotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora were negatively corre-lated with O-alkyl C, and groups of Pathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotrophﬂora were positively correlated with Carboxylic C.4. Discussion4.1. The in ﬂuence of vegetation restoration on soil physicochemical propertiesand SOC chemical compoundsPrevious studies have demonstrated signi ﬁcant effects of vegetation res-toration on soil physicochemical properties ( Li et al., 2014 ;Jiang et al.,2014 ;Chang et al., 2018 ;Bai et al., 2019 ). Our study showed that SOC,TN, TP, MBC, MBN, DOC, AK, E-Ca and SM generally increased with timeseries, suggesting that vegetation restoration not only accelerates organicmatter accumulation but also increases the soil water-holding capacity inkarst ecosystems. The increased SOC as well as N accumulation driven bythe translation of plant residues and root exudation to belowground Cand N storage suggested the co-evolution process of the C and N cycle inkarst calcareous soil ( Shao et al., 2019 ). Soil TP content exhibited a highspatial heterogeneity, which might be explained by derived-P mainlyfrom the weathering release of soil minerals, which was a long-term biolog-ical cycle process ( Wen et al., 2018 ). Besides that, DOC and MBC are part ofsoil active organic carbon ( Hu et al., 2021 ). Although it only accounts for asmall part of SOC, it is fast-moving, unstable, easily oxidized and mineral-ized, as well as the driving force of soil microbial activity energy and soilnutrients. In the present study, the variation trend of soil active organic car-bon in vegetation restoration processes was basically similar to that of or-ganic carbon with a good positive correlation (Table S3). This resultindicates that the content of soil active organic carbon was largely deter-mined by the content of SOC, and the content of SOC was affected by thedifferent organic matter content input to soil in vegetation restoration pro-cesses. Soil calcium also plays a signi ﬁcant role in maintaining SOC poolthrough a chemical bonding mechanism and chemical structure stability(Rowley et al., 2018 ).Except for the change in the amount of SOC, the SOC chemical com-pounds also changed in vegetation restoration processes. The relative abun-dance of Alkyl C fractions, which correspond to long chain aliphatic andwaxes, slightly increased along the successional trajectory. Alkyl C ispositively associated with soil organic carbon stability ( Bonanomi et al.,2018 ). Thus, the increased abundance of Alkyl C may indicate the en-hanced SOC stability companied with vegetation restoration. The preserva-tion of recalcitrant C compounds also may have been due to some labile Ccompounds quickly consumed by microorganisms ( Hu et al., 2021 ). Be-sides, the amount and type of litter and plant root exudates can lead tothe differentiation of SOC molecules. It has been reported that there is agood correlation between plant residues and O-alkyl C in soil with the ex-tension of vegetation restoration years ( Erhagen et al., 2013 ). In the presentstudy, the relative abundance of O-alkyl C increased in concert with the rel-ative abundance of Alkyl C. Yet, no signi ﬁcant difference of Alkyl C abun-dance was observed as vegetation restoration progressed, which mayhave been due to land restoration generally accompanied by labile Cpools increasing more quickly than recalcitrant C pools ( Zhang et al.,2019c ).Calcareous soils with high Ca2+concentrations developed from carbon-ate bedrock are normally characterized by high pH ( Bárcenas-Moreno et al.,2011 ). In the present study, the soil exhibited pH values >6.41 which re-ﬂects the characteristics of higher pH in karst soils. A decreasing trend inpH was also observed as vegetation restoration progressed. A plausible ex-planation for the signi ﬁcant lower pH value in YS could be attributed to alarge amount of deciduous aggregates on soil surface in primary foreststhat can release various organic acids and CO 2in the process of organicmatter being decomposed by soil microorganisms. The high soil humuscontent exist in primary forests may also contribute to the decrease of soilpH (Brand et al., 1986 ), in accordance with previous studies ( Schipperet al., 2001 ;Holtkamp et al., 2008 ). Moreover, the alkali environment re-stricts the improvement of fertility in lime soil and appropriately reducesthe soil pH values, which effectively improve soil fertility ( Deng et al.,2010 ). In the present study, vegetation restoration has signi ﬁcant impactson edaphic properties and SOC chemical compounds dynamics. Nonethe-less, these changes can not be fully understood without soil microorganismsince it plays a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial ecosystem(Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018, 2019 ;Wagg et al., 2019 ).4.2. The in ﬂuence of vegetation restoration on microbial distribution andassemblySoil properties play a vital role in determining microbial compositionand changes in soil microbial community are important indicators of soilquality ( Liang et al., 2017 ;Shan et al., 2017 ). Thus, understanding the dy-namics of microbial communities is of great signi ﬁcance in studying the en-tire terrestrial ecosystem. Consistent with our hypothesis, bacterial andfungal beta diversity varied signi ﬁcantly along vegetation restorationchronosequence indicating that returning farmland to forests disruptedthe microbial niches created by karst ecosystem in each phase of succession,and soil microbial communities differing dramatically were associated withshifts in speci ﬁc soil characteristics ( Li et al., 2021 ). Besides, the transitionin bacterial communities was more gradual and overlapped, whereas fugalcommunities were more distinct in different restoration stages ( Fig. 3 Aa n dB). This is congruent to prior observations that plant-fungi symbioses aremore prevalent than that with bacteria ( Shan et al., 2017 ) and most bacte-ria inhabiting tiny-scale niches in bulk soil have less direct contact withplants than fungi ( Bonfante and Anca, 2009 ). This phenomenon was alsovalidated by the Venn diagrams (Fig. S1A and S1B). Interestingly, both bac-terial and fungal communities from corn land were signi ﬁcantly differentfrom those in primary forest (Fig. S2A and S2B), implying that the rate ofspecies replacement was relatively fast, possibly due to the lack of soil nu-trients in corn land and increased competition during succession process,which intensi ﬁes the species replacement between communities ( SunFig. 4.

Hu et al. Science of the Total Environment 820 (2022) 1531379et al., 2017 ;Qiu et al., 2020 ). The abundance of fungal communities tendedto increase after the farmland was converted to forest, however, no conspic-uous change patterns were observed in diversity, suggesting that reforesta-tion maybe have more obvious in ﬂuence on their abundances than theirdiversities. Moreover, the peak richness of bacteria and fungi was foundin YS, which may have been due to the coexistence of both r-a n d K-selected species at the end of succession ( Mouquet et al., 2002 ).Uncovering the microbial assembly processes is essential to advancefundamentally understanding of ecosystem diversity and functioning(Sessitsch et al., 2019 ;Singh et al., 2020 ;Trivedi et al., 2020 ). Previousstudies have discovered that in severe or extremely variable circumstances,a certain environmental factor will become the limiting factor impactingmicrobial community succession and deterministic processes ( Grahamet al., 2017 ). However, stochastic processes play a dominant role in rela-tively mild and less disturbed environments, where microbial communitychanges are more likely to come from probabilistic dispersal and randombirth-death events, etc. ( Dini-Andreote et al., 2015 ). In the present study,soil bacterial communities were mainly controlled by deterministic pro-cesses, more speci ﬁcally, heterogeneous selection, while stochastic pro-cesses (homogenizing dispersal) dominated the assembly of soil fungalcommunities across the ﬁve vegetation successional processes, contradic-ting our hypothesis. Generally, heterogeneous selection is determined bydynamic selection under biotic or abiotic conditions and can lead to largechanges in microbial community ( Zhang et al., 2019a ). Heterogeneous se-lection dominating bacterial community assembly process maybe relateto the signi ﬁcant changes in edaphic properties during vegetation restora-tion. By contrast, fungi are more capable of adapting to complex environ-mental changes, and some of them will adopt multiple nutritionalapproaches simultaneously to enhance their autotrophic survival ( Xionget al., 2020 ). Therefore, stochastic processes (homogenizing dispersal) ofsoil fungal communities were found in our study.4.3. Impact of edaphic factors on soil microorganismsThe varied structure of microbial communities is closely related toedaphic properties ( Shan et al., 2017 ;Li et al., 2021 ). Previous studieshave illustrated that SOC was the key factor in ﬂuencing the bacterial com-munity structure ( Fierer and Jackson, 2006 ;Lauber et al., 2009 ;Grifﬁthset al., 2011 ). In the present study, SOC was closely related to soil bacterialdistribution in vegetation restoration processes. The strong correlationbetween SOC and bacterial distribution could be explained by thecopiotrophic-oligotrophic life strategy of soil bacteria. For example, bacte-ria belonging to Acidobacteria phylum were considered as K-strategistsand were most abundant in nutrient-poor environments ( Gao et al.,2021 ). By contrast, Proteobacteria exhibited copiotrophic attributes andwere enriched in soils with high C availability ( Qu et al., 2020 ). Calcium,as a nutrient element necessary for microbial growth and development,has the function of participating in cellular energy metabolism, regulatingcell proliferation and differentiation, stimulating microbial growth and im-proving microbial activity, which can be used to maintain microbial metab-olism under adverse soil conditions ( Xue et al., 2017 ;Wang et al., 2019 ).Therefore, it was signi ﬁcantly correlated with most bacteria, and this ﬁnd-ing was concur with the conclusions of Xue et al. (2017) andLi et al. (2021)that Ca2+is an essential nutrient that affects bacterial communities in karstsoils. In addition, maybe SM was another important factor driving micro-bial diversity in the present study. Changes of soil moisture will affect oxy-gen levels and substrate availability, consequently, affecting microbialcommunity ( Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2018 ). Moreover, pH, SOC and TNexerted the most signi ﬁcant effects on fungal community, in accordancewith previous studies ( Gao et al., 2021 ). The negative correlation betweenTN and Basidiomycetes may have been due to nitrogen inhibiting the pro-duction of extracellular catabolic enzymes and hydroxyl groups of some Ba-sidiomycetes, thus reducing its ability to break down lignin ( Fog, 1988 ).Each microorganism has an optimum pH for their thriving, and slightchanges in pH may favor different fungal taxa ( Fierer and Jackson, 2006 ;Xue et al., 2017 ). In the present study, the strong correlation between pHand fungal community was resonating with previous works in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau ( Gao et al., 2021 ) and marsh land in Sanjiang Plain ( Xuet al., 2016 ). Though multiple edaphic variables were jointly involved inregulating soil bacterial and fungal community structures, the determiningfactor was SOC, which parallel with the previous studies ( Xue et al., 2017 ;Zhao et al., 2019 ), indicating that soil microbial community structure wasclosely related to soil nutrients especially SOC content ( Liang et al.,2017 ). Besides, the diversities of fungi and bacteria in YS were lower thanthose in YM and XG, implying that early successional stages containinglow amounts of SOC lead to more unique niches and relatively high-resource habitats are less inclined to microbial niche differentiation ( Shaoet al., 2019 ).Fig. 5.

The in ﬂuence of vegetation restoration on microbial co-occurrence patternsMicroorganisms develop interactions within certain ecological niches,such as commensalism, competition, and predation, etc. ( Barberan et al.,2012 ;Faust and Raes, 2012 ), which can be revealed by microbial co-occurrence analysis ( Li et al., 2021 ). In our case, the modularity index >0.4suggests that the network has modular characteristics ( Xue et al., 2017 ).The most abundant phyla in co-occurrence network were Proteobacteriaand Ascomycota, which was in accordance with the result of existing studies(Gao et al., 2021 ), indicating that these microorganisms were adapted to a va-riety of environments ( Jiao et al., 2016 ). Proteobacteria are the main soil bac-terial groups in various habitats ( Cui et al., 2018 ;Qiu et al., 2020 ;Chen et al.,2020 ), and it is assumed that they are able to assimilate easily available or-ganic compounds and grow rapidly ( Fierer and Jackson, 2006 ). Ascomycotaare known as degraders of a variety of plant cellulose and hemicellulose, sug-gesting their important roles in decomposition of macromolecular organicmatter in karst soils ( Shan et al., 2017 ). Moreover, Bryobacter ,Haliangiuma n dM N D 1w e r ei d e n t i ﬁed as the top three genera in the co-occurrence net-work. Bryobacter , an mesophilic and psychrotolerant chemoheterotroph bac-terium that utilizes various sugars, po lysaccharides, and fa tty acids, have theability to grow under anoxic conditions and capability to reduce nitrate(Dedysh et al., 2016 ).Haliangium was con ﬁrmed as a crucial species in soilbiogeochemical cycle, yet further research into their roles in soil microbialco-occurrence network is still required in the future ( Kundim et al., 2003 ).MND1 belongs to β-Proteobacteria which has variable degradation variablecapacity, and is widely distributed in nutrient-poor environments ( Zhaoet al., 2020 ). Thus, all three keystone taxa may play crucial roles in karstsoils. Nevertheless, Li et al. (2021) found that the key taxon bacteria fromkarst soils in Yunnan were Candidatus Udaeobacter ,Chthoniobacterales andPedosphaeraceae . This is unsurprising that the high heterogeneity of karstsoils and the seasonal variation will ch ange the structure of microbial com-munities ( Banerjee et al., 2019 ). Therefore, the key species may only occurin speci ﬁc seasons or time periods ( Banerjee et al., 2019 ).Our results also disclosed that the network properties varied throughoutthe vegetation restoration process. Fo r instance, the proportion of bacterialnodes in the co-occurrence network declined, while the proportion of fungalnodes showed an opposite trend with the extension of succession time series.This may indicate that bacteria dominated a pioneer taxon in the early succes-sion stage, and as the soil nutrients inc reased, the competition of fungi, whichhad acquired enough organic matter, also increased. Previous studies haveshown that forest secondary succession contributes to the formation ofdense root systems and continuously increases nutrient release, which in-creases the activity of soil fungi, making the fungal community structuremore complex and enhancing its resilience to environmental changes ( Baiet al., 2019 ;Liang et al., 2017 ). In general, the more complex and diversethe microbial community structure in soil, the more stable the soil ecosystem,the higher the ecological function of the ecosystem, and thus the more obvi-ous the buffering effect on external environmental changes. It is worth notingthat the lower the bacteria/fungi ratio in soil the more stable the ecosystem(Wal et al., 2006 ). The present study showed that the abundance of soil bac-teria and fungi increased and the bacter ia/fungi ratio decreased in vegetationrestoration processes, indicating that ve getation restoration enhanced the sta-bility of the karst ecosystem. Altered bacteria/fungi ratios induced the differ-ent contributions from microbial catab olism and anabolism driving soil C andNd y n a m i c s( Wagg et al., 2019 ), which may lead to asynchrony of soil carbonand nitrogen. Fungi-dominated soil c ommunities may sequester more C thanthat with lower fungal abundance ( Kallenbach et al., 2016 ). Moreover, strongpositive correlations were observed in the co-occurrence network, while neg-ative correlations were rare, revealin g that microorganisms might cooperatein order to adapt to similar ecological niches ( Liang et al., 2017 ).4.5. The in ﬂuence of vegetation restoration on potential ecological function ofmicrobial communityVersatile microbial metabolic functions were observed across thesuccessional choronoseq uence. Among the identi ﬁed microbialfunctions, the relative abundance o f aerobic ammonia oxidation andnitriﬁcation groups exhibited an increasing trend in the order ofCD, XG, CSL, YS and YM. On the contrary, bacteria with aerobicchemoheterotrophy and chemohet erotrophy potential followed anopposite trend. Previous studies have found that some soil microor-ganisms participate in the nit rogen cycle including nitrogen ﬁxation,nitriﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation and ammonia oxidation to promote ni-trogen transformation ( Parkinson and Allen, 2009 ). Among them,ammonia oxidation, as the ﬁrst link of nitri ﬁcation, is the key rate-limiting reaction of nitri ﬁcation process ( Cui et al., 2018 ). Consider-ing that microorganisms can boost plant growth via increasing thebioavailability of soil-borne nutrients, in which the organic N formscan be transferred to more inorganic forms through microbial depoly-merization and mineralization. Th us, the increased abundance of ni-trate respiration and nitrogen ﬂora during the restoration processcould be the consequence of nutrient demand for plant growth(Xiong et al., 2020 ). In this study, the observed discrepancy of TNcontent in different successional stages may result from the enhance-ment of ammonia oxidation and nitri ﬁcation processes in soil duringvegetation restoration. Correspondingly, the soil N contents have a signif-icant impact on microbial nitrogen redu ction functions (Table S4). It is nota-ble that the abundance of bacteria with chemoheterotrophy potentialdecreased during the succession process, considering that this type of bacteriarequires organic matter for growth and that the SOC content increased con-tinuously in vegetation restoration choronosequence ( Chen et al., 2020 ). Apotential explanation is that the incre ased water content during the succes-sion process may reduce the oxygen level in soil, consequently, vegetationrestoration posed a negative effect on chenmoheterotrophy bacteria.In contrast to bacteria, fungi are indi spensable to breakdown refractoryorganic matter and mediators of slower carbon cycling ( Tolkkinen et al.,2015 ). Increasing evidences have revealed that fungi have more complexniches and formed different functional guilds that implement differentroles in nutrient cycling and carbon storage ( Wal et al., 2006 ;Liu et al.,2015 ). In this study, Saprotroph and Saprotroph-Symbiotroph ﬂora werethe major functional taxa in each sample. Indeed, previous studies demon-strated that saprophytic fungi produce a range of hydrolytic and oxidativeenzymes that decompose dead or senesc ent plant residues and increase soilorganic matter, which is important for a ccelerating decomposition of organicmatter and nutrient cycling ( Liu et al., 2015 ;Shan et al., 2017 ). Generally,saprophytes were mainly from OTUs 12 ( Pseudomassaria ), 3 ( Mycoarthris ),2(Tetracladium ), 15 ( Cystolepiota )a n d3 2( Hydropisphaera ) and they werepositively correlated with SOC and TN con tents, indicating that these groupsm a yp l a yak e yr o l ei nl e a f - d e c o m p o s i t ion and nutrient cycling. Notably, theabundance of Pathotroph-Saprotroph-Symbiotroph trophic mode fungitends to increase with revegetation process. This may be due to the factthat nutrient input changes during vegetation restoration affecting the sur-vival environment of fungi, consequently making the parthenogenic fungidominated and the diversity of fungal metabolic functions increased ( Yanget al., 2021 ). Pathotrophic fungi obtain nutrients mainly from host cellsand can be harmful to plant growth ( Shan et al., 2017 ). Thus, the higherabundance of pathotrophic fungi in X G may imply the higher risk of fungaldiseases than other ecosystem types. The declining trend of pathotrophicfungal abundance in the late successional stages indicates that natural vege-tation restoration process has reduced the risk of fungal diseases to some ex-tent, which is bene ﬁcial to the growth of plants. Meanwhile, we found thatsubstantial saprophytic fungi existed in YS, probably due to the fact that pri-mary forest has a large amount of vegetation apoplast on the soil surface,which enhanced soil water-holding capacity. As a consequence, the highersoil moisture will stimulate the growth of saprophytic fungi to produce a se-ries of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes to complete the decomposition oforganic matter ( Zhang et al., 2019b ). Multiple nutrient types of fungi weredetected in soil samples at each successional stage, suggesting the relativecomplexity of karst habitats to accommo date the survival of different trophicmode fungi. Collectively, these results suggested that bacteria taxa mainlycontributed to soil nitrogen ﬁxation while fungi taxa played key roles in reg-ulating soil C cycle in karst vegetation restoration processes.L. Hu et al. Science of the Total Environment 820 (2022) 153137124.6. Linking microbial modulators to soil recalcitrant carbon storageVegetation restoration is widely recognized as an effective approach tosubstantially increase vegetation coverage and terrestrial carbon sink ( Shiand Han, 2015 ), yet the stable soil C pool and its dynamics are an enigmathat has puzzled scientists for decades. The formation and accumulationof SOC is the long-term evolution of complex organic compounds underspeciﬁc climate and biological environment conditions ( Paul, 2016 ). It in-cludes part of the decomposition of plant macromolecular residues andmicrobial metabolic residues, excrement, secretions and soil humite sub-stances ( Dungait et al., 2011 ). It should be of note that microbial-derivedsubstances, such as chitin and polysaccharide, accumulate continuously insoil along with the microbial growth, metabolism and death, which contrib-ute more than 50% to soil organic matter ( Liang et al., 2017 ). Due to its ownbiochemical properties, microbial necromass C contributed to the stabilizedsoil organic matter considerably. In the present study, both Alkyl and O-alkyl C derived from soil microbial metabolites or plant residues showingan increasing trend in vegetation restoration processes revealed the dualcarbon sink effect with vegetation restoration in karst areas, which furtherreﬂect the huge carbon sequestration potential of southwest China karst re-gion that has been underestimated ( Wang et al., 2020 ). In according withour initial hypothesis, the dominant microbial functional groups had beenthe complex interaction between different C-types (Table S2). The inter-relationship may stem from the changes in microbial enzyme activitiesthat can give rise to selective decomposition of speci ﬁc compounds, modi-fying the structures of plant materials differently, and leading to distinctinter-relationships, depending on plant &tissue types and which microbialpopulations are active ( Liang et al., 2017 ). Interestingly, SOC chemical com-pounds that had a signi ﬁcant correlation with soil microbial functional groupsmainly belonged to amino acids/lignin-like structures (e.g., Carboxylic C andO-alkyl C), which were characterized as readily available to microorganisms,i.e., easily degraded carbon ( Paul, 2016 ). This ﬁnding support the recent pro-posed concept of soil microbial carbon pump, which portrayed the pathwaysof plant- and microbial- derived carbon ﬂow, that are soil microbial dual reg-ulation pathways- “ex vivo modiﬁcation ”and “in vivo turnover ”(Liang et al.,2017 ). Soil microorganisms transform easil y degradable substrates into micro-bial biomass and metabolites through “in vivo turnover ”process, and whensoil microorganisms die their necromass contributes to the stable SOM(Bonanomi et al., 2018 ). Considering the formation mechanism of complexSOC chemical compounds metabolized b y microorganisms is extraordinarysophisticated, the contribution of microbial- and plant-derived compoundsto stable SOM is far from being elucidated. Therefore, further research focusedon the formation and composition of stable SOM is still warranted.5. ConclusionsIn the present study, we revealed the effects of vegetation restoration onmicrobial interactions and recalcitrant SOC storage in southwest Chinakarst region. Revegetation in karst area could alter soil physiochemicalproperties which in turn affected soil microbial community structure. Thedetermining factor shaping soil bacterial and fungal communities in vegeta-tion restoration processes was SOC. The relative abundance of differentsubstances in SOC exhibited different trends in response to vegetation res-toration, e.g., the relative abundance of Alkyl C showing an increasingtrend, while the relative abundance of Methoxyl C decreased. Functionally,bacteria played a vital role in maintaining N cycling and nutrient require-ments while fungi played an increasing role in regulating C cycling. Besidesthat, the complexity of soil bacteria and fungi interactions along the resto-ration chronosequence increased. Moreover, a dominant effect of determin-ism on bacterial communities and stochastic on fungal communities undervegetation restoration scenario were found. The dominant functionalgroups shift with vegetation restoration process, which could be linked tothe enhanced recalcitrant SOC storage. Taken together, our results illus-trated that ecological restoration facilitated belowground microbial net-work complexity and recalcitrant SOC storage in southwest China karstregion, which support the theory that recovery is the appropriate way forrestoration and rehabilitation of degraded karst ecosystems and simulta-neously pave the way for further understanding about the microbial re-sponses to vegetation restoration in degraded karst regions.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial inter-ests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂuence thework reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Special Funds for Local Science andTechnology Development Guided by the Central Government, China(GuikeZY20198009), National Natural Science Foundation of China(42172341 and 42007049), and the Key Research and DevelopmentProgram of Guangxi (GuikeAD20297091).CRediT authorship contribution statementQ.L. conceived the study, completed the soil sample collection and de-signed the experiment.
