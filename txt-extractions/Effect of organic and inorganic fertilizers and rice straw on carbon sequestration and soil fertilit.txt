Understanding thecontributions of organic amendments in C sequestration is important for carbon budgeting.This study determined the effect of organic amendments on CO 2emission to the atmosphereand C sequestration in soil. A series of ﬁeld experiments in ﬁve consecutive rice seasons wereconducted during 2010 /C02012 at the research farm of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur RahmanAgricultural University, Bangladesh, using ﬁve treatments /C0control, cow dung (CD), poultrymanure (PM), rice straw (RS) and soil test-based fertilizer (STB). The carbon application rate fromCD, PM and RS was 2 t C ha¡1season¡1. Carbon dioxide production from rice ﬁelds wasmeasured through NaOH absorption followed by HCl titration. The difference in the amount ofcumulative CO 2evolution and SOC accretion between the control and organic treatments gaveapparent C balance and C sequestration. CD, PM and RS contributed to the positive soilnutrient balance. Application of CD, PM and RS resulted in 36, 28 and 37% loss of applied Cthrough emission, respectively. The application of organic C through RS, CD and PM accountedfor 10, 30 and 49% sequestration, respectively. There were 34, 23 and 53% unaccountedamounts of applied C from CD, PM and RS, respectively, which may be attributed to anaerobicdecomposition where CO2was not produced, or escaping of the produced CO 2throughaerenchyma channels to the leaf surface. Poultry manure was found to be ef ﬁcient inincreasing carbon and other nutrients in soils, and contributed to a higher grain yield of ricecompared to RS and CD. Due to STB fertilization, microbial activities might be enhanced andfavored better growth of root biomass, which contributed to slight sequestration of SOC in therice/C0rice cropping system.KEY WORDSorganic manures; CO 2emission; C sequestration;rice/C0rice cropping patternIntroductionCarbon (C) sequestration is a process of capturingatmospheric C through production of biomass andstoring it in soil. Soil may serve either as a source ofatmospheric CO 2or a sink of C depending on differentcrop and land management practices. It is well knownthat vegetation and soils are major storage sinks ofatmospheric CO2[1]. In Bangladesh, there is a lowreserve of C and plant nutrients in soils. Adoption ofbest management practices may sequester C in soils,which can signi ﬁcantly improve soil quality [ 2,3]. Dur-ing the past two centuries, land-use practices such asdeforestation and tillage have resulted in a net loss ofsoil C to the atmosphere [ 4]. The addition of C-enrichedmaterials like crop residues, cow dung, poultry manure,farmyard manure, compost, etc. improves soil physical,chemical and biological characteristics. The improve-ment of soil properties favors the development of thecrop root system, elongating it both at the surface leveland in deep soil, which ultimately helps to accumulatemore C in soil. It was also found that combined applica-tion of organic and inorganic sources of nutrient tosoils increased the use ef ﬁciencies of production inputsand also increased crop yields [ 5,6]. This implies that byintegrating organic matter in the fertilization program,a substantial saving on the yearly cost of inorganic fer-tilizers could be made. Cow dung is the most ancientorganic matter source, as compared to Sesbania andstraw, to increase organic C content in soils. The utiliza-tion of poultry manure to supply nutrients for plants isa recently debated issue because of its heavy metalcontents. However, poultry manure is a potentialsource of soil C and plant nutrients. Application of ricestraw was assumed to promote synchrony and reducegaseous N losses from basally applied mineral N fertil-izer. Continuous application of straw builds up the soilC content and ensures an adequate N supply. The soilorganic C pool in agriculture land uses is capable ofCONTACT Md Mizanur Rahman mizan@bsmrau.edu.bd© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCARBON MANAGEMENT, 2016VOL. 7, NOS. 1 /C02, 41/C053http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2016.1166425enhancing agricultural sustainability and serving as apotential sink of atmospheric CO 2[7]. Agriculture, for-estry and other land-use change showed an increaseof CO 2emission to the atmosphere from 1970 to 2010.In the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC it wasreported that between 1750 and 2010, cumulativeanthropogenic CO 2emissions to the atmosphere were2040§310 GtCO 2. Cumulative CO 2emissions from for-estry and other land use increased from 490 GtCO 2in1970 to 680 GtCO 2in 2010 [ 8].To offset climate change, the emissions of CO 2andother greenhouse gases need to be reduced. The rateof soil C emission is strongly regulated by the amountand types of organic materials added to soil. Both thequantity and the quality of soil C inputs, tillage inten-sity and crop rotation in ﬂuence C storage and thepotential for C sequestration [ 9]. Rice /C0fallow /C0rice isthe dominant cropping pattern in Bangladesh andreleases C as CO2and/or CH 4depending on rice culti-vation systems. Alternate wetting and drying condi-tions release more CO 2compared to a continuouslyﬂooded or lowland rice culture system, which releasesa signi ﬁcant amount of CH 4to the atmosphere [ 10,11].Methane emission from rice ﬁelds to the atmosphereoccurred by three pathways: molecular diffusion, ebul-lition as gas bubbles, and rice-mediated transport,where the last one is the major pathway accountingfor more than 90% of the total CH 4emission from soilsover the growing season [ 12]. It is uncertain whetherriceﬁelds accumulate C and how organic carbon (OC)level changes with different management practices[13], which need to be investigated. Up-to-date infor-mation on the dynamics of soil C under different soiland crop management practices is necessary to helpmaintain a good level of carbon for soil health and itsproductivity, and restraining from global warming [ 14].The present study is aimed to compensate for the lackof such studies on C sequestration and CO 2emissionunder different organic and inorganic fertilizer man-agement options in rice cultivation. The objective ofthe research was to determine the rates of CO 2emis-sion and C sequestration from the addition of cowdung, poultry manure, rice straw and soil test-basedinorganic fertilizers in soils.Materials and methodsA series of ﬁeld experiments in ﬁve consecutive rice-growing seasons of transplanted aman (July to Novem-ber) and boro (December to May) during August2010 /C0November 2012 were conducted in a naturalenvironment at the research farm of the Department ofSoil Science of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur RahmanAgricultural University, Bangladesh. The aman rice isgrown in the monsoon as a rainfed crop (sometimessupplemental irrigation is n eeded if there is not enoughrainfall) when maximum rainfall (269 to 370 mm) occurs,while the boro rice is grown after harvesting of T. amanunder fully irrigated conditions in the dry season (0 to55 mm rainfall). The study site is located at 24.09/C14Nl a t i -tude and 90.25/C14E longitude with an elevation of 8.2 mabove sea level, which is under the agro-ecologicalzone (AEZ) Madhupur Tract (AEZ 28). The soil of thestudy site belongs to the Salna series and has been clas-siﬁed as Shallow Red Brown Terrace soil in the Bangla-desh soil classi ﬁcation system and Inceptisol in theUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) classi ﬁ-cation system, which is characterized by clay within50 cm of the surface and is acidic in nature. The climateof the area is sub-tropical, wet and humid. The soil ofthe experimental ﬁeld was silty clay loam in texture,having pH 5.95, organic carbon 11.3 g kg¡1, total nitro-gen 0.9 g kg¡1, available phosphorus 22 mg kg¡1,exchangeable potassium 0.14 c-mol ( C)k g¡1, availablesulfur 15 mg kg¡1and available zinc 4 mg kg¡1.The experiment consisted of ﬁve treatments /C0con-trol, cow dung (CD), poultry manure (PM), rice straw(RS) and soil test-based fertilizer dose (STB), laid out ina randomized complete block design (RCBD) withfour replications in both aman and boro rice. In theﬁeld, the study was replicated 5 times (three T. amanseasons and two boro seasons). The unit plot size was4m£3 m. The rate of C application from CD, PM andRS was 2 t C ha¡1season¡1and, according to the inte-grated plant nutrition system, CD and PM treatmentsreceived no inorganic fertilizer, but in RS treatment132 and 60 kg N with 2 and 0 kg P per ha from ureaand triple superphosphate in boro and T. aman sea-sons, respectively, was applied for the ﬁrst year andthen fertilizer rates were adjusted based on soil testvalues. The tested rice varieties were BRRI dhan29 andBRRI dhan49 in boro and T. aman, respectively.The nutrient contents of organic materials and ricestraw were analyzed ( Table 1 ). Although the C concen-trations in CD, PM and RS differed signi ﬁcantly, the Capplication rates were the same as 2 t C ha¡1season¡1,where the application rates of CD, PM and RS asorganic materials were 10, 16.67 and 5 t ha¡1season¡1,respectively. Thus, the total C input from each of CD,PM and RS in ﬁve consecutive rice growing seasonsTable 1.

RAHMAN ET AL.was 10 t C ha¡1. The transplanting aman (T. aman) rice2010 was transplanted on August 5, 2010. On the otherhand, the boro rice 2011 seedlings were transplantedon January 25, 2011. The T. aman rice 2011 was trans-planted on August 12, 2011, the boro 2012 on January23, 2012, and the T. aman 2012 on August 14, 2012.Thirty-day-old seedlings were transplanted at 20 cm £20 cm spacing. Soil test-based fertilizer doses were cal-culated for each rice crop. These were N-P-K-S at 162-10-71-15 kg ha¡1in boro and 90-2-37-10 kg ha¡1in T.aman for the ﬁrst year of experimentation. Organicmaterials were applied in the ﬁeld before 7 days oftransplanting. Post-harvest soils were also collected(up to 15 cm depth) for bulk density, organiccarbon and nutrient study following the standard pro-cedure [ 15].Carbon dioxide production in all of the treatmentswas measured using trap-through NaOH absorptionfollowed by HCl titration [ 16] from the ﬁrst day of trans-planting. Carbon dioxide traps were prepared using80 mL of 2 N NaOH in plastic bottles and placed in theplots under each treatment. Traps were covered withplastic buckets, which were inserted into soft mud toprotect the entrance of air CO2. An empty bucket wasused as a control without soil but of alkali of samestrength in the ﬁeld. After 7 days of exposure, trapswere collected from plots at 10:00 am covered withscrew caps and replaced with another set of new traps.Aﬁxed time of 10:00 am was considered to make theCO 2absorption time exactly 1 week, while variation intrap setting and removal time might in ﬂuence theamount of trapped CO 2because of diurnal changes insoil and air temperature and also CO 2absorption time.From 80 mL of alkali solution exactly 2 mL was titrated,adding a few drops of phenolphthalein indicatoragainst 2 N HCl. Sodium hydroxide absorbed theevolved CO 2as Na 2CO 3. Before titration, BaCl 2wasadded for precipitation of the trapped CO 32¡as BaCO 3.Residual NaOH was titrated with HCl to determine theCO 2concentration. The buckets covered the soil for7 days, which perhaps caused the change in soiltemperature and oxygen content and affected soilrespiration. This was of course a limitation of themethod. Carbon dioxide emission measurement wascontinued until 14 weeks of both T. aman and bororice-growing seasons. Beyond the rice-growing season,CO 2emission during the fallow period of 336 days(between three T. aman and two boro rice crops) wasalso measured. The amount of CO 2evolved from soilwas calculated using Equation (1).Milligrams of C or CO 2DðB¡VÞN E (1)where B and V are the volume (mL) of acid needed totitrate NaOH of traps in control and treatments, respec-tively; N Dnormality of the acid; and E (equivalentweight) is either 6 or 12 to express data in terms of Cor CO 2, respectively. Data were expressed as kg CO 2ha¡1week¡1. During the fallow period, root respirationwas not considered in measuring CO 2emission asthere was no crop in the ﬁeld. Because of the methodused in the present study, it was not possible to parti-tion total CO 2emission into microbial emission androot respiration. However, using the knowledge gath-ered from the available published literature, we set alimit of root respiration to ﬁnd a reasonable amount ofCO 2emission from organic matter decomposition. Thesource of root respiration is photosynthates and theirtranslocation to the root, while application of manuresand organic residues, litter fall and addition of deadroots to soil expedite microbial respiration. In general,root respiration contributes about 50% of the total soilrespiration, while in a wheat ﬁeld it ranged from 12 to15% and in a soybean ﬁeld from 35 to 40% [ 17,18]. Xuet al. [19] reported that root respiration of 5 /C06-week-old rice seedlings contributed 85 /C092% to bulk soil res-piration. Young roots respire more compared to oldroots [ 20]. We harvested rice at grain maturity wherethe contribution of root respiration will be much lowerbecause of older roots. Furthermore, the instrumentalset-up in the rice ﬁelds in the present study for trap-ping CO 2might not be ef ﬁcient enough to trap CO 2emission from root respiration. This is because traps formeasuring released CO 2in our experiment were set upin the middle of four hills, where rice roots were obvi-ously few, and we assumed that root respiration maycontribute 30% to total CO2emission. Thus, 30% emis-sion was deducted from total CO 2emission to obtainheterotrophic emission.The concentration of labile carbon in post-harvestsoils was determined by KMnO 4oxidation followed byabsorbance reading on a double-beam spectropho-tometer [ 21].

In T. aman 2010,rice was transplanted during the ﬁrst week of Augustand the air temperature as well as soil temperaturewas high at that time, which favored rapid microbialdecomposition of added organic manures andreleased more CO 2. Initially, PM released more CO 2compared to other organic materials and inorganic fer-tilizer. The CO2emission from PM was the highest inthe fourth to ﬁfth weeks after transplanting (529 kgCO 2ha¡1wk¡1). In the case of CD, the highest emissionwas recorded at the sixth week (524 kg CO 2ha¡1wk¡1), and from RS it was at the seventh week (544 kgCO 2ha¡1wk¡1) after transplanting of rice. After theseventh week, CO 2emission from different treatmentsdecreased gradually and ﬁnally, at the end of the cropgrowing period, it reached below the initial level.Carbon dioxide emission from the inorganic fertilizer-treated plot was much lower than from organic matter(OM)-treated plots throughout the crop-growing season.However, the inorganic fertilizer treatment releasedmore CO 2than did the control treatment ( Figure 1 a).Carbon input was not applied to the inorganic fertilizerand control treatments; therefore, emission of CO2fromsoils under these two treatments was found to be low.The total CO 2emission was higher in the RS treatmentfollowed by CD, PM and soil test-based fertilizer treat-ments, and the lowest amount was observed in thecontrol treatment. In T. aman 2011 and T. aman 2012,more or less similar trends of CO 2emission wereobserved in different organ ic manure and inorganic fer-tilizer management practices. Emission of CO 2from dif-ferent manures and rice straw-treated plots were higherin the fourth to seventh weeks after transplanting; thenit decreased up to the eleventh week of transplantingand remained almost stable within 323 /C0377 kg CO 2kg¡1wk¡1in T. aman 2011 ( Figure 1 b), and235/C0294 kg CO 2kg¡1wk¡1in T. aman 2012 ( Figure 1 c).It was also found that emission of CO 2from the bororice ﬁeld signi ﬁcantly increased and approached themaximum in the vegetative stage during the sixthweek after transplanting. After that, CO 2emissiondecreased gradually and continued to the end of therice-growing period ( Figure 2 ). In boro 2011, rice wastransplanted in the last week of January when the airand soil temperature were low, which decreased themicrobial decomposition of added organic manuresthus resulting in low emission of CO2at the beginning.After the fourth week following transplanting the rateof CO 2emission decreased slightly, then increasedagain sharply in the sixth week after transplanting andFigure 1.

RAHMAN ET AL.reached a peak of 578 kg CO 2ha¡1wk¡1in the RStreatment, due to raising the soil and air temperaturewhich favored the microbial decomposition of straw.The CO 2emission after the ninth week decreased grad-ually with the increase in the crop growth period andcontinued until the end of 14 weeks, because of areduction in the readily decomposable part of carbon.All treatments followed more or less the same trend inCO 2emission throughout the rice-growing season.Among the organic materials, PM showed higher CO 2emission at an earlier stage but it came down after 1month following rice transplanting. In the case of RS,the rate of CO2emission was slower in the earlier stageof crop growth, but after the ﬁfth week the rateincreased and remained higher throughout the period,because of its high C:N ratio as mentioned earlier. TheSTB inorganic fertilizer showed comparatively muchlower CO2emission than did organic manure and RS,while the lowest emission was observed in the controltreatment where no organic manure or inorganic fertil-izer was applied ( Figure 2 a). A more or less similartrend in CO 2emission was observed in the boro 2012season ( Figure 2 b). The rate of CO 2emission wasincreased up to the ﬁfth week after transplanting, andthen it came down in the sixth week, started increasingfurther to the ninth week and, after that, graduallydecreased to the end of the fourteenth week. The RStreatment released more CO2, followed by CD and PM.At the beginning of the ﬁfth week, the PM treatmentreleased the highest CO 2(549 kg CO 2ha¡1wk¡1), whileRS released the most at the ninth week of crop growth.After that, the emission decreased gradually through-out the crop-growing season. The ﬁndings of otherresearchers are in agreement with the ﬁndings of thisstudy. It was reported that the loss of CO 2from soil isrelated to the abundance and activity of soil microor-ganisms. The usual range of CO2loss under submergedconditions is 70 /C0700 kg CO 2ha¡1wk¡1[22,23]. It isgenerally assumed that after incorporation of crop resi-dues and other organic matter to soils, it takes about 1month for maximum microbial activities, dependingon the C:N ratios of the provided organic materials.The higher the C content, the more time is needed todecompose the materials. Carbon dioxide is releasedfrom the soil through microbial decomposition, wheremicro ﬂora contributes about 99% of the CO2arising asa result of decomposition of OM under aerobic condi-tions [ 24]. Chemical oxidation of organic residues alsocontributes to CO 2emission from soils, which is nor-mally pronounced at higher temperatures. Large quan-tities of organic carbon (OC) added to soils throughdifferent manures and wastes to supply plant nutrientsmay signi ﬁcantly contribute to CO 2emission. However,proper management of organic manures and wastes,conservation tillage, improving soil biodiversity, micro-aggregation and mulching can play an important rolein reducing CO2emission and thus increasing Csequestration in soil [ 2].The variation in time of peak emission of CO 2among different manures and rice straw was due tothe differences in the C:N ratio of these organic materi-als ( Table 1 ). Because of a low C:N ratio, microbialdecomposition might be faster in PM and thus itreleased more CO2at the beginning, while high C:NFigure 2.

The rice straw-and organic matter-containing treatments releasedmore CO 2compared to the inorganic fertilizer treat-ment. The application of organic materials increasescarbon input in soil from enhanced biomass produc-tion returned to soil, which ultimately increases CO2emission [ 25].Cumulative amount of CO 2emission from soilsThe cumulative amount of CO 2emitted among differ-ent treatments in T. aman seasons varied signi ﬁcantly(Table 2 ). The maximum cumulative CO 2emission for14 weeks in T. aman 2010 was found in the RS treat-ment (5620 kg CO 2ha¡1) followed by the CD (5527 kgCO 2ha¡1) and PM (5415 kg CO 2ha¡1) treatments,while the minimum amount was from the control treat-ment (3832 kg CO 2ha¡1). The soil test-based inorganicfertilizer treatment emitted the least amount of CO 2compared to rice straw and organic manure treat-ments. A more or less similar trend was also found inthe case of total CO2emission from different treat-ments in T. aman 2011 and 2012 ( Table 2 ). The similarpattern of cumulative emission of CO 2was alsoobserved among different treatments in boro seasons(Table 2 ). The emission of CO 2from RS-, CD- and PM-treated plots did not vary signi ﬁcantly; however, thesetreatments released signi ﬁcantly higher amounts ofCO 2compared to the STB and control treatments. Themaximum cumulative emission of CO 2was found inthe RS treatment in boro 2012 season, which was6012 kg CO 2ha¡1. Rahman [ 23] conducted an incuba-tion study on CO 2emission from different organic resi-dues using a carbon rate of 0.25 g 100 g¡1soil andfound that RS and CD released 313 and 283 mg CO 2,respectively, during 118 days of study, which is almostequivalent to 6270 and 5660 kg CO2ha¡1for theperiod mentioned here and thus endorses the ﬁndingsof the present study. Bhattacharyya et al. [26], in along-term experiment of rice-rice cropping, found thatapplication of farmyard manure at the rate of 5 t ha¡1released 5159 kg CO 2ha¡1yr¡1. These variations in car-bon rate and time periods might bring changes in therate of CO 2emission from soil.The application of CD, PM and RS resulted in 36, 28and 37% loss of applied C as CO 2through microbialdecomposition ( Table 2 ). The application of organic Cthrough CD and PM accounted for 30 and 49% seques-tration, while the sequestration of C from RS accountedfor only 10%. There was an unaccounted amount ofapplied C in all three sources, with variable magnitude.The unaccounted portion of C in soil from CD and RSrepresented 34 and 53%, respectively, but in the caseof PM it was only 23% ( Table 2 ). The unaccounted por-tion of the added C may be attributed to the anaerobicdecomposition where CO2was not produced or escap-ing of the produced CO 2through aerenchyma chan-nels to the leaf surface.There are some uncertainties associated with emis-sion determination. Carbon dioxide emission in riceﬁeld soils mainly depends on soil respiration andorganic matter decomposition ampli ﬁed by soil tem-perature and moisture regimes [ 8,27,28]. Temperaturefrom plot to plot may vary, and water depth in all plotscould not be maintained at equal depths as ﬂood irri-gation was provided to rice ﬁelds. The instrumentalset-up in rice ﬁelds for trapping CO 2might be anotheruncertainty. The traps were covered with buckets for 7days which perhaps caused changes in soil tempera-ture and oxygen content and affected soil respiration.This was of course a limitation of the method. Carbonconcentrations and degradation rates of CD, PM andRS are different, which might bring variation in CO2emission as well as C sequestration under differenttreatments used in the experiment. The diurnal varia-tion also may cause uncertainty in measuring CO2.Inthe present study, CO 2was measured from ﬁelds at10:00 am. Liu et al. [29] found that peak emission ofCO 2occurred in the late afternoon. Therefore, uncer-tainties remain in the current experiment and need tobe addressed in future study.Soil carbon content, stock and sequestration inpost-harvest soilThe organic carbon of post-harvest soil (0 /C015 cmdepth) increased signi ﬁcantly in rice straw- and organicmanure-treated plots compared to the control andinorganic fertilizer treatments ( Table 3 ). Among theTable 2.

[30] observed an increment of 69.8%organic carbon in 100% NPK treatments after 9 yearsof rice /C0wheat cropping, which was explained in sucha way that balanced fertilization attributed to increasedplant biomass addition to soil. Animal manure is moreeffective in building soil C than straw is, possibly dueto the presence of more humi ﬁed and recalcitrant Cforms in animal manure as compared to the straw [ 31].Besides, manure is more resistant to microbial decom-position than plant residues are; consequently, for thesame C input, C storage is higher with manure applica-tion than with plant residues [ 32]. On the other hand,the lowest organic carbon in soils was found in the RStreatment among the organic materials, which attrib-uted to the highest emission of CO2in this treatment.This might be due to the use of additional inorganic Nfertilizer in the RS treatment over the PM and CD treat-ments. Fertilizers were applied using the integratedplant nutrition system (IPNS) concept, where nitrogencontents in PM and CD were 17.12 and 9.92 g kg¡1,respectively, and the amount of nitrogen added to soilin the ﬁrst crop (T. aman 2010) from the applied 16.67 tha¡1PM and 10 t ha¡1CD exceeded the amount rec-ommended for the crop. P, K and S were also high inall PM, CD and RS treatments, which ful ﬁlled therequirements of these three nutrients for rice crops.Therefore, additional inorganic fertilizers of thesenutrients were not needed. But in the case of RS, Ncontent was low (4.93 g kg¡1) compared to PM andCD, and could not supply the amount required for thecrop. Therefore, additional inorganic N fertilizer wasapplied in the RS treatment, which might havestimulated soil microbial activity, therefore increasingCO 2emission. Thus, treatments with inorganic nitrogenfertilizers favor degradation of SOC, which ultimatelyresulted in low C content in soil. This is an agreementwith Halvorson et al. [33].The OC, bulk density, C stock and sequestration insoils were signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by different ricestraw, organic manure and inorganic fertilizers(Table 3 ). The initial SOC, bulk density and C stock insoils were 11.3 g kg¡1, 1.38 g cm¡3and 23.39 t ha¡1,respectively. After harvesting of the ﬁfth rice crop, theSOC increased signi ﬁcantly where the OM was applied.There was a signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence of organic materialson soil bulk density compared to the control treatment.Bulk density values were slightly lowered by theorganic materials. Although the change in soil bulkdensity was not much, it gave a positive sign of impor-tance or in ﬂuence of organic materials on soil bulkdensity. A signi ﬁcantly lower bulk density of soil wasobserved in the RS (1.24 g cm¡3) treatment, followedby CD (1.27 g cm¡3) and PM (1.30 g cm¡3) treatments.Many researchers [ 30,34,35] have reported the lower-ing of soil bulk density with the application of differentorganic fertilizer in soils. Continuous application of ricestraw compost has some positive effects on soil physi-cal properties, as stated by Watanabe et al. [36]. There-fore, the application of different organic wastescontaining greater levels of OM causes a relativelyloose structure in the surface layer of the ﬁeld soil andthus decreases the bulk density of the soil to favorablelevels. In contrast, researchers also mentioned that theapplication of organic fertilizers in rice ﬁelds did notchange soil bulk density even after 4 to 10 years ofcropping (Bhattaacharyya et al. [25,37].The SOC stock increased signi ﬁcantly from 22 t ha¡1in the control to 28 t ha¡1in the PM treatment(Table 3 ). The SOC stocks of all the fertilizer treatmentswere greater than that of the control treatment.Among the organic materials the highest C stock wasfound in the PM treatment (28 t ha¡1), which was sta-tistically higher than that of the other organic materialsand STB treatments. Compared to the control treat-ment, SOC storage of the PM, CD, RS and STB treat-ments within the 0 /C015 cm soil depth was increased by28.5, 20.0, 11.0 and 5.0%, respectively. The treatmentsTable 3.

This was consistentwith the results of other studies [ 38/C041].The C sequestration in the post-harvest soilincreased signi ﬁcantly with the application of organicfertilizers ( Table 3 ). Among the treatments, PM seques-tered the maximum amount of OC in the post-harvestsoil, followed by CD. In the control treatment, Csequestration was negative /C0that is, as there were noexternal organic inputs, microbial degradation of theinherent C exhausted the C stock and thus the ﬁnalstock was less than the initial stock. There was a slightC sequestration in STB treatment, which was becauseof balanced fertilization that stimulated vigorous plantgrowth and higher root biomass which contributed toslight sequestration of SOC in the rice /C0rice croppingsystem. The sequestration of OC in the PM treatmentwas 4.9 t ha¡1, while it was 3.0 and 1.04 t ha¡1in theCD and RS treatments, respectively ( Table 3 ). Bhattaa-charyya et al. [25] was found that application of ricestraw and green manure at the rate of 7.12 t ha¡1yr¡1during 10 years of rice cropping sequestered 1.23 t Cha¡1while rice straw applied at the rate of 4.8 t ha¡1along with inorganic fertilizers contributed 1.39 t Cha¡1. In the present study, the sequestration ef ﬁcien-cies of the applied C through RS, CD and PM accountedfor 10, 30 and 49%, respectively ( Table 2 ). The additionof different manures and rice straw improved thetransformation of organic carbon and labile carboncontents in soils ( Table 3 ). The highest amount of labilecarbon in soils after harvesting of ﬁve rice crops wasfound in the RS treatment, followed by CD and PM,which indicated the potential for further emission ofCO2from rice straw. Results of the study revealed thatthe SOC buildup in the rice /C0rice cropping systemwere 40, 60 and 58 kg t¡1in the RS, CD and PM appli-cations, respectively, during the ﬁve rice growing sea-sons. This small increment in the soil organic carbon(SOC) stock may create great impacts in reducing theatmospheric C concentration. Many researchers havementioned that application of animal manure to landpromotes SOC sequestration in soil due to its relativelyhigh C content. It was also reported that poultry litterapplication to croplands led to signi ﬁcant soil organicC sequestration [ 42]. Application of rice straw anddifferent composted manures resulted in a signi ﬁcantamount of C sequestration in the soil, which increasedagronomic, physiological and recovery ef ﬁciencies ofN, P and K [ 6,40,43].Rice grain yields under different treatmentsGrain yields were signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by applyingdifferent organic materials and chemical fertilizer inboth T. aman and boro rice ( Table 4 ). The PM treatmentwas found to be superior in producing rice grain overthe other treatments in all ﬁve seasons of T. aman andboro. The observed yields of different treatments werein the order of PM >CD>STB>RS>control. Thehighest grain yields in the PM treatment of T. aman2010, boro 2011, T. aman 2011, boro 2012 and T. aman2012 were 5.43, 6.70, 5.53, 6.83 and 5.61 t ha¡1, respec-tively. All nutrients in PM were high compared to otherorganic material treatments. As the C:N ratio of PM waslow to optimum, the mineralization might be fastercompared to other organic materials including RS.Thus, nutrient release from PM was faster, whichfavored nutrient uptake and thereby higher yield. Inte-grated application of PM with inorganic nutrientsimproved the soil physical, chemical and biologicalenvironment, which encouraged the proliferation ofroots resulting in more absorption of water andnutrients from a larger area and depth, resulting in ahigher grain yield. It is well documented in otherresearch ﬁndings that combined application of organicand inorganic fertilizers in balanced doses increasescrop yields [ 5,6]. In the initial stage, microbes utilizedinherent nitrogen from rice ﬁelds with high C:N ratiocontaining RS which restricted the growth and devel-opment of shoot and root and ultimately contributedto lower grain yield.Seasonal and year-to-year variations in grain yieldsof T. aman and boro rice were also observed. Bettermanagement of soil, water and crops contributed toincrease grain yields of rice positively from the year2010 to 2012, which is applicable for both aman andboro rice. The yield of boro rice was higher than that ofaman rice because of the higher yield potential of bororice varieties and more photosynthetically active radia-tion in the boro season. Hossain et al. [44] stated thatthe average yield of modern rice varieties was 1.0 toTable 4.

Thecontribution of PM, CD and RS in increasing soil fertilitywas found to be positive in trend. A signi ﬁcant incre-ment in soil pH was observed from the application ofPM and CD in the experimental plots over the controland STB dose of fertilizer ( Table 5 ). The soil pH in post-harvest soils among the treatments of PM, CD and RSdid not vary signi ﬁcantly. The maximum increment insoil pH was found under the PM treatment, which was6.91, while it was 5.85 in the initial soil and 5.83 in thecontrol treatment. The increment of soil pH in the PMtreatment was due to the addition of calcium from thepoultry manure. Therefore, PM was found to increasesoil pH, which was reported by many researchers[6,10,45]. The increase of pH from cow dung applica-tion has been attributed to its buffering effect and theorganic acid released [ 46]. The organic matter from thecrop residue improved the soil pH status by increasingthe soil buffering capacity [ 47]. Organic fertilizersincrease the cation exchange capacity, which contrib-utes to a high base saturation of the soil. As the basesaturation increases, the relative amount of acid cati-ons neutralizes. Our ﬁndings are supported by those ofmany other researchers [ 48-50 ], who explained thatplants can alter soil pH by releasing root exudates,such as organic acid anions, to enhance mineral nutri-ent solubility, as well as by the liberation of HCandOH¡(or HCO 3¡resulting from OH¡carbonation) inorder to counterbalance cations or anions entering theroots. Decomposition of organic acid anions can alsoincrease soil pH due to proton consumption in thedecarboxylation process. Such incremental changes insoil pH might help with the availability of macronu-trients, especially phosphorus, calcium and magnesiumin acid soil.The soil nitrogen was signi ﬁcantly higher in organicfertilizer-applied plots over the control and inorganicfertilizer treatments ( Table 5 ). Among the organicmaterials, PM showed the highest amount of total Nfollowed by CD and RS. The nitrogen concentrationbetween PM (2.2 g kg¡1) and CD (2.0 g kg¡1) did notvary signi ﬁcantly; however, they were signi ﬁcantlyhigher over the RS treatment (1.6 g kg¡1). There wasno statistically signi ﬁcant difference in N contents insoils between the control and STB treatment, thoughthe total N increment was higher in the STB treatment.As per the soil fertility ranking given by BangladeshAgricultural Research Council (BARC) [ 51], the status ofnitrogen concentrations in soils under the controltreatment was very low, while it was medium in thePM and CD treatments, and low in the RS treatment.Though the organic materials were applied in soils at2t C ha¡1in all PM, CD and RS treatments, differencesexist in the quality of organic materials, mainly the C:Nratio. Because of the low to optimum C:N ratio or highconcentration of N of the poultry manure, it mineral-ized fast and supplied N to soil. The total N increase inorganic manure-treated soils was also reported bymany researchers [ 52/C054].The soil-available P content in post-harvest soilincreased signi ﬁcantly in the PM- and CD-treated plotscompared to RS- and STB chemical fertilizer-treatedplots ( Table 5 ). The phosphorus contents in soil were16.6, 35.3, 43.2, 26.0 and 22.5 mg kg¡1soil in the con-trol, CD, PM, RS and STB fertilizer treatments, respec-tively. The PM treatment showed 92% higher Psequestration in soils compared to the STB treatment,while it was 160% higher over the control treatment.The phosphorus status in soil as per BARC fertility rank-ing [ 51] was medium in the control/initial soil, while itreached a very high level with the application of PM insoils and a high level in the CD-treated soils. The incre-ment in soil P in the Salna silty clay acid soil is really agood achievement in terms of sustainable manage-ment of the most limiting plant nutrient, P, in the studysoil. Soil pH is important in controlling different avail-able forms of P, as well as precipitation /C0dissolutionand adsorption /C0desorption reactions, and thus P solu-bility and availability to plants [ 49]. It was observedthat soil pH under the PM treatment increased signi ﬁ-cantly in a favorable range for nutrient availability insoil; it might have a signi ﬁcant positive impact onnutrients, especially P. In post-harvest soil the pH valuewas around 7.0 in the PM treatment, which was opti-mum for P availability. Improvement of soil pH led tothe solubilzation of inorganic P [ 46]. The enhanced bio-logical activities in the manure-treated soil areTable 5.

As suggested by Jenkinson et al. [55], microbial bio-mass not only contains a labile pool of nutrients butalso drives the cycling of OM and nutrients in soil. Ear-lier, scientists also determined the availability of phos-phorus in soil using various organic materials, and theirﬁndings support the above results [ 56/C059].The exchangeable K content in post-harvest soilunder rice straw and organic manure treatmentsincreased signi ﬁcantly. Among the treatments, RSshowed a remarkable increase in soil K compared toother organic and inorganic fertilizer treatments(Table 4 ). In terms of K concentrations in soils, the STBtreatment (0.13 c-mol kg¡1) appeared superior to thecontrol treatment (0.10 c-mol kg¡1), while the organictreatments were better than the STB treatment. Themaximum K concentration in soil was found under theRS treatment, which was 0.28 c-mol kg¡1followed byPM (0.26 c-mol kg¡1) and CD (0.24 c-mol kg¡1). Ricestraw contains a high amount of potassium; therefore,the K concentration was higher in the RS treatment.Variation of soil carbon and nutrients with soildepthSoil carbon, total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus(P) and exchangeable potassium (K) were found to bemaximum in 0 /C05 cm topsoils under different treat-ments ( Figure 3 ). A general declining trend of all soilFigure 3.

RAHMAN ET AL.parameters, as mentioned, was observed with theincrement of soil depths. Carbon contents in the top-soil are usually found to be the maximum. This isbecause of organic residues that are applied in the sur-face soil. The higher availability of OM in the topsoilshas a profound in ﬂuence on soil microbial population,which, on other hand, also contributes to the increasedcarbon level in soils. Through microbial decompositionof OM application in the topsoils, different nutrientswere released, which might contribute to the higheravailability of N, P and K in the topsoils. Inorganic fertil-izers were also applied in the topsoil, which mighthave a residual effect in augmenting nutrient contentsin the topsoils. Among three different manures andresidues, PM contributed to more C, N and P in soils,followed by CD and RS ( Figure 3 a/C0c). In the top 5 cmsoils, carbon contents were 15.1, 14.7, 14.1, 13.2 and12.0 g kg¡1in the PM, CD, RS, STB and control treat-ments, respectively, while in the 10 /C015 cm soil depthsthese values were 13.7, 13.2, 12.0, 9.6 and 9.5 g kg¡1,respectively ( Figure 3 a). Poultry manure was found tobe more effective in building soil C than RS and CD, asexplained earlier [ 31]. Soil microbes broke down PMwhere easily decomposed portions of organic materialdisappeared relatively quickly, while the more resistantpart known as humus was left behind.In the top 5 cm of soils, total nitrogen contents were2.8, 2.4 and 1.9, 1.5 and 1.1 g kg¡1in the PM, CD, RS,STB and control treatments, respectively, while theaverage values in 10 /C015 cm soil depths were 1.5, 1.5,1.4, 1.0 and 0.9 g kg¡1, respectively ( Figure 3 b). Poultrymanure was found to be more ef ﬁcient to improve soilfertility as it contains more nutrients, compared to cowdung and rice straw. As per fertility ranking, nitrogenstatus in the topsoils under PM and CD treatmentswere medium to optimum [ 51]. Nitrogen added to thesoil is subject to several changes (transformations) thatensure the availability of N to plants. The availableforms of nitrogen in soils for plant uptake are ammo-nium (NH4C) and nitrate (NO 3¡). These transformationsand dynamics of nitrogen in soils depend on the aera-tion and submergence of soils. Bacteria decomposeorganic material and release ammonium nitrogen tosoils, which is predominant in anaerobic conditions.Ammonium nitrogen has properties that are of practi-cal importance for nitrogen management in soils, espe-cially in wetland rice crops. The ammonium nitrogencontains a positive charge (NH 4C) and, therefore, isattracted to negatively charged soil and soil organicmatter which protects its downward movement fromsoil systems.Phosphorus contents in the top 0 /C05 cm soil depthsunder all treatments, even in the control, were foundto be very high, with values of 54.57, 47.21, 30.56,26.44 and 21.24 mg kg¡1in the PM, CD, RS, STB andcontrol treatments, respectively, while the average val-ues in 10 /C015 cm soil depths were 30.54, 21.55, 20.21,17.50 and 12.98 mg kg¡1, respectively ( Figure 3 c).These data reveal that deliberate management of soiland crops could harness the potential of soil P for bet-ter crop productivity and environmental sustainability.Potassium contents were found to be the maximum inthe RS treatment, followed by PM and CD ( Figure 3 d).In the top 5 cm soils, potassium contents were 0.40,0.37 and 0.33, 0.15 and 0.13 c-mol kg¡1soil in the RS,PM, CD, STB and control treatments, respectively(Figure 3 d). The data indicate that incorporation of RSis a major source of soil potassium. But removal of RSfrom ﬁelds is widespread in India, Nepal and Bangla-desh to use as fuel for cooking, fodder and beds foranimals and also for industrial raw materials, andcauses K de ﬁciency in soils. Dobermann and Fairhurst[60] reported that about 40% of N, 30 to 35% of P, 80to 85% of K, and 40 to 50% of S taken up by riceremains in vegetative plant parts at crop maturity.Therefore, incorporation of RS in soil could substan-tially increase soil nutrients, and especially K contentscould increase greatly.ConclusionThe sequestration of organic carbon in the poultrymanure treatment was 4.9 t ha¡1, while it was 3.0 and1.04 t ha¡1in the cow dung and rice straw treatments,respectively. The results show that the application ofCD, PM and RS resulted in 36, 28 and 37% loss ofapplied C through CO2emission. The application oforganic C through CD and PM accounted for 30 and49% sequestration, while the sequestration of C fromRS accounted for only 10%. There was an unaccountedamount of applied C in all three sources, with variablemagnitude. The unaccounted portion of C in soil fromCD and RS represented 34 and 53%, respectively, butin the case of PM it was only 23%. The unaccountedportion of the added C may be attributed to the anaer-obic decomposition where CO 2was not produced, orthe escape of the produced CO 2through aerenchymachannels to the leaf surface. There was a slight Csequestration in the STB treatment. CD, PM and RScontributed to a positive soil nutrient balance, whichindicates the improvement of soil fertility as well.Results of the study indicate that the buildup oforganic carbon in soils under a rice /C0rice cropping sys-tem from residue application were 40, 60 and 58 kg t¡1of RS, CD and PM, respectively, during ﬁve rice-growingseasons, which might vary according to the initial car-bon contents of residues applied to soil. Poultrymanure was found to be ef ﬁcient at increasing carbonand other nutrients in soils, and contributed to a highergrain yield of rice compared to RS and CD. Soil carbonand other nutrients decreased with increased soildepths irrespective of organic manures and rice straw.Though it is very dif ﬁcult to increase carbon content insoils under tropical and subtropical climatic conditions,CARBON MANAGEMENT 51the regular replenishment of carbon through the appli-cation of different organic residues may maintain andincrease carbon levels in soils to some extent. Thissmall increment in soil organic carbon may creategreat impacts in reducing the atmospheric Cconcentration.AcknowledgementsThis study was conducted under the project “Carbon seques-tration in soils of Bangladesh (ID # 305) ”funded by the WorldBank, IFAD and the Government of Bangladesh through theBangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), NATP,Phase 1, and implemented by the Department of Soil Sci-ence, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural Uni-versity, Gazipur, Bangladesh.Disclosure statementNo potential con ﬂict of interest was reported by the authors.References1.
