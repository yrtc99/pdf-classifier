ARTICLEFast-decaying plant litter enhances soil carbon intemperate forests but not through microbialphysiological traitsMatthew E. Craig1,2✉, Kevin M. Geyer3,4, Katilyn V. Beidler1, Edward R. Brzostek5, Serita D. Frey3,A. Stuart Grandy3, Chao Liang6& Richard P. Phillips1Conceptual and empirical advances in soil biogeochemistry have challenged long-heldassumptions about the role of soil micro-organisms in soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics;yet, rigorous tests of emerging concepts remain sparse. Recent hypotheses suggest thatmicrobial necromass production links plant inputs to SOC accumulation, with high-quality(i.e., rapidly decomposing) plant litter promoting microbial carbon use ef ﬁciency, growth, andturnover leading to more mineral stabilization of necromass. We test this hypothesisexperimentally and with observations across six eastern US forests, using stable isotopes tomeasure microbial traits and SOC dynamics. Here we show, in both studies, that microbialgrowth, ef ﬁciency, and turnover are negatively (not positively) related to mineral-associatedSOC. In the experiment, stimulation of microbial growth by high-quality litter enhances SOCdecomposition, offsetting the positive effect of litter quality on SOC stabilization. We suggestthat microbial necromass production is not the primary driver of SOC persistence in tem-perate forests. Factors such as microbial necromass origin, alternative SOC formationpathways, priming effects, and soil abiotic properties can strongly decouple microbial growth,efﬁciency, and turnover from mineral-associated SOC.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28715-9 OPEN1Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.2Environmental Sciences Division and Climate Change Science Institute, Oak RidgeNational Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.3Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA.4Department of Biology, Young Harris College, Young Harris, GA, USA.5Department of Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.6KeyLaboratory of Forest Ecology and Management, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China.✉email: craigme@ornl.govNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:1229 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28715-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;The conversion of plant inputs into stable soil organic car-bon (SOC) represents a critical yet poorly understoodprocess, with consequences for soil C storage, nutrientavailability, net primary production, and ecosystem sensitivity toglobal change1–4. The largest and slowest-cycling SOC pool islargely composed of microbial products stabilized by associationswith soil minerals5–7, suggesting that microbial productionmediates the transfer of plant inputs into the mineral-associatedSOC pool. Microbial necromass (dead microbial cells and theirdegradates) accounts for a large portion of SOC in manysystems8,9and necromass production is controlled by threephysiological traits: microbial growth rate (MGR), microbialcarbon use ef ﬁciency (CUE) —the proportion of assimilatedmicrobial C allocated to the production of new biomass —andmicrobial biomass turnover rate (MTR). Though these traits maybe central to both SOC formation and decomposition10–12, thecontrols on microbial physiological traits and their consequencesfor SOC across environmental gradients are poorly elucidated,hindering predictions about how SOC pools will respond toenvironmental changes.Contemporary SOC theory predicts that microbial physiologicaltraits mediate SOC stabilization, with greater microbial growth,efﬁciency, or turnover leading to greater mineral-associated SOC10(hereafter the ‘necromass stabilization hypothesis ’;F i g . 1). Multipleisotope tracing studies support that high-quality, fast-decomposingplant inputs are more rapidly or ef ﬁciently transferred into mineral-associated SOC1,13–18, but see19. This effect is commonly attributedto the necromass stabilization hypothesis, assuming that higherinput quality promotes faster or more ef ﬁcient microbialgrowth10,20,21. The necromass stabilization hypothesis is repre-sented implicitly in conventional ﬁrst-order decay models22,a n di sincreasingly represented in more mechanistic microbially explicitSOC models, which often treat microbial necromass as a primarysource of mineral-associated SOC11,12,22–28. Yet, despite itsimportance in conceptual and mathematical models, this hypothesishas only limited empirical support (e.g., from arti ﬁcial laboratorymicrocosms29or single-site ﬁeld observations30). Moreover, othermechanisms could lessen the importance of the necromass stabili-zation pathway —offsetting necromass buildup via enhanced SOCturnover (e.g., priming effects)31–33or circumventing microbialphysiological traits via non-necromass SOC formation pathways(e.g., direct sorption of plant compounds34,35or microbial extra-cellular products36,37;F i g . 1a). Such mechanisms are rarely con-sidered alongside the necromass stabilization pathway in empiricalstudies.Here, we tested a hypothesis that is central to current SOCmodels —that microbial physiological traits link litter quality toSOC stabilization (H1; Fig. 1a). We used both experimentalmicrocosms and a multi-site ﬁeld study to ask whether microbialphysiological traits (1) predict differences in mineral-associatedSOC and (2) represent the key link between plant litter decom-position and SOC stabilization. We evaluated competinghypotheses (Fig. 1a) that direct interactions between plant com-pounds and mineral surfaces could explain litter quality effects onmineral-associated SOC (H2), microbial extracellular productioncould decouple microbial necromass production from mineral-associated SOC formation (H3), and microbial growth and ef ﬁ-ciency stimulation could promote decomposition and reduce netSOC gains from litter-enhanced SOC formation (H4). In themicrocosm experiment, we incubated 16 different temperate treeleaf litters with isotopically distinct soil and measured microbialphysiological traits and the ﬂow of litter-derived C into themineral-associated SOC pool. Given that the characteristics of thesoil matrix (e.g., soil texture, pH, metal-oxides) may exert morecontrol over mineral-associated SOC retention than the source orcharacteristics of the organic matter itself10,38,39(H5), we alsotested hypotheses about the relationship between plant litter,microbes, and edaphic factors (Fig. 1a) across six eastern UStemperate forests (Fig. 1b). We quanti ﬁed SOC pools (mineral-associated and necromass-derived) along with microbial physio-logical traits and other potential biotic and abiotic drivers ofmineral-associated SOC.

We monitored litter decomposition bymeasuring the rate and isotopic signature of respiration during185-day incubations of litter-soil mixtures. Litter treatmentsvaried markedly in chemical traits and decomposition parameters(Table S1). A litter quality index, obtained via a principal com-ponents analysis (Fig. S1A), explained 47% of this variation andcorrelated highly with acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) con-tent—an indicator of litter carbon quality40. We used a substrate-nonspeci ﬁc technique (18O incorporation into DNA) to quantifymicrobial physiological traits during early (15 days) and inter-mediate (100 days) stages of decomposition (Table S2). Thesetime intervals correspond to the midpoint of parallel early andintermediate carbon budget microcosms (described below).Microbial growth, CUE, and turnover were highly correlated withone another allowing us to collapse these traits into a singlemicrobial physiological trait index explaining 90% of the variation(Fig. S1B).High-quality litters increased microbial growth, CUE, andturnover (Fig. 2a). This effect was especially pronounced duringintermediate stages of decomposition suggesting a depletion ofthe smaller pool of labile substrates in low-quality litters.Microbial physiological traits were better predicted by indicatorsof litter C quality than by litter nitrogen (N) content (Fig. S2),which is notable given that N availability and substratestoichiometry are considered primary drivers of microbialphysiological traits41,42. Nonetheless, the positive effect of litterquality on microbial physiological traits supports the commonhypothesis that high-quality or fast-decomposing litters shouldpromote rapid and ef ﬁcient microbial growth10. Whereas thishypothesis has been previously evaluated indirectly by tracingmicrobial use of speci ﬁc C compounds10,22, these substrate non-speciﬁc measurements provide direct evidence from microbialcommunities growing on natural leaf litter substrates.Contrary to the predictions of the necromass stabilizationhypothesis, microbial physiological traits were not positivelyrelated to the amount of litter C recovered in the mineral-associated SOC pool during early (30 days) or intermediate(185 days) stage decomposition (Fig. 2b). This is surprising giventhat high-quality litters led to faster and more ef ﬁcient mineral-associated SOC formation (Fig. S3), a common ﬁnding that isoften attributed to the necromass stabilization hypothesis.Instead, path analysis revealed a negative relationship betweenmicrobial physiological traits and both the rate and ef ﬁciency ofmineral-associated SOC formation (Fig. 2c; Fig. S4). This patternwas most pronounced in intermediate stages when the effects oflitter quality on microbial physiological traits were strongest. Theoverall relationship between litter quality and mineral-associatedSOC formation was explained by a direct linkage rather than byan indirect effect —that is, it was not mediated through microbialphysiological traits. In fact, the indirect microbial physiologicaltrait effect counteracted and weakened the overall positive effectof litter quality on mineral-associated SOC formation in bothearly and, especially, intermediate stages of decomposition.These ﬁndings point toward a few explanations with importantimplications for conceptual and mathematical SOC models. Theinability of microbial physiological traits to explain litter qualityeffects on mineral-associated SOC formation suggests that theproduction of microbial necromass is not a suf ﬁcient explanationfor SOC stabilization in temperate systems. This result highlightsthe critical importance of non-necromass pathways of mineral-associated SOC formation. The direct linkage between litterquality and mineral-associated SOC formation in our pathanalysis could indicate direct sorption of plant-derived decom-position products14,31,43(Fig. 1a). Indeed, high-quality litters inthis experiment had more soluble material and decomposedfaster, likely enhancing dissolved SOC44and producing oxidizedintermediates with a high sorption af ﬁnity35. These effects of litterquality on dissolved SOC are known to enhance mineral-associated SOC formation45. In addition, microbial extracellularproducts could be important (Fig. 1a), but are overlooked by anemphasis on microbial physiological traits36,46. Extracellularpolymeric substances, stress compounds, and similar productsaccount for a small proportion of microbial production47, but arelikely to disproportionately affect mineral-associated SOC giventheir susceptibility to stabilization on mineral surfaces37.In direct contrast with predictions derived from the necromasshypothesis, litter quality stimulation of microbial physiologicaltraits may also mediate priming effects (i.e., stimulation of SOCdecay by fresh inputs) which act to reduce, rather than promote,mineral-associated SOC formation. Higher litter quality pro-moted faster and more ef ﬁcient microbial growth, leading toincreased microbial biomass (Fig. S5) which is likely to promoteSOC decomposition via increased microbial activity48. Thoughmineral-associated SOC is often assumed to resist microbialdecomposition, a large fraction of this pool is likely susceptible tomicrobe-mediated desorption2. Microbes can access mineral-associated organic matter as a source of N and microbial activitycan promote desorption by altering redox states or diffusiongradients, or by producing extracellular enzymes49. Alternatively,newly produced necromass could be recycled as a source of Nprior to mineral stabilization50. Thus, the negative relationshipbetween microbial physiological traits and mineral-associatedSOC formation in the path analysis indicates that decompositionof newly formed mineral-associated SOC or mineral-associatedSOC precursors outweighed necromass-driven SOC formation.Though rarely assessed32,51, the balance of these two processes islikely to vary based on the strength of mineral-organicassociations and magnitude of litter-induced priming effects.This balance should determine whether the necromass pathway isa dominant driver of mineral-associated SOC formation in agiven system.We observed a negative effect of microbial physiological traitson soil-derived (i.e., pre-existing) mineral-associated SOC(Fig. 3a) and particulate SOC (Fig. S6), supporting the hypothesisthat litter quality stimulation of microbial physiological traits ledto priming effects. By the time intermediate-stage decompositionwas reached, this led to a signi ﬁcant negative indirect effect oflitter quality on soil-derived SOC. A litter-induced priming effectwas also evident in cumulative soil-derived respiration data, butwe note that this was better predicted by the second axis of thelitter quality index —which re ﬂected litter N content (Fig. 3b)—potentially indicating that SOC formation and decompositionFig. 1 Conceptual model and map of study sites. a Conceptual modelshowing microbe-mediated mechanisms of mineral-associated soil organiccarbon (SOC) formation and decay.

Insummary, our microcosm experiment suggests that the positiveeffect of litter quality on mineral-associated SOC formation isattributable to the sorption of litter-derived or microbialextracellular products rather than microbial necromass. To thecontrary, elevated microbial growth, ef ﬁciency, and turnover maydrive the decomposition of new and old SOC.Field study . To evaluate whether the mechanisms implied by ourexperimental results are relevant drivers of mineral-associatedSOC in natural forests, we quanti ﬁed microbial physiologicaltraits along with mineral-associated and necromass-derived SOMpools across wide environmental gradients nested within six UStemperate forests. These gradients were identi ﬁed based on themycorrhizal associations of dominant trees52–54(see methods)and re ﬂected variation in litter quality and other factors hypo-thesized to control microbial physiological traits (e.g., soil C:N,pH, and N availability; Table S3). As in the microcosm experi-ment, we derived a litter quality index and a microbial physio-logical trait index explaining 45% of the variation in litterchemical traits and 79% of the variation in microbial physiolo-gical traits, respectively (Fig. S1C, D).In contrast with the microcosm experiment, we detected norelationship between litter quality and microbial physiologicaltraits in the ﬁeld (Fig. S7), which is perhaps unsurprising givenﬁeld variation in other factors expected to control litterdecomposition and microbial functioning (e.g., soil nutrientavailability). Microbial physiological traits were instead positivelypredicted by soil C:N (Fig. S7), meaning microbial growth,efﬁciency, and turnover tended to be greater in soils with morecarbon per unit nitrogen. This indicates that our plots, as well asthe soil used in our experiment (C:N =12.0), fell below thestoichiometric boundary (i.e., threshold element ratio) between Cvs. N limitation55, which is thought to range from a C:N of 20 –25for terrestrial microbial communities56. Indeed, bivariate plotssuggest a hump-shaped relationship where microbial physiologi-cal traits no longer increase with soil C:N at a soil C:N of ~20(Fig. S8), suggesting that N limitation might drive microbialphysiological traits in soils with a higher C:N ratio.Patterns in mineral-associated SOC, however, were consistentwith the microcosm experiment. Litter quality was positivelyassociated with mineral-associated SOC, but this relationship wasnot explained by microbial physiological traits (Fig. 4a; Fig. S9),which were unrelated to total mineral-associated SOC (Fig. S9).Consistent with the microcosm experiment, we observed anegative relationship between microbial physiological traits andthe proportion of soil C stored in mineral-associated SOC(Fig. 4a). This pattern may have been driven by alternativestabilization pathways or priming of mineral-associated SOC, asdocumented in the microcosm experiment, but our observationsreveal additional mechanisms by which necromass productioncould be decoupled from mineral-associated SOC along naturalgradients.Differences in necromass stabilization could weaken therelationship between necromass production and accumulationacross ﬁeld plots.

We observed only aweak positive relationship of total necromass with Fe oxand,curiously, a negative relationship with soil clay content, whereasthe necromass stabilization hypothesis assumes that microbialnecromass is highly susceptible to interactions with soil minerals.Recent work, however, suggests necromass retention may bemore in ﬂuenced by substrate chemistry than by mineralmechanisms in fungal-dominated forest topsoils57,58, potentiallyleading to the buildup of necromass in organic soils or particulateorganic matter fractions59. After resolving necromass into fungaland bacterial pools, it is clear that fungal necromass drove thenegative association with clay content —likely re ﬂecting fungaldominance in coarse-textured soils60—while bacterial necromasswas strongly associated with Fe ox(Fig. S10). This suggests, inagreement with previous work58,61–64, that bacterial cellularproducts were more prone to interactions with soil minerals andtherefore a more important source of mineral-associated SOC.We suggest that the origin of microbial necromass in ﬂuences itsstabilization potential and therefore the extent to whichnecromass production should drive mineral-associated SOCformation (Fig. 1a).Variation in abiotic soil properties could also directly orindirectly override the effect of microbial physiological traits onmineral-associated SOC. Across our plots, clay content was stronglyassociated with the proportion of soil C stored in mineral-associatedSOC and oxalate-extractable Fe (Fe ox)—an indicator of poorlycrystalline Fe oxides —was the strongest predictor of total mineral-associated SOC (Fig. 4a; Fig. S7). In addition to these directrelationships, abiotic soil properties could indirectly decouplemicrobial physiological traits from mineral-associated SOC throughtheir association with other SOM and biotic properties. Forexample, while clay content was positively associated withmineral-associated SOC, clayey soils can have a lower rootdensity65. This pattern could partially explain the negativerelationships between mineral-associated SOC and root biomassor microbial physiological traits (Fig. 4a)—because roots canpromote microbial activity —or the negative relationship betweenclay content and microbial necromass (Fig. 4b). Indeed, we foundthat greater ﬁne root biomass was associated with higher microbialbiomass (mixed model: P=0.09), necromass (Fig. 4b), and atendency toward higher microbial physiological traits (Fig. S7).Roots and root-associated microbes are likely to drivepatterns in SOC dynamics. Rhizospheres are important zonesof both SOC formation43and decay66.O u r ﬁnding that ﬁneroot biomass was associated with greater microbial activity andlower mineral-associated SOC could re ﬂect root-driven SOCpriming67. Yet our study targeted aboveground inputs andupper topsoil; a different role of roots may be apparent atgreater depths where belowground inputs dominate. Indeed,root-derived carbon was recently found to account for asubstantial and rapid accumulation of mineral-associated SOCin ingrowth cores deployed in these same plots68, indicating arole of living root or mycorrhizal inputs69. Measurements ofin situ interactions among roots, microbes, and SOC would bevaluable in further improving our understanding of pathways ofSOC formation and decomposition.While we found that microbial growth, ef ﬁciency, andturnover are not adequate predictors of mineral-associatedSOC formation in surface soils of temperate forests, necromassstabilization on mineral surfaces could still be an importantmechanism of SOC storage. This mechanism may explain morevariation in other systems (e.g., croplands or grasslands) or indeeper soils, where necromass accounts for a larger proportion oftotal SOC9. For example, agricultural soils tend to be morebacterially dominated9, potentially leading to stronger interac-tions between microbial necromass and soil minerals (asdescribed above). This may lead to a stronger associationbetween microbial physiological traits and mineral-associatedSOC in cropped systems30. Future sampling campaigns areneeded to understand how SOC formation pathways vary acrossdifferent systems.Fig. 3 Soil-derived (i.e., pre-existing) carbon losses in the microcosmexperiment. a Path analysis showing the direct and indirect effects of thelitter quality index (Litter quality) on soil-derived mineral-associated SOC(MA-SOC).

We found that plant litter quality was positivelyassociated with mineral-associated SOC in both a microcosmexperiment and across six temperate forests. This pattern, how-ever, was not explained by microbial physiological traits in eitherthe experiment or the ﬁeld study. Though litter quality waspositively associated with microbial physiological traits in themicrocosm experiment, ﬁeld variation in microbial growth, ef ﬁ-ciency, and turnover was better explained by soil C:N ratios. Moreimportantly, microbial physiological traits were negatively relatedto both mineral-associated SOC formation and the proportion ofsoil C stored in mineral-associated SOC in the experiment andﬁeld study, respectively. Thus, while acknowledging that micro-bial necromass represents an important pool of SOC, we concludethat the necromass stabilization hypothesis is insuf ﬁcient as ageneral explanation linking plant input quality to mineral-associated SOC formation.Our results highlight four factors which act to decouplemicrobial necromass production from mineral-associated SOC(Fig. 1a): differences in the mineral stabilization potential ofnecromass produced by different microbial communities (1);alternative pathways linking plant inputs to mineral-associatedSOC (i.e., direct stabilization of plant inputs or the stabilization ofmicrobial extracellular products) (2 and 3); priming of newlyformed or pre-existing mineral-associated SOC driven by higherlitter quality and greater microbial activity (4); and the overridingeffects of soil abiotic properties (5). The balance of these factors islikely context-dependent, but is critical to our predictive under-standing of mineral-associated SOC dynamics and thereforeatmosphere-soil C feedbacks. As models and experiments probethese alternative hypotheses, a broadened view of how microbesmediate mineral-associated SOC formation should ultimately leadto greater con ﬁdence in soil C projections.MethodsMicrocosm preparation and incubation . Leaf litters were collected from Lilly-Dickey Woods, a mature eastern US temperate broadleaf forest located in South-Central Indiana (39°14 ′N, 86°13 ′W) using litter baskets and surveys for freshlysenesced litter as described in Craig et al.52. Of the 19 species collected in Craiget al. (2018), we selected litter from 16 tree species with the goal of maximizingvariation in litter chemical traits (Table S1). Litters were air-dried and thenhomogenized and fragmented such that all litter fragments passed a 4000 µm, butnot a 250 µm mesh. Whereas leaf litters had a distinctly C3 δ13C signature of−30.1 ± 1.5 (mean, standard deviation), we used a13C-rich ( δ13C=−12.6 ± 0.4)soil obtained from the A horizon of a 35-yr continuous corn ﬁeld at the PurdueUniversity Agronomy Center for Research and Education near West Lafayette,Indiana (40°4 ′N, 86°56 ′W). The soil is classi ﬁed as Chalmers silty clay loam (a ﬁne-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquoll). Prior to use in the incubation,soils were sieved (2 mm) and remaining recognizable plant residues were thor-oughly picked out. Soils were mixed with acid-washed sand —30% by mass —tofacilitate litter mixing (see below) and to increase the soil volume for post-incubation processing. The resulting soil had a pH of 6.7 and a C:N ratio of 12.0.We constructed the experimental microcosms by mixing the 16 litter specieswith the13C-enriched soil. Each litter treatment was replicated four times in fourbatches (i.e., 16 microcosms per species, 272 total microcosms including 16 soil-only controls). Two batches (C budget microcosms) were used to monitor CO2efﬂux and to track litter-derived C into SOM pools, and two batches were used toquantify microbial biomass dynamics.Incubations were carried out in 50 mL centrifuge tubes modi ﬁed with an O-ring toprevent leakage and a rubber septum to facilitate headspace sampling. To eachmicrocosm, we added 5 g dry soil, adjusted moisture to 65% water-holding capacity,and pre-incubated for 24 h in the dark at 24 °C. Using a dissecting needle, 300 mg ofleaf litter were carefully mixed into treatment microcosms and controls were similarlyagitated. This corresponds to an average C addition rate of 27.1 ± 1.1 g C kg−1dry soilamong the 16 species. During incubation, microcosms were loosely capped to retainmoisture while allowing gas exchange, and were maintained at 65% water-holdingcapacity by adding deionized water every week.Carbon budget in microcosms . Respiration was quanti ﬁed with an infrared gasanalyzer (LiCOR 6262, Lincoln, NE, USA) coupled to a sample injection system.Ourﬁrst measurement was taken about 12 h after litter addition (day 1) andsubsequent measurements were taken on days 2, 4, 11, 19, and 30 for both batchesand on days 46, 64, 79, 92, 109, 128, 149, and 185 for the second batch. Prior toeach measurement, microcosms were capped, ﬂushed with CO2-free air, andincubated for 1 –8 h depending on the expected ef ﬂux rate. Headspace was sampledwith a gas-tight syringe and the CO 2-C concentration was converted to arespiration rate (µg CO 2-C day−1). Total cumulative CO 2-C loss was derived frompoint measurements by numerical integration (i.e., the trapezoid method). Toevaluate soil-derived CO 2-C ef ﬂux, we measured δ13C in two gas samples per litterFig. 4 Results from the ﬁeld study.

Isotopes were measured on days 1, 4, 11, 30, 64, 109, and 185. On each ofthese days, a two-source mixing model70was applied to determine the fraction oftotal CO 2-C derived from soil organic matter vs. litter:FlðtÞFðtÞ¼δFtðÞ/C0 δFcðtÞδCl/C0δFcðtÞð1ÞwhereFlðtÞFðtÞis the fraction total CO 2-C efﬂux [FðtÞ] derived from litter [ FlðtÞ] at timetðÞ,δFtðÞis the δ13C of the CO 2respired by each litter-soil combination, δFcðtÞisthe average δ13C of the CO 2respired by the control soil, and δClis the δ13C of eachlitter type. These data were used to calculate cumulative soil-derived C ef ﬂux vianumerical integration and, for each litter type, average soil-derived C ef ﬂux wassubtracted from total cumulative CO 2-C loss to determine cumulative litter-derivedCO 2-C loss.Carbon budget microcosms were harvested on days 30 and 185 to track litter-derived C into mineral-associated SOC at an early and intermediate stage ofdecomposition. To do this, we used a size fractionation procedure71,72modi ﬁed tominimize the recovery of soluble leaf litter compounds or dissolved organic matterin the mineral-associated SOC fraction. For each sample, we ﬁrst added 30 mLdeionized water, gently shook by hand to suspend all particles, and thencentrifuged (2500 rpm) for 10 min. Floating leaf litter was carefully removed, driedfor 48 h at 60 °C, and weighed; and the clear supernatant was discarded to removethe dissolved organic matter. The remaining sample was dispersed in 5% (w/v)sodium hexametaphosphate for 20 h on a reciprocal shaker and then washedthrough a 53 µm sieve. The fraction retained on the sieve was added to the ﬂoatingleaf litter sample and collectively referred to as particulate SOC, while the fractionthat passed through the sieve was considered the mineral-associated SOC. Bothfractions were dried, ground, and weighed; and analyzed for C concentrations andδ13C values on an elemental combustion system (Costech ECS 4010, CostechAnalytical Technologies, Valencia, CA, USA) as an inlet to an IRMS. As above,litter-derived C in the particulate and mineral-associated SOC was determined asfollows:ClsðtÞCsðtÞ¼δCstðÞ/C0δCcðtÞδCl/C0δCcðtÞð2Þwhere CsðtÞis the total particulate or mineral-associated SOC content in the sampleat time ðtÞ,ClsðtÞis the litter-derived C in the soil, δCstðÞis the measured δ13C valuefor each soil fraction, δCctðÞis the average δ13C for each fraction in controlsamples, and δClis the δ13C of each litter type. In a few cases, mineral-associatedδ13C was slightly less negative in the treatment than in the control soil. In thesecases, litter-derived mineral-associated SOC was considered zero.Total litter-derived SOC at each harvest date was calculated by subtracting thecumulative litter CO 2-C from initial added litter C. The difference between thisvalue and the sum of litter-derived particulate and mineral-associated SOC wasconsidered the residual pool which we assume mostly represents water-extractabledissolved organic matter.Microbial biomass dynamics during incubation . Sample batches were harvestedat days 15 and 100 to capture early- and intermediate-term microbial biomassresponses to litter treatments. These times were selected to correspond with themiddle of early and intermediate C budget microcosm incubations. We quanti ﬁedmicrobial biomass as well as MGR, CUE, and MTR using18O-labeled water73,74asin Geyer et al.75.Microbial biomass C (MBC) was determined on two ~2 g subsamples using astandard chloroform fumigation extraction76. One subsample was immediatelyextracted in 0.5 M K 2SO4and one was fumigated for 72 h before extraction. Aftershaking for 1 h, extracts were gravity ﬁltered through a Whatman No. 40 ﬁlterpaper, and ﬁltrates were analyzed for total organic C using the method of Bartlettand Ross77as adapted by Giasson et al.78. The difference between total organic C inthe fumigated and unfumigated subsamples was used to calculate MBC (extractionefﬁciency K EC=0.45).To determine MGR, CUE, and MTR, we ﬁrst pre-incubated two 0.5 g soilsubsamples (one treatment and one control) for 2 d at 24 °C. Prior to this pre-incubation, samples were allowed to evaporate down to 53 ± 6% (mean, sd) water-holding capacity. After the pre-incubation, water was injected with a 25 µL syringeto bring each sample to 65% water-holding capacity. For one subsample, we usedunlabeled deionized water. For the second subsample, enriched18O-water (98.1 at%; ICON Isotopes) was mixed with unlabeled deionized H 2O to achieveapproximately 20 at% of18O in the ﬁnal soil water. Each sample was placed in acentrifuge tube (modi ﬁed for gas sampling), ﬂushed with CO 2-free air, andincubated for 24 h. Headspace CO 2concentration was then measured, and sampleswere ﬂash frozen in liquid N 2and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction.DNA was extracted from each sample using a DNA extraction kit (QiagenDNeasy PowerSoil Kit, Venlo, Netherlands) following the protocol described inGeyer et al. (2019) which sought to maximize the recovery of DNA. The DNAconcentration was determined ﬂuorometrically using a Quant-iT PicoGreendsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). DNA extracts (80 µL) were dried at 60 °C in silvercapsules spiked with 100 µL of salmon sperm DNA (42.5 ng µL−1), to reach theoxygen detection limit, and sent to the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility forquanti ﬁcation of δ18O and total O content.Microbial growth rate (MGR) was calculated following Geyer et al. (2019).Speci ﬁcally, atom % of soil DNA O (at% O DNA) was determined using the two-poolmixing model:at%ODNA¼at%ODNAþss´ODNAþss/C0/C1/C0at%Oss´Oss/C0/C1 /C2/C3ODNAð3Þwhere at% is the atom %18O and O DNA+ss,ODNA, and O ssare the concentration ofO in the whole sample, soil DNA, and salmon sperm, respectively. Atom percentexcess of soil DNA oxygen (APE O soil) was calculated as the difference between at%ODNA in the treatment and control samples. Total microbial growth in terms of O(Total O; µg) was estimated as:Total O ¼Osoil´APE Osoilat%soil waterð4Þwhere at% soil water is the atom %18O in the soil water. MGR in terms of C (µg Cg−1soil d−1) was calculated by applying conversion mass ratios of oxygen:DNA(0.31) and MBC:DNA for each sample, dividing by the soil mass, and scaling by theincubation time. Assuming uptake rate (Uptake) is equal to the sum of MGR andrespiration, CUE and MTR were calculated by the following equations.CUE¼MGRUptakeð5ÞMTR ¼MGRMBCð6ÞData analysis for microcosm experiment . Litter decay constants were calculatedfor each species using litter-derived CO 2-C values to estimate litter mass loss overtime. After it was determined that a single exponential decay model provided apoor ﬁt, we ﬁt litter decomposition data using the double exponential decay model:y¼se/C0k1tþð1/C0sÞe/C0k2tð7Þwhere srepresents the labile or early stage decomposition fraction that decomposesat rate k1, and k2is the decay constant for the remaining late stage decompositionfraction.To reduce the dimensionality of litter quality and microbial indicators, indiceswere derived by principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. S1A, B) using the‘prcomp ’function in R. The ﬁrst axis of a PCA of decomposition parameters ( s,k1,andk2) and litter chemical properties (soluble and AUR contents; AUR-to-N andC-to-N ratios; and the lignocellulose index [LCI]) was taken as a litter qualityindex. Whereas this index highly correlated with indicators of C quality (AUR,soluble content, and LCI), the second axis of this PCA correlated with C:N andAUR:N and was therefore taken as a second litter quality index representingvariation in N concentration. The ﬁrst axis of a PCA of MGR, CUE, and MTR wastaken as a microbial physiological trait index.Bivariate relationships were examined using simple linear regressions onaverage species values at each harvest ( n=16). To examine relationships betweenmicrobial physiological traits and mineral-associated SOC, data from the early-term (day 15) and intermediate-term (day 100) microbial harvest were matchedwith early-term (day 30) and intermediate-term (day 185) C budget microcosms,respectively. In addition to examining total mineral-associated SOC formation, wealso estimated the ef ﬁciency of litter C transfer into the mineral-associated SOCpool as the fraction of lost litter C (i.e., litter C lost as CO2, recovered in themineral-associated SOC fraction, or in the residual pool) retained in the mineral-associated SOC. Path analyses were used to evaluate the hypothesis that microbialphysiological traits mediate the effect of litter quality on mineral-associated SOCformation and mineral-associated and particulate SOC decay. We hypothesizedthat the litter quality index would be positively associated with the microbialphysiological trait index (representing faster and more ef ﬁcient microbial growth)and microbial physiological traits would, in turn, be positively associated with therate and ef ﬁciency of mineral-associated SOC formation. We expected that thismediating pathway would reduce the direct relationship between litter quality andSOC. This analysis was conducted using the LAVAAN package79to run pathanalyses for total litter-derived mineral-associated SOC, mineral-associated SOCformation ef ﬁciency, and soil-derived mineral-associated and particulate SOC forboth early and intermediate stage harvests. All analyses were performed using Rversion 3.5.2.Field study design and soil sampling . We worked in the Smithsonian ’s ForestGlobal Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) network80in six mature U.S. temperateforests varying in climate, soil properties, and tree community composition(Fig. 1a): Harvard forest (HF; 42°32 ′N, 72°11 ′W) in North-Central Massachusetts,Lilly-Dickey Woods (LDW; 39°14 ’N, 86°13 ’W) in South-Central Indiana, theSmithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI; 38°54 ′N, 78°9 ′W) in NorthernVirginia, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC; 38°53 ′N, 76°34 ′W) on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, Tyson Research Center (TRC; 38°31 ′N,90°33 ′W) in Eastern Missouri, and Wabikon Lake Forest (WLF; 45°33 ′N, 88°48 ′W)in Northern Wisconsin, USA. Land use history across the six sites consisted mostlyNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28715-9 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:1229 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28715-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7of timber harvesting which ceased in the early 1900s. Soils are mostly OxyaquicDystrudepts at HF, Typic Dystrudepts and Typic Hapludults at LDW, TypicHapludalfs at SCBI, Typic or Aquic Hapludults at SERC, Typic Hapludalfs andTypic Paleudalfs at TRC, and Typic and Al ﬁc Haplorthods at WLF. Further sitedetails are reported in Table S5.Each site contains a rich assemblage of co-occurring arbuscular mycorrhizal(AM)- and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-associated trees (Table S6), which we leveragedto generate environmental gradients in factors hypothesized to predict microbialphysiological traits within each site. Speci ﬁcally, the dominance of AM vs. ECMtrees within a temperate forest plot has been shown to be a strong predictor of soilpH, C:N, inorganic N availability, and litter quality52–54. We established nine20 × 20 m plots in each of our six sites in Fall 2016 ( n=54) distributed along agradient of AM- to ECM-associated tree dominance. Plots were selected to avoidobvious confounding environmental factors. Where possible, we established ournine-plot gradient in three blocks (<1 ha), each containing an AM, ECM, andmixed dominance plot. Plots were generally located on upland areas except forTRC where all plots were located on toeslopes due to a lack of AM trees in uplandareas. At HF, we established six of the nine plots outside the boundaries of theForestGEO plot due to a lack of appropriate AM-ECM mixtures. At LDW, we useda random subset of previously established 15 × 15 m plots81. Basal area of livingtrees was determined using the most recent ForestGEO census (within the last 5years) or by conducting our own inventory. ECM-dominance was quanti ﬁed as thepercentage of ECM-associated basal area relative to the total plot basal area.Four soil cores (5 cm-diameter) were collected in July 2017 from each plot to adepth of 5 cm. A thin O horizon (Oe and Oa) was sometimes present and wascollected as part of the 5 cm soil core. However, there was often a thick O horizon(>5 cm) at HF, which was removed before coring. Samples were also collected at5–15 cm depth for soil texture analysis. We sampled from an inner 10 × 10 msquare in each plot to avoid edge effects. All samples from the same plot werecomposited, sieved (2 mm), picked free of roots, subsampled for gravimetricmoisture (105 °C), and air-dried, or refrigerated (4 °C) until analysis for microbialphysiological variables and N availability.Soil properties . We determined several physicochemical properties known topredict mineral-associated SOC. We measured soil pH (8:1 ml 0.01 M CaCl2:g soil)and soil texture using a benchtop pH meter and a standard hydrometerprocedure82, respectively. Organic matter content was high in some upper surfacesoils, so plot-level soil texture was determined from 5 to 15 cm depth samples. Wequanti ﬁed oxalate-extractable Al and Fe pools (Al oxand Fe ox) in all soil samples asan index of poorly crystalline Al- and Fe-oxides83, which is one of the strongestpredictors of SOM content in temperate forests84. Brie ﬂy, we extracted 0.40 g dried,ground soil in 40 mL 0.2 M NH 4-oxalate at pH 3.0 in the dark for 4 h before gravityﬁltering and refrigerating until analysis (within 2 w) on an atomic-adsorptionspectrometer (Aanalyst 800, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), using an acet-ylene ﬂame and a graphite furnace for the atomization of Fe and Al, respectively.We quanti ﬁed potential net N mineralization rates as an index of soil Navailability. One 5 g subsample per plot was extracted immediately after processingby adding 10 mL 2 M KCl, shaking for 1 h, and ﬁltering through a Whatman No. 1ﬁlter paper after centrifugation at 3000 rpm. A second subsample from each plotwas incubated under aerobic conditions at ﬁeld moisture and 23 °C for 14 d beforeextraction. Extracts were frozen ( −20 °C) until analysis for NH 4+-N using thesalicylate method and for NO 3−-N plus NO 2−-N after a cadmium columnreduction on a Lachat QuikChem 8000 ﬂow Injection Analyzer (LachatInstruments, Loveland, CO, USA). Potential net N mineralization rates (mg N gdry soil−1d−1) were calculated as the difference between pre- and post-incubationinorganic N concentrations.Microbial biomass dynamics in ﬁeld plots . Microbial biomass carbon andmicrobial physiological traits were quanti ﬁed within 10 days of collection asdescribed above, with four minor differences. First, 30 g soil subsamples werecovered with para ﬁlm and pre-incubated for 2 d near the ﬁeld soil temperaturemeasured at the time of sampling (16.5 °C for WLF and HF, and 21.5 °C for LDW,TRC, SCBI, and SERC). Second, for CO 2analysis, samples were placed in a 61 mLserum vial crimped with a rubber septum. Third, DNA concentrations weredetermined using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and a Qubit3.0ﬂuorometer (Life Technologies). Fourth, 14.5 g subsamples were used formicrobial biomass analysis.Soil organic matter characterization in ﬁeld plots . Mineral-associated SOC wasquanti ﬁed as in the microcosm experiment, but without a pre-fractionation lea-chate removal step. We additionally measured soil amino sugar concentrations toestimate microbial necromass contributions to SOM. Amino sugars are usefulmicrobial biomarkers because they are found in abundance in microbial cell walls,but are not produced by higher plants and soil animals19. Moreover, amino sugarscan provide information on the microbial source of necromass. For example,glucosamine (Glu) is produced mostly by fungi whereas muramic acid (MurA) isproduced almost exclusively by bacteria61,85. Amino sugars were extracted, pur-iﬁed, converted to aldononitrile acetates, and quanti ﬁed with myo-inositol as inLiang et al.86. We used the concentrations of Glu and MurA to estimate total,fungal, and bacterial necromass soil C using the empirical relationships reported inLiang et al.8.Bacterial necromass C ¼MurA ´45 ð8ÞFungal necromass C ¼ðmmol GluN /C02´mmol MurA Þ´179 :17´9ð9ÞLeaf litter and ﬁne roots in ﬁeld plots . In Fall 2017, we collected leaf litter on twosample dates from four baskets deployed in the inner 10 × 10 m of each plot. Litterwas composited by plot, dried (60 °C), sorted by species, weighed, and ground. Weperformed leaf litter analyses on at least three samples of each species at each site—unless a species was only present in one or two plots —to get a site-speci ﬁc meanfor each species. Some non-dominant species were not included in these analysesbecause an insuf ﬁcient amount of material was collected. Fine roots (<2 mm) werecollected at the time of soil sampling (at LDW, TRC, and WLF) or the followingsummer (HF, SERC, SCBI) due to issues with sample processing.Leaf litter and bulk root samples were analyzed for C and N content. Forleaf litter, we conducted a sequential extraction as above (sensu Moorhead &Reynolds87) to determine the soluble fraction using hot water and ethanol, theAUR —the insoluble ash-free fraction that resisted degradation by a strong acid —which contains lignin and is commonly found to inhibit leaf litter decay40. The LCIwas estimated by dividing the AUR fraction by the total non-soluble ash-freefraction. Leaf litter trait values were calculated for each plot as the average of site-speciﬁc mean values for each species in the plot weighted by proportion of totalplot basal area.Data analysis for ﬁeld study . As above, a litter quality index and microbialphysiological trait index was calculated via PCA for each plot (Fig. S1C, D). Wenote, however, that decomposition parameters were not available for the litterquality PCA in the ﬁeld study. We evaluated the extent to which microbial phy-siological variables were predicted by litter quality, N availability, stoichiometery, Cavailability, pH, or root biomass. We ﬁrst examined variability in indicators ofthese biogeochemical drivers (i.e., the litter quality index, net N mineralization, soilC:N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil pH, and ﬁne root biomass) and eval-uated whether they correlated with our mycorrhizal gradients. Linear mixedmodels were ﬁt to the microbial physiological trait index using site as a randomfactor and the above indicators as ﬁxed factors.We also used linear mixed models to evaluate whether microbial physiologicalvariables predicted signi ﬁcant variation in mineral-associated or necromass-derived C in the context of other hypothesized or known controls on mineral-associated SOC. In addition to the litter quality and microbial physiological traitindices, we included clay content, pH, Feox,A l ox, and ﬁne root biomass as ﬁxedfactors. We ﬁt models to mineral-associated SOC —on a total basis (g soil−1) and asa proportion of soil C (mineral-associated C/total soil C) —as well as total, fungal,and bacterial necromass. Models were selected to avoid highly correlated predictors(i.e., r> 0.5). Fe oxand Al oxwere correlated above this threshold and ﬁnal modelswere selected to contain only Fe oxbased on AIC. Residuals were screened fornormality (Shapiro-Wilk), heteroscedasticity (visual assessment of residual plots),and in ﬂuential observations (Cook ’s D). Based on this, MGR, MTR, and mineral-associated SOC were natural log transformed. For all mixed models, we centeredand standardized predictors (i.e., z-transformation) so that the slopes andsigniﬁcance levels of different predictors could be compared to one another on thesame axis88.Data availabilityThe data generated in this study have been deposited in the ESS-DIVE archive89(https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/ ;https://doi.org/10.15485/1835182 ).Code availabilityAnalysis code is available as part of the ESS-DIVE data package89(https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/ ;https://doi.org/10.15485/1835182 ).Received: 22 July 2021; Accepted: 28 January 2022;References1.
