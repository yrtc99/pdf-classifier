IntroductionCarbon dioxide (CO 2) is the main greenhouse gas emitted from human activities suchas burning coal, oil, and natural gas, and is considered one of the causes of global warmingand climate change. Efforts are being made worldwide to reduce CO 2in the atmosphereand ultimately achieve carbon neutrality. Besides reducing the emission of CO 2, the capture,sequestration, and utilization of CO 2is an effective way to decrease the atmospheric CO 2concentration [ 1,2]. In general, CO 2is captured from industrial emissions and sequestratedin a storage site such as the exploited oil ﬁelds, ocean, and abandoned coal mining areas,and then utilized as substrate for chemicals production [ 3]. To date, an increasing number ofmethods have been developed to capture and sequestrate CO 2[4–6]. Compared with CO 2capture and sequestration, the transformation of CO 2into chemicals is a more challengingstep. Based on the physical and chemical properties of CO 2, methods including chemicalcatalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, enzymatic and microbial catalysis have beenexplored for CO 2transformation [ 1,3,7–11]. However, most CO 2conversion methods haveissues of poor selectivity, low yields, costly catalysts, and environmental pollution, whichlimits their application.Biological carbon ﬁxation is the process of converting inorganic carbon, including CO,CO 2, and bicarbonate, into organic chemicals by plants, algae, and autotrophic microorgan-isms, which is an eco-friendly, highly selective, and promising approach compared withchemical catalysis. Biological ﬁxation of CO 2is a key step in global carbon cycle and ﬁxes1017g of CO 2annually [ 12]. The ﬁxation of CO 2in plants and some microorganisms isCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399. https://doi.org/10.3390/catal12040399 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/catalystsCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 2 of 17through the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB)) cycle, whichaccounts for more than 90% of CO 2ﬁxation in nature. [ 13]. In addition to the CBB cy-cle, chemoautotrophs and facultative chemoautotrophs have evolved multiple pathwaysfor CO 2ﬁxation. Both aerobic and obligate anaerobic bacteria are able to utilize CO 2as the sole carbon source for growth, some of which have been engineered to producevarious products such as biofuel, bioplastic, and biochemical [14–19]. In addition, in vitromulti-enzymatic catalysis has been applied for bioﬁxation and transformation of CO 2tovalue-added products [10,20].In the present review, the pathways and key enzymes for CO 2ﬁxation were ﬁrstlycomparatively analyzed. Next, the latest research on metabolic engineering and enzyme en-gineering to improve CO 2ﬁxation efﬁciency was introduced. Finally, key issues hinderingCO 2bioﬁxation, as well as potential methods and prospects for improving the efﬁciency,were discussed.2. Comparative Analysis of Pathways for Carbon Dioxide BioﬁxationBesides the CBB cycle, another ﬁve CO 2ﬁxation pathways including the reductiveacetyl-CoA cycle, reductive tricarboxylic cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle,3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cy-cle have been discovered in autotrophic and facultative autotrophic microorganisms [ 21].In the ﬁve pathways, CO 2is converted to central metabolites such as pyruvate or acetyl-CoA which are different from the CBB pivoting on carbohydrates interconversion. Thenatural CO 2bioﬁxation pathways with the intermediates and products ranging from C2,C3, C4 organic acids to longer chain carbohydrates, providing valuable platforms for theproduction of value-added products from CO 2.2.1. Calvin–Benson–Basham Cycle and RubiscoCalvin–Benson–Basham (CBB) cycle, also known as the reductive pentose phosphatecycle, is the ﬁrst discovered CO 2bioﬁxation pathway and the predominant way of car-bon ﬁxation in nature. CBB cycle is widely distributed in plants, algae, cyanobacteria,and some chemoautotrophic microorganisms such as Cupriavidus necator ,Rhodobacter ,Nitrosomonas, and Acidithiobacillus [21–23]. In the CBB cycle, ribose-1,5-diphosphate car-boxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes the electrophilic addition of CO 2to ribose-1,5-diphosphate (RuBP) and produces 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (Figure 1). Sub-sequently, 3-phosphoglycerate is transformed into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by theenzymes of gluconeogenic pathway. Some glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate branches enter thecentral carbon metabolism, and the others are used for RuBP regeneration, which is thenused for CO 2ﬁxation as a receptor.Besides the carboxylation of CO 2ﬁxation, Rubiscos also catalyze an oxygenation sidereaction of converting RuBP and O 2to 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG).The 2PG is a non-CBB intermediate, which is recycled through photorespiration pathwaygenerally known as phosphoglycolate salvage pathway [ 24,25]. In the photorespiration ofplants, 2PG is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate through a pathway involving glycine andserine intermediates (Figure 1, dark green arrow). In some chemoautotrophic bacteria, theconversion can also be accomplished via the pathway involving tartonate semialdehydeintermediate (Figure 1, brown arrow) [ 24]. A molecule of CO 2is released in the process ofRuBP oxygenation, which reduces the CO 2ﬁxation efﬁciency of plant. It is estimated thatabout 20% of the CO 2ﬁxed by plants is consumed by photorespiration under atmosphericconditions [26,27].Catalysts 2022 ,12, 399 3 of 17Catalysts 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 18    Figure 1.

The Reductive Tricarboxylic Cycle and Its Variant roTCA CycleThe reductive tricarboxylic (rTCA) cycle or the reductive citric acid cycle (Figure 2,Routine 2 and 6), ﬁrst found in the anaerobic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium limi-cola, is mainly distributed in some strictly anaerobic or microaerobic autotrophic eubac-teria [ 21,28,29]. The rTCA cycle is the oxidative TCA cycle operated in the oppositedirection by employing different enzymes to catalyze the irreversible reactions in TCAcycle, including fumarate reductase, 2-oxoglutarate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OGOR,or ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxolutarate synthase), and ATP-citrate lyase [ 21]. Another twokey carboxylases, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR, or ferredoxin-dependent2-oxolutarate synthase) and PEP or pyruvate carboxylase, are also involved in rTCA cycle.The ﬁrst step of the rTCA cycle is the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyru-vate by PFOR with the low redox potential reduced ferredoxin as electron donor, which isoxygen-sensitive and requires a reduced environment [ 30–32]. Pyruvate is further phospho-rylated to PEP , and the generation of oxaloacetate is catalyzed by biotin-dependent pyruvatecarboxylase or PEP carboxylase. Subsequently, oxaloacetate is converted to succinyl-CoAvia the reverse TCA cycle and further reductively carboxylated to 2-oxoglutarate by OGOR.The followed step is the reversible carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate by isocitratedehydrogenase. Finally, isocitrate is converted to citrate, followed by cleavage to generateacetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, completing one rTCA cycle.In the conventional rTCA cycle, 2-oxoglutarate is converted isocitrate by the reversibleisocitrate dehydrogenase. In some thermophilic species growing at 70C or above, such asHydrogenobacter thermophilus , the reaction was catalyzed by an irreversible biotin-dependentATP-consuming 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase and a non-decarboxylating isocitrate dehydro-genase [ 33–36]. These enzymes were found to work with an OGOR with low K mvalues forsuccinyl-CoA and to avoid the accumulation of heat–labile intermediate succinyl-CoA [ 21].A new variant of rTCA cycle, termed the reverse oxidative tricarboxylic acid (roTCA)cycle, was reported recently [ 37]. The roTCA cycle is essentially the same as the rTCA cycle,except that the enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of citrate. Using citrate synthase instead ofATP–citrate lyase in the roTCA cycle, ATP input is reduced making the roTCA cycle anenergy–efﬁcient pathway with only one ATP input for one acetyl-CoA molecule synthesis.However, the citrate cleavage process in roTCA is highly thermodynamically unfavorableand requires extremely high levels of citrate synthases (over 7% of total proteins) and highCO 2partial pressure to drive the cycle.2.3. The Reductive Acetyl–CoA Pathway Is the Most Ancient and Energy–Efﬁcient CO 2Fixation PathwayThe reductive acetyl–CoA pathway (rAC, or Wood–Ljungdahl pathway) is the onlynon-cyclic and energy-conserving CO 2bioﬁxation pathway mainly distributed in obligateacetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea [ 21,38]. The rAC pathway is considered tobe one of the most ancient anaerobic carbon ﬁxation pathways, responsible for biomassaccumulation and energy generation, and functions close to thermodynamic limit [ 39].Notably, the rAC pathway is the most energy-efﬁcient natural CO 2ﬁxation pathway, withless than one ATP input for the synthesis of one acetyl-CoA or pyruvate molecule [ 21]. Inthe rAC pathway, two CO 2molecules are converted to acetyl-CoA. One CO 2was reducedto the methyl level mediated by different carriers, cofactors, and enzymes in acetogens andmethanogens, and the other was reduced to CO bounding to nickel of enzyme active sites(Figure 2, Routine 1) [ 29,40,41]. The reduction of CO 2to CO is catalyzed by the bifunctionalCO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, which also accounts for the condensation ofcoenzyme A, methyl group, and CO to form acetyl-CoA. Further assimilation of acetyl-CoArequires the same pathways of rTCA cycle (Figure 2, Routine 2). In the energy generationprocess of microbes with rAC pathway, acetate or methane is the end product. In additionto CO 2ﬁxation, the rAC pathway can also act in reverse, producing reducing equivalentsby oxidizing organic compounds such as acetate [ 42,43]. Moreover, the rAC pathwaycan also be used for the assimilation of various C1 compounds, including CO, formate,Catalysts 2022 ,12, 399 5 of 17formaldehyde, methanol, and even methyl groups of aromatic O-methyl ethers/esters inlignin, giving it potential for industrial application [21,41].2.4. The 3-Hydroxypropionate Bi-Cycle Producing Pyruvate from CO 2The 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) bi-cycle was discovered in the green non-sulfur bacte-riaChloroﬂexus aurantiacus [44]. In the ﬁrst cycle (Routine 3 and 4–2 in Figure 2), acetyl-CoAis carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by the biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase, andreduced to propionyl-CoA via 3-hydroxypropionate, which is one of the characteristic inter-mediates of this cycle [ 21,45]. Propionyl-CoA is further carboxylated to ( S)-methylmalonyl-CoA by the biotin-dependent propionyl CoA carboxylase, which is then rearranged andreduced to ( S)-malyl-CoA, which is another characteristic intermediate of the cycle. Cleav-age of ( S)-malyl-CoA yields an acetyl-CoA molecule and a glyoxylate molecule, and thelatter is further assimilated in the second cycle (Routine 3 and 4–1 in Figure 2). Glyoxylate iscondensed with propionyl-CoA and ﬁnally converted to citramalyl-CoA, which is cleavedinto pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, thus completing the second cycle and yielding one netpyruvate [46].Interestingly, the whole bicycle in C. aurantiacus involves 19 steps catalyzed by 13 en-zymes, some of which are multifunctional [ 46]. Reduction of 1 mole of CO 2to pyruvaterequires approximately 2.3 mol ATP in both 3HP bicycle and CBB cycle, while the activ-ity of biotin-dependent carboxylase of the 3HP bicycle is higher than that of Rubisco inCBB cycle [ 30]. The presence of the B 12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase of the3HP bicycle makes it less oxygen tolerant and prevents it from functioning in oxygenicphotoautotrophs [21].2.5. The HP/HB Cycle and DC/HB Cycle Are the Most Recently Discovered CO 2Fixation PathwayThe most recently discovered CO 2ﬁxation pathways are the 3-hydroxypropionate/3-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle and the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/HB)cycle. The two cycles share similarities in carbon acceptor regeneration, whereas the CO 2ﬁxation enzymes differ in their oxygen sensitivity [ 21,47,48]. In the HP/HB cycle, twomolecules of inorganic bicarbonate are ﬁxed by the oxygen-tolerant biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and subsequently converted to succinyl-CoA. The catalytic process is the same as that of 3HP bi-cycle (Figure 2, Routine 3), thoughnon-homologous enzymes are used in HP/HB cycle, suggesting the independent evolutionof related enzymes [ 29]. In the DC/HB cycle, the carboxylation reactions are catalyzedby the oxygen-sensitive PFOR and the biotin-dependent PEP carboxylase, followed by anincomplete rTCA cycle to produce succinyl-CoA (Figure 2, Routine 2). The intermediatesuccinyl-CoA in HP/HB cycle and DC/HB cycle is reduced to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA andfurther converted to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which is further oxidized to acetoacetyl-CoAand cleaved to acetyl-CoA. One net acetyl-CoA is produced from bicarbonate and CO 2inthe DC/HB cycle (Figure 2, Routine 5).Generally, the anaerobic carbon ﬁxation pathways are more energetically efﬁcientthan their aerobic counterparts by using ferredoxin-dependent carbon ﬁxation enzymes.For example, the DC/HB cycle requires approximately 1.6 mol ATP for the reductionof one mol CO 2to pyruvate, while the HP/HB cycle requires 3 mol ATP in the sameprocess [ 30]. Ferredoxin-dependent carboxylases are almost restricted in strictly anaerobicmicroorganisms because they contain iron-sulfur clusters which are highly sensitive tooxygen. In contrast, the CBB cycle, the 3HP bicycle, and the DC/HB cycle have a widerdistribution due to their oxygen tolerance.3. Enzymes Catalyzing CO 2to Organic CompoundsAmong the six natural biological carbon ﬁxation pathways, the conversion of inorganiccarbon to organic compounds mainly catalyzed by carboxylases is a key and rate-limitingstep of CO 2ﬁxation. These enzymes are present in all three domains of life and haveCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 6 of 17distinct cofactor requirements, catalytic mechanisms, substrate speciﬁcities, and catalytic ki-netics, and can be broadly clariﬁed into four groups, including Rubiscos, biotin-dependentcarboxylases, CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, and 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidore-ductases. In addition to these enzymes involved in natural carbon ﬁxation pathway, somealternative carboxylases implicated in artiﬁcial CO 2ﬁxation pathways will be introducedas well.3.1. Rubisco Is the Main Carboxylase for CO 2FixationRubisco, the enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of RuBP in CBB cycle, is oneof the most abundant enzymes on the earth [ 12]. Given its central role in CO 2ﬁxation,Rubisco has been intensively studied. As a carboxylase, it is widely recognized thatRubisco has low catalytic efﬁciency, with an average turnover number ( kcat,c) of 4.15 s 1(Table 1), compared with the kcatvalues of approximately 80 s 1of typical central metabolicenzymes [ 49]. In addition to the poor catalytic efﬁciency, Rubisco also catalyzes a non-productive oxidative side reaction, producing a toxic by-product 2-phosphoglycolate, whichmust be recycled through the phosphoglycolate salvage process mentioned above, thusleading to energy and carbon loss [ 24]. Furthermore, there exists a proposed tradeoffbetween substrate speciﬁcity and carboxylase activity [ 30,50]. In other words, Rubisco withhigher catalytic efﬁciency has less differentiation between CO 2and O 2, resulting in moreoxidation reactions and more energy input for the phosphoglycolate salvage process. MostRubiscos function in atmosphere with O 2-abundant and CO 2-scarce condition (21% O 2,0.04% CO 2, corresponding to 0.012 mM CO 2and 0.26 mM bicarbonate in water ( pH 7.4 ,20C)), the carboxylation efﬁciency of which further decreases [ 29]. For example, thenet carboxylation rate of Rubisco from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 is estimated to be approximately 4% of its apparent kcat,c(14 s 1) under atmosphericconditions [ 50]. To date, four forms of Rubiscos have been found in nature [ 51,52]. Forms Ito III are bona ﬁde Rubiscos that catalyze the carboxylation or oxygenation of RuBP , whileform IV Rubiscos termed Rubisco-like proteins (RLPs) are not involved in carbon ﬁxation.Form I Rubiscos are widely distributed in plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and proteobacteriathat rely on CBB cycle for carbon ﬁxation. Form I Rubiscos are composed of eight large(L) and eight small (S) subunits organized in an L 8S8structure, representing the moststructurally complex Rubiscos [ 51]. Small subunits were found to impact the conformationof the catalytic sites of large subunits dimers, and affect catalytic efﬁciency and substratespeciﬁcity [ 53]. A recently discovered clade of form I Rubiscos lacking small subunitsexhibits a relatively low kcat,c, and average K m,ccompared to form I enzymes [ 54]. Inaddition, certain form I Rubiscos are associated with CO 2concentrating mechanisms toimprove carbon ﬁxation efﬁciency (see below) [ 13]. Form II Rubiscos are mainly found inproteobacteria, archaea, and dinoﬂagellate algae, and also participate in CBB cycle [ 52].Unlike form I Rubiscos, form II Rubiscos only consist of large subunits that form an L 2or L 6complex, exhibiting a simpler structure [ 51,55]. As a result, form II Rubiscos generally havea higher catalytic rate ( kcat,cabout 7 s 1) and lower substrate speciﬁcity (K m,cabout 85 M)compared with those of form I Rubiscos (K m,cless than 20 M,kcat,cabout 3 s 1) [50].Form II Rubiscos typically exist in CO 2-rich and/or anaerobic environments [ 21]. Form IIIRubiscos are mainly found in archaea and participate in the ribonucleosides metabolismof pentose biphosphate pathway rather than the CBB cycle [ 52,56]. These archaea lack acomplete pentose phosphate pathway, and the ribose moieties of nucleosides are importantcarbon sources and are linked to central metabolism through carboxylation, followed bycleavage catalyzed by form III enzymes. Form IV Rubiscos are not real Rubiscos and donot catalyze the key reaction of carboxylation, but share sequence similarity with Rubiscosdespite lacking the conserved amino acid residues essential for carboxylation [ 13,51,57].The catalytic mechanism of RLPs is similar to that of Rubiscos via the formation of anenolate intermediate, suggesting a divergent evolution.Catalysts 2022 ,12, 399 7 of 17Table 1.

[ 60], and the averages of collected values with their ranges marked inparentheses are shown in the table.b: Data from only one paper.The diversity of Rubiscos with different subunits, structural complexity, and kineticparameters provides evidence for the evolution of Rubiscos [ 13]. It is believed that overa long period of evolution, Rubiscos have optimized substrate speciﬁcity and enzymaticactivity for the hosts’ niche [ 64]. Rubiscos are not independent enzymes and require aseries of proteins and enzymes to assist Rubiscos to function properly [ 65]. The naturalevolution process of Rubiscos provides important clues for improving Rubiscos and CBBcycle. Considering the central role in CO 2ﬁxation, there have been continuous efforts toimprove the catalytic performance of Rubiscos. The latest research progress in improvingthe efﬁciency of Rubiscos for carboxylation is summarized below.3.1.1. Screening and Recombinant Expression of Efﬁcient Rubiscos to EnhanceCO 2FixationThe most direct way to enhance the carboxylation of CBB cycle is to introduce highlyactive Rubiscos. For example, a Rubisco with higher catalytic efﬁciency ( kcat,cvalue about14 s 1) from Synechococcus species was introduced into the facultative chemoautotrophCupriavidus necator H16 in combination with the expression of endogenous GroES/ELchaperones, leading to an increased growth rate and biomass production of the engineeredstrain growing autotrophically [ 66]. Moreover, simultaneous overexpression of RcbXchaperone and hydrogenases resulted in a 93.4% increase in ﬁnal biomass and a 99.7%increase in polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. This result demonstrated that efﬁcientCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 8 of 17Rubisco, along with appropriate CO 2supply, can sustain rapid growth and carbon ﬁxationof autotrophic microorganisms.Since effective Rubiscos have a signiﬁcant effect on the growth rate of autotrophicmicroorganisms, screening Rubiscos with a high carboxylation rate is important to improveCO 2ﬁxation efﬁciency. Through systematical mining of genomic information, the mostcatalytically efﬁcient Rubisco was identiﬁed from Gallionella genus [ 55]. The Rubisco fromGallionella belongs to form II and has a kcat,cof 22 s 1and a relatively low afﬁnity for CO 2(Km,c= 276 M). Importantly, the Gallionella Rubisco displays as a homodimer, and thesimple structure may be beneﬁcial for heterologous expression. Another form II Rubiscowith a relatively high kcat,cof 16.4 s 1was discovered from the endosymbiont of a deep-seatubeworm Riftia pachyptila (RPE Rubisco) [ 58]. RPE Rubisco can be readily expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) without additional expression of chaperones and showed high carboxyla-tion efﬁciency. However, the low speciﬁcity for CO 2(Km,c= 172.4 M) prevented the RPERubisco from functioning properly under ambient atmospheric conditions. Collectively,these results suggested that more catalytically efﬁcient Rubiscos can be found in form IIRubiscos, although they are less speciﬁc and require an elevated CO 2concentration.3.1.2. Enhancing CO 2Fixation through Constructing Synthetic PhosphoglycolateSalvage PathwayThe oxygenation catalyzed by Rubisco produces by-products, which are usuallyrecycled by carbon loss photorespiration. It is an alternative strategy to recycle the by-products through non-carbon loss or carbon ﬁxation processes, by which CO 2ﬁxationefﬁciency of CBB cycle will be improved. The synthetic malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) cycle,relying on PEP carboxylase and malyl-CoA lyase to catalyze the cleavage of malyl-CoAto acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate, has been shown to enhance bicarbonate assimilation incyanobacteria by approximately two-fold [ 67]. The PEP carboxylase is one of the mostactive oxygen-tolerant carboxylases with speciﬁc activity up to 150 mol/min/mg, enablingfast carboxylation. Notably, glyoxylate is assimilated to C3 metabolites via tartronatesemialdehyde without net carbon loss in the MCG pathway. Meanwhile, in the MCGcycle, the C3 metabolites produced in the CBB cycle were converted to acetyl-CoA throughadditional carbon ﬁxation catalyzed by PEP carboxylase, which favors the generation ofacetyl-CoA from CBB cycle products.Through rational design, high-throughput microﬂuidics, and microplate screening,a novel glycolyl-CoA carboxylase with a kcat,c of 5.6 s 1was designed recently basedon the propionyl-CoA carboxylase from Methylorubrum extorquens [68]. The engineeredenzyme displays comparable catalytic properties to natural carboxylases in CO 2ﬁxation.By the catalysis of the engineered glycolyl-CoA synthetase, a tartronyl-CoA reductasefrom Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus , and a semialdehyde reductase, glyoxylate produced in theoxygenation of Rubisco can be converted to glycerate in the so-called tartronyl-CoA path-way [ 68]. In the synthetic pathway, an additional carboxylation is catalyzed by the en-gineered glycolyl-CoA carboxylase, thus connecting the by-products of CBB cycle withthe central carbon metabolism. Notably, when using the tartronyl-CoA pathway to recy-cle 2-phosphoglycolate, additional CO 2is ﬁxed rather than released, thus increasing thecarbon efﬁciency of 2-phosphoglycolate recovery from 75% to 150% and decreasing ATPconsumption by 21%. Moreover, the new pathway can be easily integrated into the CBBcycle for by-product recycling by the expression of three additional enzymes.3.1.3. Concentrating CO 2for Fixation by Enzyme EngineeringThe low concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere is not sufﬁcient to sustain rapidcarboxylation reactions of Rubiscos, especially those with less speciﬁcity. Carbon con-centration mechanisms (CCM) exist in many photo-/chemo-autotrophic microorganismsand plants, providing Rubiscos with CO 2-rich conditions that promote carboxylation andinhibit deleterious oxygenation of RuBP [ 69]. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) can generate CO 2in cell by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bicarbonate and are key to the autotrophic growthCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 9 of 17of microorganisms [ 70,71]. Similarly, a biogenic polyamine has been reported to captureatmospheric CO 2, forming carbamates and enriching CO 2for Rubiscos [ 72]. Furthermore,CO 2is concentrated through a biophysical CCM in Synechococcus species. A bicarbonateuptake system is coupled with a virus-like proteinaceous shell named carboxysome thatencapsulates Rubiscos, CAs, and other accessory proteins in a conﬁned microcompartment,which can exclude O 2and provide a CO 2-rich condition for Rubiscos to promote carboxy-lation and inhibit deleterious side reaction [ 73]. In addition, a biochemical CCM whichrelies on PEP carboxylase was found in C 4plants. PEP carboxylase catalyzes CO 2to malate,which is then oxidatively decarboxylated to concentrate CO 2for Rubiscos [ 74]. As a stablecarbon carrier, malate is suitable for long-distance transportation in multicellular plants. Itcan be speculated that transplantation of CCM from C 4to C 3plants such as rice is expectedto increase photosynthesis and grain yield [75,76].A functional carboxysome was recently constructed in a Rubisco-dependent E. colistrain. An engineered E. coli strain harboring form I Rubisco from Halothiobacillus neapoli-tanus and a prkgene from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was constructed, which cangrow autotrophically with 10% CO 2. The engineered E. coli was able to grow in ambientatmosphere when the CCM of H. neapolitanus was co-expressed [ 77]. It wasproved that thelarge subunit of Rubisco determines whether the Rubisco complex can be encapsulated intheH. neapolitanus carboxysome [ 78]. The CsoS2 protein wasproposed as a scaffold proteinthat acts as an interaction hub to encapsulate Rubisco of H. neapolitanus [79]. These resultssuggested that the interaction between Rubisco and scaffold protein is essential for the for-mation of functional carboxysome, and foreign Rubiscos might not be incorporated into thecarboxysome. Nonetheless, expression of a functional carboxysome in E. coli demonstratesthe potential to increase carboxylation efﬁciency in microorganisms without CCM.Increasing carboxylation capacity of Rubisco is key to improving photosynthesis, as itis the main entry for inorganic carbon into biosphere. In addition to strategies describedabove, the approaches such as direct evolution of Rubiscos, engineering large or smallsubunits of Rubisco, and changing expression and activation of Rubiscos can also improveCO 2ﬁxation [80].3.2. Biotin-Dependent CarboxylaseBiotin-dependent carboxylases are an ancient group of carboxylases that carboxylate avariety of substrates, including acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, pyruvate, and 2-oxoglutarate.These carboxylases play an important role in many essential metabolic pathways, includingsynthesis and degradation of fatty acids, degradation of certain amino acids, anaplerosis ofTCA cycle intermediates, gluconeogenesis, and autotrophic ﬁxation of CO 2[81]. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and 2-oxoglutaratecarboxylase are involved in four of the above discussed six CO 2ﬁxation pathways. Theseenzymes are composed of at least three functional components: biotin carboxyl carrierprotein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, and carboxyl transferase (CT) domain,and share a common catalytic mechanism to catalyze a two-step reaction [ 82]. The BCdomain catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of the biotin moiety of BCCP usingbicarbonate as a carbon source, followed by the transfer of the carboxyl group from thecarboxylated biotin at BCCP domain to the substrates determined by the CT domain.The biotin-dependent carboxylases have several advantages over Rubiscos. Firstly,biotin-dependent carboxylases exhibit a higher carboxylation rate than Rubiscos (Table 1).In addition, O 2does not interfere with the carboxylation by biotin-dependent carboxylases,and no oxygenation reaction would occur to impair the carboxylation efﬁciency. Moreover,considering substrate availability for biotin-dependent carboxylases, bicarbonate is moreavailable than CO 2in water, which is important for maintaining rapid carboxylation.Efﬁcient biotin-dependent carboxylases are promising for CO 2ﬁxation and productionof valuable products. Recently, simultaneous -carbon ﬁxation and succinate productionwas achieved in a recombinant E. coli through partially introducing 3HP bi-cycle [ 83]. Thesuccinate synthetic pathway is centered on acetyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoACatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 10 of 17carboxylase, the carboxyltransferase domain of which was mutated. Through directedevolution, the kcat,c value of the mutant enzyme is 13.3 s 1, and the overall catalyticefﬁciency is improved by 94 times based on kcat,c/Km,c. As a result, the highest productionof succinate reached 2.66 g/L with a CO 2ﬁxation rate of 0.94 mmol/L/h. However, thecarboxylation and the subsequent reduction step require a substantial amount of ATP andNADPH (one succinate from acetyl-CoA requires 3 ATP and 3 NADPH), which will restrictthe succinate yield [ 83,84]. In addition to the incomplete 3HP bi-cycle, pyruvate carboxylase,which plays an important role in anaplerotic generation of TCA intermediates, is also usedfor the production of dicarboxylate. Overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase from Rhizopusoryzae (RoPYC) was reported to enhance fumarate production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,and further enhancement was achieved by mutation P474N in RoPYC, resulting in a14% increase in PYC activity, and the ﬁnal fumaric acid yield reached 314.5 mg/L [ 85].Furthermore, the R458P mutation, which affects the allosteric and biotin carboxylationdomain in RoPYC, was reported to further increase fumaric acid production with a maximaltiter of 465.5 mg/L [86].A unique member of the biotin-dependent carboxylases family, 2-oxoglutarate car-boxylase (OGC), is predominantly identiﬁed in thermophilic bacteria from the rTCA cycle-dependent phylum Aquiﬁcae [ 36]. OGC catalyzes the carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate tooxalosuccinate, which is further reduced to isocitrate. However, this process is accom-plished by a single enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) in the conventional rTCA cycle.Interestingly, ICDH normally catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate in theoxidative TCA cycle. The reaction catalyzed by ICDH is characterized by reversibility andhigh speciﬁc activity. The recombinant ICDH from Chlorobium limicola showed a carboxyla-tion rate of 27.2 mol/min/mg at pH 7 and a decarboxylation rate of 160 mol/min/mg atpH 9 [ 87,88]. Therefore, the carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions can be controlledby changing pH, showing great application prospects in CO 2ﬁxation and storage process.3.3. Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA Synthase and the Application for BiosynthesisBifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS)is a key enzyme of the rAC pathway in acetogens and methanogens. These enzymestypically consist of two functional subunits, CODH and ACS, which are associated with aheterotetrameric complex [ 89]. The CODH subunit catalyzes the reversible reduction ofCO 2to CO, which is delivered to the active sites of ACS through an internal gas channel,preventing the leak of toxic CO and conﬁning it within CODH/ACS complex [ 89,90]. TheACS subunit catalyzes the reversible condensation of CO, a methyl moiety bound to acorrinoid iron-sulfur protein and coenzyme-A to acetyl-CoA. Some CODH/ACS variantshave been reported to contain unsealed channels for CO oxidation to generate reducingequivalents [ 91]. The reduction of CO 2is quite thermodynamically unfavorable, with a stan-dard redox potential as low as –520mV , requiring highly reduced ferredoxin as an electrondonor [29,92]. Therefore, this enzyme is mainly restricted to anaerobic environments.Acetogens, which depend on CODH/ACS and the rAC pathway for energy generationand biomass accumulation, produce acetate as the end product by using CO 2, H 2,andtoxic CO. The rAC pathway is one of the most energy-efﬁcient carbon ﬁxation pathways,and it is estimated that acetogens produce over 1013kg acetate annually, demonstratingits potential for biomanufacturing [ 41]. Various acetogens have been engineered for theproduction of valuable products including acetate, ethanol, butanol, 2,3-butanediol, andacetoin, from syngas composed of CO 2, H2, and CO [93–96].In a recent study, the tolerance of Eubacterium limosum ATCC 8486 to CO increasedup to 80% through adaptive evolution. The resulting strain displayed a faster growthrate and produced 42.28 mM/gCDW acetate under 40% CO condition [ 96]. Moreover,this strain was engineered to produce acetoin with a production of 19.6 mM/gCDW, a1.34–fold increase compared with the parental strain. An engineered E. limosum KIST612overexpressing CODH, ACS, and a coenzyme CooC2 exhibited a 3.1-fold increase in the rateof CO oxidation and a 1.4-fold increase in acetate production to 13.9 g/gCDW acetate [ 97].Catalysts 2022 ,12, 399 11 of 17The results suggest that acetogens are promising for biosynthesis by utilizing CO andCO 2[98].3.4. 2-Oxoacid:Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase and the Application in CO 2FixationThree of the six natural carbon ﬁxation pathways use enzymes from 2-oxoacid (2-ketoacid):ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OFOR) family to catalyze the reductive carboxylation.Two members of OFOR enzymes, PROF and OGOR, are involved in the carboxylation ofacetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA to pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate, respectively. Ferredoxinsare a group of small proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters with mid-potentials between 400 mv and  500 mV . They are required as the electron donor to drive the thermo-dynamically and energetically challenging reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA andsuccinyl-CoA, the standard redox potentials of which are about  500 mV [ 29,99]. OFORreactions are typically reversible and can operate in both ﬁxation and release of CO 2, mainlydepending on the redox potential of co-factors [100,101].Diverse oligomeric states of OFOR enzymes have been discovered, including homod-imers, heterotetramers, and heterohexamers [ 102,103]. OFOR enzymes share a similardomain arrangement despite different domains constitution and contain up to seven dif-ferent domains, several of which are conserved for substrate and cofactor binding, andhousing iron-sulfur cluster(s) for electron transfer [ 104]. Notably, most OFOR enzymesare highly oxygen-sensitive and rapidly and irreversibly inactivated upon exposure toair, constraining the corresponding autotrophic pathways in a strictly anaerobic or mi-croaerobic environment [ 30]. In addition, to drive the thermodynamically and energeticallychallenging process, ferredoxins need to be kept highly reduced by sodium (or proton)motive force driven oxidoreductases or electron bifurcation mechanism [29,99].The oxygen-tolerant PFOR from the extremophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocal-darius was proposed to catalyze the decarboxylation of pyruvate. Interestingly, the PROFexhibited carboxylase activity in vitro when coupled with low-potential ferredoxins ormethylviologen (with standard redox potentials of less than  500 mV and  446 mV ,respectively) as electron donors [ 104]. Besides using ferredoxin or methylviologen as elec-tron donors, cadmium sulﬁde nanorods were reported to act as electron donors to drivethe reductive carboxylation of succinyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate catalyzed by OGOR fromMagnetococcus marinus MC-1 [ 62]. Notably, cadmium sulﬁde nanorods can be reducedby photo-excitation and exhibited a standard redox potential of  700 mV . Generally,OFOR from the three anaerobic carbon ﬁxation pathways, rTCA, rAcCoA, and DC/HB,require fully reduced ferredoxin to catalyze reductive carboxylation. Even though reducedferredoxin is difﬁcult to achieve outside native cells, artiﬁcial electron donors can be usedas an alternative in vitro, expanding their application for biosynthesis.3.5. Artiﬁcial Pathways for CO 2Fixation and BiosynthesisIn addition to natural carbon ﬁxation pathways, several artiﬁcial carbon pathwayshave been designed, which are proposed to be energetically and/or kinetically superior totheir natural counterparts theoretically [105]. Schwander et al. constructed a CO 2ﬁxationpathway named “crotonyl-CoA/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA” (CETCH) cycle,and the in vitro CO 2ﬁxation rate is comparable to that of CBB cycle [ 106]. The cycle wasdesigned based on an efﬁcient crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, a member of enoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase family, with the highest CO 2ﬁxation rate of 130 mol/min/mg,which is approximately 37 times of Rubisco. Compared with the natural cycles, the CETCHcycle is the most energy-efﬁcient aerobic carbon ﬁxation pathway with only one ATPinput for glyoxylate production. However, its direct product glyoxylate is not a centralmetabolite, and can be coupled with the tartronyl-CoA pathway to improve CO 2ﬁxationefﬁciency [ 68]. Recently, the CETCH cycle was coupled with an in vitro enzyme cascadeto convert CO 2to terpenes and polyketides, showing its potential for CO 2ﬁxation andproduction of value-added products [ 107]. Since the CETCH cycle consists of 12 enzymaticreactions which are not involved in central carbon metabolism, in vivo functional CETCHCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 12 of 17by metabolic engineering has not been reported. Taken together, the CETCH, MCG, andtartronyl-CoA pathways have demonstrated the potential of artiﬁcial pathways for CO 2ﬁxation both in vitro and in vivo , which will facilitate CO 2ﬁxation and transformation tovalue-added products.In addition to these ingenious and intricate artiﬁcial carbon ﬁxation pathways, somerelatively simple carbon ﬁxation pathways have been constructed in vitro with immobi-lized enzymes [ 10]. The enzymatic carbon dioxide ﬁxation system showed potential forbiotransformation of CO 2. For instance, amine-functionalized metal-organic frameworkswere used to adsorb CO 2and immobilize the enzyme cascade consisting of carbonic an-hydrase, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase for the reductionof CO 2to formate, achieving 13.1-times increase of ﬁnal production compared with freeenzyme systems [ 108]. The enzymatic cascade of FDH, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), andformaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) was used to convert CO 2to methanol [ 10]. Theimmobilized FDH-FalDH-ADH cascade and in situ separation by pervaporation membranewere combined for improving the transformation of CO 2to methanol. [ 109]. In some cases,immobilization of enzymes displayed enhanced performance. For example, the dimericform II Rubisco exhibits higher stability against proteolysis, and the larger form I Rubiscoexhibits improved CO 2selectivity after immobilization [110].4. Conclusions and ProspectsBiological carbon ﬁxation and converting CO 2into value-added bioproducts is apromising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, the low activity of CO 2ﬁxation enzymes hinders the further improvement of carbon ﬁxation efﬁciency and itsapplication (Table 1). It has been suggested that the enzyme activity and speciﬁcity ofRubisco have reached Pareto optimality in the long-term evolution, so the activity ofsome carboxylases, including Rubisco, could not be further enhanced through enzymeengineering [ 13,64,111]. Screening natural carboxylases based on omics analysis or denovo designing non-natural counterparts through enzyme engineering are promisingapproaches [ 55,68,83]. For example, a novel form II Rubisco with a kcat,cof 22 s 1wasrecently reported, promising to improve CO 2ﬁxation capacity of CBB cycle. In addition toimproving enzyme activity, artiﬁcial CO 2ﬁxation pathways have been designed to improvethe energetic efﬁciency and oxygen tolerance. Some artiﬁcial carbon ﬁxation pathways, suchas the MCG pathway and CETCH cycle, have been demonstrated to improve CO 2ﬁxationboth in vivo and in vitro . Encouragingly, the heterotrophs of E. coli and Pichia pastoris havebeen transformed to autotrophs, providing a new idea for CO 2ﬁxation [112,113].Another key factor affecting carbon bioﬁxation efﬁciency is CO 2concentration. Itis generally accepted that a higher CO 2concentration enhances photosynthetic assimila-tion [ 114]. A low concentration of atmospheric CO 2cannot support rapid carboxylation, sonatural autotrophs have evolved CCMs to concentrate CO 2for Rubiscos [ 69]. It has beenproved that constructing CCM such as carboxysomes in microorganisms through metabolicengineering is effective for CO 2concentrating. However, the assembly of carboxysomescontaining non-native contents, such as the fast form II Rubisco, needs to be further stud-ied [ 16,73,77]. Fermentation of autotrophic microorganisms in bioreactors with improvedCO 2concentrations can also promote the catalytic performance of Rubisco [16].The bioﬁxation and reduction of CO 2require a substantial amount of NAD(P)H andATP , which is primarily provided by solar energy in nature. However, the supply ofNAD(P)H and ATP is expensive and challenging, especially in the case of in vitro catalysiswith immobilized enzyme cascades. Interdisciplinary approaches such as photochemistryand bioelectrochemistry can provide solutions for NAD(P)H and ATP generation usingsunlight and electricity. For example, a ferredoxin NADP+reductase and a crotonyl-CoAcarboxylase/reductase were co-immobilized within a redox-active hydrogel and were cou-pled with electrodes for NADPH regeneration which was used to drive the carboxylationreaction [ 115]. Furthermore, a chloroplast mimic was constructed to encapsulate photosyn-thetic membranes and CETCH enzyme cascades, and the ATP and NAD(P)H regeneratedCatalysts 2022 ,12, 399 13 of 17from sunlight in the system were used for carboxylation [ 116]. Remarkable progress hasbeen made in CO 2bioﬁxation and value-added products synthesis. The rapid developmentof synthetic biology has provided novel strategies for improving CO 2bioﬁxation, such asthe development of more efﬁcient carboxylases and artiﬁcial CO 2pathways. It is expectedthat more efﬁcient pathways and enzymes for CO 2bioﬁxation and conversion can bedeveloped through metabolic and enzyme engineering.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, X.P . and Y.H.; investigation, X.P . and Y.H.; writin g—o riginaldraft preparation, X.P .; writing—review and editing, Y.H.; funding acquisition, Y.H.
