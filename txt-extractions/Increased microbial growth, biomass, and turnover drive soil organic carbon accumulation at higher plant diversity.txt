Soil	microorganisms	 are	central	to	the	conversion	of	plant	organic	matter	into	SOC,	yet	the	relationship	between	plant	diversity,	soil	microbial	growth,	turnover	as	well	as	carbon	use	efficiency	(CUE)	and	SOC	accumulation	is	unknown.	As	heterotrophic	 soil	microbes	are	primarily	carbon	limited,	it	is	important	to	understand	how	they	respond	to	increased	plant‐derived	 carbon	inputs	at	higher	plant	species	richness	(PSR).	We	used	the	long‐term	grassland	biodiversity	ex‐periment	in	Jena,	Germany,	to	examine	how	microbial	physiology	responds	to	changes	in	plant	diversity	and	how	this	affects	SOC	content.	The	Jena	Experiment	considers	dif‐ferent	numbers	of	species	(1–60),	functional	groups	(1–4)	as	well	as	functional	identity	(small	herbs,	tall	herbs,	grasses,	and	legumes).	We	found	that	PSR	accelerated	microbial	growth	and	turnover	and	increased	microbial	biomass	and	necromass.	PSR	also	accel‐erated	microbial	respiration,	but	this	effect	was	less	strong	than	for	microbial	growth.	In	contrast,	PSR	did	not	affect	microbial	CUE	or	biomass‐specific	 respiration.	Structural	equation	models	revealed	that	PSR	had	direct	positive	effects	on	root	biomass,	and	thereby	on	microbial	growth	and	microbial	biomass	carbon.	Finally,	PSR	increased	SOC	content	via	its	positive	influence	on	microbial	biomass	carbon.	We	suggest	that	PSR	fa‐vors	faster	rates	of	microbial	growth	and	turnover,	likely	due	to	greater	plant	productivity,	resulting	in	higher	amounts	of	microbial	biomass	and	necromass	that	translate	into	the	observed	increase	in	SOC.	We	thus	identify	the	microbial	mechanism	linking	species‐rich	plant	communities	to	a	carbon	cycle	process	of 	importance	to	Earth's	climate	system.KEYWORDSmicrobial	activity,	microbial	carbon	use	efficiency,	microbial	necromass,	microbial	turnover,	plant	diversity,	soil	organic	carbon1 |  INTRODUCTIONBiodiversity	loss	through	anthropogenic 	changes	in	the	global	environment	is	threatening	ecosystem	functions	and	ser‐vices.	Grassland	ecosystems	are	predicted	to	experience	most	biodiversity	losses	as	a	consequence	 of	land‐use	change,	such	as	the	conversion	of	grasslands	into	croplands	(Sala	et	al.,	2000)	and	recent	studies	revealed	concomitant	 negative	impacts	on	soil	carbon	cycling	(Chen	&	Chen,	2019;	Tang	et	al.,	2019).	Terrestrial	ecosystems	store	most	organic	carbon	in	soils	where	it	has	the	670  |    PROMMER Et al.potential	to	become	stable	soil	carbon	and	thus	can	be	seques‐tered	for	longer	time	periods.Globally,	terrestrial	carbon	storage	is	dominated	by	forests	(39%	of	the	total	terrestrial	organic	carbon	stored	in	forest	soils	and	veg‐etation),	but	grasslands	also	contribute	substantially	 (34%	of	the	total	terrestrial	carbon)	as	they	cover	a	large	part	of	the	world’s	landmass,	with	~53	×	106	km2	grassland	area	versus	~29	×	106	km2 forest	area	(White,	Murray,	&	Rohweder,	2000).	Soil	organic	carbon	(SOC)	represents	the	largest	carbon	reservoir	in	global	grasslands,	with	up	to	98%	carbon	stored	belowground	 (Hungate	et	al.,	1997).	As	such,	understanding 	the	mechanisms	that	sustain	grassland	SOC	storage	is	of	utmost	importance	for	estimating	the	potential	of	grasslands	to	reduce	atmospheric	carbon	dioxide	(CO2)	concen‐trations	and	mitigate	feedbacks	from	the	biosphere	to	the	climate	system.Plant	diversity	is	increasingly	recognized	to	be	central	to	grass‐land	SOC	storage,	with	observations	 from	biodiversity	experiments	demonstrating	 clear	links	between	plant	diversity,	primary	produc‐tivity,	and	ecosystem	carbon	cycling	(Cong	et	al.,	2014;	De	Deyn	et	al.,	2011;	Fornara	&	Tilman,	2008;	Lange	et	al.,	2015;	Naeem,	Thompson,	Lawler,	Lawton,	&	Woodfin,	1994).Hereafter,	we	use	plant	diversity	as	a	term	to	describe	both	plant	species	number	and	functional	composition,	and	specify	when	referring	specifically	to	plant	species	richness	(PSR),	func‐tional	group	richness,	or	functional	group	identity.	Higher	abo‐veground	plant	productivity	as	a	consequence 	of	increased	plant	diversity	is	usually	also	accompanied	 by	increased	belowground 	plant	biomass	production,	although	the	latter	may	occur	only	after	a	delay	(Cong	et	al.,	2014;	Fornara	&	Tilman,	2008;	Ravenek	et	al.,	2014).	However,	while	there	is	evidence	that	increasing	plant	di‐versity	translates	into	greater	aboveground	 primary	productivity	(Roscher	et	al.,	2005;	Spehn	et	al.,	2005;	Tilman,	Wedin,	&	Knops,	1996),	few	studies	have	investigated	the	mechanisms	linking	plant	diversity	and	plant	productivity	with	SOC	dynamics.	This	is	partly	due	to	the	paucity	of	long‐term	biodiversity	experiments	that	allow	for	exploration	of	typically	slow	changes	in	SOC	storage.	Indeed,	we	are	aware	of	only	four	of	such	grassland	biodiversity	experi‐ments	globally.	Studies	from	these	experiments	have	consistently	shown	positive	effects	of	plant	diversity	on	SOC	storage,	and	have	largely	ascribed	this	to	increased	rhizosphere	carbon	inputs	(Cong	et	al.,	2014;	De	Deyn	et	al.,	2011;	Fornara	&	Tilman,	2008;	Lange	 et	al.,	2015;	Steinbeiss,	Beßler,	et	al.,	2008).	Yet,	how	this	mecha‐nism	is	linked	to	microbial	carbon	processing	has	rarely	been	em‐pirically	tested,	limiting	our	ability	to	implement	microbial	carbon	dynamics	in	climate‐carbon 	models	and	dynamic	global	vegetation	models	(Crowther	et	al.,	2016).The	build‐up	of	organic	carbon	ultimately	depends	on	the	bal‐ance	between	carbon	inputs	and	outputs	from	the	system,	which	is	determined	by	plant	biomass	production,	and	SOC	formation	and	decomposition,	 and	is	therefore,	to	a	high	degree,	governed	by	the	activity	of	soil	microbes.	Most	plant‐derived	 carbon	is	taken	up	by	soil	microbes	and	used	to	either	generate	energy	(and	thus	CO2)	or	generate	biomass.	After	death,	microbial	necromass	becomes	part	of	the	nonliving	soil	organic	matter	pool	(Miltner,	Bombach,	Schmidt‐Brucken,	&	Kastner,	2012).	Estimates	of	the	proportion	of	microbi‐ally	derived	carbon	transformed	into	nonliving	SOC	range	from	40%	(Kindler,	Miltner,	Richnow,	&	Kastner,	2006)	to	80%	(Liang	&	Balser,	2011),	but	the	role	of	necromass	carbon	for	SOC	build‐up	is	not	well	tested	in	the	context	of	changing	PSR.	It	is,	therefore,	important	to	distinguish	between	microbial	catabolic	and	anabolic	pathways	in	order	to	disentangle	their	specific	contributions	to	SOC	accumula‐tion.	One	way	to	synthesize	microbial	physiology	is	the	widely	used	metric	of	microbial	carbon	use	efficiency	(CUE),	which	describes	the	efficiency	by	which	microbes	convert	organic	carbon	into	growth	(Manzoni,	Taylor,	Richter,	Porporato,	&	Agren,	2012;	Sinsabaugh,	Manzoni,	Moorhead,	&	Richter,	2013).	When	incorporated	 into	mi‐crobial	biomass,	carbon	has	the	potential	to	become	part	of	the	soil	organic	matter	pool	and	can	reside	in	soils	for	longer	time	periods.	Accordingly,	a	high	microbial	CUE	favors	SOC	storage,	although	other	physiological	 characteristics	 of	the	soil	microbial	community	like	microbial	growth	and	turnover	may	equally	promote	SOC	ac‐cumulation.	Moreover,	microbial	CUE	was	shown	to	scale	positively	with	microbial	growth	(Zheng	et	al.,	2019)	and	to	be	maximized	at	highest	growth	rates	(Manzoni	et	al.,	2017).	Nevertheless,	 despite	the	general	importance	of	these	microbial	processes	to	SOC	accu‐mulation,	their	relationships	with	plant	diversity	are	almost	entirely	unknown.In	this	study,	we	explicitly	addressed	the	question	of	how	soil	microbial	physiology	responds	to	increasing	plant	diversity.	PSR,	functional	group	richness,	and	functional	composition	have	all	been	shown	to	promote	aboveground 	and	belowground 	plant	productiv‐ity	in	the	Jena	Experiment	(Marquard	et	al.,	2009;	Ravenek	et	al.,	2014).	However,	increases	in	root	biomass	were	more	strongly	de‐termined	by	PSR	than	by	functional	group	richness	(Ravenek	et	al.,	2014)	and	further	led	to	greater	rhizosphere	carbon	inputs	in	high‐diversity	plant	communities	 (Chen	et	al.,	2017;	Lange	et	al.,	2015).	We	here	focus	on	how	microbial	activity	impacts	the	transforma‐tion	of	detrital	organic	material	to	unravel	the	causal	physiological	pathways	through	which	soil	microbes	promote	SOC	accumulation 	(Figure	1).	Specifically,	we	used	the	long‐term	biodiversity	exper‐iment	in	Jena	(Roscher	et	al.,	2004)	to	measure	gross	rates	of	mi‐crobial	community	growth,	turnover,	and	CUE	in	grassland	plots	differing	in	plant	diversity.	Plant	diversity	was	considered	in	three	metrics:	PSR	(1,	2,	4,	8,	16,	and	60	plant	species);	plant	functional	group	richness	(one,	two,	three,	and	four	plant	functional	groups,	composed	of	grasses,	legumes,	small	herbs,	and	tall	herbs);	and	plant	functional	group	identity	(the	presence/absence 	of	a	certain	plant	functional	group).	As	depicted	in	Figure	1,	we	hypothesized 	(a)	that	microbial	growth	and	turnover	rates	would	increase	with	increasing	PSR,	resulting	in	higher	amounts	of	microbial	biomass	and	necromass	that	in	turn	lead	to	SOC	accumulation;	 and	(b)	that	higher	PSR	would	increase	microbial	growth	more	than	respiration,	correspondingly 	promoting	microbial	CUE	and	leading	to	increased	SOC	storage. 13652486, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14777 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The	field	site	is	located	on	an	upland	area	of	the	floodplain	of	the	River	Saale,	with	a	mean	annual	temperature	of	9.1°C	and	mean	an‐nual	precipitation	 of	610	mm	(1980–2010)	(Hoffmann,	Bivour,	Früh,	Koßmann,	&	Voß,	2014).	The	experiment	was	created	in	2002	on	a	former	arable	field	that	had	been	under	continuous	cropland	man‐agement	for	more	than	40	years.	The	soil	was	classified	as	Eutric	Fluvisol	(FAO‐UNESCO,	 1997)	and	changes	markedly	in	texture	from	sandy	loam	to	silty	clay	with	increasing	distance	from	the	river	(Steinbeiss,	Temperton,	&	Gleixner,	2008).	The	experimental	design	is	described	in	detail	by	Roscher	et	al.	(2004).	Briefly,	the	study	site	consists	of	82	plots	(20	m	×	20	m)	that	differ	in	levels	of	sown	PSR	(1,	2,	4,	8,	16,	60	species)	and	plant	functional	group	richness	(one,	two,	three,	four	functional	groups	of	grasses,	small	herbs,	tall	herbs,	legumes).	The	plots	are	arranged	in	a	randomized	block	design	with	four	blocks	arranged	to	account	for	edaphic	variations	that	arise	as	a	consequence	of	the	changing	soil	texture	mentioned	above.	Each	of	the	blocks	represents	a	subset	of	the	complete	design	and	covers	the	whole	range	of	PSR	and	plant	functional	group	richness,	including	one	bare	plot	with	no	vegetation.	The	grassland	plants	were	chosen	from	a	60‐species	pool,	representing	species	typical	for	seminatural,	species‐rich	mesophilic	Molinio‐Arrhenatheretea 	meadows	(Ellenberg	&	Leuschner,	2010).	The	management	 of	the	field	site	is	adapted	to	extensive	hay	meadows,	with	two	mowings	per	year	and	no	fertilizer	application.	In	order	to	ensure	that	only	target	species	develop,	all	plots	are	weeded	by	hand	three	times	per	year.2.2 | Soil sampling and analysesSoil	samples	were	taken	in	September	2015	from	all	plots	(N = 85; one	monoculture	plot	was	abandoned	because	of	poor	plant	perfor‐mance).	Bare	plots	were	excluded	from	later	data	evaluations	as	we	were	primarily	interested	in	plant	diversity	effects	and	not	in	differ‐ences	between	bare	and	vegetated	plots,	leaving	81	plots	for	further	analysis.	Five	soil	cores	(diameter	2.5	cm)	were	taken	from	each	plot	up	to	a	depth	of	10	cm,	pooled	to	make	one	composite	sample	and	sieved	to	2	mm.	Fine	roots	(<2	mm)	were	removed	by	hand,	washed,	dried	at	65°C	for	24	hr,	and	weighed.	Fresh	sieved	soil	samples	were	kept	at	15°C	(in	situ	soil	temperature)	 for	3	days	prior	to	analyses.	Soil	samples	were	dried	at	105°C	for	24	hr	to	determine	gravimetric	soil	water	content.	Dried	samples	were	then	ground	with	a	ball	mill	(MM2000)	and	analyzed	for	total	carbon	and	nitrogen	content	by	an	elemental	analyzer	(EA	1110;	CE	Instruments).	 SOC	content	was	determined	from	samples	pretreated	with	2	M	HCl	prior	to	drying	and	grinding	to	remove	carbonates.	For	determination	 of	root	car‐bon	content	and	root	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratios,	fine	root	dry	mass	was	treated	identically	to	the	dried	soil	samples,	that	is,	ground	and	measured	by	an	elemental	analyzer.	We	calculated	root	carbon	mass	per	area	(in	g	root	C/m2)	that	hereafter	is	referred	to	as	root	biomass	carbon.	Given	the	focus	here	on	soil	carbon	dynamics,	all	important	carbon	pools	and	processes	are	given	as	carbon	equivalents.Soil	extractable	carbon	and	nitrogen	pools	were	determined	by	extraction	of	4	g	fresh	soil	with	30	ml	1	M	KCl,	shaken	for	30	min	and	filtered	through	ash‐free	cellulose	filters.	To	determine	total	dis‐solved	organic	carbon,	1	M	KCl	soil	extracts	were	analyzed	using	a	TOC/TN	analyzer	(Shimadzu	TOC‐VCPH	with	TNM‐1	and	ASI	Autosampler; 	Shimadzu).	Microbial	biomass	carbon	content	(here‐after	used	synonymously 	with	microbial	biomass)	was	determined	using	the	chloroform	fumigation	extraction	(CFE)	method	(Schinner,	Öhlinger,	Kandeler,	&	Margesin,	1996).	The	fumigation	was	per‐formed	in	parallel	to	18O‐water	incubation	and	DNA	extraction	of	soil	samples	for	accurate	determination	 of	the	factor	converting	microbial	DNA	into	microbial	biomass	(fDNA,	see	below).

Soil	DNA	content	and	mi‐crobial	biomass	carbon	measured	by	CFE	were	demonstrated	 to	be	strongly	positively	correlated	(Marstorp,	Guan,	&	Gong,	2000;	Widmer,	Rasche,	Hartmann,	&	Fliessbach,	2006),	indicating	that	these	two	methods	are	equivalent	to	estimating	soil	microbial	bio‐mass.	Soil	microbial	necromass	was	quantified	by	acid	hydrolysis	of	soils	(50	mg)	with	4	M	methane	sulfonic	acid	(2	ml)	and	high‐  performance	anion‐exchange 	chromatography 	with	pulsed	ampero‐metric	detection	(Dionex	ICS	3000),	following	separation	of	amino	acids	and	amino	sugars	on	a	PA20	column.	The	HPLC	gradient	used	was	adapted	from	Martens	and	Loeffelmann	(2003).	Calculation	of	bacterial	and	fungal	necromass	followed	the	protocol	proposed	by	Appuhn	and	Joergensen	(2006).	In	brief,	given	a	molar	ratio	of	muramic	acid	and	glucosamine	of	1:1	in	bacterial	cell	walls,	we	sub‐tracted	bacterial	glucosamine	from	total	glucosamine	yielding	fungal	glucosamine.	To	obtain	bacterial	and	fungal	necromass	carbon,	bac‐terial‐borne	muramic	acid	was	multiplied	with	an	average	conversion	factor	of	45	and	fungal	glucosamine	was	multiplied	by	9	(Appuhn	&	Joergensen,	2006).Gross	rates	of	growth	and	turnover	of	microbial	biomass,	as	well	as	microbial	CUE,	were	determined	based	on	the	incorporation	 of	iso‐topically	labeled	oxygen	(18O)	from	18O‐labeled	water	into	microbial	genomic	DNA	(double‐stranded	 DNA,	dsDNA)	and	concurrent	mea‐surements	of	basal	respiration	(Spohn,	Klaus,	Wanek,	&	Richter,	2016;	Walker	et	al.,	2018;	Zheng	et	al.,	2019).	Specifically,	soil	samples	were	incubated	with	18O‐labeled	water	(97	at%	18O;	Campro	Scientific)	for	24	hr	and	thereafter	the	18O	abundance	and	the	total	O	content	of	the	DNA	were	measured	using	a	thermochemical	 elemental	analyzer	(TC/EA	Thermo	Fisher)	coupled	with	an	IRMS	(Delta	V	Advantage;	Thermo	Fisher).	In	parallel,	soil	samples	amended	with	the	same	vol‐ume	of	nonlabeled	water	were	incubated	for	the	same	time	period	to	serve	as	natural	18O	abundance	(NA)	controls.	DNA	of	18O‐labeled	and	‐unlabeled	samples	was	extracted	(FastDNA™	SPIN	Kit	for	Soil;	MP	Biomedicals)	and	its	concentration	 was	determined	fluorimetrically 	(Sandaa,	Enger,	&	Torsvik,	1998)	using	a	PicoGreen	assay	(Quant‐iT™	PicoGreen®	dsDNA	Reagent;	Life	Technologies).	 After	24	hr	of	incuba‐tion,	gas	samples	were	taken	from	each	sample	and	the	CO2 concen‐trations	measured	by	a	Gas	GC	(Trace	GC	Ultra;	Thermo	Fischer)	to	determine	microbial	respiration.where t	(hr)	is	the	incubation	time,	 p	is	the	atmosphere	pressure	(kPa),	n	is	the	molecular	mass	of	the	element	C	(12.01	g/mol),	R	is	the	ideal	gas	constant	(8.314	J	mol	−1	K−1),	T	is	the	absolute	temperature	of	the	gas	(295.15	K),	Vhs	is	the	volume	(L)	of	the	head	space	vials,	and	DCO2	(ppm)	is	the	increase	in	CO2	concentration 	produced	during	the	24	hr	incubation	period.Newly	formed	DNA	was	quantified	by	multiplying	sample	O	con‐tent	by	the	18O	excess	of	DNA	relative	to	the	natural	abundance	of	18O	in	DNA	measured	in	control	samples.	A	DNA‐oxygen	 content	of	31.21%	was	applied	to	estimate	the	dsDNA	formed	by	microbial	growth	during	the	incubation	period.Ototal	is	the	total	O	content	(µg)	of	the	dried	DNA	extract,		at%excess	is	the	at%	excess	18O	of	the	labeled	sample	compared	to	the	mean	at%	18O	of	NA	samples,	and	31.21%	is	the	DNA‐oxygen	content,	and	at%label	is	the	18O	enrichment	of	soil	water.Then,	for	each	sample,	a	conversion	factor	(fDNA)	was	applied	to	translate	the	concentration 	of	DNA	produced	during	the	incubation	period	into	microbial	biomass	carbon	production	over	24	hr.	The	conversion	factor	was	obtained	by	dividing	the	microbial	biomass	carbon	content	of	each	sample	by	its	corresponding	 DNA	content	(both	in	µg/g	soil	DW).where	DW	is	the	dry	mass	of	soil	in	grams,	and	 t	is	the	incubation	time	in	hours.The	amount	of	carbon	taken	up	by	microbial	biomass	was	calcu‐lated	as	the	sum	of	microbial	growth	and	respiration.We	also	expressed	respiration,	growth,	and	carbon	uptake	on	a	micro‐bial	biomass	basis	to	obtain	biomass‐specific	 respiration,	growth,	and	carbon	uptake.	Under	steady‐state	conditions	where	microbial	biomass	does	not	change	(e.g.,	over	24	hr),	biomass‐specific	 growth	is	equivalent	to	microbial	biomass	turnover	rate,	and	its	inverse	corresponds	to	mi‐crobial	biomass	turnover	time.	Finally,	microbial	CUE	was	calculated	by	the	following	equation	(Manzoni	et	al.,	2012;	Sinsabaugh	et	al.,	2013):where	Cgrowth	is	the	carbon	allocated	to	microbial	biomass	produc‐tion,	that	is,	microbial	growth,	and	Crespiration	is	the	organic	carbon	respired	to	CO2.2.3 | StatisticsStatistical	analyses	were	performed	using	the	software	R	version	3.1.3	(R	Core	Team,	2015).

We	added	fixed	fac‐tors	PSR	(log‐transformed) 	and	plant	functional	group	richness	sequentially,	 with	plant	functional	group	identity	effects	tested	in	models	already	containing	block,	PSR	and	plant	functional	group	richness.	Significance	was	determined	using	likelihood	ratio	tests	(L)	including	and	excluding	explanatory	terms.	We	explored	asso‐ciations	between	response	variables	using	a	Pearson	correlation	matrix	with	the	package	 Hmisc	(Harrell	et	al.,	2016).	Block	effects	were	corrected	prior	to	correlation	analysis,	by	first	calculating	block	means	and	the	grand	mean	across	all	blocks.	The	difference	in	block	mean	to	the	grand	mean	was	then	added	to	each	individ‐ual	value	within	the	block.By	combining	correlation	and	LMM	results	with	pre‐existing	knowledge	of	the	experiment,	we	established	a	conceptual	model	of	PSR	effects	on	SOC	to	be	tested	(Figure	1).	We	used	path	anal‐ysis	to	combine	multiple	linear	models	into	a	single	causal	net‐work	in	which	variables	could	act	as	both	predictors	and	responses	(Lefcheck,	2016;	Shipley,	2009).	For	this	analysis,	we	used	directed	acyclic/piecewise	 SEM	using	the	packages	 nlme  and piecewiseSEM  (Lefcheck,	2016;	Pinheiro	et	al.,	2017).	The	piecewise	SEM	ap‐proach	is	more	flexible	than	the	traditional	variance–covariance 	SEM	as	it	enables	fitting	of	LMMs	to	a	range	of	distributions. 	The	overall	model	fit	was	assessed	using	Shipley's	test	of	directed	sep‐aration,	for	which	a	good	model	fit	is	obtained	when	Fisher's	C	is	statistically	nonsignificant 	(p	>	.05)	(Shipley,	2009).	Furthermore, 	as	the	 piecewiseSEM 	package	reports	missing	or	incomplete	path‐ways,	such	pathways	were	tested	in	parallel	models	and	included	in	the	model	if	the	respective	pathway	was	statistically	significant	(p	<	.05)	and	mechanistically 	meaningful.	Nonsignificant 	pathways	(if	missing	or	not)	were	generally	excluded.	Models	constructed	in 	this	manner	differ	only	in	the	linkage	of	pathways	but	contain	the	same	dataset	and	thus	can	be	compared	using	the	Akaike	infor‐mation	criterion	(AIC)	and	the	AICc	(for	small	sample	sizes).	Path	coefficients	were	standardized 	(β‐coefficients) 	to	enable	compari‐sons	across	responses	of	varying	units	and	finally	conditional	(R2c,	all	factors)	and	marginal	(R2m,	fixed	factors	only)	coefficients	of	determination	were	reported	for	each	LMM.As	our	conceptual	model	did	not	produce	a	SEM	with	an	ade‐quate	fit,	we	tested	other	related	model	structures	as	follows.	First,	we	excluded	microbial	CUE,	which	is	fully	numerically	derived	from	microbial	growth	and	respiration,	did	not	significantly	explain	the	target	variables	in	the	SEM	and	did	not	respond	to	PSR	in	the	LMM.	Second,	although	microbial	turnover	increased	with	PSR	in	the	LMM	and	may	partially	explain	increases	in	microbial	necromass	and	SOC,	SEMs	including	microbial	biomass	and	microbial	turnover	did	not	work	out	and	we,	therefore,	omitted	microbial	turnover	in	the	final	SEM.	Third,	we	removed	bacterial	necromass	since	it	did	not	respond	to	changes	in	either	PSR	or	functional	group	richness	(see	LMM	results).	Finally,	although	microbial	(fungal)	necromass	posi‐tively	responded	to	PSR	in	the	LMM	it	was	not	significantly	linked	to	SOC	storage	in	SEM	models	containing	microbial	biomass	and	was,	therefore,	omitted	from	the	final	SEM	(but	see	Figure	S3).	The	strong	link	between	microbial	biomass	and	SOC	storage,	therefore,	masked	any	other	possible	and	causally	linked	intermediate	 drivers	such	as	microbial	turnover	and	necromass.	In	an	additional	attempt	we,	therefore,	ran	SEM	structures	that	excluded	microbial	biomass	but	included	microbial	(fungal)	necromass.The	resulting	final	model	was	tested	for	both	sown	and	realized	PSR	(Figure	S2).	In	addition,	we	tested	the	final	model	(Figure	3)	with	sown	PSR	plus	downstream	diversity	metrics	(i.e.,	functional	group	richness	and	the	presence/absence	 of	specific	functional	groups)	to	enable	comparisons	with	the	SEM	containing	PSR	only	(Figure	S4).	One	shortcoming	of	the	piecewise	SEM	approach	is	the	impossibility	of	implementing 	bidirectional	relationships.	We	thus	reanalyzed	our	final	piecewise	model	using	the	traditional	SEM	technique	(Grace,	2006).	For	this,	variables	were	block‐corrected	 analogous	to	the	data	used	for	the	correlation	matrix	prior	to	model	construction	with	the	lavaan	package	(Rosseel,	2012).	The	overall	model	goodness‐of‐fit	statistic	is	based	on	a	chi‐squared	distribution	with	a	good	model	fit	being	indicated	by	an	insignificant	(p	>	.05)	test	statistics.	To	de‐scribe	the	extent	of	match	between	the	specified	model	and	the	sample	covariance	matrix	we	followed	the	two‐index	strategy	pro‐posed	by	Hu	and	Bentler	(1999)	and	reported	the	root	mean	square	error	of	approximation	 (RMSEA)	and	its	90%	confidence	intervals	(CI90)	(Steiger	&	Lind,	1980),	together	with	the	standardized	 root	mean	square	residual	(SRMR).	These	absolute	fit	indices	are	approx‐imate	‘badness‐of‐fit’ 	measures	that	indicate	worsening	absolute	fits	as	the	index	value	increases.	An	indication	for	good	model‐data	fit	is	reached	when	RMSEA	≤	0.06	and	SRMR	≤	0.08	(Hu	&	Bentler,	1999).	Both	the	piecewise	and	the	variance–covariance	 SEM	approach	further	enabled	the	determination 	of	indirect	effects	(i.e.,	the	rela‐tionship	between	two	variables	caused	by	one	or	more	mediating	variables)	by	multiplying	the	standardized	 path	coefficients	of	the	respective	pathways	to	give	indirect	effect	strengths.3 |  RESULTS3.1  | Plant species richness effectsIncreases	in	PSR	positively	influenced	most	measured	soil	physico‐chemical‐,	plant‐,	and	microbial‐related 	parameters	(Tables	1	and	2,	Figure	2).

This	result	was	accompanied	by	increased	microbial	activity,	in	terms	of	respiration,	growth,	and	carbon	uptake	with	increasing	PSR	(p	=	.008,	 p	<	.001,	and	 p	<	.001;	Table	2).

Specifically,	microbial	growth	increased	twofold	from	monoculture	plots	to	60‐species	plots,	whereas	respiration	increased	only	1.5‐fold	(Table	1,	Figure	2c,d,	respectively).

In	contrast,	SOC	was	only	as‐sociated	with	microbial	biomass,	which	had	a	significant	positive	effect	(β	=	.68).	Respiration	showed	no	significant	relationships	with	either	microbial	biomass	or	SOC,	but	was	significantly	posi‐tively	affected	by	microbial	growth.	To	account	for	the	strong	pos‐itive	correlation	between	growth	and	microbial	biomass	(r	=	.65,	p	<	.001;	Table	3),	we	constructed	the	same	model	with	the	tradi‐tional	variance–covariance 	SEM	approach	(Figure	S1).	Even	though	this	approach	did	not	allow	implementation	 of	LMMs	it	enabled	us	to	consider	bidirectional	relationships	of	endogenous	variables	by	calculating	their	shared	variance	(residual	variance),	which	we	did	for	microbial	growth	and	biomass.	Overall,	this	analysis	repro‐duced	the	data	well	(χ26	=	5.25,	 p	=	.513;	RMSEA	=	0.000,	CI90	(0.000;	0.134),	SRMR	=	0.035)	and	yielded	similar	results	to	the	piecewise	SEM.	Nevertheless, 	the	piecewise	approach	explained	a	larger	proportion	of	variance	due	to	its	ability	to	incorporate	ran‐dom	effects	( R2c).The	piecewise	SEM	using	realized	PSR	(Figure	S2)	was	very	simi‐lar	to	the	model	using	sown	PSR	and	resulted	in	the	same	significant	paths	and	overall	model	structure.	Replacing	microbial	biomass	by	fungal	necromass	in	the	final	model	(Figure	S3b)	explained	SOC	to	a	smaller	proportion	of	variance	and	fungal	necromass	was	solely	driven	by	PSR.The	SEM	including	PSR	plus	functional	group	richness	re‐vealed	PSR	to	be	of	greater	importance	for	the	microbially	me‐diated	SOC	build‐up.	This	is	because	PSR	directly	and	indirectly	promoted	microbial	biomass	more	than	functional	group	rich‐ness,	which	only	had	a	direct	and	weaker	effect	on	microbial	bio‐mass	(Figure	S4e).	Models	testing	for	effects	of	functional	group 	identity	indicated	that	legumes	adversely	affected	microbial	biomass	through	negative	effects	on	root	biomass	(Figure	S4a),	 whereas	the	contrasting	was	true	for	grasses	(Figure	S4b).	Both	small	herbs	and	tall	herbs	were	not	linked	to	root	biomass	(Figure	S4c,d).	However,	small	herbs	promoted	microbially	mediated	SOC	accumulation	 through	positive	effects	on	microbial	growth	and	biomass	(Figure	S4c),	while	this	was	not	the	case	for	tall	herbs	(Figure	S4d).3.2 | Plant functional group richness effectsThe	only	parameter	that	was	affected	by	plant	functional	group	richness	was	microbial	biomass,	which	significantly	increased	with	increasing	plant	functional	group	richness	after	accounting	for	spe‐cies	richness	effects	(p	=	.023;	Table	2).

The	exceptions	to	this	were	DOC	and	root	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratio,	where	the	significant	PSR	effect	was	eliminated	if	plant	functional	group	richness	was	included	first	(p	=	.199	and	.410,	respectively;	Table	S1).	These	findings	indicate	that	the	effects	of	PSR	generally	exceeded	those	of	plant	functional	group	richness	on	the	soil	micro‐bial	system.3.3 | Plant functional group identity effectsWe	found	contrasting	effects	of	grasses	and	legumes	on	many	of	the	parameters	analyzed	(Table	2),	and	this	was	most	striking	for	root	carbon	and	root	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratios.	Specifically,	while	grasses	significantly	increased	root	carbon	and	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratio	(p = .020 and p 	<	.001;	Table	2),	legumes	had	a	significant	negative	effect	(p	<	.001	and	.001;	Table	2).	Furthermore, 	the	pres‐ence	of	grasses	increased	DOC	content,	biomass‐specific	 growth,	and	microbial	necromass	carbon	(p	=	.032,	.087,	and	.008;	Table	2),	whereas	legumes	again	showed	the	opposite	effect	(p	=	.003,	.056,	and	.067;	Table	2).	Concordant	with	effects	on	biomass‐specific 	growth,	microbial	turnover	time	decreased	in	the	presence	of	grasses	and	increased	in	the	presence	of	legumes.	Legumes	also	had	a	negative	impact	on	microbial	biomass	and	microbial	growth	(p	=	.002	and	.013,	respectively; 	Table	2),	but	these	variables	were	additionally	positively	affected	by	the	functional	group	of	small	herbs	(p	=	.004	and	.039;	Table	2).	Finally,	small	herbs	had	a	signifi‐cant	positive	effect	on	SOC	content	(p	=	.012;	Table	2).	Tall	herbs	did	not	exhibit	any	significant	impact	on	measured	parameters	(Table	2).4 |  DISCUSSIONSpecies‐rich	grasslands	are	fundamental	 for	many	ecosystem	pro‐cesses	and	services	and	are	important	for	increasing	the	carbon	storage	of	terrestrial	ecosystems	(Hungate	et	al.,	2017).	Higher	SOC	storage	is	believed	to	be	either	due	to	greater	plant	inputs	and/or	due	to	lower	losses	of	organic	carbon	at	high	levels	of	plant	diversity,	the	latter	of	which	reflects	a	higher	efficiency	of	soil	microbial	carbon	cycling.	We	found	here	that	increasing	PSR	promoted	microbial	biomass	both	directly	and	indirectly	through	higher	plant	carbon	inputs	(as	indicated	by	higher	root	carbon	mass	per	area)	and	faster	microbial	growth.	This	increase	in	microbial	biomass	was,	in	turn,	mechanistically 	coupled	with	the	build‐up	of	SOC,	as	shown	by	piecewise	SEM.	Moreover,	microbial	turnover	rates	increased	with	increasing	PSR,	which	most	likely	triggered	in‐creases	in	microbial	necromass	and	thus	contributed	to	the	higher	SOC	content	found	in	species‐rich	plant	communities.	 Although	these	connections	could	not	be	demonstrated	 in	a	single	common	SEM,	fungal	necromass	significantly	determined	SOC	in	a	reduced	structure	of	the	SEM	(Figure	S3b).	In	contrast,	changes	in	microbial	respiration	or	CUE	were	not 	causally	linked	to	the	increase	in	SOC 	content	with	increasing	PSR.The	established	positive	relationship	between	plant	diversity	and	productivity	is	commonly	coupled	with	increased	aboveground	living	and	dead	plant	biomass,	as	well	as	with	higher	belowground	 biomass	production	and	root	exudation	(El	Moujahid	et	al.,	2017;	Fornara	&	Tilman,	2008;	Ravenek	et	al.,	2014;	Roscher	et	al.,	2005).	Root	bio‐mass	and	root‐associated	 products,	such	as	belowground	 litter	and	root	exudates,	are	the	main	forms	of	carbon	input	into	soils	and	repre‐sent	important	carbon	sources	for	soil	microbes.	Greater	root	inputs	into	soils,	however,	can	trigger	decreases	(Steinbeiss,	Temperton,	et	al.,	2008)	or	increases	in	SOC	storage	(Xu,	Liu,	&	Sayer,	2013),	de‐pending	on	the	responses	of	microbial	carbon	metabolism	and	the	extent	of	rhizosphere	priming	effects.	Our	findings	of	higher	micro‐bial	biomass	and	activity	in	response	to	increasing	PSR	concomitant	with	increased	belowground	 carbon	input	as	evidenced	by	a	higher	root	biomass	carbon	is	in	line	with	earlier	studies	from	the	Jena	Experiment	(Eisenhauer	et	al.,	2010;	Lange	et	al.,	2015;	Strecker	et	al.,	2015).	However,	when	splitting	overall	‘microbial	activity’	into	anabolic	and	catabolic	processes,	we	observed	a	more	pronounced	increase	in	growth	(twofold)	than	in	respiration	(1.5‐fold),	indicating	a	relatively	greater	anabolic	capacity	of	soil	microbial	communities	at	high	PSR	levels.	We	suggest	that	this	caused	soil	microbial	biomass	to	increase,	which	explains	the	higher	growth	rates	observed	per	unit	of	soil	mass.	Interestingly,	biomass‐specific 	respiration	rates	and	micro‐bial	CUE	did	not	respond	to	changes	in	PSR,	while	biomass‐specific 	growth	rates	increased	significantly	with	increasing	PSR.	This	is	im‐portant	because	biomass‐specific 	rates	represent	the	microbial	phys‐iology	independently 	of	microbial	biomass.	The	latter	is	equivalent	to	microbial	turnover	at	steady	state	conditions	(i.e.,	when	microbial	biomass	remains	constant	in	the	short	term,	as	expected	in	a	24	hr	measurement	 period,	and	as	shown	by	Zheng	et	al.	(2019)),	explain‐ing	why	both	microbial	growth	and	microbial	biomass	turnover	rates	accelerated	under	increasing	PSR.	In	the	long	term	(at	decadal	scales),	accelerated	microbial	growth	and	faster	microbial	turnover	rates	will	promote	microbial	necromass	formation.	This	accelerated	production	and	turnover	of	microbial	biomass	is	expected	to	promote	SOC	stor‐age	via	ongoing	iterative	cycles	of	microbial	proliferation,	growth,	and	death,	ultimately	leading	to	incorporation	of	higher	amounts	of	micro‐bial‐derived	carbon	in	the	SOC	pool	of	more	diverse	plant	commu‐nities.	Thus,	microbial	growth	increased	through	higher	plant	carbon	inputs	has	the	potential	to	fuel	the	soil	organic	matter	reservoir	with	microbially	derived	carbon	due	to	both	accelerated	biomass	and	nec‐romass	formation	(Liang,	Cheng,	Wixon,	&	Balser,	2011).	We	further	stress	the	importance	of	measuring	microbial	respiration	and	growth	simultaneously, 	when	assessing	microbial	contributions 	to	SOC	accu‐mulation,	as	both	processes	affect	SOC	dynamics	in	different	ways	(Data	S1).The	observed	increase	in	microbial	necromass	carbon	with	PSR	was	mainly	driven	by	increases	in	the	formation	of	fungal	necro‐mass,	since	bacterial	necromass	did	not	respond	to	manipulations	 in	PSR.	As	such,	the	fungal	to	bacterial	necromass	ratio	also	increased	with	increasing	PSR.	Fungal‐derived	 necromass	was	shown	to	sig‐nificantly	contribute	to	soil	organic	matter	accumulation	 that	was	also	strongly	promoted	by	efficient	microbial	biomass	production	 13652486, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14777 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

While	a	previous	study	from	the	same	experiment	reported	no	PSR	but	plant	func‐tional	group	richness	effects	on	fungal	to	bacterial	biomass	ratios	based	on	phospholipid	 fatty	acid	analysis	(Lange	et	al.,	2014),	we	found	that	the	corresponding	 necromass	ratio	was	more	strongly	driven	by	PSR	(Table	2)	than	by	functional	group	richness	(Table	S1).	 More	diverse	plant	mixtures	most	likely	support	soil	microbial	com‐munities	with	a	larger	amount	and	higher	diversity	of	resources,	which	is	supported	by	previous	work	at	this	experiment	demonstrat‐ing	a	higher	diversity	of	organic	compounds	of	low	molecular	weight,	such	as	organic	acids,	at	higher	levels	of	PSR	(El	Moujahid	et	al.,	2017).	This	suggests	that	the	diversity	of	more	complex	compounds,	such	as	lignins,	proteins,	and	condensed	tannins,	may	also	be	higher	with	increasing	PSR.	Both	the	quality	and	quantity	of	substrates	are	known	to	affect	bacterial	and	fungal	growth,	with	fungal	growth	being	more	promoted	by	complex	carbon	substrates	and	increased	loading	rates	of	available	substrate	compared	to	bacterial	growth	(Rousk	&	Baath,	2011).	This	could	have	translated	into	the	higher	fungal	to	bacterial	necromass	ratios	observed	here.	Alternatively,	it	cannot	be	ruled	out	that	the	recycling	of	bacterial	necromass	by	the	active	microbial	community	is	faster	than	that	of	the	fungal	nec‐romass	at	higher	PSR,	for	example,	because	bacterial	remains	are	thought	to	be	richer	in	nutrients	(Sterner	&	Elser,	2002)	or	because	fungal	necromass	decomposition 	is	retarded	by	melanin	impregna‐tion	(Fernandez,	Langley,	Chapman,	McCormack,	&	Koide,	2016).Increased	labile	carbon	inputs	can	trigger	the	activation	of	dor‐mant	microbes	(Blagodatskaya	 &	Kuzyakov,	2013)	by	alleviation	of	their	carbon	limitation	(Demoling,	Figueroa,	&	Baath,	2007).	We	found	little	evidence,	however,	that	soil	microbes	were	released	from	carbon	limitation	through	increased	plant	carbon	inputs	at	higher	PSR,	since	we	observed	no	response	in	microbial	CUE	and	in	biomass‐specific 	res‐piration.	Microbial	CUE	was	shown	to	decrease	and	biomass‐specific 	respiration	to	increase	under	conditions	of	increasing	carbon	availabil‐ity	(Manzoni	et	al.,	2012;	Spohn	&	Chodak,	2015).	However,	biomass‐  specific	respiration,	determined	as	the	ratio	of	soil	basal	respiration	to	soil	microbial	biomass,	does	not	provide	any	information	about	how	much	of	the	carbon	taken	up	by	microbes	is	used	for	microbial	growth	and	thereby	is	incorporated	into	microbial	biomass.	Therefore,	although	biomass‐specific 	respiration	and	CUE	both	refer	to	microbial	utilization	of	carbon,	biomass‐specific	 respiration	should	not	be	used	as	a	proxy	for	microbial	CUE,	which	is	defined	by	the	ratio	of	growth	over	carbon	uptake.	Nonetheless	biomass‐specific 	respiration	is	a	valu‐able	indicator	as	a	relative	measure	of	the	degree	of	substrate	limita‐tion	of	the	soil	microbial	community	(Wardle	&	Ghani,	1995).No	response	of	microbial	biomass‐specific 	respiration	and	CUE	implies	that	although	more	plant‐derived	 carbon	will	have	entered	the	soil	in	more	diverse	plant	communities,	 the	soil	microbial	com‐munity	most	likely	did	not	change	in	nutritional	limitations	but	re‐mained	carbon	limited	or	carbon	to	nutrient	colimited,	even	at	high	PSR	levels.	This	is	in	concordance	 with	observations	 from	a	large	suite	of	soils	differing	in	land	use,	soil	organic	matter	content,	nutri‐ent	status,	soil	pH,	and	spanning	a	wide	range	of	soil	carbon	to	nitro‐gen	ratios,	which	have	shown	that	soil	microbial	growth,	determined	by	radiotracer	incorporation 	approaches,	is	most	commonly	limited	by	a	lack	of	carbon	or	energy	(Alden,	Demoling,	&	Baath,	2001;	Demoling	et	al.,	2007;	Kamble	&	Baath,	2014).We	did	not	find	support	for	our	expectation	that	microbial	CUE	would	change	with	PSR.	Changes	in	microbial	CUE,	therefore,	can‐not	explain	the	increase	in	SOC	accumulation 	with	PSR.	Increasing	resource	carbon	to	nutrient	ratios	for	soil	microbial	communities	have	been	shown	to	decrease	microbial	CUE	(Manzoni	et	al.,	2012).	In	the	Jena	Experiment,	not	only	the	quantity	but	also	the	quality	of	plant	biomass	responded	to	changes	in	plant	diversity	as	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratios	increased	significantly	with	PSR.	This	is	thought	to	be	a	consequence	 of	altered	nutrient	allocation	and	carbon	fixa‐tion	patterns	of	aboveground 	vegetation	(Abbas	et	al.,	2013;	Vogel,	Eisenhauer,	Weigelt,	&	Scherer‐Lorenzen, 	2013),	and	because	of	shifts	in	the	identity	and	proportional	 composition	of	plant	func‐tional	groups,	especially	in	the	case	of	root	stoichiometry	 (Chen	et	al.,	2017).	Plant	detrital	material	can	be	expected	to	have	even	wider	carbon	to	nutrient	ratios	compared	to	living	plant	tissues,	due	to	remobilization 	of	nutrients	prior	to	litter	production.	These	changes	in	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratios	of	plant	biomass	and	detritus	most	likely	translated	into	unfavorable	substrate	stoichiometries 	for	soil	micro‐bial	communities,	 as	also	reflected	in	the	increasing	root	and	soil	carbon	to	nitrogen	ratios	observed	here	with	increasing	PSR	(Tables	1	and	2	for	root	stoichiometry 	only).	Constant	microbial	CUE,	there‐fore,	also	suggests	that	microbial	communities	 here	operate	below	their	threshold	element	ratio	and	therefore	experience	persistent	carbon	limitation	(Mooshammer, 	Wanek,	Zechmeister‐Boltenstern, 	&	Richter,	2014).When	compared	to	PSR,	functional	group	richness	was	of	less	importance	to	microbially	driven	SOC	build‐up.	Specifically,	while	functional	group	richness	also	promoted	microbial	biomass	in‐creases	that	translated	into	the	build‐up	of	SOC,	this	effect	was	less	pronounced	and	was	neither	mediated	through	root	carbon	input	nor	through	microbial	growth.	This	is	important	because	previous	findings	have	shown	that	both	PSR	and	functional	group	richness	increase	aboveground	community	biomass	(Marquard	 et	al.,	2009),	but	we	demonstrate	here	that	only	PSR	effects	extend	belowground.	 Despite	this,	we	found	clear	effects	of	the	presence	versus	absence	of	different	functional	groups,	and	particularly	of	legumes,	on	the	soil	microbial	system.	Specifically,	we	found	that	le‐gumes	decreased	root	biomass,	microbial	growth,	microbial	biomass,	and	turnover	rates.	While	we	did	not	observe	a	legume‐induced	reduction	in	biomass‐specific 	respiration,	as	previously	reported	from	the	same	experiment	(Strecker	et	al.,	2015),	our	findings	add	support	to	the	notion	that	legumes	have	a	negative	impact	on	soil	microbial	processes.	This	is	coupled	with	the	fact	that	legumes	have	been	shown	to	decrease	root	biomass	(Ravenek	et	al.,	2014).	As	a	consequence,	 our	findings	suggest	that	legumes,	as	the	only	func‐tional	group	here	with	negative	effects	on	the	soil	microbial	system,	are	responsible	for	the	reductions	in	SOC	content	observed	in	this	 experiment,	and	act	via	their	inhibitory	influence	on	community‐level	root	biomass,	and	thereby	on	microbial	biomass	and	activity.	We	posit	that	this	legume	effect	arises	due	to	the	ability	of	legumes	to	 13652486, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14777 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

By	comparison,	grasses	are	known	to	invest	relatively	exten‐sively	in	root	biomass,	which	may	be	responsible	for	our	observations	that	grasses	supported	microbially	driven	SOC	build‐up	(Figure	S4b).	  Tall	herbs	did	not	affect	the	soil	microbial	system,	whereas	small	herbs	significantly	increased	microbial	growth	and	biomass	and	thus	led	to	increases	in	SOC	(Figure	S4c).	This	positive	effect	of	small	herbs	was	rather	unexpected	and	needs	further	clarification.In	conclusion,	species‐rich	plant	communities, 	most	likely	through	greater	plant	organic	matter	inputs,	promoted	the	growth	of	soil	mi‐crobial	communities	more	strongly	than	their	respiratory	activity,	triggering	increases	in	microbial	biomass.	At	the	same	time,	microbial	biomass	turnover	rates	increased,	thereby	promoting	microbial	nec‐romass	formation.	We	show	that	these	mechanisms	together	led	to	SOC	accumulation.	 Clearly	changes	to	the	soil	system	are	themselves	a	driver	of	change	in	the	plant	community,	and	thus	the	changes	we	observed	to	some	extent	reflect	the	coupling	between	shifts	in	plant	communities	and	the	soil	system.	This	is	the	first	evidence	of	causal	links	between	microbial	physiology,	microbial	biomass,	and	necromass	build‐up	and	SOC	storage	in	the	context	of	plant	biodiversity.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe	gratefully	acknowledge	 the	coordinators	 and	technical	staff	of	the	Jena	Experiment	for	their	work	in	maintaining	the	field	site	and	also	many	student	helpers	for	weeding	of	the	experimental	plots.
