China  11  12 Abstract : The variation characteristics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in and around  the 13 coking plant area are still unclear. In this work, t he concentration and stable carbon 14 isotope composition of SOC in coke plant soils were investigated to preliminarily 15 identify the sources of SOC  in and around the plant  area, and to characterize soil carbon 16 turnover. Meanwhile, the carbon isotopic techniqu e was used to initially identify the 17 soil pollution processes and sources in and around the coking plant area. The results 18 demonstrate that the SOC content (12.76 mg g-1) of the surface soil in the coking plant 19 is about 6 times higher than that outside the  coking plant (2.05 mg g-1), and the variation 20 range of δ13C value of the surface soil in the plant ( -24.63～-18.55‰) is larger than that 21                                                    * Corresponding author.

The SOC concentration decreases 22 gradually from the center of the plant outward with increasing distance, and the δ13C in 23 the middle and north of the plant tends to be positive compared with the δ13C in the 24 west and southeast of the plant.  As the increase of soil depth, the SOC content and δ13C 25 value in the plant increases. On  the contrary, δ13C value and SOC content outside the 26 plant decreases, with a minor  variation . Based on the carbon isotope method, the SOC 27 in and around the coking plant area is mainly from industrial activities (e.g., coal 28 burning and coking), and partly from C3 plants. Notably, organic waste gases 29 containing heavy hydrocarbons, light oils , and organic compounds accumulated in the 30 northern and northeastern areas outside the plant due to south and southwest winds, 31 which may pose an environmental health risk . 32 Keywords : coking plant ; soil organic carbon ; carbon isotope ; distribution and turnover  33  34 1. Introduction  35 Soil carbon pools play a crucial role in soil fertility and ecosystem balance, and their 36 faint changes can severely affect the dynamics and distribution of carbon  (Chen et al., 37 2005; Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000; Raich and Potter, 1994) . The primary  sources of soil 38 organic carbon (SOC) are natural and anthropogenic processes  (Fennell and Bentley, 39 1998) . In contrast, perturbations to the soil carbon pool caused by different forms of 40 organic matter produced by human activities cannot be neglected  (Guo et al., 2013; Guo 41 et al., 2017).  It is therefore imperative to identify the source of SOC and to assess the 42 disturbance of soil carbon pools cause d by human activities. Nonetheless, due to the 43 Journal Pre-proofinfluence of complex environmental factors and the lack of relevant research methods, 44 previous studies have mainly focused on the determination of SOC content and state, 45 making it difficult to accurately grasp  the origin and dynamics of carbon.  For example, 46 ambient temperature, soil moisture, soil texture, C/N ratio, pH, and electrical 47 conductivity can indirectly influence  the carbon decomposition process by affecting the 48 enzymatic activity of soil microorganisms, thus altering the input and distribution of 49 SOC  (Bird et al., 2003; Guggenberger et al., 1994; O ’leary , 1981; Zhu and Liu, 2008) . 50 Besides, the shift of land use p attern will also alter the source and process of SOC, 51 which brings difficulties in understanding the fate of SOC  (Han et al., 2020; Liu et al., 52 2020).  53 The advent of stable carbon isotope technology has enabled qualitative and 54 quantitative analysis of the s ource, turnover, mobility, stability and decomposition of 55 SOC  (Canadell et al., 2000; Ehleringer et al., 2000; Freeman et al., 1990; Guo et al., 56 2013; Lao et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020; Malhi et al., 1999; Han et al., 2015; Natelhoffer 57 and Fry, 1988; Weih mann et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2020) . Among them, the dynamic 58 fractionation effect of photosynthesis leads to an enrichment of light isotopes in 59 biogenic carbon, resulting in differences in the isotopic composition of carbon between 60 organisms and atmospher ic CO 2 in terrestrial ecosystems  (Bai et al., 2012) . In general, 61 SOC in natural soils is mainly derived from terrestrial higher plants. The carbon 62 isotopic fractionation during SOC decomposition is negligible compared to that of plant 63 photosynthesis, thereby resulting in that the SOC is consistent with the δ13C of planted 64 plants on this soil  (Crow et al., 2006; Fernandez et al., 2003) . Besides , the 65 Journal Pre-proofmineralization and humification of SOC and the influence of human activities (e.g., 66 coal combustion) are accompanied by isotopic fractionation, and the isotopic 67 composition of SOC from different sources is vastly different  (Zou et al., 2020 ; Guo et 68 al., 2013; Guo et al., 2017 ). From this, different sources of SOC can be accurately 69 distinguished according to  different isotopic compositions and the carbon conversion 70 processes in the soil can then be integrated, thus providing an indication for the study 71 of soil carbon turnover  (Ehleringer et al., 2000; Gregory et al., 1999; O’ leary , 1981; 72 Sun et al., 2003) . 73 Notably, coking plant, as a typical industrial area, the pollutants (e.g., benzene series, 74 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals) generat ed from  its production 75 process will be directly discharged into the atmosphere, and finally accumulate and 76 diffuse in the soil through wet and dry deposition  (Hu et al., 2022; Mu et al., 2014; 77 Yuan et al., 2013) . And, during the process of coking, gas purification , and tar product 78 recovery, the leakage of raw materials containing additional organic matter can also 79 have a serious impact on the soil  (Mu et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2007). It 80 can be seen that the prolonged operation of the coking production  may inevitably affect 81 the SOC turnover pattern  (Guo et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2021; Zou et al ., 2020).  Previous 82 studies on stable carbon isotopes mainly focused on agricultural soils. Nevertheless , the 83 distribution and variation of δ13C and SOC the industrial areas  affected  by human 84 disturbance are not clearly identified . Therefore, it is necessary to study the distribution 85 and turnover of soil organic carbon inside and outside the cok ing plant. Based on the  86 hypothesis  that isotope methods can sensitively reveal the interference and restoration 87 Journal Pre-proofprocesses of the soil carbon cycle, carbon iso topes may preliminar ily identif y the  88 environmental pollution and sources from industrial activities . Therefore, a coking 89 plant  in Tangshan City was selected as the study area and carbon isotope tracing 90 technique w as used to understand the response of the c oking industrial production 91 process to the carbon turnover patterns inside and outside  plant  and preliminarily 92 identify the soil pollution processes and sources in the coking plant area . 93 2. Materials and Methods  94 2.1. Study area  95 Tangshan is one of the most prominent industrial cities in Hebei province, located 96 between 117°31' ～119°19' E and 38°55' ～40°28' N. It is a continental monsoon climate 97 with an average annual temperature of 12.5  ℃ and an average annual precipitation of 98 about 500~700 mm. The coking plant in this study is located in the eastern part of 99 Tangshan City and was established in 2004 with an area of approximately 68 hm2. The 100 topography of the plant is flat and the surface is covered by quaternary strata. The plant  101 located in the core industrial zone of eastern Hebei province, integrates coking, power 102 generation, sintering and iron and steel production and has complex pollution sources. 103 The waste, solid waste and particulate pollutants produced by the plant could hav e a 104 potential impact on the environment of surrounding areas and even Hebei province. I t 105 mainly produces coke, tar, natural gas , and crude benzene, has been listed by the 106 government as a key enterprise for environmental protection supervision.  107 2.2. Collect ion and testing of soil samples  108 Soil samples were collected according to the classification of different functional 109 Journal Pre-proofzones (Fig. 1) . Specifically, 36 sampling points were set inside and outside the coking 110 plant, including 14 inside  and 22 outside  samples (Fig. 1).  Soil samples at different 111 depths (0～10 cm, 10 ～20 cm, and 20 ～40 cm) were collected in June 2019.  The plants, 112 roots, leaves , and other organic residues as well as rocks in the samples were removed 113 using  tweezers and then air-dried.  Subsequ ently , the soil sample is ground, sifted , and 114 transferred to a brown grinding flask for later use. The samples passed through the 100 - 115 mesh sieve were used to detect the total organic carbon (TOC). Samples passed through 116 a 20 -mesh sieve were used to determine pH (Hu et al., 2022). In addition, soil 117 physicochemical  parameters , includ ing organic carbon, ele ctrical conductivity, total 118 nitrogen, and grain size distribution , also were measured . The specific detection and 119 analysis procedures are detailed in the supplementary text.  120 2.3. Carbon isotope analysis  121 About 2 mg of soil sample wrapped in tin cups (organi c carbon content > 1%, pure 122 carbon content > 20 ug) was placed in an autosampler and then into a combustion 123 furnace.  Among them , helium was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was 124 controlled to about 100 mL min-1. Oxygen was used as the supporting gas for 125 combustion and the flow rate was controlled at 175 mL min-1 for a duration of three 126 seconds. The furnace temperature was set at 1050 ℃. Subsequently, the CO 2 from the 127 high-temperature burning of the organic carbon was dehydrated and dried with 128 magn esium perchlorate, and then separated from other impurities by gas 129 chromatography. Finally, the carbon isotopic composition of the obtained pure CO 2 gas 130 was determined using  an isotope mass spectrometer (MAT253).  131 Journal Pre-proofInternational reference material for stable  isotope analysis of δ13C, namely Vienna 132 Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The carbon isotopic composition is described by δ13C, 133 which is defined as:  134 δ13C (‰) = [Rsample /Rstandard  - 1] × 1000  135 IAEA600 (Caffeine, carbon isotope value -27.771 ‰) was used to calibrate  the 136 sample. The δ13C value was measured repeatedly throughout the study with an accuracy 137 of 0.2 ‰. 138 2.4. Data Processing  139 The map of the sampling sites was drawn using ArcGIS 10.7, and the other figures 140 were drawn by Origin 2021. The inverse distance weight  analysis function included in 141 ArcGIS is used to characterize the spatial variability properties of certain parameters in 142 the studied region. Pearson correlation analysis was also performed in Origin 2021 to 143 investigate the relationship between carbon isot opic composition and SOC.  144 3. Results and discussion  145 3.1 Physical and chemical properties of soil  146 The distribution of physical and chemical properties of the soil is shown in Table S1.  147 Except for pH and SOC  concentration s, the coefficients of variation (CV) of electrical 148 conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), organic matter (OM), CaCO 3, and soil particle 149 composition  (SPC% ) data are all above 15%, indicating strong natural and 150 anthropogenic disturbance (Table S1)  (Hu et al., 2022) . Moreover, t he soil inside the 151 coke plant is alkaline with an average pH of 8.3, while the soil outside the plant is 152 neutral with an average pH of 7.4 (Fig. 2 -A). The soil in the plant  is composed mainly 153 Journal Pre-proofof sand particles, loam particles , and clay particles, with an average ratio of 60.79%, 154 20.0% , and 19.5% , respectively . The average proportions of loam particles (14.0%) and 155 sand particles (55.0%) in the outside plant  was not significantly different from that in 156 the inside plant , but ther e are more clay particles (30.7%).  Besides , the average values 157 of EC (0.75 ms cm-1), OM (75.4 g mg-1), and CaCO 3 (43.4 g mg-1) in the inside soils of 158 plant  are higher than that of EC (0.2 m S cm-1), OM (25.6 g mg-1), and CaCO 3 (15.1 g 159 mg-1) in the o utside  soils, respectively. The difference is that the TN content of the 160 inside  soil (0.6 g mg-1) is lower than that of the outside  soil (0.8 g mg-1). 161 3.2 Distribution characteristics of  carbon isotopes and SOC 162 3.2.1 Horizontal variation characteristics  163 The overall δ13C value of soil organic carbon in the coking plant area varie s from - 164 24.92‰ to -18.55‰ (Fig. 2 -B). The variation range of δ13C in the soil inside the plant 165 (-24.63～18.55 ‰) is higher than that in the soil outside the plant ( -24.92～20.22 ‰). 166 The δ13C values of in -site soils with an average  value  of -22.42‰ are more  positive 167 compared to those of off -site soils (-23.26‰) (Fig. 2 -B), which  may be caused by the 168 high CaCO 3 content of soil in the plant  (Table S1) (Boeckx et al., 2006) . Meanwhile, 169 the SOC  content of the soil inside the plant (12. 81 mg g-1) is about 6 times higher than 170 that of the soil outside the plant (2. 05 mg g-1) (Fig. 2 -B). After removing these two 171 outliers, the organic matter content (5.3 mg g-1) of the soil inside the plant remained 172 higher than that of the soil outside the plant (2.05 mg g-1). 173 To determine the spatial variation characteristics of SOC concentration  and δ13C 174 value  in the study area, ArcGIS was used to perform inverse distance weight analysis 175 Journal Pre-proofon SOC concentratio n and δ13C value  (Fig. 3). The results display  that the SOC 176 concentration in the surface soil of the inside plant  (especially in the raw material area 177 and the dust area of the road) is relatively high , and SOC concentrations decrease from 178 southwest to northeast and decrease s with increasing distance from the center of the 179 coking plant, suggest ing that the SOC outside plant is mainly from industrial activities  180 (Fig. 3-A) (Guo et al., 2017). Nevertheless , the δ13C values of top -soils located in the 181 centra l and northern parts of the study area are more positive than those of other areas 182 (Fig. 3 -B). Significant ly, stack emissions (fly ash) and unorganized emissions (poor 183 containment) are the main emission patterns of coking -generated emissions (Mu et al., 184 2014). Among these, gases consisting of heavy hydrocarbons, light oils and additional 185 organic compounds (including POPs, VOCs, and PAHs) , and coal ash  (containing 186 heavy metal)  are continuously release s into the atmosphere , and then enter the soil 187 through wet and dry deposition (Deng et al., 2014; Mu et al., 2013; Norra et al., 2005). 188 Moreover , the wind direction in Tangshan City is mainly south and southwest, lead ing 189 to a high SOC concentration in the surface soil of the inside plant , and gradually 190 decreases with the increase of the distance from the center of the plant (from the center 191 to the outside). Simultaneously , coal dust deposition caused by coal storage can enrich 192 the soil with δ13C (Norra et al., 2005). Wind force cause s δ13C-rich exhaust gas and 193 particulate matter to migrate and accumulate in the northern part of the plant , which is 194 also the key to the significant difference in δ13C distribution characteristics outside the 195 plant  (δ13C values in the middle and north of the plant tend to be positive compared 196 with those in the west and southeast).  197 Journal Pre-proof3.2.2 Vertical variation characteristic s 198 Variations in the organic carbon isotope and organic matter content were investigated 199 at different depths . As the soil depth increase s from 0～10 cm to 20 ～40 cm, regions 200 with large variation in δ13C values include  coke oven area (S 1), waste water pond (S 2), 201 ammonium sulfide area (S 4), tank area (S 6), and gas tank area (S 8) (Fig. S1 -B), 202 indicating that SOC  in those areas  are degraded naturally by microorganisms in its 203 profile (Chen et al., 2005). Conversely, the  δ13C values in the gas tank area ( S13), coke 204 oven area ( S11), and coke quenching area ( S10) have a slight  variation range (Fig. S1 - 205 B). The reason for this can be conc luded  by the fact that coal slag enters  and enriches 206 in the soil , which influence s the SOC fractionation induced by soil microorganisms  207 (Zou et al., 2020). With the increase of soil  in the outside plant  depth  from 0～10cm to 208 20～40cm  (e.g., S15, S18, S20, S24, S27, S29, S33, and S 35), the variation of δ13C 209 value is tiny (Fig. S2 -B), while  the region s with large variation of SOC  content include 210 ammonium sulfide zone (S 4), tank zone (S 6), coke quenching zone ( S10), and the soil 211 outside plant  (S15 and S 18) (Fig. S1 -A and Fig. S2 -A), which are mainly affected by 212 the spatial distribution  of leaf and root litter.  On the contrary, the variation range of 213 SOC  content in the coke oven area (S 1), waste water pool (S 2), gas tank area (S 8 and 214 S13), coke oven area ( S11), and the soil outside plant  (e.g., S20, S24, S27, S29, S33, 215 and S 35) is small (Fig. S1 -A and Fig. S2-A). This may be  due to  various pollutants 216 produced in industrial processes affect the microbial activity, which is detrimental to 217 the sequestration  of SOC . 218 Owing to the  restriction  of some functional areas in the coking  plant , only soil 219 Journal Pre-proofsamples with a depth of 0 ～20 cm were collected from most of the sample sites (Table 220 S2). Based on this, we discuss the vertical variation of SOC and δ13C values in th e 221 shallow soil of the plant from 0 cm to 20 cm. On the whole, the average SOC content 222 at different soil depths in side the plant  is 4.9 mg g-1 (0～10 cm) and 5.5 mg g-1 (10～ 223 20 cm), respectively, showing an increasing trend with the increase of depth (Fig. 4-A). 224 And the δ13C values of the inside  plant also show a similar trend (from -22.39‰ to - 225 20.56‰) (Fig. 4 -A). The coking plant  is dominated by coal burning and coking, which 226 makes abundant  organic matter accumulate  in the soil inside the plant  (Guo et al., 2017). 227 Differently,  the SOC  content  outside plant  decrease s with the increase of soil depth 228 (from 1.96 mg g-1 to 1.89 mg g-1) (Fig. 4 -B). When the soil depth increase s from 0～10 229 cm to 10～20 cm, the average δ13C value decrease s from -22.26‰ to -22.35‰ (Fig. 4 - 230 B). In contrast to natural soil profiles, the soil in side and outside the plant tend to 231 decrease in SOC  concentration with increasing depth, but the change  is not significant 232 enough  (Liu et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2008) . 233 3.3 Source identification  of SOC  234 3.3.1 Pearson correlation analysis  235 Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between organic 236 carbon isotopes and SOC  content in the soil.  It can be seen that there is a positive 237 correlation between SOC  concentration and δ13C inside the coking  plant (R2 = 0.171) 238 (Fig. S3 -A). The SOC  content is enriched by the accumulation of organic feedstock in 239 the coking coal producing areas.  Meanwhile , dust generated from  coal accumulation 240 and transportation tends to be enriched  in δ13C (Lopez -Veneroni, 2009).  Besides, the 241 Journal Pre-proofsoil inside the plant is rich in CaCO 3 and alkaline, which is typical of saline -alkali soils  242 (Table S1 ). In the process of soil salinization, the carbonate in the soil accumulates δ13C, 243 which  can increase the value of δ13C (Boeckx et al., 2006). Interestingly, t here is a 244 negative correlation between SOC  concentration and δ13C outside the plant (R2 = - 245 0.0999) (Fig. S3 -A), indicating that the decomposition degree of SOC  outside the plant 246 is low. This may be due to complex isotopic fractionation caused by microbial and 247 animal respiration during the conversion of plant residues to organic carbon  (Bai et al., 248 2012; Fujiyoshi et al., 2011).  249 3.3.2 Natural and anthropogenic sources  250 Carbon  isotopic comp osition is commonly used to distinguish the natural and 251 anthropogenic contributions of carbon in soils ( e.g., coal, rocks, and plants ( C3 and C4 252 plants) (Ehleringer et al., 2000). The previous results show ed that the δ13C values of 253 plant samples from steel  industrial areas vary -15.4～-15.1‰ and -30.0～-26.7‰  (Guo 254 et al, 2013 and 2017) . And the isotopic composition of C3 plants ranges from -30‰ to 255 -20‰, while that of C4 plants ranges from -17‰ to -8‰ (Lin et al., 2013). As 256 mentioned above, topsoil δ13C values  inside and outside  the coking plant range from - 257 24.63 to -18.55‰ and -24.92 to -20.22‰, respectively. Comparative studies have found 258 that natural sources of SOC  inside and outside  coking plant  should be dominated by C3 259 plants, with limited sources from C4 plants.  260 Compared with the δ13C value of the surface soil of the industrial area in Beijing ( - 261 24.7 ± 0.5‰), the δ13C value of the surface soil in the coking plant is more positive (- 262 22.4 ± 1.56‰) (Fig.  5). Besides , the δ13C values of several typical production areas in 263 Journal Pre-proofBeijing (23.8  ± 0.5‰ (sintering plant), 23.71  ± 0.3‰ (rolling section), 23.6  ± 0.2‰ 264 (coke production), 24.7  ± 0.5‰ (top-soil in industrial area ), and 24.3±0.6 ‰ (coal)) are 265 also related to the average δ13C value ( -23.2 ± 0.8‰) of the coking production areas 266 (including raw material area, solid waste accumulation area, gas tank area, coke 267 quenching area , and coke oven area) is similar (Fig. 5). Th erefore, SOC  in the coking 268 plants mainly comes from industrial  production activities and the accumulation of raw 269 materials and wastes (Guo et al., 2013). Besides , the δ13C value of soil outside the 270 coking plant ( -22.4 ± 1.06‰) is mostly  consistent with the δ13C value of surface soil of 271 non-industrial area in Beijing ( -21.9 ± 1.5‰) (Fig.  5), suggesting  that SOC  in the two 272 regions has similar sources (Guo et al., 2017).  The δ13C value and SOC difference of 273 coking production area s are analyzed emphatically, and the results are shown in Fig. 274 S4. Undoubtedly , SOC in the raw material area and road ash accumulation area is 275 significantly higher than that in other sampling areas, which is mainly generated in the 276 process of coal accumulation and burning  (Mu et al., 2013  and 2014). SOC content s of 277 solid waste accumula tion area, gas tank area, coke quenching area , and coke oven area 278 are not significantly different from δ13C. On the whole, the δ13C values of the soil in 279 the coking plant  and its surrounding areas are -24.63～-18.55‰ and -24.92～-20.22‰, 280 respectively, which are consistent with the isotopic compositions of the fly ash collected 281 by blast furnace during coking (-23.84‰～-23.32‰).  It can be seen  that coal/coal 282 burning has a great contribution to soil organic carbon in and around the plant (Guo et 283 al., 2013; Mu et al., 2013 ; Zou et al., 2020 ). 284 Previous research has found that there are some differences in carbon isotope 285 Journal Pre-proofcomposition and SOC content  between industrial, surrounding industrial and non - 286 industrial areas (Fig. S5) (Guo et al., 2017). Specifically, the soil SOC concentration 287 level showed an obvious change (i.e., industrial area > surrounding industrial area > 288 non-industrial area) (Fig. S5 -A). As far as the variation of δ13C is concerned, the non - 289 industrial area is larger than that of the industrial area and the surrounding area (Fig. 290 S5-B). Besides, the region with stable δ13C value and relatively elevated SOC is mainly 291 influenced by indust rial activities, and the area with large variation of δ13C value and 292 low SOC concentration is mainly affected by microbial turnover of SOC in the surface 293 layer (Guo et al., 2017).  However, in this study, the variation of δ13C values of SOC  in 294 and out of the plant  are fundamentally  the same, which may be due to the lack of 295 significant isotope fractionation in the coking industrial production process  and the 296 consistent source of SOC in and outside plants  (Fig. 6) (Norra et al., 2005). Furthermore , 297 the soil in  the coking plant has a steep SOC content, further indicating that coking 298 production activity is the main source of SOC.  Compared with the soil inside plant , the 299 SOC  content outside the plant  is lower, and the isotopic composition of SOC  is 300 relatively posi tive, indicating that the SOC outside plant  mainly c omes from dead 301 branches and defoliations (mainly C3 plants).  302 4. Conclusions  303 Stable carbon isotope method  is used to explore organic carbon turnover patterns  and 304 preliminarily  identify the soil pollution processes and sources in and around the coking 305 plant area . The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the physical and chemical 306 properties of the soil inside and outside the plant  are significantly different, and are 307 Journal Pre-proofheavily dist urbed by industrial  activities  and fluctuate considerably; (2) the SOC 308 concentration in the study area increase s from southwest to northeast, and decrease s 309 with the increase of the distance from the center of the coking plant. The δ13C of topsoil 310 located i n the middle and north of the study area is more positive than that of other 311 areas; (3) with the increase of soil depth, the average SOC  content of different soil 312 depths in the plant  show s an increasing trend, while the SOC  content of outside  soil 313 haves  a decreasing trend; (4) the main sources of SOC  of the coking plant  primarily  314 include industrial sources ( e.g., coal burning and coking) and natural sources ( C3 315 plants). It is worth noting that exhaust gases (heavy metals and organic pollutants) from 316 the coking plant  accumulate downwind of the plant  due to the action of wind . Therefore, 317 the severe environmental risk  on the downwind areas of the coking plant shoul d be 318 given extra attention.  319 Declaration of Interest Statement  320 The authors declare that they have no competing financial interests or personal 321 relationships . 322 Acknowledgments  323 This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development 324 Program of China (grant No 2019YFC1805805, 2018YFC1800306) and National 325 Natural Science foundation of China (grant No 21307090).  326 Reference s 327 Bai E., Boutton T.W., Liu F., Wu X.B., Hallmark C.T. , Archer S.R., 2012.
