Holden  Mycorrhizal fungi associated with plant roots may contribute to carbon sequestration in soils.CREDIT: MAIN PHOTO AND LEFT INSET, KATHLEEN TRESEDER; RIGHT INSET, KATIE SHELEF        Many soil fungi consist of small, delicate hyphae that permeate a complex matrix of soil particles (see the ﬁ  gure). They are easily damaged, making it difﬁ  cult to directly observe their activities under undisturbed conditions. On page 1615 of this issue, Clemmensen et al. ( 1) use isotopic and molecular techniques to infer that a common group of fungi, the mycorrhizal fungi, can sequester carbon in the soil. This is important because carbon stored in soil over long periods can help to offset the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Most fungal species act as decomposers that elicit a net release of CO2 to the atmosphere, but mycorrhizal fungi could be a notable exception.Mycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with most plant roots, helping the plants to take up nutrients from soil. As a result, plants that are colonized by these fungi often grow much faster ( 2). Essentially, the fungi augment the removal of atmospheric CO2 by their plant hosts (see the ﬁ  gure). A portion of that car-bon is then allocated to the mycorrhizal fungi, which use it to build hyphae that extend into the soil ( 3). Once these hyphae die, the car-bon in their tissues could be quickly decom-posed by other soil microbes, or it could remain in the soil for years to decades. The longer the mycorrhizal carbon remains in the soil, the greater the potential contribution to soil carbon sequestration. Thus, it is critical to understand the fate of mycorrhizal carbon in ecosystems.To address this issue, Clemmensen et al. investigated a set of boreal forest islands that differ in their wildﬁ  re history and soil car-bon accumulation. They used a mathemati-cal model to partition soil carbon stocks into carbon derived from aboveground plant litter or from roots and root-associated fungi. This modeling approach revealed that as much as 70% of soil carbon was root-derived, par-ticularly deeper in the soil where root densi-ties were highest. The model ﬁ  ndings were corroborated by molecular analyses, which showed that mycorrhizal and other root-asso-ciated fungi dominated deeper soils, whereas decomposer fungi were only abundant in shallow soils. Furthermore, stable isotope signatures of soil organic matter most closely resembled that of mycorrhizal fungi.These ﬁ  ndings highlight the central role of mycorrhizal fungi in soil carbon seques-tration in boreal forests. Historically, ecosys-tem ecologists have focused on how quickly the carbon in dead plant leaves is converted to CO2 by decomposers. Y et recent work indi-cates that the carbon compounds that remain in the soil over the long term have been pro-duced by fungi and other microbes, not by plants ( 4). These microbially derived com-pounds are extremely diverse and are thus difﬁ  cult for decomposers to target ( 5). They can include remnants of cell walls, such as chitin, glucans, peptidoglycans, or polysac-charides ( 6). Microbial residues react with one another and with other components of the soil to form materials that cannot be eas-ily converted to CO2. It makes sense that organic compounds produced by mycorrhi-zal fungi would ﬁ  t this scenario.Mycorrhizal fungi are a dominant com-ponent of the microbial community in soils. Changes in their abundance (and hence in their contribution to carbon sequestration) could therefore have global consequences ( 7). Two groups of mycorrhizal fungi, ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi, are especially common in high-latitude systems ( 8). They dominated the deeper soils in the study by Clemmensen et al. At least some of these fungi respond to elements of global change. For instance, ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to proliferate when exposed to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and decline after nitrogen enrichment (which is common in ecosystems surrounding urban and agricultural areas) ( 7). Any ectomycorrhizal contributions to carbon sequestration could change in concert.In northern forests, wildﬁ  res may also alter the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to sequester carbon in soil on short and long time scales. Wildﬁ  res decrease the abundance of ectomy-corrhizal fungi, and reduced fungal abun-dance after wildﬁ  res can persist for several years ( 9). On millennial time scales, Clem-mensen et al. found that mycorrhizal fungi make smaller contributions to soil carbon in more frequently burned boreal forests, poten-tially because dead fungal tissues decay faster in these soils. Given that climate warming is likely to increase the occurrence of wildﬁ  res in northern forests ( 10), mycorrhizal con-tributions to soil carbon sequestration may decline in these regions.Many questions remain regarding the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on carbon cycling within ecosystems. For example, it remains to be shown whether certain residues of ericoid or ectomycorrhizal fungi consis-tently contribute to soil carbon storage.

Plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during pho-tosynthesis and direct a portion of this carbon belowground to roots, where it is transferred to mycor-rhizal fungi. The fungi then incor-porate some of this carbon into hyphae. Once hyphae die and decompose, residues of the carbon are converted to organic material in the soil. Clemmensen et al. sug-gest that this process may contrib-ute to long-term carbon storage in soils.

Hrycyna 2  Structures of membrane metalloproteases provide the basis for understanding mutations associated with premature aging.        Mutations in the genes encoding the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A or the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 cause the devastating premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Guilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and the related progeroid disorders restrictive dermopathy (RD) and mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD-B) ( 1– 4). Children with HGPS, for example, manifest accelerated aging symptoms, including fail-ure to thrive, hair loss, joint ailments, lipo-dystrophy, and cardiovascular disease, typi-cally dying from the latter in their mid-teens. In all of these progeroid disorders, a persis-tently farnesylated and methylated form of lamin A is the “molecular culprit,” exert-ing dominant-negative effects that promote aging-related symptoms ( 1). On pages 1604 and 1600 of this issue, Quigley et al. ( 5) and Pryor et al. ( 6) report the three-dimensional crystal structures of the human zinc metallo-protease ZMPSTE24 and its yeast homolog, Ste24p. These proteases play critical roles in two steps of the posttranslational matu-ration of human lamin A and the yeast mat-ing pheromone a-factor, respectively ( 7– 9). ZMPSTE24 and Ste24p are multispanning membrane proteins and as such, determin-ing their structures by x-ray crystallography represents a substantial accomplishment. The structures should lead to a better understand-ing of how these enzymes function and how they are associated with aging.The ZMPSTE24 substrate lamin A main-tains the structural integrity of the nucleus. It is synthesized as a precursor, prelamin A, that terminates in a C-terminal CAAX motif (where C is cysteine, A is generally an ali-phatic amino acid, and X is any residue). Like all CAAX proteins, prelamin A under-goes three sequential posttranslational mod-iﬁ  cations including isoprenylation of cyste-ine with a farnesyl lipid moiety, endoproteo-lytic removal of the -AAX peptide by ZMP-STE24 (or by RCE1), and carboxyl meth-ylation ( 1,  2) (see the ﬁ  gure). Unlike most other CAAX proteins, however, prelamin A undergoes a second cleavage event, also mediated by ZMPSTE24, to yield mature lamin A. This second cleavage removes the last 15 amino acids of the protein, including the newly modiﬁ  ed C terminus ( 4,  7– 9).

In the hypothetical reaction scheme shown, the C terminus of lamin A (blue), which has been modiﬁ  ed with a farnesyl moiety (green line), enters the cavity through a gap in the chamber wall between two transmembrane spans, and aligns in the Zn2+ active site. ZMPSTE24 removes the -AAX peptide. The membrane protein ICMT then methylates (Me) lamin A. This is followed by removal of the modiﬁ  ed C terminus by ZMPSTE24 and the release of lamin A.1Department of Cell Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. 2Depart-ment of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.

HAMMOND/SCIENCEglycoprotein glomalin produced by arbuscu-lar mycorrhizal fungi (another major group) is thought to reside for decades in the soil ( 11). It is not clear whether analogous com-pounds are constructed by other mycorrhi-zal fungi and under what conditions. Another open question is whether ericoid and ectomy-corrhizal fungi conduct decomposition them-selves. Many members of these groups have the physiological capacity to break down and take up soil organic material ( 8), which could ultimately result in the production of CO2. Finally, the extent to which mycorrhizal fungi improve plant growth can also determine how much carbon is deposited in the soil via dead plant material. It is the sum of these three pro-cesses—deposition of mycorrhizal residues, decomposition by mycorrhizal fungi, and augmentation of plant growth—that deter-mines how mycorrhizal fungi affect carbon storage.
