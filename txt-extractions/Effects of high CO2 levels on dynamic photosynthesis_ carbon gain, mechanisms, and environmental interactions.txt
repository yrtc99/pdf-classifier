Few studies have examined the influence of environmental fac -tors on effects of high levels of CO2 on dynamic photosyn -thesis. We identified several knowledge gaps that should be addressed to aid future predictions of photosynthesis in high-CO2 environments.Keywords  Carbon dioxide  · Dynamic photosynthesis  · Elevated CO2 · Fluctuating irradiance  · Lightfleck  · SunfleckIntroductionThere is growing concern over elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Pachauri et  al. 2014 ). Terrestrial plant pho -tosynthesis is a key process of models constructed for pre -dicting the increase in atmospheric CO2 or for assessment of its mitigating role in suppression of CO2 increase. Most of these models are based on knowledge obtained under steady-state conditions, including constant light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, and other air conditions such as airflow rate and water vapor density.However, plant photosynthesis in nature, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems, never occurs under steady-state con -ditions. Photosynthetic activity changes over various time scales due to temporal variation in photosynthetic resources and environmental conditions. For example, light inten -sity is often referred to as the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD or PFD) and varies temporally in nature, fluctuating 100s of times within seconds in plant canopies or at forest floors (e.g. Pearcy 1999 ; Pearcy et  al. 1996 ; Abstract  Understanding the photosynthetic responses of terrestrial plants to environments with high levels of CO2 is essential to address the ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2. Most photosynthetic models used for global carbon issues are based on steady-state photosyn -thesis, whereby photosynthesis is measured under constant environmental conditions; however, terrestrial plant photo -synthesis under natural conditions is highly dynamic, and photosynthetic rates change in response to rapid changes in environmental factors. To predict future contributions of photosynthesis to the global carbon cycle, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photosynthesis in rela -tion to high CO2 levels. In this review, we summarize the current body of knowledge on the photosynthetic response to changes in light intensity under experimentally elevated CO2 conditions. We found that short-term exposure to high CO2 enhances photosynthetic rate, reduces photosynthetic induction time, and reduces post-illumination CO2 burst, resulting in increased leaf carbon gain during dynamic photosynthesis. However, long-term exposure to high CO2 during plant growth has varying effects on dynamic photo -synthesis. High levels of CO2 increase the carbon gain in photosynthetic induction in some species, but have no sig -nificant effects in other species. Some studies have shown Responses of the Photosynthetic Systems to Spatio-temporal Variations in Light Environments: Scaling and Eco-devo Approaches * Hajime Tomimatsu  tomimatsu.hajime@nies.go.jp * Yanhong Tang  tangyh@nies.go.jp; tangyh@pku.edu.cn1 Present Address: Department of  Ecology, College of Urban and  Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing  100871, China2 Center for  Environmental Biology and  Ecosystem Studies, National Institute for  Environmental Studies, Onogawa 16 -2, Tsukuba  305-0053, Japan366 J Plant Res (2016) 129:365–3771 3Tang et al. 1988, see Fig. 1 for example). The photosyn-thetic machinery of plants senses and responds to variation in PFD at all temporal scales, from milliseconds to years (e.g. Baldocchi et al. 2001; Katul et al. 2001; Pearcy and Pfitsch 1995). It is important to understand how such tem-poral variation in photosynthesis will change in the future as global CO2 levels increase. The recent rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 has shifted academic focus towards understanding photosynthesis in the natural environment. This has led to the publication of many studies on photo-synthesis, expanding from traditional steady-state models to more realistic dynamic models (e.g. Kaiser et al. 2015; Rascher and Nedbal 2006). The processes, mechanisms, and ecological consequences of dynamic photosynthesis in response to high levels of CO2 could differ from those of steady-state photosynthesis (Kaiser et al. 2015); therefore, it is necessary to understand dynamic photosynthesis under high-CO2 conditions to reliably assess and predict future photosynthesis in natural environments with high levels of CO2. However, the current understanding of dynamic pho-tosynthesis related to high CO2 levels is limited.Dynamic photosynthesis can be viewed as two inde-pendent processes: first, photosynthetic rates increase after an increase in PFD, and second, photosynthetic rates decrease after a decrease in PFD. The increase in photo-synthetic rate after a sudden increase in PFD is called the photosynthetic induction response (see details in “Introduc-tion” section; Fig. 2), which has been of increasing interest in recent decades (e.g. Pearcy et al. 1994; Way and Pearcy 2012). The induction response limits light-use efficiency, and the degree of limitation varies depending on the physi-ology and biochemistry of the leaf photosynthetic system, photosynthetic resources, and environmental conditions such as CO2 concentration. The photosynthetic induction response can be divided into three different but highly interactive sub-processes: electron transport, changes in the stomata system, and the photosynthetic enzyme sys-tem (Chazdon 1988; Pearcy et al. 1994; Pearcy and Way 2012; Tikhonov 2015). These sub-processes greatly depend on CO2 concentration and are expected to differ in high-CO2 environments (e.g. Chazdon and Pearcy 1986; Knapp et al. 1994; Naumburg and Ellsworth 2000). When PFD Fig. 1  Sunlight penetrating through forest canopy (a), sun-flecks on leaves (b) and diurnal change of photosynthetic pho-ton flux density (PPFD) in a gap (red color) and the understory (blue color) on the forest floor in Malaysia’s Pasoh Forest Reserve (2°59′N, 102°18′E).

The photosynthetic CO2 uptake process after PFD decrease is often referred to as post-illumination CO2 assimilation, which is also highly affected by environmental CO2.We reviewed studies that have experimentally examined elevated CO2 levels on photosynthesis in response to tem-poral variation in PFD within seconds–hours. For a broader review of dynamic photosynthesis, we recommend two excellent papers (Kaiser et al. 2015; Way and Pearcy 2012). We focused on the effects of experimentally high levels of CO2 on the physiological effects, acclimation changes, and leaf carbon gain in dynamic photosynthesis, as well as the major mechanisms involved in and eco-physiological effects of environmental factors on the dynamic photosyn-thetic response to high levels of CO2.Time course and carbon gain of dynamic photosynthesis under high CO2Time course studies provide important observations of dynamic systems. There are three types of time course studies that have been used to observe CO2 gas exchange in dynamic photosynthesis: photosynthetic induction after increases in light, post-illumination CO2 assimilation after decreases in light, and response to a series of short light-flecks or fluctuating light. High levels of CO2 are expected to affect all of these responses, but information on post-illumination assimilation and the photosynthetic response to short light-flecks is much more limited than that on the induction response.Typically, the time course of photosynthetic induction after an increase of PFD can be arbitrarily divided into three phases (Fig. 2). The first phase, thought depending on leaf induction state, is very short and often completes within the first 1–2 min (Pearcy 2007). The second phase includes mainly Rubisco activation, often taking 5–10 min. The third phase typically takes 10–30 min, which is domi-nated by stomata opening. There are three major limiting processes involved in the induction time course, which are RuBP regeneration, Rubisco activaion and stomatal movement.In general, high-CO2 conditions have previously been used in two ways: to measure photosynthesis only or to both grow plants and assess their photosynthesis. For con-venience, the former is herein referred to as “short-term eCO2” and the latter is referred to as “long-term eCO2”. Short-term eCO2 exposure usually lasts minutes–hours, while long-term exposure occurs for months–years, depending on the experimental design. Short-term eCO2 exposure only stimulates the physiological responses of Fig. 2  Representative responses of CO2 assimilation rate of P . euramericana cv. I-55 grown at 380 and 700 μmol CO2 mol−1 air.

There is a large body of knowledge on the effects of short- and long-term CO2 exposure on steady-state photosynthesis (Ainsworth and Long 2005; Ainsworth and Rogers 2007; Long et al. 2004), but very little on dynamic photosynthesis (Kaiser et al. 2015).Effects of short-term elevated CO2 on dynamic photosynthesisChazdon and Pearcy (1986) reported a dataset on the effects of short-term CO2 on photosynthetic induction response in the herbaceous species Alocasia macrorrhiza (Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that showed the short-term response of photosynthetic induction to dif-ferent CO2 levels. In addition, two points should be taken from this report. First, despite the fact that the steady-state assimilation rate at high PFD increased with increasing ambient CO2, the time course of photosynthetic induction differed depending on the measurement CO2 level rang-ing from 130–1,284 µmol CO2 mol−1 [Table 2 in Chaz-don and Pearcy (1986)]. At the CO2 concentration below 200 μmol mol−1, photosynthetic rate increased slowly and continuously with time. However, under CO2 concentra-tions above 200 μmol mol−1, the change in photosynthetic rate showed two phases: an early rapid increasing phase followed by a slow and sigmoidal increasing phase. This biphasic nature of the induction was more pronounced at the highest CO2 concentration (Chazdon and Pearcy 1986). This is notable, as it suggests that physiological events at different time points during the induction process may be associated with different mechanisms. For example, Kirschbaum and Pearcy (1988a) indicated that high levels of CO2 enhanced only the second phase of photosynthetic induction in the same species. Second, the full photosyn-thetic induction reported in Chazdon and Pearcy (1986) occurred quicker under higher CO2 concentration. These two studies suggest that short-term eCO2 results in higher carbon uptake in photosynthetic induction response than ambient and low CO2 levels in herbaceous plants.Tomimatsu et al. (2014) conducted the first experi-ment on the effects of short-term eCO2 on tree species in natural environments. Comparing the effects of 350 and 700 μmol mol−1 CO2 on photosynthesis under a simu-lated sunfleck in Dipterocarpus sublamellatus seedlings in a tropical forest floor in Malaysia confirmed that high lev-els of CO2 reduced the induction time and increased leaf carbon gain in seedlings. Both the initial and late induc-tion phases occurred more rapidly under high levels of CO2 than under low levels.Although time course studies have examined post-illumination assimilation and the CO2 burst period under Table 1  Charateristics of dynamic photosynthesis under “short-term” high CO2 conditionsLUE lightfleck (or sunfleck) use efficiencya IT50% and IT90% indicate induction time required to reach 50 and 90 % of the steady-state in photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) following an increase of PFDSpecies Herbaceous  or tree[CO2] (ppm) Induction time of A (min)aA (μmol CO2 m−2s−1) Induction time of gs (min)ags (mol H2O m−2s−1) LUE (%)ReferencesGrowth Measurement IT50% IT90% Low-light High-light IT50% IT90% Low-light High-light(PFD = 10) (PFD = 500) (PFD = 10) (PFD = 500)A. macrorrhiza Herbaceous 360 130 1.1 19.0 – 1.1 – – – – – Chazdon and Pearcy (1986)360 200 5.3 23.2 – 2.0 – – – – –360 640 4.6 14.7 – 6.0 – – – – –360 844 5.9 13.3 – 5.8 – – – – –360 1284 2.0 11.7 – 7.5 – – – – –(PFD = 50) (PFD = 500) (PFD = 50) (PFD = 500)D. sublamellatus Tree Ambient 350 0.8 7.3 1.9 4.6 8.1 17.4 0.07 0.10 91.9 Tomimatsu et al.

Tomimatsu et al. (2014) found that short-term eCO2 exposure enhanced photosynthetic light-use efficiency in post-illumination CO2 fixation, although the relative contribution was small, partly because the simulated sunfleck lasted for a long time (30 min) and only one sunfleck was applied. It is expected that short-term eCO2 should enhance light-use efficiency and increase leaf carbon gain in post-illumination CO2 fixa-tion under short, frequent sunflecks.There is no data available on the effects of short-term eCO2 on photosynthetic responses to a series of light-flecks. Marin et al. (2014) found no significant differ -ences in the net photosynthetic carbon gain under 260–490 µmol CO2 mol−1 air in their study examining leaf energy balance in response to dynamic light. In the morn-ing, atmospheric CO2 within plant canopies or on the for -est floor varies considerably diurnally and seasonally. For example, in the morning, CO2 concentration near the for -est floor can be higher than the average CO2 outside the forest by as much as about 100 µmol CO2 mol−1 air (Baz-zaz and Williams 1991; Buchmann et al. 1996; Day et al. 2002). Therefore, it would be useful to know the contribu-tion of short-term eCO2 to leaf carbon gain in understory plants where PFD is often very limited (Tomimatsu et al. 2014). This research group examined CO2 gas exchange in response to an artificial light-fleck in D. sublamellatus seedlings under 350 and 700 µmol CO2 mol−1 air in a tropi-cal rain forest. The total photosynthetic carbon gain from the light-fleck was about two times greater under high lev-els of CO2 than under low levels. The increase in light-fleck use efficiency contributed to 7 % of the increased carbon gain, most of which was due to a reduction in photosyn-thetic induction time under high levels of CO2. This sug-gests that short-term eCO2 increase photosynthetic light use efficiency under both steady-state and fluctuating light conditions, which should be considered when assessing the leaf carbon gain of understory plants.Effects of long-term elevated CO2 on dynamic photosynthesisSeveral studies have examined the effects of CO2 levels on dynamic photosynthesis using long-term eCO2 exposure (Table 2) (Holisova et al. 2012; Knapp et al. 1994; Kos-vancova et al. 2009; Leakey et al. 2002; Naumburg and Ellsworth 2000; Tomimatsu and Tang 2012). Knapp et al. (1994) conducted the first experiment to examine dynamic photosynthetic responses under long-term eCO2 expo-sure, which is perhaps the only study to have examined the dynamic photosynthesis of C4 grass in relation to high levels of CO2. In a grassland dominated by C4 grasses in Kansas, USA, Andropogon gerardii Vitman was exposed to high levels of CO2 (double the ambient level) continuously throughout the growing season of about 3 months. Stoma-tal and photosynthetic responses to different temporal PFD patterns were measured in plants under high and ambient CO2. The study found that C4 grass appeared to have a fast stomatal response to elevated CO2, due to both a high ini-tial stomatal conductance and rapid stomata opening under high levels of CO2. Because the leaves exposed to high lev-els of CO2 developed and grew under such conditions, the change in initial stomatal conductance and opening speed was possibly due to acclimation. Stomatal response to high levels of CO2 may be relatively more important in dynamic photosynthesis in C4 plants than C3 plants, but few studies have examined the effects of high levels of CO2 on photo-synthesis under fluctuating light in C4 plants. In this study, the maximum photosynthetic rate and carbon gain during induction response did not differ significantly between plants exposed to high and ambient levels of CO2.The effects of high levels of CO2 on dynamic photo-synthesis in C3 plants are not consistent in the literature. Naumburg and Ellsworth (2000) conducted the first study to examine the effects of long-term eCO2 on dynamic photosynthesis in C3 plants. In a free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in the understory of a Pinus taeda plan-tation, two shade-tolerant species (Acer rubrum and Cor -nus florida) and two shade-intolerant species (Liquidambar styraciflua and Liriodendron tulipifera) were grown under ambient and ambient + 200 ppm CO2 conditions to assess potential differences in dynamic photosynthesis between the tree types under high levels of CO2. High CO2 levels had no significant effects on induction gain on any of the species throughout the day but extended the post-illumina-tion assimilation period in all species after light decrease. Hence, high levels of CO2 would be expected to increase the leaf carbon gain under fluctuating light.After growing seedlings of the tropical tree Shorea lep-rosula in 711 and 376 ppm of CO2 for 216 days, Leakey et al. (2002) examined the effects of high levels of CO2 on both steady-state and dynamic photosynthesis. As expected, long-term treatment increased carbon gain in leaves under both steady-state and fluctuating light environ-ments. Interestingly, the gain was greater under dynamic light conditions. This was ascribed to the greater light fleck use efficiency under high-CO2 conditions (Leakey et al. 2002, 2005). This high efficiency was due to a combination of faster carbon gain, slower carbon loss, increased post-illumination CO2 fixation, and decreased post-irradiance CO2 burst (Leakey et al. 2005).Kosvancova et al. (2009) examined dynamic photosyn-thesis in the broadleaved Fagus sylvatica and coniferous Picea abies after exposure to 385 and 700 µmol CO2 mol−1 370 J Plant Res (2016) 129:365–3771 3Table 2  Charateristics of dynamic photosynthesis under “long-term” high CO2 conditionsSpecies Herbaceous  or tree[CO2] (ppm) Induction time of A (min)aA (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) Induction time  of gs (min)ags (mol H2O m−2 s−1)LUE (%)ReferencesGrowth Measurement IT50% IT90% Low-light High-light IT50% IT90% Low-lightHigh-light(PFD  = ~50)(PFD  = ~1000)(PFD  = ~50)(PFD  = ~1000)A. rubrum Tree Ambient Ambient – 4.0 1.25 6.6 – 11.2 0.02 0.12 – Naumburg and Ellsworth (2000)+200 +200 – – 1.5 9.5 – – 0.02 0.08 –C. florida Tree Ambient Ambient – 8.8 1.25 4.7 0.0 14.5 0.03 0.07 –+200 +200 – – 1.8 9.5 – – 0.03 0.08 –L. styraciflua Tree Ambient Ambient – 7.2 0.9 6.4 – 17.5 0.03 0.11 –+200 +200 – – 1.7 10.5 – – 0.03 0.12 –L. tulipifera Tree Ambient Ambient – 5.0 1.5 5.8 – 13.5 0.05 0.12 –+200 +200 – – 1.9 7.1 – – 0.04 0.09 –(PFD  = 30)(PFD  = 525)(PFD  = 30)(PFD  = 525)S. leprosula Tree 376 350 1.2 13.6 0.7 4.9 2.5 3.8 0.04 0.12 90.5 Leakey et al.

Leaves that developed in high levels of CO2 exhibited a faster initial induction response. The same group reported that high levels of CO2 increased dynamic photosynthetic carbon gain under fluctuating light conditions in the same two species (Holisova et al. 2012). Furthermore, we previously found that the photosynthetic induction response is faster and leaf carbon gain is higher in leaves exposed to high levels of CO2 for about 3 months compared to leaves in low levels of CO2 (Tomimatsu and Tang 2012).There is little information on whether or how dynamic photosynthesis in terrestrial plants may acclimate to fluctu-ating light and high levels of CO2, but it could potentially be influenced by the acclimation of stomata morphology and enzyme levels. Leakey et al. (2002) showed that the photosynthetic capacity of dipterocarp seedlings acclimated to elevated CO2 levels but not to sunfleck conditions. We previously examined the dynamic photosynthetic responses of two Populus species grown under different CO2 regimes to assess the effects of CO2 acclimation (Tomimatsu and Tang, unpublished data). In both species, the photosyn-thetic induction response was consistently faster under high rather than low levels of CO2. We further assessed the sto-matal conductance during the induction response and found that stomatal conductance was consistently higher in the high than the low CO2 plants under the same measuring CO2 concentrations.Mechanisms involved in dynamic photosynthesis under high CO2Photosynthetic inductionAs we explained above, photosynthetic induction after an increase of PFD consists of three major phases (Fig. 2), which are regulated by different major mecha-nisms (Fig. 3). In general, the first phase of photosynthetic induction consists of an almost instantaneous increase in CO2 assimilation through the metabolite pool and enzyme activation available already in the low light, and rapid light activation of enzymes in the RuBP regeneration (Kirsch-baum and Pearcy 1988b; Pearcy 1990). The second induc-tion phase is often much slower and is regulated by the light activation requirement of Rubisco and other Calvin-cycle enzymes. The third phase is mainly controlled by sto-mata opening.Photosynthetic electron transportFluctuating light provides most of the photosynthetic energy in many natural environments, and the high PFD in fluctuating light acts as a stressor to photosynthetic Table 2  continued(No data) (PFD  = 1500)(No data) (PFD  = 1500)P . abies Tree 385 385 – – – 10.3 – – – 0.11 – Holisova et al.

Photosynthetic electron transport (PET) is important in regulating photosynthetic machinery to use fluctuating light while avoiding light stress (e.g. Hor -ton et al. 1996; Kono and Terashima 2014; Rochaix 2011). However, there is little information on the effects of high levels of CO2 on PET under fluctuating light.Based on current knowledge of the regulation of PET under steady-state conditions (Foyer et al. 2012), one can expect that both linear electron transport and cyclic elec-tron transport should play a role in dynamic photosyn-thesis under high levels of CO2. For example, high lev-els of CO2 stimulate Calvin-Benson cycle turnover and increase electron flow through PSII, which affects the photosynthetic response to changes in light (Tikhonov 2015). In addition, high levels of CO2 alter the cyclic PET performed by the thylakoid Ndh complex (Martin et al. 2015). For example, examining the functional rel-evance of this complex in relation to dynamic photosyn-thesis under ambient and high levels of CO2 in tobacco plants showed that Ndh-defective plants (due to an ndh  gene defect) showed slower photosynthetic responses to increases in light at high levels of CO2 compared to ambi-ent levels.RuBP regenerationIn C3 plants, RuBP serves as a CO2 receptor, and the size of the RuBP pool is a key factor determining the rate of pho-tosynthesis. The amount of RuBP available for photosyn-thesis depends on the extent of RuBP regeneration, which is mainly affected by the rates of electron transport and the Calvin cycle. Changes in PFD duration and temporal patterns, CO2 concentration, and other environmental fac-tors can affect RuBP regeneration. Under constant PFD conditions, high levels of CO2 promote CO2 fixation and stimulate the Calvin cycle, thereby increasing RuBP regen-eration (Ainsworth and Rogers 2007).There is very little information on the effects of high CO2 levels on RuBP regeneration in dynamic photosynthe-sis. In one study, after an increase in PFD, the photosyn-thetic rate showed an initial increase within seconds and then increased again for several minutes, which was pos-sibly limited by RuBP regeneration. This rapid increase in CO2 uptake was accelerated by high levels of CO2 (Kirsch-baum and Pearcy 1988a). In addition, we previously found that the initial photosynthetic rate is greatly increased when CO2 levels are high (Tomimatsu and Tang 2012).Rubisco activase and Rubisco activationRubisco activase catalyzes the release of inhibitors from Rubisco and affects Rubisco activity. This process requires ATP and is influenced by temperature and CO2 lev-els. Rubisco activase may be one of the most important enzymes in dynamic photosynthesis. Yamori et al. (2012) compared the photosynthetic induction response among plants with different levels of Rubisco activase (i.e., over -expressed, normal levels in wild-type plants, and reduced levels in antisense plants). They found that plants with higher levels had a more rapid induction response, and concluded that Rubisco activase has a more important role regulating dynamic photosynthesis than steady-state photo-synthesis. Another study found that manipulating Rubisco activase regulation enhanced dynamic photosynthesis (e.g. Carmo-Silva and Salvucci 2013; Soleh et al. 2016).

We previously found that induction limitations after long-term eCO2 exposure seemed to be at least partially attributable to an increased Rubisco activase:Rubisco ratio in one Populus species (unpublished data, Tomimatsu and Tang).Plants grown under long-term high-CO2 environ-ments tend to have lower Rubisco levels or activity (Sage et al. 1989; Sage 1994) compared to plants grown in low-CO2 environments. If the rates of increase are constant, a smaller maximum Rubisco activity or lower maximum stomatal conductance should be reached more rapidly in plants exposed to high levels of CO2 than those exposed to low CO2. This leads to the hypothesis that plants exposed to high levels of CO2 should have a faster photosynthetic induction response than those exposed to low CO2 levels.Post-illumination CO2 assimilationAfter a decrease in PFD, the photosynthetic rate drops quickly, usually within seconds (Fig. 2 ). The contribution of post-illumination CO2 fixation to carbon gain in leaves is often not significant, but it may play a substantial role in light environments with many short sunflecks and in high-CO2 environments (Pearcy 1994; Sharkey et al. 1986). CO2 fixation immediately after a decrease in PFD is due to bio-chemical intermediates, including Calvin cycle intermediates, NADPH, and ATP (Laisk et al. 1984; Sharkey et al. 1986). The amount of these intermediates depends on the duration and intensity of previous light conditions, photosynthetic rate, and other environmental conditions such as CO2 concentra-tion. The data on the effects of high levels of CO2 on post-illumination CO2 fixation are not consistent in the literature (e.g. Laisk and Edwards 1997; Tomimatsu et al. 2014; Vines et al. 1983, see discussion and citations in Leakey et al. 2002). Further studies are needed to clarify this issue and improve estimations of carbon gains in leaves under fluctuating light environments and to improve plants themselves.The leaves of C3 plants often show a CO2 burst after a decrease in light (Fig. 2). This burst is due to photores-piratory metabolites (Fig. 3). The burst size depends on environmental conditions, including light intensity, CO2 concentration, photosynthetic metabolites such as RuBP, photosynthetic enzymes such as Rubisco, and subsequent photorespiratory metabolism (for details, see Pearcy 1990). Because photorespiration is suppressed by CO2, high lev-els of this gas should reduce the post-illumination burst. Several studies have confirmed this, under both short-term (Laisk and Edwards 1997; Tomimatsu et al. 2014; Vines et al. 1983) and long-term CO2 exposure (Leakey et al. 2002).Effects of high levels of CO2 on stomatal conductance and dynamic photosynthesisUnderstanding stomatal conductance in response to fluctua-tions in light is key to understanding dynamic photosynthe-sis. Both long- and short-term eCO2 exposure are expected to result in a decrease in stomatal conductance under con-stant light and increase the opening rate in response to changes in PFD (e.g. Ainsworth and Long 2005; Kosvan-cova et al. 2009; Tomimatsu et al. 2014; Tomimatsu and Tang 2012), although we found that high CO2 increased stomatal conductance under low PFD in our unpublished data. However, the mechanisms involved may differ some-what between long- and short-term exposures. In general, stomatal size and density decrease with long-term increases in CO2 concentration (Franks and Beerling 2009; Wood-ward and Kelly 1995). These morphological changes, which are due to acclimation to high-CO2 environments, can result in lower stomatal conductance. Instantaneous increases in CO2 also reduce stomatal conductance, but this is only due to a decrease in stomatal aperture without any changes in quantity or size.The rapid increase in stomatal conductance after an increase in PFD under high levels of CO2 may be ascribed to the rapid opening of stomata, a high initial stomatal con-ductance before the increase in PFD, and a decreased maxi-mum stomatal conductance at the higher PFD.Knapp et al. (1994) reportedly observed rapid opening of stomata during photosynthetic induction in a C4 plant (A. gerardii) growing under high levels of CO2. However, there is no further evidence to confirm in the finding in either C4 or C3 plants. Increased stomatal conductance under low PFD or decreased conductance under high PFD could indicate rapid stomatal opening. However, observations in relation to these speculations are conflicting. In F . sylvat-ica L. and P . abies, a reduction in the maximum stomatal conductance was reported in plants under high levels of CO2, which has been ascribed to contribute to the observed improvements in rapid induction (Kosvancova et al. 2009). We have shown that the effects of long-term eCO2 on sto-matal conductance differ among plant species and PFD conditions. In Populus euramericana cv. I-55, high levels of CO2 increased stomatal conductance under low PFD but reduced conductance under high PFD (Tables 1 and 2). However, in Populus koreana × trichocarpa cv. Peace, high levels of CO2 increased stomatal conductance under all experimental PFD conditions (Tomimatsu and Tang 2012). Conversely, some studies have found that stoma-tal conductance does not significantly change under high levels of CO2 during photosynthetic induction, despite an 374 J Plant Res (2016) 129:365–3771 3increase in induction speed (Leakey et al. 2005; Naumburg and Ellsworth 2000).In conclusion, it is currently unclear how long-term exposure to high levels of CO2 affects stomatal conduct-ance in dynamic photosynthesis, as there are several knowl-edge gaps. For example, it is not known how stomatal accli-mation to long-term eCO2 exposure and the instantaneous response to different PFDs contribute to dynamic photosyn-thesis. Similarly, long-term eCO2 reduces maximum sto-matal conductance, which should enhance rapid changes in stomatal conductance during induction responses; however, long-term eCO2 also makes stomata larger, which should lead to a slower stomatal response (Drake et al. 2013), as larger stomata take longer to open and close (Raven 2014). It is unknown how these two opposite forces affect the overall speed of stomatal conductance. Stomatal perfor -mance is critical to the dynamic response of photosynthe-sis in natural environments, therefore, studies are needed to clarify their contributions to dynamic photosynthesis under high-CO2 conditions.Biotic and abiotic factors related to the effects of high CO2 levels on dynamic photosynthesisEffects of isoprene emissions on dynamic photosynthesis under high levels of CO2Some plants emit isoprene from leaves, which has received increasing interest in the last two decades (Sharkey et al. 2008). Isoprene emissions may help maintain dynamic photosynthesis by protecting the photosynthetic system from heat and light stress induced by high PFD sunflecks, thereby benefiting the carbon gain by leaves under fluctuat-ing light and temporally high temperature conditions (Shar -key et al. 2008; Way et al. 2011).Based on the thermotolerance hypothesis of isoprene emissions, it was expected that leaves in high-CO2 environ-ments should emit more isoprene as a protection from heat stress, as high levels of CO2 reduces stomatal conductance, increasing leaf temperature (Sharkey et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al. 2009). Therefore, dynamic photosyn-thesis in isoprene-emitting plants such as understory plants in humid tropical forests should benefit from high-CO2 conditions. However, many observations do not support this hypothesis and show that high levels of CO2 reduce isoprene emissions (Sharkey et al. 2008). Way et al. (2011) reported that electron transport rates recovered better under sunfleck conditions in isoprene-emitting plants. However, no evidence showed that high levels of CO2 enhanced iso-prene-related tolerance of heat- and light-stressed photo-synthesis. These results suggested that isoprene biosynthe-sis may have evolved at low CO2 concentrations, where its physiological effect is greatest, and that elevated CO2 will reduce the functional benefit of isoprene in the near future. Other hypotheses have been presented (Sharkey et al. 2008) to explain the inconsistencies. Further field studies on the effects of isoprene emissions on dynamic photosynthesis should be conducted to clarify this topic.Relationship between water and dynamic photosynthesis under high levels of CO2Water levels in leaves and in the environment, including in soil and in air, should affect dynamic photosynthesis, mainly because these factors affect stomatal responses to fluctuating light (e.g. Tinoco-Ojanguren and Pearcy 1993). Water stress may shorten the photosynthetic induction time by decreasing stomatal conductance. Under high levels of CO2, stomatal conductance generally decreases, which should in turn reduce water loss during dynamic photosyn-thesis (Tang and Liang 2000). However, few studies have assessed the effects of high CO2 levels on water use during dynamic photosynthesis. In a CO2 enrichment experiment in grasslands, Knapp et al. (1994) found that a C4 grass had significantly lower water loss under elevated levels of CO2, due to a rapid stomatal response to fluctuating light and reduced stomatal conductance under low light. However, Marin et al. (2014) reported that under fluctuating light, tobacco leaves showed a significant increase in net photo-synthesis but little change in transpiration. They speculated that future increases in atmospheric CO2 would increase carbon gain in leaves but not change leaf transpiration. In another C3 plant species, D. sublamellatus, we found that accumulated water loss decreased during a single sun-fleck, although not significantly, in 700 µmol CO2 mol−1 air compared to 350 µmol CO2 mol−1 air (Tomimatsu et al. 2014). However, there are no reports that address whether water loss is reduced more during dynamic photosynthe-sis than during steady-state photosynthesis in high-CO2 environments.Effects of high levels of CO2 on dynamic photosynthesis in relation to plant fitnessFACE experiments have suggested that elevated CO2 should affect photosynthesis and growth to different extents among plant species (Ainsworth and Long 2005); therefore, dynamic photosynthesis under high levels of CO2 should also differ among species. For example, Rubisco content decreases under long-term acclimation to elevated CO2 (Ainsworth and Rogers 2007), which may affect dynamic photosynthesis.Naumburg and Ellsworth (2000) examined whether shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species had different photosynthetic responses to sunflecks under high levels of 375 J Plant Res (2016) 129:365–377 1 3CO2. They did not find a distinct difference but concluded that high levels of CO2 enhanced photosynthetic induction during both dynamic and steady-state photosynthesis (see Tables 1 and 2 ). Although independent studies have shown that plant species differ in their induction time and stoma-tal conductance responses after long-term eCO2 exposure, there is insufficient data to show a systematic difference in dynamic photosynthesis among different functional groups.Minor physiological changes in individual species can result in large ecological consequences in ecosystems. Changes in dynamic photosynthesis could potentially influ-ence the structure and function of ecosystems; some spe-cies grow better and have higher fitness than others, which could lead to further changes in the species composition of plant communities in a world with high levels of CO2. Kül-heim et al. (2002) provided evidence that rapid regulation of dynamic photosynthesis to variation in light contributed to plant fitness. Future studies should clarify the effects of minor physiological differences, such as dynamic photo-synthetic response to high levels of CO2, on plant fitness and species diversity in natural environments.ConclusionsThe global climate is changing not only in terms of increasing atmospheric CO2 but also in terms of increas-ing temperature, changes in spatiotemporal precipitation patterns and nitrogen deposition, along with other envi-ronmental changes. The effects of high levels of CO2 on dynamic photosynthesis will be affected by all of these environmental factors. However, there are few studies on how these factors in combination may affect dynamic pho-tosynthesis. Furthermore, the effects of high levels of CO2 on dynamic photosynthesis have been observed only in a limited number of plant species. Compared to studies on steady-state photosynthesis associated with high levels of CO2, there are few mechanistic studies on dynamic pho-tosynthesis under high-CO2 conditions. As a result, the current body of knowledge on dynamic photosynthesis under high levels of CO2 is insufficient to make reliable assessments and predictions of global climate change, and additional information on photosynthesis in natural envi-ronments is necessary. Finally, from an ecological perspec-tive, future studies should aim to understand how dynamic photosynthesis under high-CO2 conditions will contribute to species coexistence in light-limited ecosystems such as tropical forests.Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Ichiro Terashima and Dr. Hiroy-uki Muraoka for their invitation to this special issue, and their warm encouragement and patience during the preparation of this review paper.ReferencesAinsworth EA, Long SP (2005) What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?
