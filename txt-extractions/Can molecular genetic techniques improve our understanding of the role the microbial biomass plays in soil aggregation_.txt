Many studies have investigated soil structure formation andstability. However, the underlying mechanisms behind its formation are stilloften unclear, including how soil microorganisms regulate this process via theaggregation of soil particles. In this review, we seek to summarise currentinformation regarding how microorganisms influence aggregation and explorewhether the application of molecular genetic techniques has potential toincrease our understanding in this important area. Specifically, we review cur-rent information regarding the exact nature and role of microbially producedsoil binding agents (extracellular polymeric substances, glomalin, hydropho-bins and chaplins) and how different soil microorganisms (bacteria, archaea,fungi, protists) regulate and influence the production of these substances.Molecular genetic techniques have the capacity to provide new informationregarding the genetic make-up of the soil microbial biomass, which couldpotentially be related to their function in soil and role in the aggregation of soilparticles. However, more work is required to identify the key functional genesimportant for studying aggregation processes. Techniques better able to studythe fine scale distribution of microorganisms and microbial products are alsorequired to fully understand microbial interactions and functioning on a scalerelevant to aggregation. Future developments in this area may offer an oppor-tunity to improve our understanding of, and potentially manipulate, soil aggre-gation for the benefit of soil functioning and environments.KEYWORDSbacteria, extracellular polymeric substances, fungi, glomalin, virusesReceived: 30 January 2022 Revised: 28 August 2022 Accepted: 13 September 2022DOI: 10.1111/ejss.13307This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in anymedium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.© 2022 The Authors.

In turn, these biological func-tions are dependent on good soil physical structure. Soilstructure refers to the size, shape, and arrangement ofsolid soil particles and the pore spaces between them(Letey,1991 ; Sullivan et al., 2022 ). The individual min-eral components of the soil (sand, silt, and clay) formassociations with organic material and inorganic cement-ing agents (carbonate or iron and aluminium oxides) andaggregate together into clusters of soil particles (Figure1)(Dalal & Bridge, 1996 ; Letey, 1991 ; Sullivan et al., 2022 ;Wilpiszeski et al., 2019 ). This aggregation creates a net-work of air spaces of varying size called soil pores thatcreate a series of spatially heterogeneous habitats thatsupport a diverse range of microorganisms (Sullivanet al.,2022 ; Totsche et al., 2018 ; Wilpiszeski et al., 2019 ).Greater soil structural organisation and stability is typi-cally associated with indicators of good soil health, suchas increased soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage,greater biological activity, good soil aeration, high infil-tration rates and water storage, and reduced runoff, ero-sion, waterlogging, and emissions of greenhouse gasses(Bailey et al.,2019 ; Liu et al., 2019 ; Six et al., 2004 ;Tisdall & Oades, 1982 ; Wu et al., 2021 ).Aggregation and the establishment of a stable net-work of soil pore spaces are intricately linked to the activ-ities of the soil microbial biomass (Berg et al., 2020 ;Dalal & Bridge, 1996 ). The activity of the microbial bio-mass (bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists) plays a keyrole in producing the agents and structures that bind soilparticles together and create a stable soil structure. Inturn, soil particle aggregation and the arrangement ofpore spaces, play a critical role in regulating and protect-ing microbial activity due to their impact on the supplyof air, water, and metabolites (Nimmo,2005 ; Srivastavaet al., 2019 ).Soil aggregation and the formation of soil structure isa widely studied topic. There is abundant informationavailable regarding how this is influenced by soil type,environmental conditions (precipitation and tempera-ture), anthropogenic activities, plant type, and soil biolog-ical activity (Lavelle et al.,2020 ; Liu et al., 2019 ;Srivastava et al., 2019 ). However, the underlying mecha-nisms of aggregation and the formation of structure areoften still poorly understood (Lehmann & Rillig,2015 ;Trivedi et al., 2017 ). In particular, the interactionsbetween aggregated soil particles, the microenvironmentsthey create, and how the microbial communities presentinteract to create soil structures and regulate C and Ncycling are poorly understood (Schimel &Schaeffer,2012 ). We also have a poor understanding ofthe quantitative contribution that different groups ofbiota make to aggregation (Lehmann et al., 2017 ).Recent advances in techniques allowing us to exam-ine the soil microbial biomass at a genetic level have pro-vided the soil science community with an opportunity toexamine soil microbiology at a new level of detail. A bet-ter understanding of the diversity, abundance and behav-iour of the soil microbial biomass, including geneexpression, could help better understand the relationshipbetween microbial activity and the formation and stabil-ity of soil structure. Knowledge of functional genes insoils will allow us to recognise how microbes respond tochanging soil structure and environmental conditionsand elucidate how the activities of microbes are involvedin soil aggregation and stabilisation. However, whilethere has been an explosion in the use of genetic tech-niques to study various soil processes, their use to exam-ine soil aggregation is currently limited. It is thus the aimof this current review to examine the potential for genetictechniques to improve our understanding of soil aggrega-tion and summarise existing literature on the topic.2|T H ER O L EO FT H EM I C R O B I A LBIOMASS IN THE AGGREGATIONOF SOIL PARTICLESIt is widely believed that the soil microbial biomassplays an integral role in the aggregation of soil parti-cles. The stimulation of soil biological activity by theaddition of organic material leads to microbial growthand the production of binding agents that stick soilparticles together (Six et al.,2004 ). If microbial activityand the production of binding agents stops, the stabil-ity of aggregated soil partic les decline, and they breakdown into stable si lt-sized organo-mineral complexes(M/C19arquez et al., 2019 ).Given that soil microbial activity plays an importantrole in the formation of soil structure, a greater under-standing of microbial community functioning willincrease our understanding of how soil particles aggre-gate together and form stable networks of pore spaces(Bhattacharyya et al.,2021 ). It should be noted that awide range of abiotic (e.g., clay content and mineralogy,soil pH), environmental (e.g., wetting, and drying events,anthropogenic management) and biotic (e.g., plant rootgrowth and activity, soil fauna) factors can also haveimportant influences on the formation of soil structure.However, detailed discussion of these factors is beyondthe scope of the current review, which is focused on theinfluence of the microbial biomass.2o f1 5 KAUR ET AL . 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License2.1 |Binding agents involvedin aggregationThe binding agents involved in aggregation can generallybe categorised as either transient, temporary or persistent(Tisdall & Oades, 1982 ). Transient agents hold the soilparticles together for a short period (weeks to months)and include organic compounds such as polysaccharides,proteins and lipids (Chenu & Cosentino,2011 ; Tisdall &Oades, 1982 ). Temporary binding agents, which persistfor months to years, are composed of plant roots and fun-gal hyphae, and primarily act to aggregate soil particleson a macro-scale (>250 μm) (Chenu & Cosentino,2011 ;Meurer et al., 2020 ). Persistent binding agents includehumid organic material-polyvalent metal cations com-plexes, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and carbon-ates, which act as binding or cementing agents on amicro-scale (<250 μm) and strongly bind clay particles(decades to centuries) (Tisdall & Oades,1982 ; Totscheet al., 2018 ). The soil microbial biomass is important forthe production of many transient and temporary bindingagents present in soil environments, and those of particu-lar importance are described in detail below.2.1.1 | Extracellular polymeric substancesExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are moleculesreleased by a wide range of bacteria, archaea and fungithat are dominated by polysaccharides, but also includeproteins, enzymes, lipids, and nucleic acids (Chenu &Cosentino,2011 ; Costa et al., 2018 ; Deka et al., 2019 ;Mahapatra & Banerjee, 2013 ; Marvasi et al., 2010 ). Micro-organisms produce EPSs for a variety of purposes, suchas to protect themselves from predation or abioticstressors (temperature, water deficits, pH change), andaid attachment to soil particles (Costa et al.,2018 ; Donotet al., 2012 ; Lünsdorf et al., 2000 ; Marvasi et al., 2010 ).These substances are often found to promote aggregationat a microscale (<250 μm) due to their ability to bond tomineral surfaces and bridge mineral particles together(Chenu & Cosentino, 2011 ; Deka et al., 2019 ; Lünsdorfet al., 2000 ; Totsche et al., 2018 ; Verchot et al., 2011 ).While recognised as promoters of aggregation, theexact nature and role of EPS is relatively poorly under-stood due to their diversity and structural complexity(Costa et al.,2018 ). The ability of different EPSs to bindsoil particles is variable and likely related to propertiessuch as their size, hydration properties and viscosity(Akhtar et al.,2018 ). The EPS production by bacteria istypically greatest when C is readily available, but thebuild-up of microbial biomass is limited by other nutri-ents, such as N (Chenu & Cosentino, 2011 ). Drying con-ditions also stimulate EPS production (Chenu &Cosentino, 2011 ) and greater ability to produce EPSs hasbeen observed in microorganisms adapted to living indrier environments (Lennon et al.,2012 ).2.1.2 | Glomalin, melanins, hydrophobins,chaplins and rodlinsGlomalin is thought to be a glycoprotein that is producedby arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and widelyreported to be associated with the aggregation of soil par-ticles and soil structural stability (Agnihotri et al., 2022 ;Bird et al., 2002 ; Dai et al., 2015 ; Ji et al., 2019 ; Liuet al., 2020 ; Rillig et al., 2002 ; Wright &Upadhyaya, 1998 ). It is often hypothesised that glomalinis secreted by AMF and acts as a “glue ”that binds soilparticles together or increases their hydrophobicity(Singh et al., 2020 ; Wright & Upadhyaya, 1998 ). How-ever, direct evidence for its role is often lacking (Irvinget al.,2021 ; Rillig & Mummey, 2006 ). This is further com-plicated by the fact that that there is currently no meth-odology available to directly measure glomalin in soil.Glomalin is most commonly defined operationally byrepeatedly autoclaving the soil in a citrate bufferSand, silt, & clay particlesPore spacesWater and gasesSOIL AGGREGATIONPHYSICALOrganic materialsBacteriaArchaeaFungiProtistsVirusesBIOLOGICAL Fungal / bacterial hyphae, plant rootsEPSGlomalin, hydrophobins, chaplinsHumic material, Fe- & Al-oxides, carbonatesBINDING AGENTS FIGURE 1 Summary of thephysical and biological componentsinvolved in the aggregation of soilparticlesKAUR ET AL . 3o f1 5 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License(of varying concentration) and then measuring the pro-tein extracted using the non-specific Bradford proteinassay (Agnihotri et al.,2022 ; Holatko et al., 2021 ; Irvinget al., 2021 ). This process extracts a range of proteins andother compounds that can interfere with the Bradfordassay, and it has long been recognised that these repre-sent “glomalin related soil proteins ”(GRSP) rather thanglomalin itself (Agnihotri et al.,2022 ; Holatkoet al., 2021 ; Irving et al., 2021 ; Rillig, 2004 ). Indeed, theexact chemical nature of glomalin is still largelyunknown (Irving et al., 2021 ).Some studies have reported that 80% of glomalin pro-duced by AMF is tightly bound to the fungal hyphae andspores, rather than being excreted into the surroundingsoil environment (Driver et al., 2005 ), and geneticsequencing has revealed that the gene for glomalin hashomology with a class of stress-induced proteins with acellular function (Purin & Rillig, 2007 ). Some researchershave thus suggested that glomalin has a primarily cellu-lar function, likely related to helping hyphae attach tosurfaces, allowing hyphae to break air-water interfaces bylowering the surface tension of water, and/or decreasingthe palatability of fungal hyphae to fungal grazers (Driveret al.,2005 ). Its relationship to aggregation may be due tothe association of fungal hypha with aggregated soil par-ticles, and its persistence in the environment, rather thandue to its active secretion (Purin & Rillig,2007 ; Rillig &Mummey, 2006 ). Recent work has also failed to find anyevidence that AMF secrete GRSP at high levels and hassuggested that GRSP may simply be artefacts of the inac-curate methodology used to extract them (Murphyet al.,2020 ). Further work is thus required to determinewhich of the compounds contained in GRSP are of a fun-gal origin, whether they are actively extruded into the soilor only released after fungi die and are decomposed byother microorganisms, and the exact role that this playsin the aggregation of soil particles (Holatko et al.,2021 ).Melanins are the cell wall proteins produced by fungiand bacteria in soil and are considered of some significancein organic C storage in soil (Siletti et al., 2017)a l t h o u g ht h erole of melanins in aggregation is not clearly established.Because of their relatively high hydrophobicity, mela-nins may confer protection against aggregate disruptionand thereby contribute to aggregation at microscale(<250–53μm) in soil (Mugerwa & McGee,2017 ).Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins pro-duced by a wide range of filamentous saprophytic fungi(King,2010; Rillig & Mummey, 2006). These are believed tohave a variety of roles, such as promoting the extension offilaments across air-water bo undaries by lowering watertension and facilitating myce lium attachment to surfaces(Elliot & Talbot, 2004;K i n g , 2010; Rillig & Mummey, 2006).It has been hypothesised that these substances play a rolein soil aggregation due to their role in attaching fungi to soilsurfaces and their ability to inc rease surface hydrophobicity(Rillig & Mummey, 2006). However, there has been limitedresearch regarding their behaviour in the soil environmentto date.Similar to hydrophobins, chaplins and rodlins areproteins with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic proper-ties involved in the formation of aerial hyphae by fila-mentous Streptomycetes bacteria (Claessen et al.,2006 ;King, 2010 ; Rillig et al., 2007 ; Sawyer et al., 2011 ).Research into chaplin function indicates that they alsoact as surfactants to lower the surface tension of waterand assemble into a hydrophobic layer that coats emerg-ing hyphae (Elliot et al.,2003 ; Sawyer et al., 2011 ). Thus,similar to hydrophobins, it is believed that these struc-tures increase the hydrophobic nature of soil surfaces,and are likely to play a role in aggregation (Rilliget al.,2007 ) and soil structural stability.2.2 |Microorganisms involvedin aggregationSoil microbial communities are predominantly made up ofbacteria and fungi, with these organisms making up 102–104more biomass than other components (Fierer, 2017).However, archaea and protists are also present and can playimportant roles in the soil ecosystem (Fierer, 2017). Onerecent meta-analysis that examined the impact of animals(earthworms, nematodes, arthro pods, etc), fungi, and bacte-ria on aggregation observed that soil biota have, on average,a positive impact on aggregation (increasing aggregation by24%) (Lehmann et al.,2017). However, this can range froma 77% decrease (typically due to the impact of soil animals,but also some species of fungi) to over a 10-fold increase inaggregation (Lehmann et al.,2017).Fungi are considered to be more important for theaggregation of soil particles on a macro-scale (>250 μm),while bacteria contribute to both macro- and micro-(<250 μm) aggregation (Lehmann et al., 2017 ). Predatoryorganisms such as protists (and viruses, although theseare not microorganisms) may also have important indi-rect effects on aggregation due to their impact on bacte-rial and fungal community structure and functioning(Erktan, Rillig, et al.,2020 ; Wilpiszeski et al., 2019 ).2.2.1 | FungiThe significant influence of fungal activity on soil aggre-gation and stabilisation in soil has been reported innumerous studies (Bai et al.,2019 ; Bedini et al., 2009 ;Bethlenfalvay et al., 1999 ; Bossuyt et al., 2001 ; Rillig4o f1 5 KAUR ET AL . 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseet al., 2002 ; Rillig et al., 2010 ; Tiemann et al., 2015 ; Tonget al., 2020 ; Zheng et al., 2014 ). Filamentous fungi canincrease aggregation by enmeshing soil particles withfungal hyphae, and via the production of products thatcan “glue ”soil particles together (e.g. extracellular poly-saccharides) (Caesar-Tonthat, 2002 ; Caesar-TonThat &Cochran, 2000 ; Chenu, 1989 ) and/or increase soil hydro-phobicity and water repellence (e.g. glomalin, GRSP orhydrophobins) (Chenu & Cosentino,2011 ; Ji et al., 2019 ;Rillig et al., 2010 ; Zheng et al., 2014 ). The improvementsin aggregation and alteration of pore distributions createdby fungal activity can also enhance the activity of bacte-rial communities (Rillig & Mummey,2006 ). However,fungi can also act to decrease aggregation when theyexcrete enzymes that can degrade organic material, orwhen they physically destabilise aggregated soil particlesby opening pathways for water influx (Lehmannet al.,2020 ; Lehmann & Rillig, 2015 ).2.2.2 | BacteriaMany bacteria release EPSs that glue soil particlestogether and are important transient binding agents(Lehmann et al.,2017 ). Bacterial filaments may also beimportant in binding soil particles at a micro-scale, simi-lar to the way fungal filaments are important for bindingparticles at a macro-scale (Lehmann et al., 2017 ). Certaingroups of bacteria are also known to produce chaplins,which increase soil hydrophobicity and stability (Singhet al., 2017 ). However, like soil fungi, bacteria can alsodecrease the stability of soil aggregation. For example,Bethlenfalvay et al. ( 1999 ) observed that the rapid prolif-eration of aerobic bacteria seemed to decrease the num-ber of water stable soil aggregates, possibly due to rapiddecomposition of binding agents.2.2.3 | Protists and virusesThe activity of predatory organisms in soil environmentsalso has the potential to impact soil microbial communi-ties, carbon cycling, and thus soil aggregation (Erktan,Rillig, et al.,2020 , Wilpiszeski et al., 2019 ). For example,it is known that protozoan grazing can trigger the pro-duction of aggregating agents, such as EPS, as a defencemechanism (Matz & Kjelleberg, 2005 ). Indeed, in a studyof a simplified soil system, the addition of a free-livingamoeba ( Acanthamoeba castellanii ) to a microbial com-munity dominated by Pseudomonas fluorescens wasobserved to enhance aggregation, and this was hypothe-sised to be due to increased bacterial EPS production inresponse to attack (Erktan, Rillig, et al.,2020 ). Higherorder predators (e.g., collembolans) were also demon-strated to influence aggregation due to their impact onfungal biomass and community composition (Erktan,Rillig, et al.,2020 ), although such higher order speciesare not part of the microbial biomass.The impact of viruses on soil aggregation is largelyunknown, although work on aquatic ecosystems suggeststhat they are likely to be important drivers of carbon andnutrient dynamics (Ashelford et al.,2003 ; Fierer, 2017 ;Kimura et al., 2008 ; Swanson et al., 2009 ; Williamsonet al., 2005 ; Williamson et al., 2017 ), and therefore poten-tially aggregation. However, we currently have a verypoor understanding of how viruses alter nutrient cycling,food webs and genetic variability in soils (Williamsonet al.,2017 ), and to our knowledge, no studies havedirectly examined their impact on soil aggregation.3|MOLECULAR GENETICTECHNIQUES AND THEIR ABILITYTO PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTOAGGREGATIONGreater understanding of the composition of the microbialbiomass and its role in aggregation could potentially allowits manipulation to improve soil structure and condition(Berg et al.,2020). Genetic approaches offer a sophisticatedt o o lt h a tc a nh e l pi d e n t i f yt h ed i v e r s i t ya n df u n c t i o n a l i t yo fthe soil microbial biomass (Geisen et al.,2019). These caninclude sequencing-based approaches, whereby genes fromspecific taxa or functional groups of interest are searchedfor using specific primers (Hazen et al.,2012)a n dr e l a t e dt osoil aggregation or environment al characteristics. In con-trast, metagenomic, or metatr anscriptomic, approaches canbe applied and universal primers used to assess the range ofgenes present in an environm ent (metagenomic) and/oractively being expressed (met atranscriptomic). This canthen be related to species dive rsity and/or soil functioning(Geisen et al.,2019). However, the diversity and complexityof the soil microbial biomass makes characterising the rela-tionship between aggregation and microbial biomassincredibly complex (Garoutte et al.,2016;J a n s s o n&Hofmockel, 2018; Kuzyakov & Blagodatskaya, 2015;O v e r yet al., 2021; Thiele-Bruhn et al., 2020), and only a limitedamount of work has been conducted to date (for a selectedsummary, see Table 1).3.1 |Community compositionGreater understanding of the degree to which the compo-sition of the soil microbial biomass correlates with aggre-gation could help improve understanding of thoseKAUR ET AL . 5o f1 5 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseorganisms with a key role in aggregating soil particles(Rillig & Mummey, 2006 ). Genetic approaches areincreasingly being used to examine community composi-tion in soil environments and relate these to aggregation.For example, numerous studies have used genetic tech-niques to examine the differences in species compositionor diversity between different sized aggregate classes(Bach et al.,2018 ; Constancias et al., 2014 ; Davinicet al., 2012 ; Han et al., 2021 ; Kim et al., 2008 ; Mummeyet al., 2006 ; Trivedi et al., 2017 ). Other studies have useda combination of computed tomography (CT) scanning tocharacterise fine scale soil architecture including poresize distribution and connectivity of pores, followed bythe dissection of macroaggregates into subsections andthe characterisation of the microbial community withinthese subsections using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing(Kravchenko et al.,2014 ). This approach was able toidentify the presence of different microbial communitiesin aggregates from different crop management types andrelate species composition to differences in pore sizedistributions.While these studies often identify distinct microbialpopulations in different aggregate sizes or pores, they donot typically provide direct evidence for the involvementof key species in aggregation, nor help highlight the dis-tinct processes involved. To better define the relation-ships between species composition and aggregation,information on microbial diversity needs to be combinedwith indicators related to aggregation. In this regard,some studies have examined the relationship betweenmicrobial composition identified via 16S rRNA sequenc-ing, soil EPS-saccharide content, and aggregation to iden-tify bacterial genera that were associated with EPSproduction and increased aggregation (as determined bymeasuring aggregate stability using traditional sievingand sedimentation techniques) (Bettermann et al.,2021 ;Zethof et al., 2020 ). Similarly, a study by Duchicela et al.(2013 ) examined changes in aggregation following thecessation of cultivation and was able to observe a strongpositive relationship between changes in fungal commu-nity composition and increases in aggregate stability(Duchicela et al.,2013 ). In contrast Lehmann et al. ( 2020 )were able to analyse the DNA of fungal species isolatedfrom the soil and tested for their ability to aggregateunconsolidated soil material to infer the phylogeneticrelationships of fungal strains related to aggregation.Testing for specific taxa that are associated with soilprocesses is only likely to be successful when these taxaare closely linked to specific functions (Grahamet al.,2016 ; Thiele-Bruhn et al., 2020 ). Indeed, linkingthe taxa found in the soil to the functional capabilitiesof the soil microbial biomass is challenging and infor-mation about the organisms present is not always usefulfor predicting biochemical processes or how these maychange with variations in their environment(Fierer,2017 ). For example, where processes are cata-lysed by a diverse number of organisms, changes incommunity composition may have minimal impact dueto the ability of alternative community members to per-form that function (Geisen et al.,2019 ;L o u c aet al., 2018 ). The use of microbial community composi-tion to examine aggregation processes can thus be com-plex due to the enormous microbial diversity in soil andthe high degree of functional redundancy often presentin microbial communities (Burke et al.,2011 ; de Graaffet al., 2015 ;L o u c ae ta l . , 2018 ).TABLE 1 Examples of studies that have used molecular genetic approaches to study soil aggregationApproach Applied ReferencesAnalysis of microbialcommunitycompositionUsed genetic analysis to identify soil bacteria in bulk versus rhizosphere soil andrelated these to soil EPS-saccharide contents and soil aggregation.Bettermann et al.

To date, most of the work con-ducted to examine functional genes in soil environmentshas focused on genes for carbon degradation and nutrientcycling (King,2010 ; Shi et al., 2019 ), rather than genesthat can promote aggregation. Indeed, due to the widerange of mechanisms used by organisms to aggregate soilparticles, identifying functional genes to test for soilaggregation is challenging (Caesar-TonThat et al.,2014 ).However, analysis of genes associated with the produc-tion of binding agents, such as EPSs, glomalin (GRSP) orhydrophobins, may be valuable to gain a greater under-standing of aggregation and the impact of managementstrategies or abiotic variables (King,2010 ; Rillig &Mummey, 2006 ).3.2.1 | EPSPrimarily due to their applications in the food industry,the greatest amount of genetic information regardingEPS production is related to bacterial exopolysaccharideproduction (Donot et al.,2012 ; Schmid et al., 2015 ).Despite the wide range of polysaccharides produced bybacteria, the biosynthetic pathways involved in their pro-duction tend to be relatively well-conserved and commonto many bacteria (Pereira et al.,2013 ). However, whilewe currently have a broad understanding of the geneticregulation of EPS in bacteria (Pereira et al.,2009 ;Rehm, 2010 ; Schmid et al., 2015 ) this is far from com-plete, and greater understanding is required of the genesinvolved in its synthesis and regulation in the full rangeof organisms found in soil (Costa et al.,2018 ). Indeed, formany EPS substances produced in soil environments, westill have only a relatively rudimentary understanding ofthe genes involved, and the structure and function of thesubstances resulting from their expression (Marvasiet al.,2010 ).Despite our incomplete understanding, some stud-ies have been able to demonstrate key functional genesfor EPS production involved in aggregation. For exam-ple, the production of the polymer leven by Paenibacil-lus polymyxa bacteria has been associated withincreased aggregation of soil around wheat roots(Bezzate et al.,2000 ). The infection of wheat plantswith mutant bacterial strains whose SacB gene encod-ing for levansucrase had be en disrupted resulted inreduced aggregation and confirmed the role of levan inthe aggregation of soil particles (Bezzate et al.,2000 ).Similarly, twice as many water stable macroaggregateswere observed around the roots of Brassica napusplants inoculated with a control versus mutant strainofRhizobium (Santaella et al.,2008 ). Mutant strainswere deficient in the gtagene, which encodes for glu-cosyltransferase or galactosyltransferase, and is knownto be essential for the production of exopolysaccharidesin the Rhizobium strains studied (Santaellaet al.,2008 ). In a further example, exopolysaccharideproduction in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is regulated bytheepsoperon containing 15 genes, with epsA andepsBbeing the two most important for exopolysaccharideproduction (Deka et al.,2019 ). Inactivation of thesegenes was observed to decrease EPS production andaggregation in inoculated soil (Deka et al., 2019 ).In other studies, metagenomic approaches have beenused to examine the range of genes present in the soilenvironment and determine which of those present arerelated to aggregation. For example, one study examinedchanges in the makeup and function of the bacterialcommunity in bulk soil versus biocrusts and relatedthese to aggregation (Cania, Vestergaard, Kublik,et al.,2020 ). In these studies, genes related to the pro-duction of exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides(wza, algE, algJ, wcaB, wcaF, wcaK, amsJ, kpsE, epsG,e p s A ,s a c B ,w z t ,l p t F ,l p t G ,l p t C )w e r eo b s e r v e dt oincrease in biocrusts compared to bulk soil samples(Cania, Vestergaard, Kublik, et al., 2020 ). Similar tech-niques were also used to demonstrate that the improvedaggregate stability associated with reduced tillage prac-t i c e sa ts o m es i t e sw a sa s s o c i a t e dw i t ha ni n c r e a s ei nt h eabundance of genes associated with exopolysaccharideand lipopolysaccharide production (Cania, Vestergaard,Suhadolc, et al.,2020 ), although at others no differenceswere observed (Cania et al., 2019 ; Cania, Vestergaard,Suhadolc, et al., 2020 ). It was noted by the authors ofthis study that due to the lack of gene sequence dataregarding the production of EPS by other organisms,these studies are biased towards bacteria (Cania, Vester-gaard, Suhadolc, et al.,2020 ). It was also noted that theactual production of exo- and lipo-polysaccharides coulddiffer depending on environmental factors (carbonavailability, temperature, soil pH, etc) and the applica-tion of more metatranscriptomics analysis of the soilenvironment would be desirable to examine these fac-tors given that even though genes may be present, theymay not always be actively expressed (see further dis-cussion below) (Cania et al.,2019 ). Ideally, geneticinformation should also be related to direct measure-ments of exo- and lipopolysaccharides in the soil,although the methods available to extract these sub-stances require development and are currently unable todifferentiate between substances produced by differentorganisms (Cania et al.,2019 ).KAUR ET AL . 7o f1 5 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

Evidence indi-cates that genes coding for homologues of heat shockprotein (hsp) 60 are responsible for glomalin produc-tion (Purin & Rillig,2007 ). However, we are unawareof any studies that have related glomalin genes toaggregation or soil structure. Recently, work has beenconducted to create PCR primers that can amplify avariety of glomalin gene lin eages as markers for AMFdiversity (Magurno et al.,2019 ). This work has alsonoted that the gene sequences for glomalin partiallydiffer between different species of AMF, which mayalso indicate differences in the nature of the glomalinproduced (Magurno et al.,2019 )a n dp r o v i d es c o p ef o rmore detailed work on the relationship between fungaldiversity, glomalin production and aggregation. How-ever, the use of Hsp60 as a gene target for glomalinproduction has been called into question by someauthors who consider it unlikely that Hsp60 are criticalcomponents of glomalin, and greater research in thisarea is required (Holatko et al.,2021 ;I r v i n get al., 2021 ;M u r p h ye ta l . , 2020 ).Research has also been carried out to identify thegene sequences involved in hydrophobin production,with one study reporting on the involvement of over70 genes from a variety of fungal species, many of whichcontain multiple genes for hydrophobin (Linderet al.,2005 ). However, limited research has been con-ducted regarding the behaviour of hydrophobins in soilenvironments (Rillig, 2005 ) and we are unaware of anystudies that have examined the relationship betweenhydrophobin gene expression and soil aggregation. Thepresence of multiple genes within organisms also makesthe study of hydrophobin function via techniques such asgene inactivation more challenging, as other genes maycompensate for the activity of genes that are deleted(Linder et al.,2005 ; Whiteford & Spanu, 2002 ).Genes for chaplin formation in Streptomycetes bacte-ria have been identified ( chpA-H ). Two short chaplins(chpE andchpH ) are known to be expressed during bothvegetative and aerial mycelial phases, while the remain-der are only expressed during aerial hyphae formation(Elliot et al.,2003 ; Sawyer et al., 2011 ). Similarly, genesfor rodlin formation in Streptomyces produce Rod1A andRod1B proteins, which are present on the outer surfaceof aerial hyphae (Claessen et al., 2006 ). However, we areunaware of any studies that have related the expressionof chaplin and rodlin genes in soil to the process ofaggregation.3.2.3 | Carbon catabolismWhile genes associated with carbon degradation are typi-cally associated with a decline in aggregation, in someinstances analysis of these genes can also be useful forunderstanding the changes in aggregation in response toenvironmental conditions or management change. Forexample, some studies have observed that nitrogen addi-tion decreases decomposition by down-regulating theexpression of ligninolytic (lcc) (Edwards et al.,2011 )o rcellobiohydrolases (cbhI) genes (Fan et al., 2012 ). Thepotential impact of such processes on aggregation areclear, although very few studies have related the changesin genes of carbon catabolism to changes in aggregation.4|CHALLENGES ASSOCIATEDWITH GENETIC TECHNIQUESWhile genetic techniques clearly have the capacity toprovide significant insight into the aggregation of soilparticles, there are several challenges associated withtheir use. Firstly, because these techniques have onlybeen available for a relativel y short period of time, theycan suffer from variability due to the variety of meth-odologies or protocols used by different laboratories,which can make comparison between studies difficult(Geisen et al.,2019 ; Hazen et al., 2012 ;H i r s c het al., 2010 ;T h i e l e - B r u h ne ta l . , 2020 ). In addition, fullextraction of the DNA present in soil environments canbe difficult, with some authors estimating that mostmetagenomic data from soil covers <20% of the diver-sity present (Nannipieri et al.,2020 ).Databases that contain genetic sequencing informa-tion [e.g. the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes andGenomes (KEGG), the National Centre for BiotechnologyInformation (NCBI)] are currently used to relate thegenes extracted from a soil with particular types of micro-organisms or functions. These databases can differ signif-icantly (Nannipieri et al.,2020 ), and while they arerapidly evolving, they are currently dominated bysequences from fast-growing bacteria (Cania et al., 2019 ;Cania, Vestergaard, Suhadolc, et al., 2020 ; Thiele-Bruhnet al., 2020 ), partly due to the relative ease with whichthese organisms can be cultured and analysed. However,the soil microbial biomass also contains slow-growingbacteria, archaea, fungi and protists that play importantroles in aggregation. Similarly, tools such as functional8o f1 5 KAUR ET AL . 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensegene arrays, which target the extraction of genes involvedin various functional processes, also do not represent thefull diversity of microbial functions (Shi et al.,2019 ) andparticularly those related to aggregation (e.g., EPS pro-duction). The use of genetic techniques to understand theimpact of viruses on soil processes is also limited, largelybecause there is no universal marker gene for viruses andit is difficult to recover enough viral DNA from soil touse metagenomic approaches to examine viral commu-nity ecology (Emerson,2019 ).Many genetic approaches also only provide informa-tion regarding the relative abundance of different organ-isms or genes, rather than actual abundance, which cancomplicate interpretation of their ecological significance(Fierer,2017 ; Geisen et al., 2019 ). Techniques such asreal time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis can pro-vide some quantitative indication of the organisms pre-sent (Hirsch et al., 2010 ). However, these techniquesmay provide no differentiation between active, dormantor dead microorganisms, which may overestimate poten-tial function or diversity (Graham et al., 2016 ; Thiele-Bruhn et al., 2020 ). Metagenomic approaches can alsodetect genes that are not actively being expressed, andmany genes can have more than one function, depend-ing on the context of the gene in the genome of themicroorganism (Jansson & Hofmockel,2018 ; Nannipieriet al., 2020 ). For example, the nirK gene, which codes forthe nitrate reductase enzyme, is involved in ammoniaoxidation, nitrite oxidation, denitrification and aerobicammonia oxidation (Prosser,2015 ). In addition, quanti-tative approaches do not provide any informationregarding process rates, which can be relatively insensi-tive to gene abundance, meaning that these approachesmay not always be reliable predictors of soil functions(Prosser,2015 ).Because RNA is only synthesised by actively growingcells, and degrades relatively rapidly once produced (par-ticularly mRNA, although rRNA can survive for monthsin moribund or dead cells), its measurement can be usedto identify metabolically active communities (Hirschet al.,2010 ) and studies have used extraction and mea-surements of these components to try and identify activeorganisms (Chen et al., 2013 ; Garoutte et al., 2016 ). How-ever, some authors suggest that this approach may beflawed and that the correlation between organism activityand rRNA in environmental samples is inconsistent(Blazewicz et al.,2013 ; Geisen et al., 2019 ). The low phy-logenetic resolution of the rRNA region also limits its usefor species identification (Lindahl et al.,2013 ).A further problem with the use of genetic techniquesto study aggregation is the scale at which they need to beapplied to provide useful information. The distribution ofcarbon and other resources (oxygen, water) is highlyheterogeneous in soil, and physical constraints on themovement of the microbial community can limit thecross-species interactions and contribute to the largenumber of niches and high species diversity within soilenvironments (Jansson & Hofmockel,2018 ; Nannipieriet al., 2020 ). Given the spatial arrangement and interac-tion between microbial communities have a direct rolein their functional relationships and the expression offunctional genes, understanding of the fine scale spatialdistribution of microorganisms and how they function isdesirable to fully understand soil processes (Crawfordet al.,2007 ; Jansson & Hofmockel, 2018 ;K u z y a k o v&Blagodatskaya, 2015 ), including soil architecture andaggregation. However, current genetic approaches oftenuse relatively large amounts of soil and are incapable ofdefining this fine scale resolution (Baveye,2021 ;Crawford et al., 2007 ; Nannipieri et al., 2020 ;Prosser, 2012 ).The most common approach used to study the distri-bution and activity of organisms on a spatial scale rele-vant to the aggregation of soil particles is to separatesoil into different aggregate classes using sieving tech-niques before analysis (Sainju,2006 ; Wilpiszeskiet al., 2019 ). However, the manner in which this sievingis carried out (e.g. wet or dry) can influence aggregateproperties and microbial activity or diversity (Blaudet al.,2017 ; Liao et al., 2021 ;S a i n j u , 2006 ;V o set al., 2013 ). These techniques also do not preserve porestructures, which are key habitats for microorganisms(Vos et al., 2013 ; Wilpiszeski et al., 2019 ), or enable thespatial distribution of soil taxa to be examined (Geisenet al.,2019 ).Aggregate dissection techniques followed by theexamination of the microbial communities associatedwith classes of soil aggregates can help identify the spa-tial associations between microbes on a fine scale (Voset al.,2013 ). Some studies have also combined X-Rayμ-CT scanning using synchrotron with molecular tech-niques to better determine the spatial distribution oforganisms, as discussed above (Bailey et al., 2013 ;Kravchenko et al., 2014 ). The isolation and sequencing ofDNA and RNA from individual cells extracted from geor-eferenced locations is also an approach that could beused to better characterise the distribution of organismswithin soil pores (Erktan, Or, & Scheu,2020 ), and theevolution of such techniques has been recently described(Baveye et al., 2018 ). However, given there is likely to bea wide range of organisms capable of binding and aggre-gating soil particles, and thus a degree of functionalredundancy in aggregation processes, the usefulness ofsuch characterisation to understand aggregation may belimited. In addition, this approach is technically chal-lenging and difficult to apply.KAUR ET AL . 9o f1 5 13652389, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13307 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

Molecular genetics could potentially increaseunderstanding of the diversity and functionality of thesoil microbial biomass and its relationship to aggregation,although the challenges associated with this approachare significant. The diversity and complexity of the soilmicrobial biomass make characterising relationshipsbetween it and aggregation complex, particularly giventhe gaps in understanding the key organisms and func-tional genes important for aggregation and the challengesassociated with studying the fine scale distribution of themicrobial biomass and its activity.Current approaches to the study of aggregation haveoverwhelmingly used methodologies that destroys thesoil structure and relies on correlations between differentsized aggregates classes and soil compositional or func-tional traits to draw conclusions regarding the organismsand genes responsible for binding soil particles. Whilethis approach has provided some useful information, thedestruction of soil architecture is a significant barrier toobtaining a complete understanding of how differentorganisms interact and behave to induce aggregation.The reliance on observational and correlational studiesalso fails to provide direct evidence of the exact mecha-nisms involved in aggregation.To advance our understanding, future work shouldconcentrate on combining techniques capable of examin-ing microbial behaviour within the inherent soil architec-ture and seeking to manipulate experimental conditionsto gain greater evidence of the mechanisms responsiblefor aggregation. This will require work to better deter-mine the exact nature of binding agents involved inaggregation. In addition, the identification of functionalgenes associated with the production of binding agents isrequired and likely to be a more promising area ofresearch than the study of the organisms responsible foraggregation given the high degree of functional redun-dancy among microbial communities. Further advance-ments will likely to be made when functional geneexpression, for example, the specific enzymes and theirproducts, can directly be studied in situ within the sur-faces of aggregated soil particles and associated poresusing a combination of synchrotron-based X-Ray μ-CTscanning, nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry (nano-SIMS) and 3-D-nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry3-D-NMR, for13C,15N and31P. While studying the pro-cess of aggregation at the molecular level is no doubtcomplex, if successful this future research may increaseour ability to manipulate environmental conditions toenhance aggregation for the benefit of soil health, agri-cultural productivity and environmental benefits, includ-ing carbon sequestration.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSRupinder Kaur: Writing –original draft (lead).Kathryn Louise Page: Writing –original draft (equal).Ram C Dalal: Conceptualization (equal); writing –reviewand editing (equal).
