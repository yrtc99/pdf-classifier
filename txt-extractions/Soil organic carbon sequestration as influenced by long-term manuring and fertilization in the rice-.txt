ChinaABSTRACTFertilization is a feasible approach to increase the soil organic carbon. To investigate theeffect of fertilization on crop biomass carbon, dynamics of soil organic carbon and soil car-bon sequestration rate in the ( Oryza sativa L.)-wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systemunder the middle reach of the Yangtze River, central China, a thirty-three years(1981 /C02013) long-term fertilizer experiment was conducted with nine treatments, includingno amendment addition treatment (control), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fer-tilizer treatments (N, NP, NPK), manure (M) and manure combined with chemical fertilizertreatments (MN, MNP, MNPK, hMNPK). The results indicated that average crop biomass car-bon was increased by 39.9 /C077.2% compared to unfertilized control (4.43 t ha/C01yr/C01) dueto fertilizer application, the highest crop biomass carbon was 7.85 t ha/C01yr/C01in the hMNPKtreatment and the lowest crop biomass carbon was 5.21 t ha/C01yr/C01in the N alone treat-ment. The annual total organic carbon input were 4.14 t ha/C01yr/C01in the M treatment and5.80 t ha/C01yr/C01in the hMNPK treatment, which was 1.95 /C02.74 times of those in the NPKtreatments (2.12 t ha/C01yr/C01). Total organic carbon input of soil were increased by10.2/C023.3 kg C ha/C01yr/C01, and increment rate in the appended manure treatments weremuch higher than those in the control and inorganic fertilizer treatments. Soil organic car-bon retention in the topsoil (0 /C020 cm) decreased by 0.11 /C00.14 t ha/C01yr/C01in the control,N and NP treatments; nevertheless, soil organic carbon sequestration rates varied from 0.03to 0.20 t ha/C01yr/C01in the NPK and appended organic manure treatments. These resultsdemonstrate that organic manure use or integrated organic manure with chemical fertilizerapplication can be important strategies for increasing soil organic carbon sequestration andmaintaining soil quality in the rice-wheat cropping system of China.KEY WORDSCrop biomass carbon; soilorganic carbon; carbonsequestration rate;rice-wheat cropping systemIntroductionThe rice ( Oryza sativa L.)-wheat ( Triticum aestivumL.) cropping system is one of the largest agricul-tural production systems in the world, whichoccupy 24 million hectares cultivated land and ismainly distributed in southern and eastern Asia(Indo-Gangetic plains and South China) [ 1]. The13.5 million hectares in South Asia are distributedin India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanamarand Bhutan [ 2]. The 10.5 million hectares in EastAsia are widely spread in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei,Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and Anhui provinces ofChina, which account for roughly half of the totalrice cultivated area in China. It is crucial to keepsustainable crop yields, ensure China ’s food secur-ity, and protect the soil environment.Soil organic carbon, as is closely linked with soilphysical-chemical properties, nutrient cycling andplant-available nutrients uptake and release, is animportant index of soil fertility and agricultural sus-tainability. Usually, a positive relationship existsbetween the soil organic carbon content and thecrop yield, which can reflect the soil productivity[3]. The soil carbon retention is a complex process,which is affected by many factors, such as conser-vation tillage, cropping sequences, fertilizations,organic amendments, soil textures, climate condi-tions and anthropogenic factors [ 4,5]. The applica-tion of the manure increases the soil organiccarbon content and improves other soil physical-chemical properties; including soil tilth, water-holding capacity, aggregate stability, and thewater infiltration rate [ 6]. In many cases, there is apositive relationship between carbon inputs frommanures and crop residues and the correspondingsoil organic carbon content [ 7].

[ 1] observed that the regular incorporation ofcrop residues and farmyard manures slowlyincreased soil organic carbon contents in the rice-wheat cropping system in India.Because of the high resilience of the soil organiccarbon, effects of agricultural management on soilorganic carbon should be observed through long-/C0term field experiments [ 8]. Furthermore, thelong-term fertilizer experiment can analyze thechangeable discipline of the soil fertility and fertil-izer benefit, crop growth and soil environmentsdue to annual changes of climate in a systematicand scientific way [ 9]. Long-term field experimentsare essential to evaluate the cropping manage-ment practices required to achieve desired yieldsand agricultural sustainability in terms of the cropproduction, soil fertility, and environmen-tal impacts.However, there were few investigations aboutthe effects of long-term organic manure andchemical fertilizer application on soil organic car-bon input, soil organic carbon concentration andsoil carbon sequestration rate in the yellow-brownsoil, central China. To fill this knowledge gap, theaims of this study are to: (1) evaluate the impactsof the long-term application of inorganic andorganic fertilizers on the soil organic carbon andits sequestration in the yellow-brown soil and (2)estimate the relationship between soil organic car-bon input and soil carbon sequestration rate in therice-wheat cropping system. In this study, it ishypothesized that long-term organic manureapplication or manure combined with chemicalfertilizer application can sequester carbon in soil,but soil organic carbon will be declined due tolong-term chemical fertilizer application alone.Materials and methodsStudy site, climate and soilA thirty-three years (1981 /C02013) long-term fertil-izer experiment in a rice-wheat rotation systemwas initiated from rice cultivation in 1981, belong-ing to the National Fertilizer ExperimentMonitoring Network at Nanhu experimentalStation, Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences inWuchang of China, located at latitude 30/C14280N,longitude 114/C14250E and altitude 20 m in the cen-tral of China. The experimental site lies in a sub-tropical monsoon zone, which is characterized byhot summers and severe winters, and occasionalsnowfall during winter. The mean annual tempera-ture is 13/C14C ranging from a minimum of 3.7/C14Ci nJanuary to a maximum of 28.8/C14C in July. Themean annual precipitation is 1300 mm, most ofwhich (about 60%) is received from April to Julyand the annual non-frost period is 240 days.The soil at experimental site is a yellow-brownsoil, belonging to Albic Luvisol in FAO classifica-tion, which has a clay loam texture with 15% sand,36% silt, and 49% clay. Soil properties (in 1981) inanthraquic horizon depth (0 /C020 cm) were as fol-lows: soil organic carbon 15.9 g kg/C01, total N 1.80 gkg/C01, total P 1.00 g kg/C01, total K 30.2 g kg/C01, alka-line hydrolysable N 151 mg kg/C01, available P5.00 mg kg/C01, available K 98.5 mg kg/C01, pH 6.30and the bulk density 1.29 g cm/C03.Experiment design and field managementA thirty-three years (1981 /C02013) long-term fertil-izer experiment was conducted with nine treat-ments (in a randomized complete block designwith three replicates), and each plot size was 40m2(5 m width /C28 m length). The nine treatmentswere as follows: (i) no chemical fertilizer or manureapplication, Control; (ii) the inorganic N fertilizertreatment, N; (iii) the inorganic N and P fertilizertreatment, NP; (iv) the inorganic N, P and K fertil-izer treatment, NPK; (v) the manure (pig dungcompost) treatment, M; (vi) inorganic N fertilizerplus the manure treatment, MN; (vii) inorganic Nand P fertilizer plus the manure treatment, MNP;(viii) inorganic N, P and K fertilizer plus the manuretreatment, MNPK; (ix) the inorganic N, P and K fer-tilizer plus 1.67 times of manure treatment,hMNPK. Application doses for manure and chem-ical fertilizer and split times are shown in Table 1 .The inorganic N, P, and K fertilizers were appliedas annual rate of 150 kg N ha/C01,7 5 k gP 2O5ha/C01,and 150 kg K 2Oh a/C01. The N, P, and K fertilizerswere applied as urea, ammonium phosphate, andpotassium chloride, respectively. The 22,500 kgha/C01of organic manure from pig dung compostevery year were applied to M, MN, MNP and MNPKtreatments, while 37,500 kg ha/C01were applied tohMNPK treatment. The pig dung compost aver-agely contained 282 g kg/C01C, 15.1 g kg/C01total N,20.8 g kg/C01P2O5, 13.6 g kg/C01K2O, and 69% water.The 60% of inorganic fertilizers were appliedduring the rice growth season and the other 40%during the wheat growth season, while manurewas applied equally (50:50) to the two crops. The40% of the N fertilizer was applied as a basal fertil-izer, 40% was applied during the tillering stageand 20% during the booting stage in the rice620 C. HU ET AL.growth season. The 50% of N fertilizer was appliedas a basal fertilizer, 25% during the wheat seedlingstage and 25% during the jointing stage in thewheat growth season. Every year, the P, K fertilizerand manure were applied as basal fertilizers, priorto plough. All basal fertilizers and manure wereevenly sprinkled on the soil surface by hand andwere incorporated into the plough layer by tillageas soon as possible. Tillage was done to 20 cmdepth by plough and followed by harrow. The fer-tilized and unfertilized plots were tilled similarly.The cropping system was rice and wheat rota-tions. The rice was transplanted in June and har-vested in October, and then the wheat wasdirectly sowed in November and harvested in Mayof the next year. The aboveground crops were har-vested with sickle and removed, thus no strawreturned into the soil in all plots. Nevertheless, riceor wheat stubbles and roots were incorporatedinto the soil with a plow before the subsequentrice and wheat. Besides the fertilizer treatments, allother agronomic managements were identical infertilized and unfertilized plots.Rice and wheat grains were separated fromstraws using a plot thresher. Straws were removedafter threshing. Grains were weighed after sun-dry-ing and recorded from the whole plot (14% watercontent by oven-dry basis).Soil and plant samplingA total of twenty-seven composite soil samplesfrom nine treatments by three replicates werecollected from 0 /C020 cm soil layer in June orOctober every year after crops being harvestedbefore soil plowing. Each composite soil sampleconsists of ten mixed cores. Each soil sample wasstored in a sealed plastic bag, transferred to thelab as soon as possible, air-dried for 14 days atroom temperature and then ground. Subsampleswere sieved through a 1-mm screen, mixed, andanalyzed the contents of N, available P and avail-able K and soil pH. Other subsamples were groundthrough a 0.25 mm sieve to determine soil organicC, total N, total P and total K concentrations. Bothof straws and grains were oven-dried at 65/C14C for72 h and then ground through a 0.5-mm sieve inorder to analyze the carbons and total N, P, Kconcentrations.Laboratory analysisThe soil bulk density was measured with an ironring method. The potassium dichromate externalheating method was used to determine soilorganic C concentration [ 10]. The semi-microKjeldahl method and the alkaline-hydrolysable dif-fusion method measured total N and alkaline-hydrolysable N concentrations, respectively [ 11].Soil total P and soil total K were digested in anickel crucible with sodium hydroxide at 750/C14C.Soil total P were determined using the molyb-denum colorimetric method at a wavelength of880 nm [ 12]. Soil total K were determined usingatomic absorption spectro-photometry [ 13]. Soilavailable P was extracted with 0.5 mol L/C01NaHCO 3Table 1.

Soil available K was extracted with1 mol L/C01NH 4Ac (soil: solution ¼1:10) and meas-ured with the flame photometry method [ 15]. SoilpH was measured with 0.01 mol L/C01CaCl 2slurry(soil: solution ¼1:2.5) with a glass electrode.Samples from plant tissues and pig dung compostsdigested in H2SO4and H 2O2were analyzed fortotal N by a micro-Kjeldahl method [ 11]. The Pconcentration of plant tissues digested in HNO 3and HClO 4was determined by the ammoniummolybdate method [ 16] and K concentration ofplant tissues by a flame photometry [ 15]. Carboncontents of plant tissues and manures were deter-mined by a wet oxidation method [ 17]. All thedata were expressed on the basis of dry mass.Calculation of carbon inputThe yields of each crop straws and grains wererecorded from all plots every year. Crop biomasscarbon is calculated according to abovegroundcrop biomass and carbon concentrations of harvest-able crop grains or straws respectively. Namely, therice biomass carbon is equal to the rice straw yieldmultiplied by its carbon concentration plus the ricegrain yield multiplied by its carbon concentration.The wheat biomass carbon is calculated with thesame method. Crop biomass carbon is calculatedby the following equation.Crice/C0biomass ¼Yield rice/C0straw/C2Crice/C0strawþYield rice/C0grain/C2Crice/C0grain (1)Cwheat /C0biomass ¼Yield wheat /C0straw/C2Cwheat /C0strawþYield wheat /C0grain/C2Cwheat /C0grain (2)Where C rice-biomass (t ha/C01yr/C01) and C wheat-biomass (tha/C01yr/C01) are biomass carbon of rice and wheat,Yield rice-straw , Yield rice-grain , Yield wheat-straw andYield wheat-grain (t ha/C01yr/C01) are straw and grainyields of rice and wheat. C rice-straw ,Crice-grain ,Cwheat-straw and C wheat-grain (g kg/C01) are the carbon con-centration of straw and grain of rice and wheat.The annual total carbon input is measuredbased on belowground roots and stubbles incor-porated into the topsoil, and applied organic man-ures. Crop carbon input is calculated by thefollowing equation.Cinput¼Cbelowground þCstubbles þCmanure (3)Cbelowground ¼Rrice/C0belowground /C2Crice/C0biomassþRwheat /C0belowground /C2Cwheat /C0biomass (4)Cstubbles ¼Rrice/C0stubbles /C2Yield rice/C0straw/C2Crice/C0strawþRwheat /C0stubbles /C2Yield wheat /C0straw/C2Cwheat /C0straw(5)Where C input (t ha/C01yr/C01) is annual total carboninput into soil, C manure (t ha/C01yr/C01)i sc a r b o nc o n -centration of applied organic manure into soil.Cbelowground (t ha/C01yr/C01) is the underground bio-mass carbon mainly from rice or wheat roots. Bothof Rrice-belowground and R wheat-belowground have a fixedv a l u eo f3 0 % ,w h i c hi st h er a t i oo fa n n u a lu n d e r -ground biomass carbon of each crop to above-ground one. The 75.3% of wheat roots and almost100% of rice roots are distributed in 0 /C020 cm soillayers. Cstubbles (t ha/C01yr/C01) is rice and wheatstubbles biomass carbon. R rice-stubbles is 5.6% andRwheat-stubbles is 15%, both of which are the ratio ofeach crop stubble biomass incorporated into soil toaboveground straw biomass [ 18,19].Calculation of soil organic carbon stock andsequestrationSoil organic carbon stock is equal to soil organiccarbon concentration multiplied by the bulk dens-ity and the depth. Soil organic carbon stock is cal-culated by the following equation.Cstock¼SOC/C2BD/C2D/C210 (6)Where C stock is soil organic carbon stock (tha/C01), SOC is soil organic carbon concentration (gkg/C01), BD is the soil bulk density (g cm/C03), and D isthe depth of soil (m) [ 20].Sequestered soil organic carbon of each treat-ment in the 0 /C020 cm soil depth is equal to thedifference between the soil present organic carbonstock (2013) and the initial one (1981). The carbonsequestration is calculated by the followingequation.Csequestration ¼Cstock in 2013 /C0Cstock in 1981 (7)Where C sequestration is carbon sequestration ofeach treatment in the 0 /C020 cm soil depth (tha/C01), C stock in 2013 is organic carbon stock of eachtreatment in 2013 (t ha/C01) and C stock in 1981 isorganic carbon stock in 1981 (t ha/C01)[21].The carbon sequestration rate is equal tosequestered soil organic carbon of each treatmentdivided by the period of the experiment (thirty-three years). The carbon sequestration rate is cal-culated by the following equation.Csequestration rate ¼ Cstock in 2013 /C0Cstock in 1981 ðÞ =T(8)622 C. HU ET AL.Where C sequestration rate is soil carbon sequestra-tion rate (t ha/C01yr/C01), T is the period of the experi-ment, and thirty-three years for the presentstudy [ 22].Statistical analysisAll data were subjected to statistical analysis ofvariance using the SPSS 11.5 software package andwere used to evaluate differences between differ-ent treatments. Difference obtained at P<0.05level was considered statistically significant usingthe LSD (least significant difference) test.ResultsCrop biomass carbonThe harvestable aboveground crop biomass car-bon was significantly influenced by fertilization(P<0.001) and fertilization years ( P<0.001).Averagely, crop biomass carbon was increased by39.9/C077.2% compared to unfertilized control dueto thirty-three years fertilizer application in therice-wheat cropping systems. The unfertilizedcontrol had the lowest biomass carbon (averagelyannual 4.43 t ha/C01), whereas crop biomass carbonwere the highest in the hMNPK treatment (aver-agely annual 7.85 t ha/C01). Annual crop biomasscarbon was generally higher with manure com-bined with chemical fertilizer compared to chem-ical fertilizer or manure alone treatments.Averagely, annual crop biomass carbon were 5 tha/C01in N treatment, approximate 6 t ha/C01in NP,NPK, M treatments, and approximate 7 t ha/C01inMN, MNP, MNPK, hMNPK treatments ( Figure 1 ).Organic carbon inputAveragely, the lowest total carbon input was 1.44 tha/C01yr/C01in the control treatment, whereas thehighest one was 5.80 t ha/C01yr/C01in the hMNPKtreatment ( Figure 2 ). The average annual carboninputs in the manure treatments (M, MN, MNP,MNPK, hMNPK) were 1.95 /C02.74 times of that inthe NPK treatment (2.12 t ha/C01yr/C01).

The slopes in the balanced application ofthe NPK fertilizer treatment were much sharperthan those in the unbalanced application ofinorganic fertilizer treatments (N, NP).Dynamics of soil organic carbonDuring thirty-three years periods, soil organic car-bon contents had decreasing tendency in the con-trol, N and NP treatments, but had increasingtendency in the NPK, especially appended organicmanure treatments. The rates of decline orincrease were diverse in different fertilization treat-ments ( Figure 3 ). The slopes of linear regressionequations in soil organic carbon indicated that128.4 /C0162.4 mg kg/C01carbon was accumulated inthe appended organic manure treatments everyyear, whereas only 66.2 mg kg/C01carbon in NPKtreatment. Soil organic carbon declined at an rateof 30.1, 21.9, and 14.1 mg kg/C01carbon in the con-trol, N, and NP treatments every year, respectively.Applications of organic manures combined withinorganic fertilizers (MN, MNP, MNPK, hMNPK) sig-nificantly ( P<0.05) increased soil organic carboncontents compared to the corresponding applica-tion of inorganic fertilizers alone (N, NP, NPK). Thebalanced application of the NPK fertilizer increasedsoil organic C contents in comparison to theunbalanced application of inorganic fertilizers(N, NP).Soil carbon sequestrationSoil organic carbon stocks (0 /C020 cm) declined inthe control (33.6 t ha/C01), N (33.5 t ha/C01) and NP(34.7 t ha/C01) treatments in contrast to the initialorganic carbon stock (38.0 t ha/C01), whereasthe organic carbon stocks ascended in the NPK(39.1 t ha/C01) and appended manure treatments(41.8 /C044.5 t ha/C01) in the topsoil during thirty-three years periods. Soil organic carbon sequestra-tion rates (0 /C020 cm) in the MN (0.12 t ha/C01yr/C01),MNP (0.18 t ha/C01yr/C01), MNPK (0.20 t ha/C01yr/C01)and hMNPK (0.19 t ha/C01yr/C01) treatments were sig-nificantly ( P<0.05) higher than those in M (0.12 tha/C01yr/C01) and NPK (0.03 t ha/C01yr/C01) treatments,and the sequestration rate in the M treatment wassignificantly ( P<0.05) higher than that in the NPKtreatment ( Figure 4 ).Regression analysisThere exists a significant non-linear regressionbetween the soil carbon sequestration rates andthe annual carbon inputs ( Figure 5 ). According tothe non-linear regression equation, parametersrelated to soil carbon sequestration were deducedin yellow-brown soil. The estimated decompositionrates of soil organic carbon were 0.46 t ha/C01yr/C01and the minimum rate of the carbon input tomaintain the initial soil organic carbon level was2.40 t ha/C01yr/C01. There is a non-linear correlationbetween the soil carbon sequestration rates andthe annual carbon inputs.DiscussionEffects of manuring and fertilization on soilcarbon sequestrationSoil organic carbon showed a slight decline trendin the control, N and NP fertilizer treatments forthe duration of thirty-three years experiments. Itwas attributed that every year abundant crop bio-mass was removed from those treatments, but thecarbon input from crops into soil could not main-tain the soil carbon equilibrium. Soil carbon outputthrough soil respiration was higher than soil inputcrop roots and stubbles in the control with noamendment addition [ 8,23]. However, the soilorganic carbon content slightly increased in theunfertilized control in a long /C0term experimentsite in Italy [ 8] and also increased in the N and NPfertilizer treatments in the dryland of Loess Plateauin northwest China [ 24]. Increases of soil organiccarbon contents in the balanced NPK applicationplots and organic manure application plots weresimilar to the other experiment sites. For example,adding farmyard manure significantly enhancedsoil organic carbon in a dark loessial soil [ 25], in awheat-maize cropping system of China [ 26,27]and in a wheat-maize [ 28] and rice-wheat croppingTable 2.

The soil organiccarbon sequestration rate (0 /C020 cm) was0.12/C00.20 t ha/C01yr/C01under the appendedmanure treatment in this study. In contrast to theother long-term fertilizer experiment sites, Su et al.[33] reported that changes in soil organic carbonstocks (0 /C020 cm) were 0.16 /C00.42 t ha/C01yr/C01inthe middle of Hexi Corridor. Soil organic carbonsequestration rate (0 /C020 cm) was 0.02 /C00.37 tha/C01yr/C01due to the application of the animalexcretion in a semi /C0arid cropland [ 34] and0.04/C00.16 t ha/C01yr/C01under the arid region afterthe farmyard manure application in southeasternNorway [ 35]. The possible reason was that the soilorganic matter was more rapidly degraded in arice-wheat cropping system than that in an uplandcropping system. The paddy-upland rotation couldaccelerate soil organic matter degradation due tohigh hydrothermal conditions.The soil organic carbon usually rose with theincrease of the carbon input before equilibrium[36]. A non-linear regression was observedbetween the soil carbon sequestration rate andthe organic carbon input in this experimental site.The non-linear regression indicated that the soilcarbon sequestration efficiency descended withthe increasing gradient of the carbon input.Factors affecting soil organic carbonsequestrationThe agricultural soil is an important carbon reser-voir, which plays a key role in migrating carbondioxide emission [ 8]. Soil organic carbon sequestra-tion was mainly influenced by climates, soil types,tillage, fallows, rotations, fertilizations, and so on[37]. For example, Zhang et al. [ 32] reported thatthe organic carbon conversion rate decreased sig-nificantly with the increase in the annual activeaccumulative temperature and precipitation.Under normal conditions, the soil organic carbonaccumulation rate tends to decrease with thehigher soil temperature and moisture. There wasusually a positive linear correlation between soilorganic carbon levels and soil clay contents of sur-face soils [ 38]. No-tillage could increase the soilorganic carbon stock compared with conventionaltillage, because it could significantly reduce soily = 0.1371 x + 17.561R2 = 0.2713P = 0.01612 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0Organic carbon content (g kg-1)Fertilization yearMNPy = 0.1557 x + 17.546R2 = 0.3246P = 0.00712 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 1 02 03 04 0Organic carbon content (g kg-1)Fertilization yearMNPKy = 0.1624 x + 18.128R2 = 0.2703P = 0.01612 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 1 02 03 04 0Organic carbon content (g kg-1)Fertilization yearhMNPKFigure 3.

The crop straw return to soil signifi-cantly increased soil carbon stocks [ 41,42]. Somestudies indicated that applications of fertilizers(including chemical fertilizer, organic manure andchemical fertilizer combined with organic manure)could increase soil organic carbon contents[43/C046]. Follett et al. [ 47] found that the N fertil-ization increased soil organic carbon contents dueto higher crop biomass inputs. However, otherlong-term fertilization studies reported differentresults. Triberti et al. [ 8] indicated that the NP fer-tilization did not affect the soil organic carbon inspite of the huge increase of the stover carboninput in Italy and Argentina, and Su et al. [ 33]found that N, NP and NPK fertilizer applicationsdecreased the soil organic carbon contents in thewheat-maize cropping system. In all experimentalsites in the world, long-term applications oforganic manures increased soil organic carboncontents by adding carbon from the manure itselfand increasing carbon from the crop residue dueto the higher crop biomass in amended soil [ 43,46,48]. However, the field research demonstratedthat different amendments applied at the samecarbon rate had diverse effects on soil organic car-bon sequestration [ 49]. Both of crop residues andcattle slurries, which were degraded more rapidly,had a lower carbon sequestration capacity com-pared with cattle dung due to different compos-ition characteristics of organic matters [ 8].According to the non-linear regression equationbetween the soil carbon sequestration rate andthe annual carbon input, we deduced that theminimum amount of the carbon input to maintainthe initial soil organic carbon level was 2.40 t ha/C01yr/C01, while the carbon input in the control, N, NPfertilizer treatment was only 1.44 /C01.99 t ha/C01yr/C01. In a word, the soil carbon sequestration ratewas lower in rice /C0wheat cropping systems owingto higher frequency hydrothermal and water-upland alternation compared with other croppingsystems. Therefore, the further increments of soilorganic carbon sequestration in rice-wheat crop-ping system would be mainly attributed to extracarbon inputs (including straws returned into soil,cover crops, enhancing crop residues, plantinggreen manures, applying farmyard manures, live-stock and poultry dung, etc).ConclusionThirty-three years (1981 /C02013) manuring and fer-tilization increase crop biomass carbon, organiccarbon input, however, only organic manure appli-cation can increase soil organic carbon concentra-tion in the rice-wheat cropping system of China.Averagely, crop biomass carbon is increased by39.9/C077.2% compared to unfertilized control dueto organic manure or chemical fertilizer applica-tion.

Soil organic carbon con-centration in the topsoil have decreasing tendencyin the control, N and NP treatments; however, soilorganic carbon concentration have ascending ten-dency in the NPK treatment and is significantlyincreased in the manure alone or manureappended chemical fertilizer treatments. Theseresults demonstrate that organic manure applica-tion or integrated organic manure with chemicalfertilizer application can be important strategiesfor increasing soil organic carbon sequestrationand maintaining soil quality in the rice-wheat crop-ping system of China.AcknowledgementsThis Project Sponsored by the National Key Research andDevelopment Program of China (2018YFD0200500); theSpecial Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the PublicInterest of China (201203030); the Scientific ResearchFoundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars,State Education Ministry (2012-940); the Scientific andTechnological Key Achievements Cultivation Project ofHubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2017CGPY01).References1.
