However, being a non-renewable and threatened resource, preserving soil quality is crucial to maintaina range of ecosystem services critical to ecological balances, food production andhuman health. In an agricultural context, soil quality is often perceived as the abilityto support ﬁeld production, and thus soil quality and fertility are strictlyinterconnected. The concept of, as well as the ways to assess, soil fertility hasundergone big changes over the years. Crop performance has been historicallyused as an indicator for soil quality and fertility. Then, analysis of a range ofphysico-chemical parameters has been used to routinely assess soil quality. Todayit is becoming evident that soil quality must be evaluated by combining parametersthat refer both to the physico-chemical and the biological levels. However, it canbe challenging to ﬁnd adequate indexes for evaluating soil quality that are bothpredictive and easy to measure in situ . An ideal soil quality assessment methodshould be ﬂexible, sensitive enough to detect changes in soil functions,management and climate, and should allow comparability among sites. In thisreview, we discuss the current status of soil quality indicators and existingdatabases of harmonized, open-access topsoil data. We also explore theconnections between soil biotic and abiotic features and crop performance inan agricultural context. Finally, based on current knowledge and technicaladvancements, we argue that the use of plant health traits represents a powerfulway to assess soil physico-chemical and biological properties. These plant healthparameters can serve as proxies for different soil features that characterize soilquality both at the physico-chemical and at the microbiological level, including soilquality, fertility and composition of soil microbial communities.KEYWORDSsoil quality, soil-microbe-plant system, microbiome, plant health, soil database,soil indicatorsFrontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 01OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYRoberta Pastorelli,Council for Agricultural and EconomicsResearch (CREA), ItalyREVIEWED BYAntonio Marcos Miranda Silva,University of São Paulo, BrazilValeria Faggioli,Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog ı´aAgropecuaria (INTA), Argentina*CORRESPONDENCEIoannis A.

However, the soil is a non-renewable and threatened resourceextremely vulnerable to climate change and to intensiveagroecosystem management ( Lehmann et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it isurgent to maintain and improve so il biodiversity and fertilityconsidering that soil quality is critical to ecological balances, foodproduction and human health. Indeed, soil underpins a range ofecosystem services because of its pivotal role in regulating water ﬂowand storage, gaseous exchanges, nutrient dynamics, food security andcrop productivity ( Brevick et al., 2018 ). Soil is composed of anextremely complex matrix of organic and inorganic materials.Different physico-chemical and biological parameters in ﬂuence thismatrix and determine soil properties and functions ( Kekane et al.,2015 ). Nevertheless, one of the hardest challenges of soil science isdeciphering soil ’s complexity to assess its quality and measuring soilparameters can require advanced equipment depending on the focus.In this review, we present how the focus of soil science is graduallyshifting from physico-chemical analysis toward biologicalcomponents ( i.e.soil microbial community and activity) and howwe envision that overall plant health, and not just crop productivity,could represent a valuable readout for evaluating soil quality. We areconscious that the plant has been used as a primordial indicator toinfer soil properties. Here we propose new arguments for using planthealth as a reliable proxy of soil properties, as supported by thecurrent scienti ﬁc framework.Current “status quo ”of soilquality indicatorsDeﬁning soil-related concepts is dif ﬁcult because soil is complexand heterogeneous. In this review, we mainly focus on the soil qualityconcept as de ﬁned in Table 1 , which emphasizes the services that soilprovides to living organisms. In the last three decades, several authorshave highlighted the importance of using indicators of a differentnature to achieve a clear understanding of soil quality and as valuableassets for ecosystem monitoring and assessment ( Muñoz-Rojas,2018 ). Due to the multi-dimensional nature of soil quality, usingmultiple indicators is generally preferred. An assessment approachbased on a set of indicators should be considered safer than relying ona single indicator. A soil quality indicator should be i) relevant ii)sensitive iii) practical, user-friendly and cheap, and iv) informative formanagement ( R i n o te ta l . ,2 0 1 9 ). Soil quality indicators aretraditionally divided into physical, chemical and biological, most ofthem being very well connected with each other ( Cardoso et al., 2013 ;Muñoz-Rojas, 2018 ;Rakshit et al., 2020 ).Guo (2021) proposed a further classi ﬁcation of indicators into 3tiers: Tier 1 indicators, which have been widely accepted; Tier 2indicators, which are regionally validated but need additional researchfor improved adoption; and Tier 3 indicators, which are promising tomirror soil quality, however extensive research is needed forimprovements in measurement, interpretation, and use of them.Physico-chemical indicators are widely used and mostly reported inTier 1. Physical soil parameters determine air and water movement;they are the most visible and their assessment does not requirededicated equipment. Most common physical indicators are bulkdensity, soil texture and structure, aggregate stability, porosity, plantavailable water and hydraulic properties ( Horn et al., 1994 ). Theseindicators represent solid soil particles, which are often correlatedwith hydrogeological processes including erosion, aeration, runoff,inﬁltration rate, and water holding capacity and can have an impacton important soil characteristics. For instance, soil texture impacts thebalance between water and gases ( Oertel et al., 2016 ;Wang et al.,2021 ). Aggregate stability is greatly in ﬂuenced by plants and soilmicrobial communities and im pacts plant available water(Blankinship et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, available watercapacity depends on soil texture. Chemical properties representcomplex chemical reactions. Chemical parameters such as pH,organic and total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), mineral nutrientssuch as phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), and cation exchangecapacity are typically correlated with the potential to providenutrients to plants and retain chemical compounds that areharmful to the biotic and abiotic environment ( Schjoerring et al.,2019 ;Mohiuddin et al., 2022 ). Soil pH has a direct impact on physico-chemical and biological soil parameters. It can affect soil compactness(Matsumoto et al., 2018 ) and soil shear strength parameters ( Ghobadiet al., 2014 ) through its action on soil water retention and is stronglyrelated to nutrient availability and microbial activity ( Parra et al.,2017 ;Lammel et al., 2018 ). Microbial activity is also affected byorganic C, which impacts water holding capacity, stability ofaggregates and storage of N ( Smith et al., 2021 ). Nitrogen and P arethe most important plant nutrients: they are both present in a varietyof chemical forms, indicating their highly dynamic activity and theirTABLE 1 Soil-related concepts and de ﬁnitions (according to Bünemann et al., 2018 ;Lehmann et al., 2020 ).Soil fertility is the oldest and narrowest concept and it refers to the ability of soil to support the growth of plants and to sustain the crop yield for human use. Fertil e soil isimportant for agriculture, as it enables crops to grow healthy and strong, providing an abundant and nutritious food, ﬁbre or fuel supply.Soil quality is a measure of the soil ability to function effectively in support of plant growth and other ecosystem services. It is usually considered as “the capacity of a soil tofunction within ecosystem and land-use boundaries to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and anim al health ”, includinghumans ( Doran and Parkin, 1994 ;Doran and Parkin, 1996 ).Soil health has been used since the late 90s and it “captures the ecological attributes of the soil which have implications beyond its quality or capacity to produce a particularcrop. These attributes are chie ﬂy those associated with the soil biota; its biodiversity, its food web structure, its activity and the range of functions it performs ”(Pankhurst et al.,1997 ). Soil health and quality are often used as synonyms, but soil health usually does not only refer to human-related ecosystem services.Soil security refers to the idea that access to the services provided by soil ecosystems should be considered a fundamental human right and is often discussed in the c ontext ofpolicy making. It involves considering the cultural, ﬁnancial, and legal aspects of soil management.Giovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 02presence in the soil is largely depending on microbiological orphysico-chemical dynamics, respectively ( Shen et al., 2011 ;Fowleret al., 2013 ).Since soils are major reservoirs of terrestrial C ( Lal, 2008 ), soilorganic carbon (SOC) is a key functional and manageable chemicalindicator ( Lal, 2016 ;Hueso-Gonza ́lez et al., 2018 ). SOC is the majorcomponent of soil organic matter (SOM) and has critical roles in allsoil processes. The annual rate of SOM losses can vary greatly,particularly in agricultural soil s, and strictly depends on tillagemethods, the type of plant/crop cover, drainage status of the soiland weather conditions. SOC is thus critical for climate changeadaptation and mitigation strategies ( Muñoz-Rojas, 2018 ).Biological indicators are reported in Tier 2 and Tier 3. They arerepresented by enzyme activity, microbial community composition,soil microbial biomass and activity, soil respiration rate, soil proteinindex, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) pro ﬁle, phospholipid fatty acid(PLFA) analysis, soil biodiversity, abundance of earthworms, presenceof pathogens and parasites ( Guo, 2021 and references therein).To integrate indicators for soil quality into a soil management orconservation program, different approaches can be followed. Oneapproach is to conduct soil surveys to gather data on the physical,chemical, and biological soil parameters. This can help to identifyareas with poor or declining soil quality, and can provide a baselinefor monitoring changes over time. A set of soil quality indicators thatreﬂects the speci ﬁc needs and goals of the program can also bedeveloped. Indicators of soil quality can then be developed and usedto guide the implementation of practices aimed at improving the soil.It’s important to regularly review and update these indicators, and toinvolve all relevant stakeholders in the process. Finally, recentadvances in data analysis and machine learning techniques, such asnetwork analysis and structural equation modeling, can be used toestablish connections between soil quality indicators. This canprovide powerful, interactive tools for soil assessment andmanagement ( Bünemann et al., 2018 and references therein).Although their usage is becoming more and more frequentlyappreciated, the number and the type of biological indicators toconstruct a soil quality assessment system is still under debate ( Paz-Ferreiro and Fu, 2013 ;Nunes et al., 2021 ;Guo, 2021 ). Surely, morescienti ﬁc data are needed to further validate the soil quality relevanceand practicality of these biological indicators. Here, we presentevidence for microbiota being an emerging and valuable aspect ofsoil quality.Microbiota as determinants for soil qualityMicrobial diversity and activity represent an aspect of soil quality.Bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa and earthworms are part of thebiological properties of the soil and their activity are interconnectedwith soil physical and chemical properties such as aeration, SOM orpH, and greatly contribute to C and nutrient cycling ( Yang et al.,2018 ). The degradation of soils due to land-use change, erosion,compaction, and pesticide contamination has led to a decline in soilhealth and ecosystem services. To sustain these services and improvesoil quality, it ’s crucial to understand the role of microbialcommunities in soil health. De ﬁning microbiota and microbiome,and using them as indicators of soil quality, is an important ﬁrst stepin this process. The plethora and diversity of microbes residing in thesoil (bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists and algae) are collectively calledsoil microbiota, while microbiota together with their genomic,functional potential are collectively referred to as the microbiome(Pascale et al., 2020 ;Berg et al., 2020 ). High-throughput sequencingduring the last two decades has revealed many key microbial phyla aswell-represented in soil includi ng the bacterial Proteobacteria,Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and the fungalAscomycetes and Basidiomycet es. The plants can exert somepressure on the assembly of the bacterial and fungal microbiotasurrounding them. Studies have demonstrated a microbial diversitygradient between the soil, the rhizosphere (the region of soilimmediately surrounding the roots) and the root endosphere (innerroot tissues), with less diverse microbiomes thriving inside rootscompared to the rhizosphere and soil ( Pascale et al., 2020 ;Trivediet al., 2020 ). The aboveground parts of plants are also home to adiverse and variable community of microbes, deriving from the air,movement of pollinators and other insects, or other plant tissues(Vorholt, 2012 ). These microbes are a subset of the broader soilmicrobiome, and they have adapted to the unique conditions foundon the aboveground parts of plants. This suggests that the soil acts as areservoir for the microorganisms that colonize both the roots andaboveground parts of plants ( Pascale et al., 2020 ;Trivedi et al., 2020 ).The soil microbiome holds great functional potential since mostmicrobes can affect soil aggregation, can mobilize nutrients andhave a role in nutrient cycling but also affect the growth and healthof plants ( Saleem et al., 2019 ;Pascale et al., 2020 ,Custo ́dio et al., 2022 ,Liu et al., 2022 ). Some examples of microbial services to soil qualityand plant health can be found in the section “Microbes can affect soilquality and plant health ”. The importance of soil microbiota as anindicator of soil quality becomes more apparent considering that theyare the source of plant-associated microbiota and can become part ofour diet viathe food web ( Blum et al., 2019 ).Soil monitoring and LUCAS databaseDue to its non-renewable nature, soil must be constantlymonitored to prevent its degradation and promote long-termmanagement. Information databases, and metastudies on soilassessment ( Jian et al., 2020 ), facilitate the evaluation of existingand projected land production, the identi ﬁcation of land and waterrestrictions, and the assessment of risks associated with landdegradation. This is critical for good management of naturalresources, progress towards ending hunger, achieving food securityand sustainable agriculture, especially in light of the issues caused byglobal climate change and the need to make the environment moreresilient. In the last 15 years, the number of soil databases has rapidlyincreased and up-to-date there is a consistent number of thosededicated to speci ﬁc soil parameters, and also those containingharmonized data from all over the world (reference https://soil-modeling.org/resources-links/data-portal/data-portal , InternationalSoil Modeling Consortium ISMC) ( Figure 1 ;Table S1 ). We presenthere as case-study a well-structured soil database promoted by theEuropean Union (EU), called “Land Use/Cover Area frame statisticalSurvey Soil ”(LUCAS) ( https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/lucas ).LUCAS represents the largest harmonized open-access dataset ofGiovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03topsoil parameters available for the EU ( Orgiazzi et al., 2018 ). TheLUCAS survey, carried out by EUROSTAT on a three-yearly basissince 2006, focuses on the state and the dynamics of changes in landuse and cover in the EU. Currently, all 27 EU countries have beencovered and over 270,000 points have been analyzed on different landcover types (agricultural, grassland, forest, built-up areas, transportnetwork, etc.). A standardized sampling procedure was used to collectaround 0.5 kg of topsoil (0-20 cm), successfully analyzed for chemicaland physical parameters like the percentage of coarse fragments,particle size distribution (% clay, silt and sand content), pH (in CaCl 2and H 2O), organic C (g/kg), carbonate content (g/kg), P content(mg/kg), total N content (g/kg), extractable K content (mg/kg), cationexchange capacity (cmol(+)/kg) and multispectral properties. In 2018,the LUCAS survey included additional analyses like bulk density ( i.e.weight of dry soil in a given soil volume), soil biodiversity, visualassessment of soil erosion and measurement of the thickness of theorganic horizon in organic-rich soil. LUCAS Soil survey 2022 iscurrently underway. Notably, the modules Soil Biodiversity andPesticides were recently added to LUCAS, providing tools in thisdirection to both policymakers and the academic community. TheSoil Biodiversity module contains the largest molecular biology-basedanalysis of soil biodiversity in the EU. The Pesticides module providesthe most comprehensive and harmonized assessment of pesticideresidues in European agricultural soils ( Orgiazzi et al., 2022 ).Acquisition of extra data will surely improve our ability to monitorsoils and predict soil-mediated services. However, despite thisprogress, our understanding and capacity to predict the effects ofsoil on plants is still limited.The relationship between soil quality andagricultural productivityIn an agricultural set up, crop performance is dramaticallyinﬂuenced by the physico-chemical soil parameters, andagronomical practices are often intended to modify them tomaximize ﬁeld production. A fertile agricultural soil should havestructure and porosity that allow the exchange of air and water,ensuring good root penetration. Improper agricultural practices canthreaten soil structure viathe breakage of aggregates, increasing soilcompaction and decreasing soil porosity. This leads to a reduced soilwater content and aeration, limiting root development, and cropperformance in general ( Rogers and Benfey, 2015 ).Soil density in ﬂuences root growth and shoot traits. Hard soilsstrongly inhibit root growth and elongation and further affect thedevelopment of leaves and shoots ( Passioura, 2002 ). Interestingly, thisinhibitory effect in hard soils has been recorded on aboveground planttraits, independently from root nutrient and water uptake, suggestingthat a “soil density signal ”might be sensed and systemicallytransmitted from roots independently from a nutritional effect(Passioura, 2002 ;Correa et al., 2019 ). In more detail, plants canadaptively respond to soil density (and in particular to soilcompaction) by modifying the architecture of their root systems.This can have both positive and negative effects on plant performance,leading to either tolerance to soil compaction or a reduction in theplant yield ( Correa et al., 2019 ). Such plastic response has a geneticcomponent, so that “soil compaction tolerance ”is to date considereda trait to be targeted in breeding programmes. On the other hand,excessively loose soils can also lead to poor crop performance,potentially due to an inadequate contact surface between roots andsoil particles ( Passioura, 2002 ). Many physical parameters in ﬂuencecrop productivity by affecting how the soil retains water and makes itavailable for crop production ( Rogers and Benfey, 2015 ). Soil textureplays a crucial role in determining a soil ’s water holding capacity andthe amount of plant-available water it can provide. Different soils,such as loamy, sandy, or clay, have different abilities to attract andhold water due to the size of their pore space and the way water is heldwithin the pores. This means that even when two soils have similarﬁeld capacity, they may not perform equally in terms of providingwater for plants. In general, silt loam soils tend to provide a largeramount of plant-available water compared to other types of soil(Rogers and Benfey, 2015 ).The relationship between soil nutrients and crop yield is well-established for some commercially important leafy and fruit crops(Incrocci et al., 2017 ). Plant nutrient availability strongly depends ontheir interplay with the soil physico-chemical parameters such ascation exchange capacity (CEC), water content, pH and presence ofcolloids. For each crop there is a range from a minimum to amaximum concentration of a nutrient that ensures the best cropperformance. However, ﬁnding this range for each nutrient and foreach crop is challenging. Interestingly, a meta-analysis that includeddifferent plant communities growing in different sites worldwideshowed that leaf traits such as area, N and P contents were moretightly linked to nutrient availability than parameters related to plantgrowth ( Thomas et al., 2016 ). This suggests that leaf traits could beused as a proxy to monitor nutrient availability in the soil.A ss o i ln u t r i e n t sa r et a k e nu pb yr o o t sa si o n s( i.e.NO−3,N H+4andH2PO−4), the soil pH plays a pivotal role in nutrient availability. Plantsc a nt o l e r a t eaw i d er a n g eo fs o i lp H ,t h eo p t i m u mr a n g ef o rm o s tagricultural crops is between 5.5 and 7.5, as the maximum availability ofthe macronutrients is displayed in sl ightly acidic to neutral soils. Poorcrop growth and yield on acidic soils are usually due to the toxicity of H+,aluminum (Al), and manganese (Mn), nutrient de ﬁciencies (particularlyCa and Mg) and reduced uptake of water ( Long et al., 2017 ). Inparticular, Al toxicity is a common problem in acidic soils, where Al ispresent as soluble Al3+ion. This form can passively enter plant roots,impairing many physiological proces ses and eventually impacting cropyield ( Oshunsanya, 2018 ). Unfortunately, soil acidi ﬁcation is a problemFIGURE 1Number of European/world soil databases released from 2007 to2022.Giovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04that affects many cultivated areas worldwide, due to the excessive use of Nfertilizers, acid rain and intensive monoculture ( Long et al., 2017 ).Alkaline conditions aff ect more than 25% of the world ’ss o i l s ,including calcareous, saline, and sodic soils ( Lo ́pez-Bucio et al., 2000 ).High pH decreases the availability of many mineral nutrients in the soilsolution causing nutrient de ﬁciencies and reduces the soil hydraulicconductivity and soil water retention ( Suarez, 2012 ;Xu et al., 2020 ).Beside the negative effect on nutrient uptake, salinity and sodicity mainlyimpact plant growth through io n toxicity and osmotic stress ( Huanget al., 2017 ), while high pH affects root cell elongation and root watertransport ( Xu et al., 2020 ). All these mechanisms eventually lead toreduced crop growth and productivit y as demonstrated for rice, wheregrain yield was shown to signi ﬁcantly decrease with increasing pH in arange from 7 to 9 ( Huang et al., 2017 ).While the relationship between ind ividual soil parameters, such asnutrient content, soil structure, or pH, and crop performance is clear inprinciple, it becomes more complicated and unpredictable in ﬁeldconditions. This is because multiple physico-chemical soil parameterscan affect soil quality simultaneously, creating a unique environment foreachﬁeld. This indicates that methods that consider multiple parametersc a nb em o r ea c c u r a t et op r e d i c tt h e i re f f e c to np l a n tp e r f o r m a n c et h a nsingle-use parameters. As an example, Peralta et al. (2014) studied therelationship between different soil parameters and wheat nitrogendemand and grain yield in different sites. Despite a positive correlationbetween N availability and grain yield, the study also showed that theparameters more relevant to explain the wheat N demand were mostlysite-speci ﬁc. This highlights the importance of considering the “site”variable when analyzing soil factors and their impact on cropperformance. In a study focusing on wheat yield in hilly regions theyfound that spatial variability signi ﬁcantly affected crop performance,underscoring the importance of considering the “site”variable whenanalyzing soil factors and their im pact on crop performance. The studyalso showed that topographic attributes, such as slope, can have adramatic impact on water availabili t ya n ds h o u l db ei n t e g r a t e di n t ocrop performance predictions ( Ajami et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, theannual weather conditions could in ﬂuence the physico-chemical soilfeatures that are critical for cr op yield. That was suggested by Juhos et al.(2015) that performed a multivariate analysis on the same ﬁelds usingdata coming from 10 years and considering different crops (maize, wheat,sunﬂower). They found that in droughty years, the salinization, soiltexture, and nutrient contents were the most in ﬂuencing parameters,while in rainy years the SOM and th e nutrient contents were the mainlimiting factors determining the crop yields.Microbes can affect soil quality andplant healthMicrobiota and soil quality have a reciprocal relationship, asevidenced by various examples in the literature. Microbes can directlyaffect soil quality through their ability to release extracellularpolymeric substances (EPS), which are mostly composed ofpolysaccharides, proteins, and DNA. These substances improve soilparticle aggregation and help retain moisture ( Costa et al., 2018 ). Inaddition, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can form densenetworks of hyphae that facilitate nutrient transfer betweendifferent soil areas and also contribute to maintaining soil structureand aggregation ( Rillig et al., 2015 ). In the next examples, we will useplant health as a readout of soil quality. Although the term “planthealth ”can be interpreted in multiple ways, we aim to de ﬁne a plantas healthy “as long as its physiological performance, determined by itsgenetic potential and environmental conditions, is maintained ”(Döring et al., 2011 and references therein). An ideal soil foragricultural production should accommodate a diverse microbiomecontaining many microbes with enhanced nutrient mobilizationcapacity and the ability to suppress plant pathogens ( Weller et al.,2002 ;Saleem et al., 2019 ). Many studies have shown that when plantsare stressed, they “cry for help ”by emitting chemical signals thatattract helpful soil microbes that can assist in relieving the stress(Pascale et al., 2020 ). For instance, when soil P or N is unavailable forplants, they secrete molecules to attract AMF and nitrogen- ﬁxingrhizobia from the soil that can facilitate P and N uptake respectively(Oldroyd, 2013 ;Lanfranco et al., 2018 ). When plants experiencedrought, they can also recru it microbes that can speci ﬁcallyattenuate drought-related stresses in plants ( Williams and de Vries,2020 ). Similarly, in soils with unavailable iron (Fe) plants releasemetabolites to attract iron-mobilizing microbiota ( Stringlis et al.,2018 ;Harbort et al., 2020 ). In the case of increased pathogen loadin soil and a disease outbreak, there is an enrichment of selectedmicrobiota e.g.ﬂuorescent Pseudomonas sp. that can lead to thesuppression of disease ( Weller et al., 2002 ). This phenomenon isknown as speci ﬁc soil suppressiveness to plant diseases. However,disease suppression can be also achieved by increasing the activity ofsoil microbiota viasoil manipulation and the addition of organicmatter, certain agronomic practices, or improvement of soil fertility,leading to general suppressiveness ( Raaijmakers and Mazzola, 2016 ).Additionally, the presence or absence of rare bacterial taxa in the soilcan determine whether the soil can favor future disease outcomes,opening new avenues toward the use of microbes as indicators of“disease-prone ”soils ( Wei et al., 2019 ). Finally, drought can disruptsoil structure and water content and in turn affect the structure andactivity of microbiomes. Severe drought can affect the presence ofmicrobiota that can contribute to plant resilience ( Santos-Medell ı ́net al., 2021 ), while conditions of mild drought can increase bacterialactivity related to Fe transport and metabolism ( Xu et al., 2021 ).Therefore, achieving plant tolerance to drought requires decodinghow soil and plant microbiomes respond and adapt to droughtconditions. Caution is needed under conditions of (a)biotic stress,since plants may have less control over their microbiota, leading tothe formation of dysbiotic plant microbiomes. Dysbiosis can affect thehost, the microbiota, or both, and occurs when the proportions ofmicroorganisms in the microbiome are not balanced or when harmfulmicroorganisms are present in high numbers. This can lead tonegative effects on the plant, such as reduced growth and increasedsusceptibility to disease. It is important to take steps to prevent ormitigate dysbiosis in plant microbiomes to maintain the health andproductivity of the plants ( Arnault et al., 2022 ).Monitoring soil quality in agriculturethrough soil-plant-microbiota crosstalkThe expansion of ecosystem services provided by soils and theirconnection with human, animal and ecosystem health underpins theGiovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 05key role of soil in the emerging “One Health ”vision ( Banerjee and vander Heijden, 2022 ;Lehmann et al., 2020 ). The numerous healthindicators for soil (physical, chemical and biological) and thecomplex interactions between them in many different processesmakes it challenging for soil scientists to select the mostrepresentative indicators or to determine how many indicatorsshould be considered during soil health evaluation ( Creamer et al.,2022 ). Moreover, in different climatic conditions the same indicatorcould be considered high or low depending on other parameters (forexample organic C levels can be considered high or low depending onthe soil clay content).Recently, the EU soil mission launched a new set of eightobjectives proposing clear targets and new measurable physical,chemical, biological and socio-economic indicators for monitoringthe state of the soil ( European Mission - A soil deal for Europe).However, not all of the proposed parameters can be used to assessdifferent ecosystems, and the range of indicators is somewhat limitedand may not be fully representative of speci ﬁc contexts. In general,biological properties are under-represented in soil health evaluations,despite their direct link to physico-chemical parameters and theirrecognized impacts on soil fertility, plant productivity, and humanhealth ( Bongiorno, 2020 ). For instance, while the EU has recognizedthe importance of improving soil biota quality as part of its trajectorytoward sustainable soil management and restoration, the monitoringof microbiota dynamics and biodiversity is not included as a criticalsoil indicator. Novel criteria and indicators based on the tracking ofmicrobiota diversity should be introduced to evaluate soil quality.This is feasible considering the advances in next-generationsequencing technologies that have been extensively used in the lasttwo decades toward microbiota mapping in different ecosystems,including soils. However, some challenges still exist before adoptingsoil microbiota-based indicators: a) while taxonomy and compositioncan be easily tracked, the functionality of microbiomes relies on moreexpensive and bioinformaticall y demanding approaches such asshotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and b) theexisting microbial databases, u sually used for microbiomecharacterization and functionality, might not be representative ofmost soils and ecosystems. In this framework, the use of microbiotadiversity as a soil quality indicator is not yet widely adopted. Giventhat microbial colonization alters plant physiology, development andgene expression, it may be possible to monitor host plant traits anduse plant health as a reliable soil quality indicator.Indeed, plant health can be considered as the ﬁnal output of theintegration of many soil quality parameters since it re ﬂects thecomplexity of the interaction between plants and their environmentinto a single outcome. Plants can therefore be seen as a powerful lensthrough which we can interpret the soil, as already suggested byecologists ( van der Putten et al., 2013 ). This approach can offer a real-time and up-to-date methodology to interpret the status of a plant byfocusing on multiple reliable measurements, rather than just plantyield ( Figure 2 ). Each of the suggested plant health parametersrepresents an important proxy for different soil quality parameters,including soil microbial divers ity. By using plant health as anindicator of soil quality, we could monitor and address importantsocietal goals, such as reducing soil pollution, improving soilrestoration and enhancing soil structure to support habitat qualityand soil biota and crops.As an example, we are here listing a set of plant health parametersthat are easy to measure and essential to evaluate soil status ( Table 2 ).The plant photosynthetic capa city likely mirrors importantinformation about soil chemic al parameters, such as nutrientavailability ( Ai et al., 2017 ), but it is also affected by soilphysicochemical and biological parameters, such as root-associatedmicrobes ( Moustakas et al., 2020 ;Balestrini et al., 2020 ) or conditionsaffecting these parameters like deserti ﬁcation ( Qiu et al., 2018 ), pH(Long et al., 2017 ). It is a sensitive indicator, with rapid and largechanges in ﬂuenced by external factors. Chlorophylls, including Chl a,Chl b and Chl a+b, can be easily measured with a simple ethanol-based extraction and colorimetric assays or with on- ﬁeld portableapproaches. A correct range of photosynthetic pigment concentrationcorrelates with a healthy content of macro- and micro- nutrients.Another plant parameter useful to infer crucial soil physico-chemicalindicators and microbiota dynamics is represented by the plantelemental composition ( Callaham and Stanturf, 2021 ;Schjoerringet al., 2019 ;Shaaban et al., 2016 ;Mohiuddin et al., 2022 ;Singh et al.,2022 )(Table 2 ). The macro- and micro-elements accumulating inplant tissues provide a clear readout of soil nutrient availability thatcan impact plant food security an d human nutrition, thereforemirroring a meaningful soil service. In addition, detailed nutritionalproﬁling of plant tissues can facilitate precision in fertilizermanagement and can be performed at different stages of plantgrowth. Monitoring it over time can provide a better resolution andimprove our ability to interpret soil nutrient availability and itsﬂuctuations. Furthermore, tracking the presence of pollutants inplant tissues can also provide insights into soil health, including itslevels of heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides and microplastics, whichare all absorbed by plant roots and accumulate in plant tissues ( Biswaset al., 2018 ;Stoykova and Inui, 2021 ;Walder et al., 2022 ;Edlingeret al., 2022 ). Altogether, monitoring the levels of different targetmolecules accumulating inside plant tissues could help us ﬁngerprintthe quality of soils.Soil and plant resilience are considered two sides of the same coin.Seaton et al. (2020) and Deng et al. (2020) showed that severalphysico-chemical soil parameters such as water repellency, texture,pH, SOC and nutrient soil content can affect the ability of plants towithstand (a)biotic stresses. A dditionally, alterations in thecomposition and activities of the plant-associated microbiota canaffect plant resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Chialva et al.,2018 ;Pascale et al., 2020 ;Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020 ;Chialva et al.,2022 ;Vannini et al., 2021 ;Trivedi et al., 2022 ). It is also suggested thatplant adaptation to climate change will be driven by eco-evolutionaryinteractions with its associated microbiome ( Trivedi et al., 2022 ).Metatranscriptomic and metagenomics technologies could be used toidentify plant-associated microorganisms and their relationship tosoil characteristics and plant adaptation. Moreover, meta-omicsstudies provide information about gene expression levels viagenomics and transcriptomics, as well as about post-translationalchanges viaproteomics. Additionally, metabolomics or volatilomicscan provide information about metabolites as a result of cellularprocesses, or volatile organic c ompounds (VOCs), respectively.Therefore, a combination of -o mics methods can connect allaspects of the plant-microbe-soil relationship at the cellular level(Sharma et al., 2020 ;Brown et al., 2021 ;Gupta et al., 2021 ;Mishraet al., 2022 ;Yu et al., 2022 ).Giovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 06Future perspectivesIn this review, we argue for the use of plant health traits asindicators of soil quality, under both a physico-chemical and abiological point of view. However, their adoption needs to beaccompanied by the development of rapid and reliable assays onboth the plant and soil sides. On the plant side, new strategies suitablef o rt r a c k i n gp l a n th e a l t hm a yu tilize gene-expression basedtechnologies or bioinspired soft and miniature machines able torecord a wide range of paramete rs. Since it has already beenFIGURE 2Plant health indicators as a proxy of soil quality. A combination of plant health parameters such as photosynthesis, yield and resilience can represent apowerful ‘‘lens ’’to evaluate soil quality and differentiate between a “good ”, healthy soil and a “bad ”soil, with properties not supporting plant growth. In a“good ”soil, a diverse and balanced microbiome is present, along with optimal physico-chemical parameters and air and water movement, while differentnutrients are available for the plant and support its growth, health and resilience. In contrast, a “bad ”soil is characterized by a dysbiotic microbiome,reduced water and air movement, limited nutrient availability and suboptimal physico-chemical parameters, which negatively affect various plant traits.Using different methods and analyzing multiple indicators, we can determine the relationship between soil parameters and selected traits of plant h ealth.TABLE 2 Plant health indicators that correlate with soil characteristics.Soil parametersPlant health indicator Physical Chemical BiologicalPhotosynthetic capacity Deserti ﬁcation ( Qiu et al., 2018 ) Water(Qiu et al., 2018 )P and N soil availability ( Ai et al., 2017 ) AM fungi ( Moustakas et al., 2020 ;Balestrini et al., 2020 )Micro- and macro- elements Soil texture ( Callaham and Stanturf, 2021 ) NPK and SOM ( Schjoerring et al., 2019 ); pH,redox potentials ( Mohiuddin et al., 2022 );electric conductivity ( Shaaban et al., 2016 )Microbiota diversity ( Singh et al., 2022 );AM fungi ( Lanfranco et al., 2018 )Pathogenesis Structural heterogeneity and water/oxygenavailability ( Otten and Gilligan 2006 ); moistureand clay content ( Döring et al., 2020 )NPK, organic matter content and cationexchange capacity ( van Agtmaal et al., 2018 )AM fungi ( Vannini et al., 2021 );microbiota ( Chialva et al., 2018 ;Chialva et al., 2022 )Stress resilience Water repellency, soil texture and macroporedensity ( Seaton et al., 2020 )Soil carbon stock and pH Seaton et al., 2020 );soil indigenous nutrients ( Deng et al., 2020 )Microbiota ( Seaton et al., 2020 ;Trivediet al., 2022 )Presence of pollutants(heavy metals, herbicide,pesticide, microplastics)Temperature and moisture ( Biswas et al., 2018 ) Organic matter and mineral fractions(Biswas et al., 2018 )Microbial activities ( Biswas et al., 2018 );microbiota ( Walder et al., 2022 ); AMfungi ( Edlinger et al., 2022 )Giovannetti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1082752Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 07demonstrated that RNAs and miRNAs can be used as marker genes tomonitor the onset and transmission of (a)biotic stresses ( Lo ́pez-Galiano et al., 2019 ;Tyagi et al., 2021 ;S ̌ec ̌ic ́et al., 2021 ;Zhanget al., 2022 ;Paes de Melo et al., 2022 ) species-speci ﬁc large-scalemicroarrays which cluster all the (a)biotic stress markers genesavailable in shoot could be envisaged. Additionally, plant-likeminiature adhesive systems for in situ leaf microenvironmentmonitoring have been recently developed ( Fiorello et al., 2021 ;Coatsworth et al., 2022 ). The development of plant-inspiredminiature machines coupled by sensors to detect in real-timemacro- and micronutrients in plant leaves would be instrumental toinfer soil nutrient availability and open avenues for their applicationin precision agrotechnology systems. Additionally, the agriculture 4.0technologies applied in the ﬁeld such as the use of drones and sensorscould provide novel ways to assess plant health. Drones can serve as apowerful tool to monitor the growth of crops ( Rejeb et al., 2022 ). Forexample, new spectroscopic techniques, such as unmanned aerialvehicle (UAV) multispectral sensor is already used in the ﬁeld formonitoring crop leaf N accumulation, leaf area index, and leaf dryweight and photosynthetic capacity ( Potgieter et al., 2017 ;Yao et al.,2019 ;Zhang et al., 2020 ;Sharma et al., 2022 ). This drone-basedphenotyping approach might be further ﬁne-tuned and fostered todevelop a non-destructive, rapid and in situ method to track planthealth. On the soil side, applying methods to detect the actual level ofmicrobial biodiversity, as well as microbiota functions relevant toplant growth promotion and the regulation of biogeochemical cyclingwould be a major step forward. Up-to-date techniques for genome/amplicon sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analyses arealready available, and the costs and time from sequencing to ﬁnaldata are progressively reducing. That could make this strategypotentially more affordable in the future for daily practice in theﬁeld. Together, the systems- and molecular-level knowledge on plant-soil-microbiota crosstalk will be pivotal to decode and improve soilhealth and crop productivity.Author contributionsVF, SP, IAS proposed the concept.
