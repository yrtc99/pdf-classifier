We demonstrated that bacteriausing FH increase the hydrolysis of an organic nitrogen source that only the funguscan degrade. Using puriﬁed fungal exudates, we found that this increased hydrolysiswas due to bacteria enhancing the activity of proteolytic enzymes produced by thefungus. The same effect was shown for various fungal and bacterial strains. The effectof this enhanced proteolytic activity on bacterial and fungal biomass production variedaccordingly to the source of C organd N orgprovided. An increase in biomass for bothpartners 5 days post-inoculation was only attained with a N orgsource that the bacteriumcould not degrade and when additional C orgwas present in the medium. In contrast,all other combinations yielded a decrease on biomass production in the co-culturescompared to individual growth. The coupled cycling of C organd N orgis rarely consideredwhen investigating the role of microbial activity on soil functioning. Our results showthat cycling of these two elements can be related through cross-chemical reactions inindependent, albeit interacting microbes. In this way, the composition of organic materialcould greatly alter nutrient turnover due to its effect on the outcome of interactionsbetween fungi and bacteria that disperse on their mycelia.Keywords: carbon and nitrogen, bacteria–fungi interaction, Morchella spp., soil, fungal highways, hydrolysis,fungal exudates, nutrient cycleINTRODUCTIONSoils are living components of terrestrial ecosystems that sustain essential services such as nutrientrecycling and productivity (Schnitzer and Klironomos, 2011; Baveye et al., 2016). The ability ofsoils to perform these services depends on both abiotic and biotic factors. Among the latter, fungiand bacteria are considered as central engines of soil nutrient cycling (Torsvik and Øvreås, 2002).However, the importance of other soil organisms such as protists, nematodes, and even viruses, inFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 2Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi Interactionsthe cycling of nutrients in soils is also highlighted by recentfunctional studies (Adl and Gupta, 2006; Gebremikael et al., 2016;Geisen et al., 2016). In the carbon (C) cycle, fungi are knownto degrade large polymers, including plant cell wall componentssuch as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Kohler et al., 2015).In contrast, bacteria are active in the degradation of simplerpolysaccharides (Lladó et al., 2016). Nitrogen (N) is a secondimportant nutrient aﬀecting soil ecosystem services (Kibblewhiteet al., 2008; Mooshammer et al., 2014; Mooshammer et al.,2017). Apart of the mass production of inorganic N fertilizersin agriculture, the N cycle is virtually entirely controlled byprokaryotic microbes (Falkowski et al., 2008). Fixation ofatmospheric nitrogen and the transformation of ammonium intonitrate, are reactions catalyzed only by prokaryotic enzymes thatrender N bioavailable to other organisms (Falkowski et al., 2008).In addition to nitrate and ammonium, which are consideredthe most abundant forms of bioavailable N in soils (Kant et al.,2010), dissolved organic N (e.g., small peptides and amino acids)represents a signiﬁcant pool of N in many soils (Tamm, 1991;Jones et al., 2004; Hodge and Fitter, 2010; Hynson et al., 2015).Besides, more complex forms of organic N can contribute tothe pool of available N for plant uptake through the interactionwith symbiotic microorganisms such as mycorrhizae (Näsholmet al., 2009). While studies investigating the use of organic Nare scarce (Horwath, 2017), the balance of C and N content insoils (C/N molar ratio) has been shown to aﬀect the abundanceof fungi and bacteria (Waring, 2013). This is because eachelement appears to inﬂuence one or the other microbial group(Demoling et al., 2007). Therefore, depending on availability ofC and N, direct uptake or mineralization of organic C and Ncompounds (hereafter C organd N org) can play an important rolein determining soil microbial activity.Beside the individual activity of fungi or bacteria in C and Ncycling, a recent area of interest consists in investigating the roleof bacteria–fungi interactions (BFI) in microbial activity (Frey-Klett et al., 2011; Deveau et al., 2018). Fungal colonization ofterrestrial ecosystems likely had a strong impact on the evolutionof bacteria, with soil bacteria living and evolving in a fungalworld (Boer et al., 2005). The same can be expected reciprocallyin the case of fungi. This long co-evolutionary history shapesnutrient cycling. Indeed, the classic fungi-only/bacteria-only viewof nutrient turnover is now changing based on the recognitionof BFIs occurring during organic matter mineralization, asreported, for instance, for lignocellulose degradation (Johnstonet al., 2016) or wood cellulose and lignin degradation in forestsoils (Valaskova et al., 2009; Hervé et al., 2016; Kielak et al.,2016; Rinta-Kanto et al., 2016). The same should be true in themineralization of various N orgsubstrates, but this point has notbeen assessed so far.Here, we focus on how one recently model system of BFIin soils, namely the active dispersal of bacteria on the surfaceof fungal mycelial networks, aﬀects the mineralization of C organd N orgcompounds. This dispersal mechanism, dubbed “fungalhighways” (FH) (Kohlmeier et al., 2005), expands the spatialrange in which bacteria can be active, as bacterial mobilityis otherwise limited by the discontinuity of water ﬁlms inmost soils (Kohlmeier et al., 2005; Dechesne et al., 2010;Wang and Or, 2010). FH have been suggested to be importantin processes related to soil bioremediation (Wick et al., 2007;Furuno et al., 2010). In microcosm experiments, FH appears asone of the mechanisms explaining the role of fungi on activatingthe bacterial use of a speciﬁc C source (Martin et al., 2012;Bravo et al., 2013). In addition, recently, FH have been shown toaﬀect the way microbial communities get assembled in a modelecosystem in which dispersal is highly limiting (rind cheese)(Zhang et al., 2015). The physical contact established betweenfungi and bacteria during FH opens up the possibility of a moredirect nutrient exchange as well as cross-chemical reactions thatmay enhance or reduce microbial metabolic activity. In thisstudy, we investigated the role of FH interactions established withdiﬀerent species of the fungal genus Morchella in the exploitationof C organd N organd their eﬀect on fungal and bacterial biomass.MATERIALS AND METHODSDescription of the Fungal and BacterialSpecies Used in the StudyThree fungal strains belonging to the genus Morchella(Ascomycota) were used in this study ( Table 1 ). They wereisolated from ascocarps collected in Switzerland. Morchellacrassipes (NEU M84), Morchella rufobrunnea (NEU M85) andanother isolate of Morchella rufobrunnea were identiﬁed bysequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 andthe 5.8S rRNA gene, Morchella crassipes is known to form FHwith diverse bacteria (Pion et al., 2013a). Available informationconcerning the ecology of the genus suggest that Morchellaspp. includes not only saprophytic species, but also facultativemycorrhizal species (Tietel and Masaphy, 2018). This fungalgenus is of economic importance as the fruiting bodies of variousspecies are used commercially as edible fungi and in traditionalmedicine (Tietel and Masaphy, 2018).Seven strains belonging to the genus Pseudomonas , as well astwo strains belonging to the genera Cupriavidus (two species)and Escherichia (one species) were included ( Table 1 ). Thespeciﬁc characteristics of the strains, including the presenceof ﬂuorescent tags, motility, gene deletions, ecology (habitat),and proteolytic activity are shown in Table 1 .Pseudomonasputida strain KT2440 and its isogenic non-ﬂagellated mutant(strain 1ﬂiM ) were kindly provided by Dr. Arnaud Dechesne(Technical University of Denmark). Both strains harbor in theirchromosomes a gene coding for either a green ﬂuorescent protein(GFP) or a red ﬂuorescent protein (DsRed) in a neutral locus.These genes are expressed constitutively and were inserted inthe chromosome with the miniTn7 transposon delivery plasmid(Lambertsen et al., 2004; Dechesne et al., 2010). The non-motile1ﬂiM strain was constructed by allelic exchange (for detailsplease refer to Dechesne et al., 2010). The deletion of geneﬂiM causes the absence of the ﬂagellum (Dechesne et al., 2010)and makes P. putida KT2440 1ﬂiM unable to disperse on FH(Pion et al., 2013b). According to the annotation of the genomeofP. putida KT2440, this strain does not possess a casein-degrading protease ( Supplementary Table S1 ).Pseudomonasﬂuorescens strain CHAO 1gacA was constructed and kindlyFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 3Lohberger et al.

The strain carries a deletion on the gene gacAgenerated with a recombinant plasmid, which was constructedin cosmid pVK100 and mobilized with the helper plasmidpME497 by Escherichia coli toP. ﬂuorescens CHAO (for detailsplease refer to Laville et al., 1992). The gene gacA encodes aregulatory protein of the two-component system GacA/GacS,which controls the expression of secondary metabolites andextracellular products. Under the conditions tested here, thisstrain does not have a proteolytic activity. P. ﬂuorescence Pf0-1and Pf0 1aprA were kindly provided by the laboratory of ProfStuart B. Levy (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston).The gene aprA was deleted using the suicide vector pSR47Sby ampliﬁcation of the gene by PCR and interruption by theinsertion in an antibiotic resistance cassette. The mutated alleleswere ﬁnally cloned into the pSR47S plasmid and transferred byconjugation (for details please refer to Seaton et al., 2013). TheaprA gene encodes for an alkaline protease, which is involved inproteolytic activity.Preparation of InoculaA pre-inoculum of the fungal strains was prepared on malt agarmedium (malt) ( Supplementary Table S2 ) and incubated for5 days at 21C. The pre-inocula were made by placing a pieceFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 4Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi Interactionsof malt previously colonized by mycelium on top of the freshmedium. The piece was cut using the large end of a sterilizedPasteur pipette. The inoculum was obtained from the outer rimof the colony.A bacterial pre-inoculum was prepared from a cryopreservedculture by ﬁrst re-culturing on nutrient agar (NA) medium(Supplementary Table S2 ) overnight. The cultures wereincubated at the optimal temperate for each strain (24, 30,or 37C as indicated in Table 1 ). This culture was then usedto inoculate a fresh NA Petri dish as a bacterial loan. Pre-inocula were incubated overnight at optimal temperature for eachindividual species. To prepare the inoculum for the experiments,bacterial biomass was mechanically collected with a sterile spatulafrom the fully-covered NA plate. Biomass was transferred to anEppendorf tube and washed three times in 1 mL saline aqueoussolution (0.9% w/v NaCl) to avoid any carry over from thepre-inoculum medium. Between the washing steps, the bacterialinoculum was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. After removingthe medium, the inoculum was adjusted to the cell concentrationof 108cells mL 1.Extracellular Proteolytic ActivityProteolytic activity was tested on a skimmed milk medium withand without additional malt (malt/casein and casein, respectively;Supplementary Table S2 ). In the experiments with the fungalpartner alone, a plug cut with the large end of a sterilized Pasteurpipette was obtained from the colony edge of the fungal pre-inoculum and placed in the center of a Petri dish containingthe respective medium. The Petri dish was incubated at 21C indarkness. In order to prepare co-cultures, the bacterial inoculumwas added to Petri dishes with the fungus prepared as indicatedbefore, after 1 day of incubation. The bacterial cells were added asa semicircle (5 mL) at around 1.5 cm from the fungal inoculum.Cultures with bacteria alone were prepared as above, but in theabsence of the fungus. Six replicates were prepared for eachcondition. After adding the bacterial inoculum, images of thePetri dishes were taken 2, 3, and 5 days post inoculation (DPI),using a Canon Power Shot SX 230 HS digital camera. The close-up images of the colonies were taken with a Nikon C-BD230stereomicroscope with diﬀerent ﬁlters for bright ﬁeld (PhotonicPL3000 cold light as source; Nikon C-SHG1), GFP , and DsRed(mercury light source for ﬂuorescence images; Nikon C-SHG1).In order to compare the area of proteolysis from the fungalmonocultures and bacterial-fungal co-cultures, the original 8-bitRGB images were analyzed using ImageJ (Version 2.0.0). Theimages were split into the three color channels (red, green, andblue). The blue channel, with the highest contrast, was used forfurther analysis. The picture was converted into a red image toadjust the threshold manually. After the image was converted intoa black/white image, where the area of proteolysis appears black,a person naive to the experimental design manually selected thewhite zones within this area in black. The black area was thenautomatically surrounded with a selection tool and the extend ofthe area of proteolysis was analyzed in mm2(n= 6). In order totest for signiﬁcant outliers a Grubb’s Test was used ( a= 0.01).A Shapiro–Wilk Test was then performed to test for normality ofthe data using a threshold of p= 0.01 for n= 6. The diﬀerencein the mean area of the proteolytic zone for each condition wasthen statistically compared using a two-tailed Students T-Test for2 independent means with a threshold of p= 0.01.Extraction of Fungal ExudatesIn order to control for the excess production of proteolyticenzymes by the fungus in presence of bacteria, fungal exudateswere extracted and tested for proteolytic activity. Proteolyticactivity was measured on exudates extracted from mono and co-cultures prepared on malt and malt/casein medium, as indicatedin the respective ﬁgure legends. After 5 DPI, water-soluble fungalexudates were extracted by collecting the agar and transferring itto a 50 mL falcon tube. A 0.9% NaCl (w/v) solution was addeduntil the 30 mL mark of the Falcon tube. This was incubatedfor 24 h, at 4C. The supernatant was ﬁlter sterilized (0.2 mmnylon ﬁlter, NalgeneR). Exudates were also collected from speciﬁcareas of the fungal colony. For the latter, exudates were extractedfrom four diﬀerent places of the fungal mono or co-culture bypouching out the agar with the tick end of a sterile Pasteur pipette.Three agar plugs from each place were placed in 200 mL of 0.9%NaCl (w/v) and incubated for 24 h at 4C. The supernatant wasﬁlter sterilized as indicated before.Proteolytic Activity of Extracted FungalExudates in Presence and Absence ofBacteriaTo test for proteolytic activity of the fungal exudates alone, 8 mLof the ﬁlter-sterilized fungal exudates were dropped on thesurface of malt/casein agar (0.75% agar). To measure the eﬀectof bacteria on proteolytic activity of the fungal exudates, bacterialcells were inoculated on NA as previously described. Bacterialbiomass was recovered as described before (preparation ofpre-inocula). Cells were then mixed with 30 mL of 40C warm(non-polymerized) malt/casein agar medium (ﬁnal bacterialconcentration 5107cells mL 1). The medium-bacterial mixwas gently homogenized and poured into Petri dishes. Then,8mL of the ﬁlter-sterilized fungal exudates were dropped onthe surface of the medium containing bacteria. To verify thatenhancement depends on living bacterial cells, Petri dishes withthree compartments of 10 mL each (no bacteria, living, anddead bacteria) were used for this purpose. Living bacteria wereprepared and inoculated and as previously described. Deadbacteria were obtained by heating and freezing bacterial cellsfour times alternately for 5 min at 80C in a water bath and5 min at 196C in liquid nitrogen. The control without bacteriacontained only medium. On each compartment 8 mﬁlter-sterilized exudates were dropped on the surface (with the numberof technical replicates indicated in the respective ﬁgure legends).Each combination was prepared in triplicate.Pictures were taken 24 h after inoculation at 21C with aCanon EOS 5D MK2 at same light and distance conditions (lens:Sigma f2.8/105 mm makro; exposure: camera raw, f8, 1/250 sek,adobe rgb). Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop fromthe raw images using the following settings: wb: 3900, color-tone:C45, contrast:C1; clarityC50. Quantiﬁcation of the tonalvalue averages of each dropping spot was performed with ImageJFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 5Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi Interactions(Version 2.0.0). A circle of 30 pixels was placed in the middle ofeach spot and the average of the tonal value was analyzed. TheGrubb’s Test was used to test for signiﬁcant outliers. The Shapiro–Wilk Test was used to test for normality. A two-tailed StudentsT-Test for two independent means was also chosen to determinesigniﬁcant diﬀerences ( p= 0.01) between the proteolytic activityof the fungal exudates in the presence and absence of bacteria.Effect of C organd N orgSources on theOutcome of Morchella –PseudomonasInteractionMorchella crassipes and Pseudomonas putida were selected totest the eﬀect of varying C organd N orgon biomass production.Pre-inocula were prepared as indicated previously. The funguswas then inoculated in the middle of a Petri dish (as previouslydescribed) on malt, malt/casein, casein, urea or malt/urea andincubated for 24 h at 21C. After 1 DPI, 5 mL of a bacterialsuspension (pre-inoculated bacteria as described before) wereadded at a concentration to 108cells m 1. Both strains wereinoculated as a mono or co-culture for 6 DPI. The experimentswere performed in triplicates.Fatty Acid AnalysisThe analysis of speciﬁc fatty acids (FA) was used to measurethe eﬀect of the diﬀerent culture conditions (i.e., mediatype, mono versus co-culture) on the resulting P. putidaand M. crassipes biomass. For this, quantitative analysis ofspeciﬁc phospholipid biomarkers for the bacterium and funguswas conducted (Olsson, 1999; Zelles, 1999). PhospholipidFAs were extracted from a total of 27 samples and wereidentiﬁed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).For quantiﬁcation gas chromatography/ﬂame ionizationdetection (GC/FID) was used (Spangenberg et al., 2014;Spangenberg, 2016). All chemicals [chromatography-gradesolvents: dichloromethane, methanol, hexane, toluene; analyticalgrade (or higher) anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na 2SO4) and 35%w/w hydrochloric acid (HCl)] were supplied by VWR/MerckInternational AG (Dietikon, Switzerland). Solvents wereglass-distilled shortly before use. Fully deuterated lauric acid(D23n-C12V0) and arachidic acid (D 39n-C20V0) were purchasedfrom Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (CIL, Tewksbury, MA,United States) and used for preparation of an internal standardsolution in dichloromethane. Reagent-grade water was preparedby three liquid-liquid extractions of 500 m puriﬁed water using aDirect-Q UV 3 MilliporeRSystem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)with 50 mL dichloromethane.For FAs analysis, Petri dishes containing medium andmicrobial biomass were frozen at  80C for 2 days andthen freeze-dried for 16 h. The medium and the microbialbiomass were separated mechanically from the Petri dish usingcleaned forceps and scissors and placed in a 12 mL borosilicateglass vials with Teﬂon-lines screw caps. An aliquot of internalstandard solution containing a deﬁned amount (50 mg) ofdeuterated carboxylic acids (D 23n-C12V0, lauric acid, D 39n-C20V0,arachidic acid) was added to each sample to allow downstreamidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation. FAs were then extracted byvortexing for 2 min and using sonication in solvents of decreasingpolarity (10 min in 2 3 mL methanol, 10 min in 2 3 mLmethanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v; 10 min in 2 3 mLdichloromethane). The extracts were combined and the solventremoved via gentle evaporation under a clean nitrogen ﬂow.The extracted FAs were transesteriﬁed using the acid-catalyzedprocedure to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) (Ichiharaand Fukubayashi, 2010). The FA extract was dissolved in0.20 mL toluene, and 1.5 mL methanol and 0.30 mL 8.0 vol. %HCl/methanol solution were added in that order. The mixturewas vortexed for 1 min and incubated at room temperaturefor>16 h. After cooling to room temperature, 1.5 mL of hexaneand 1.5 mL of reagent-grade water were added and the mixturevortexed for 1 min. After phase separation, the upper hexanelayer, containing the FAMEs, was removed, dried with anhydrousNa2SO4, passed to a 2 mL vial with Teﬂon (PTFE)-lined screwcap, and stored atC4C until analyses.Chemical characterization of FAs was performed by GC/MSusing an Agilent (Palo Alto, CA, United States) 6890 GC. TheGC was connected to an Agilent 5973 mass selective detectoroperating at 70 eV (source 230C and quadrupole 150C) in theelectron ionization mode with emission current of 1 mA andmultiple-ion detection over m/z 10–450. Helium was used ascarrier gas (1.4 mL/min ﬂow rate). For the analyses of FAMEfractions, the system was equipped with an Agilent free FAphase fused silica capillary column (50 m length, 0.20 mm i.d.)coated with nitroterephthalic acid modiﬁed polyethylene glycolstationary phase (ﬁlm thickness 0.33 mm). A sample aliquot wasinjected split-less at a temperature of 200C. Helium was used ascarrier gas (1 mL/min ﬂow rate). After an initial period of 2 min at100C, the column was heated to 240C at 5C/min followed byan isothermal period of 30 min. Compound assignment was basedon comparison with standard mass spectra in the NIST14 MassSpectral Library (National Institute of Standards and Technology,Gaithersburg, MD, United States), GC retention time, and MSfragmentation patterns. The FAs are abbreviated as x:y, where “x”is the number of carbons and “y” the number of double bonds.Concentrations of the FAs were determined by GC/FID usingan Agilent Technologies (2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington,DE, United States) 7890B GC system equipped with a 7693Aautomated injection system and a ﬂame ionization detector. Thecolumn and chromatographic conditions were the same used forGC/MS. Quantitative data were expressed in mg FA determinedfrom the peak area ratios of unknown and internal standardsof known concentrations. Quantiﬁcation of phospholipids inthe microbial cells were assessed with the total peak areas of thebiomarker FAs cy17:0 for bacteria (Guckert et al., 1985) and 18:2w6for fungi (Olsson, 1999; Zelles, 1999). These two biomarkers wereselected based on a full comparison of the FAs proﬁle of monoand co-cultures in diﬀerent media ( Supplementary Figure S1 ).The relative change of biomass was calculated according to the FAdetermination in mg/culture for each co-culture in comparisonto the corresponding monoculture. To control for outliers, aGrubb’s Test was performed. After removing outliers, a studentt-test with two-tail hypothesis was used with a signiﬁcance atp<0.05 to compare the change in relative biomass betweenmono and co-cultures.Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 6Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi InteractionsRESULTSProteolytic Activity by Morchellacrassipes and Associated BacteriaSoil fungi are known to produce a large range of extracellularenzymes to access N from organic compounds (Leake and Read,1990; Chalot and Brun, 1998; Read and Perez-Moreno, 2003;Nygren et al., 2007). However, the eﬀect of FH on the hydrolysisof N orgcompounds has not been evaluated so far. Proteolyticactivity in a species of the genus Morchella (M. crassipes )was measured on skimmed milk (C/N molar ratio = 4.47)and malt (C/N = 55.84) medium (malt/casein medium) withmilk proteins as N orgsource and malt as an additional C orgsource ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables S2, S3 ). Thefungus and the two P. putida strains (wild-type and non-motilemutant) were tested individually as well as in co-cultures. Whentested as a monoculture, only the fungus showed proteolyticactivity ( Figures 1A,A2 ) but not the two bacterial strains(Figures 1B,B2 ). This conﬁrmed the prediction made fromthe genomic information. In the fungal-bacterial co-cultures,proteolytic activity was higher than in the fungal monoculture(Figures 1C,C2 ). However, the results were only statisticallysigniﬁcant for the co-culture with the motile P. putida strain,given the large variability in the results obtained with thenon-motile strain ( Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S2 ).Thus, while proteolytic activity in malt/casein medium warrantsthe presence of fungal proteases, bacteria presence somehowenhanced the activity of these proteases.The increase in fungal proteolytic activity might be either theresult of fungal production of additional proteolytic enzymes inresponse to competition with bacteria for the uptake of Norgfrom hydrolysed compounds or due to bacteria enhancing theeﬃciency of the secreted fungal enzymes. We therefore testedthe eﬀect of bacteria on proteolytic activity of extracted fungalexudates, thus avoiding the production of additional proteasesas an active response by M. crassipes to competition. We foundthat both P. putida strains were still able to enhance the activityof fungal proteases from puriﬁed fungal exudates obtained fromcultures in diﬀerent media and conditions ( SupplementaryFigure S3 ). This was measured by detecting not only thepresence of a halo indicative of the proteolytic activity ofthe fungal enzyme, but also the increase in brightness of theproteolysis spot as compared to the control without bacteria(Figures 2A–D ; upper compartment) or with dead bacterial cells(Figures 2A–C ; left compartment). When the eﬀect of livingbacteria ( Figures 2A–C ; right compartment; Figure 2D ; left andright compartment) versus dead bacteria ( Figures 2A–C ; leftcompartment) was compared ( Figures 2A–D ), the results showedthat dead bacteria have no eﬀect on the proteolytic activity, whileliving P. putida cells (regardless of the presence of the ﬂagellum)are required to signiﬁcantly stimulate the proteolytic activity ofM. crassipes exudates ( Figure 2E ). In conclusion, these resultsshow that living bacteria enhance fungal proteolytic activity, andthis on itself could explain the results without considering theneed for an increase in the production of proteolytic enzymes bythe fungus as the result of competition.Enhanced Proteolysis by Bacteria inOther Morchella SpeciesIn order to test if the results obtained in the case of M. crassipescorrespond to a physiological property extended to other speciesin the same genus, two additional Morchella rufobrunneastrains, as well as diﬀerent bacterial species were also studied(Table 1 ). The positive eﬀect of both P. putida strains onthe proteolytic activity of fungal exudates was also observedfor exudates extracted from the two additional Morchellastrains ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). For these fungal strains,we conﬁrmed a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of living bacteriaon proteolytic activity ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). Diﬀerentbacterial strains, able or not to use FH, were also testedwith M. crassipes . Enhancement of the proteolytic activity ofM. crassipes exudates was observed for all the bacteria dispersingusing FH, which included most Pseudomonas spp. and twoCupriavidus species. Bacteria that do not disperse naturally onfungal mycelium (in opposition to the artiﬁcially non-dispersingﬂagellar mutant), which included P. azelaica HBP1 (isolated froma wastewater treatment plant) and E. coli K12, had no eﬀecton proteolytic activity of M. crassipes exudates ( SupplementaryFigure S6 ). The exact mechanism of enzymatic enhancementis still unknown but appears to be common in bacteria fromdiﬀerent taxonomic clades able to establish FH.Effect of C organd N orgSources on theBiomass of M. crassipes andP . putidaAn increased proteolytic activity does not allow conclusionsabout the actual N uptake and who beneﬁts of the increase infungal proteolytic activity. Most studies on FH have focusedon the beneﬁts for the bacterial partner by quantifying cellsand surface area colonized (Pion et al., 2013b). As it stands,proper ﬁtness measures are very diﬃcult to obtain for fungi,and BFI studies face the additional challenge to separatethe individual eﬀect on the fungal and bacterial partners.Therefore, we selected our best-studied pair ( M. crassipesand the ﬂagellated strain of P. putida ) and measured speciﬁcphospholipid biomarkers, as an indirect proxy to infer theeﬀect of hydrolysis of diﬀerent C organd N orgsources onbiomass production. A change in biomass can be measuredindirectly by the quantitative analysis of speciﬁc phospholipidsextracted from mono and co-cultures (Olsson, 1999; Zelles,1999). An inferred increase in the biomass of both partners inco-cultures relative to monocultures would provide evidencefor increased C organd N orgturnover as a result of enhancementof fungal proteases by dispersing bacteria. A unilateral inferredincrease in biomass (or no increase) would provide evidencefor competition between the two microbial partners. We founddiﬀerent responses in inferred relative biomass changes betweendiﬀerent media. In a medium containing malt only, inferredbacterial biomass signiﬁcantly decreased ( p<0.00001) inthe co-culture ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S1 ).In contrast inferred fungal biomass was higher in the co-culture as compared to the monoculture, but the statisticalsigniﬁcance of the results could not be assessed ( Figure 3A ).Nonetheless, these results agree with a previous study thatFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 7Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi InteractionsFIGURE 1 | Extracellular proteolytic activity of Morchella crassipes in skimmed milk medium supplemented with malt as an additional carbon source. Theexperimental setup consisted of the inoculation of the fungus alone in the center of the Petri dish (left image, upper panel), the bacterial monoculture in form of asemi-circle (left image, center) or the two organisms together (co-cultures) with a bacterial inoculum at a ﬁxed distance from the fungal inoculum (left image, lowerpanel). In this medium, proteolysis can be observed directly by the formation of a clearing halo around the growing mycelium after 2 (A–D) and 3 (A2–D2) dayspost-inoculation (DPI). Experiments were performed in mono-cultures of the fungus (A,A2) and bacterium (B,B2) or in co-cultures of the fungus with a motile strainofPseudomonas putida KT2440 (C,C2) or its non-motile isogenic mutant ( D,D2 ;P . putida 1ﬂiM). The experiment was performed in six replicates. After 2 DPI, nocontact between the fungus and the bacterial inoculum was observed and accordingly, proteolysis was only observed around the fungal inoculum. The area ofproteolysis was measured and compared for the different experimental conditions at 3 DPI, after contact with the bacterial inoculum. The difference in the proteolyticactivity between the mono and co-culture with the two strains of P . putida KT2440 is statistically signiﬁcant for the motile strain ( E;p-value = 0.002769,t-value = –3.9414, two-tailed). A representative scale bar for the fungal mono and co-culture corresponding to 15 mm is shown in the ﬁrst image.has documented the use of bacterial biomass as a nutrientsource (bacterial farming) by M. crassipes in this medium(Pion et al., 2013b). Accordingly, our results suggest thatthe fungus beneﬁts in terms of biomass production in theharvesting phase of farming by using P. putida cells as anadditional nutritional source. In a medium with casein butwithout malt as an additional C orgsource, inferred bacterialbiomass was signiﬁcantly higher ( p-value = 0.0004) in theco-culture while fungal biomass decreased as compared tothe monoculture but this was not statistically signiﬁcantFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 8Lohberger et al.

Proteolytic activity was measured in skimmed milk medium supplemented withmalt (malt/casein). Schemes of experimental set up are shown in (A). The three treatments investigated consisted of a control without bacteria, a dead bacterialculture of P . putida (motile or non-motile; 1ﬂiM) and corresponding living bacterial cultures.

In the graph only the p-values for the pair-wise comparisons between negative control (no bacteria) versus P . putidaalive and no bacteria versus P . putida 1ﬂiMalive are indicated ( p<0.00001).

In contrast, in malt/casein medium, bothinferred fungal and bacterial biomass was higher in the co-cultures as compared to the monocultures, but in both casesthe diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant ( Figure 3C ).Interestingly, bacterial farming was never triggered in either ofthe media supplemented with skimmed milk ( SupplementaryFigures S7, S8 ), indicating that a reduced content in N orgis likely a key factor triggering bacterial farming in the caseofM. crassipes .In order to test the eﬀect of the N org source on theinteraction, in addition to skimmed milk we investigatedurea as a second relevant N orgsource, as urea is commonlyfound in soils. Moreover, urea (C/N = 0.5, SupplementaryTable S3 ) is a N orgcompound readily used as N fertilizer.In contrast to casein, for which only the fungus possessesproteolytic activity, both the bacterium and the fungusproduced ureases to degrade this N orgsource. However, inthe case of the bacterium, ureases could only be producedin medium supplemented with malt as an additional C orgsource ( Figure 4 ). In medium containing both, urea andmalt, inferred bacterial biomass remained unchanged, andfungal inferred biomass decreased, but this was not statisticallysigniﬁcant ( Figure 4A ). In this condition, no FH wereestablished as the fungus avoided contact with the bacterialFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 9Lohberger et al.

In addition, theenhancement of Morchella spp. proteolytic activity is unlikely theconsequence of direct fungal competition with bacteria, as theeﬀect was maintained for puriﬁed fungal exudates.The exact mechanism by which bacteria enhance proteolyticactivity remains unknown. However, given the nature of theenzymes involved (proteases), some hypothesis can be proposed.Extracellular digestion of protein substrates is required forsurvival and growth of all fungi (Yike, 2011). Casein-degradingproteases have been characterized in a variety of fungal species.These enzymes appear to belong to several classes of peptidases(da Silva, 2017), and to be widespread across diﬀerent species(de Souza et al., 2015). Their optimal reaction conditions varygreatly in terms of pH (from acid to alkaline) and temperature(for example, from 28C in the case of Humicola lutea to 70CforThermomyces lanuginosus ) (de Souza et al., 2015). Potentialmechanisms that could explain the activity observed are themodiﬁcation of the local pH by bacterial growth (Scanlon et al.,2018), the eﬀect of bacteria on the availability of an enzymaticco-factor (e.g., metals; (Riordan, 1977)), or the secretion of aspeciﬁc co-factor by bacteria. Nevertheless, for advancing inthe mechanistic understanding of the process, the puriﬁcationand characterization of the enzyme(s) involved is required. Thiscould not be achieved here. Fungal proteases are very importanthydrolytic enzymes that had attracted considerable attentiongiven their biotechnological use (de Souza et al., 2015) and theirrole in pathogenesis (Yike, 2011; Han et al., 2017). UnderstandingFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 March 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 124fmicb-10-00124 February 27, 2019 Time: 17:30 # 11Lohberger et al. Carbon and Nitrogen in Bacteria–Fungi Interactionshow BFI modulate the activity of this type of enzymes couldtherefore improve our understanding of these processes.The results also show that diﬀerent N orgsources, the presenceof an additional C orgsource, as well as the simultaneous presenceof enzymes in the interacting couple, result in a variable outcomeof the interaction in terms of the potential beneﬁt in growthfor each partner. This variable eﬀect on hydrolysis of N org-containing compounds during bacterial dispersal on the growthof either (or both) the fungal and/or the bacterial partneroﬀers a new perspective on FH, besides the purely mechanicalaspect of bacterial dispersal on a fungal support. An exchangein nutrients has been postulated as explaining the interactionof fungi and bacteria living inside fungal hyphae (Frey-Klettet al., 2011; Ghignone et al., 2012). Likewise, similar processesof nutritional complementation and interference appear to playa role in the association of fungi with extracellular bacteriausing FH. Given the fact that FH appear to be widespread andinvolve a large diversity of bacterial and fungal clades (Kohlmeieret al., 2005; Wick et al., 2007; Banitz et al., 2011; Warminket al., 2011; Simon et al., 2015, 2017), future studies shouldinvestigate additional interacting species (e.g., a range of fungiand bacteria with diﬀerent ecologies) and metabolic processespotentially modiﬁed by BFIs.Fungal highways and the cross-chemical reactions establishedbetween Morchella spp. and bacteria associated in this dispersalmechanism can be instrumental to a better understanding of soilnutrient cycling. Such exchanges between fungi and bacteria maybe essential in C and N cycling in soils and other ecosystemsin which this interaction is expected to be one of the occurringBFI. Moreover, the enhanced access to C organd N orgassociatedto FH can have an impact at higher trophic levels. For instance,N availability plays a key role in CO 2uptake by plants (Terreret al., 2016). In the case of ectomycorrhizal fungi, the abilityto access N orgthrough secreted proteases has been related totheir ecological niche diﬀerentiation as part of the natural forestsuccession (Rineau et al., 2016). For example, in temperate andboreal forest, N is the element limiting tree nutrition (Rees et al.,2001). This fosters symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi (Chalot andBrun, 1998) and shoot-endophytic bacteria (Carrell and Frank,2014). Under these conditions, a bypass of nutrient acquisitiondirectly from organic sources might be an advantage for plantsassociated to fungi. Indeed, plants associated with mycorrhizalfungi (largely providing N from organic sources) showed up to30% biomass increase in response to elevated CO 2(Talbot andTreseder, 2010; Whiteside et al., 2012; Terrer et al., 2016; Norbyet al., 2017). Our ﬁndings suggest that, through the exploitationof N org, not only mycorrhizal fungi, but also bacteria dispersingon their mycelial network, could play an important role insupporting plant CO 2uptake (Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007; Zhuet al., 2016). The interaction of fungi and bacteria could helpplants associated to mycorrhizal fungi to better access N fromcomplex organic sources such as proteins, and thus improveatmospheric CO 2ﬁxation in plant biomass. Recently, it has beenshown that C supply of the host plant can trigger the uptakeand transport of N in the symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi (Fellbaum et al., 2012). Similarly, ectomycorrhizal fungi canenhance the mobilization of N orgfrom decomposed soil organicmatter as a result of C supply from the plant, especially in borealforest ecosystems (Lindahl and Tunlid, 2015). Enhanced growthof plants could lead to a positive feedback by providing moreC to the soil as litter (either below- or above ground), which isin turn needed for the synergistic enhancement of proteolyticactivity observed here in FH interactions. Therefore, a plant inassociation with a fungus having enhanced access to complexNorgdue to dispersing bacteria could also beneﬁt throughout thisBFI. In addition, another potential implication of the interactionobserved in this study is the negative impact of some agriculturalpractices that alter the soil fungal and bacterial network [forexample, tillage (Beare et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2016; Sharma-Poudyal et al., 2017)] on the eﬃciency of the recycling of C organd N orgin soils.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAL conducted the experiments.
