However, poor understanding of themechanisms responsible hinders the development of effective land management strategies toenhance soil carbon storage. Here we empirically test the link between microbial ecophy-siological traits and topsoil carbon content across geographically distributed soils and landuse contrasts. We discovered distinct pH controls on microbial mechanisms of carbonaccumulation. Land use intensi ﬁcation in low-pH soils that increased the pH above athreshold (~6.2) leads to carbon loss through increased decomposition, following alleviationof acid retardation of microbial growth. However, loss of carbon with intensi ﬁcation in near-neutral pH soils was linked to decreased microbial biomass and reduced growth ef ﬁciencythat was, in turn, related to trade-offs with stress alleviation and resource acquisition. Thus,less-intensive management practices in near-neutral pH soils have more potential for carbonstorage through increased microbial growth ef ﬁciency, whereas in acidic soils, microbialgrowth is a bigger constraint on decomposition rates.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05980-1 OPEN1Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford OX10 8BB, UK.2Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK.3Departmentof Molecular Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Leipzig 04318, Germany.4Department of Biogeochemical Processes, MaxPlanck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena 07745, Germany.5Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster LA1 4AP, UK.6Imperial College London, AscotSL5 7PY, UK.7Department of Sustainable Agriculture Sciences, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, UK.8Present address: Department of Ecologyand Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine 92697, USA.9Present address: School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Reading RG66UR, UK.

Landmanagement strategies to reverse this decline are needed, but wedo not suf ﬁciently understand the detailed mechanisms under-lying the accumulation and loss of SOC. This is hampering thedevelopment of better land management strategies and introducesuncertainties into models that forecast feedbacks to climaticchange. Furthermore, soil is the largest carbon (C) pool in theterrestrial biosphere containing twice as much C as in theatmosphere, with the topsoil (0 –30 cm) containing approximatelyhalf the amount3–5. By regulating the storage and release oforganic C through decomposition of soil and plant organicmatter, soil microorganisms play a major role in soil C ﬂuxes4,6.New research suggests that better knowledge of thismicrobial regulation may be critical in projecting changes in SOC,thereby improving predictions of climate change feedbacks7,8.A new paradigm also recognizes the direct, signi ﬁcant contribu-tion of microbial biomass to organic matter accumulation,whereby microbial residues are transformed into stable SOCfractions4,9–11. However, uncertainties remain over the in ﬂuenceof microbial physiology on its biomass production and eventualpersistence in soil. This highlights the need to explore both theecological and biochemical basis for SOC storage with a focus onthe microbial traits —their phenotypic characteristics12,13.Shifts in microbial traits due to climate change have beenshown to have consequences for SOC storage14,15. Microbialcarbon use ef ﬁciency (CUE) or growth ef ﬁciency, the proportionof substrate C that microorganisms assimilate versus that lost inrespiration, is a key trait that determines the fate of C insoils14,16,17. Recent theory suggests that high microbial growthefﬁciency may indicate increased ability of those communities tostore SOC through relatively greater biomass synthesis andresultant increases in the amount of microbial residues availablefor stabilization11,14,15,18,19. An increased microbial investment inresource acquisition in the form of extracellular enzyme pro-duction to degrade complex substrates is thought to result inlower growth ef ﬁciency20. Similarly, physiological adaptations toalleviate stresses such as soil acidity or decreased water availabilitycould lead to increased maintenance energy requirements, thuslowering the growth ef ﬁciency21. Yet, microbial trait trade-offsbetween the use and acquisition of complex resources, adaptationto stress and biomass production have hitherto been unexplored.We argue that these trade-offs are signi ﬁcant in determining thefate of C inputs in soils.The collective traits of diverse microbial populations regulatethe ecosystem functioning through their interactions with eachother and the environment12. We now have evidence that gra-dients of soil properties such as soil pH are strong drivers of soilmicrobial diversity22,23. Therefore, we posit that along similargradients, there are differences in microbial ecophysiologicaltraits that may affect CUE at a community level. Knowledge ofsuch empirical trends could be the key to better understand theeffects of land management on SOC storage. Identifying con-sistent effects of land management on soil microbial ecophy-siology is dif ﬁcult as land use intensi ﬁcation and their impacts onedaphic properties like soil pH, bulk density and moisture contentare often site-speci ﬁc and context-dependent15,24. Trait estimatesfrom literature syntheses provide the theoretical and empiricalbasis of the CUE variability across soils and suggest that microbialefﬁciency is an integrative measure of stoichiometric constraints,substrate quality and quantity, soil biodiversity, and edaphicproperties25–27. However, we still cannot con ﬁdently establishempirical relationships between the microbial CUE and envir-onmental variables. This makes it dif ﬁcult to predict thespatiotemporal patterns of CUE that are key to upscaling themicrobial ecophysiological responses to anthropogenic change28.The overall aim of this study was to assess the effect of land useintensity on microbial ecophysiological traits across landscapesoil gradients and evaluate the consequences of trait trade-offs onSOC accumulation. To achieve this, we analyzed the microbialtraits in soils collected from 56 distributed sites across the UK(Fig. 1) in temperate habitats ranging in land use from low-intensity species-rich grasslands to high-intensity grasslands andcroplands. We used regression and path analyses to discernpotential microbial ecophysiological controls on SOC accumula-tion and associated environmental drivers. Using stable carbonisotope tracing and soil metaproteomics, we demonstrate twodistinct mechanisms of SOC accumulation at low and high soilpH. The mechanisms highlight the signi ﬁcance of microbialgrowth and metabolic ef ﬁciency on SOC accumulation. Thiscollective knowledge enables the changes in soil pH, induced byland use intensi ﬁcation, to be used as a proxy to determine theeffect of land management strategies on microbial soil carboncycling processes.ResultsEmpirical links between microbial physiology and soil carbon .Weﬁrst tested the broader relationships between microbial eco-physiology and soil properties, using C concentration as a proxyfor SOC accumulation, to understand how microbial processesdetermine the mineralization, assimilation, and accumulation oforganic matter inputs which underpin SOC formation and loss.For soils sampled from a landscape-scale gradient of 56 spatiallydispersed sites across Britain (three replicates per site), weobserved clear relationships between certain microbial4.55.05.56.06.57.07.58.0pHFig. 1 Geographical distribution of sampling sites.

However, substrate CUE at acommunity level, measured as the proportion of13C-labeled plantlitter DOC incorporated into microbial DNA relative to that lostas respired CO 2, appeared to be driven by interactions of multipleedaphic properties and could not be assembled in a single linearmodel. We then used recursive partitioning through regressiontree analysis to disentangle the interactions; the best partitioningparameter was soil pH from among the edaphic properties thatwere tested, which also included soil moisture, clay content, Cand N concentration, and C:N ratio (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thethreshold was determined at pH 6.2 using slope failure test(piecewise regression) for CUE versus SOC linear regression(Supplementary Fig. 2)29. In other words, community CUEmeasured here was distinctly different across the pH threshold of6.2; above this value community CUE and SOC concentration co-varied, indicating the interdependence of microbial growth ef ﬁ-ciency and SOC accumulation (Fig. 2a). The CUE –SOC rela-tionship broke down below the threshold pH, where microbialgrowth constraints imposed by acidity and wetness could be moreimportant in organic matter accumulation. In such acidic soils,microbial turnover or growth rate (amount of new DNA formedper unit time) was very low (Fig. 2b), but the respiratory responsedid not differ across the entire range of soil pH (Fig. 2c); both inline with previous studies30–32. It is plausible that in lower pHsoils, there is a shift from growth to maintenance respiration as atrade-off to increased investment into physiological strategies tosurvive in a stressful acidic environment that can often also be0.40.3pH <6.2 pH >6.2R2 = 0.004p = 0.66R2 = 0.32p < 0.0001R2 = 0.3p < 0.0001R2 = 0.05p = 0.006R2 = 0.64p < 0.0001R2 = 0.34p < 0.0001 R2 = 0.34p < 0.0001R2 = 0.19p = 0.002Community CUE qCO2 ( μgC μgBiomassC–1 h–1)Biomass ( μgC g–1)Bacterial richnessTurnover rate (y–1)Acetase activity (nmol m–1 g–1)0.20.100.30.20.1010684021006080400201600100013007004000 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 200 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 200 5 10 15 20 05 1 0Soil C (%) Soil C (%)15 201.20.90.60.30abcdf eFig. 2 Relationship between microbial parameters and soil carbon.

We also notethat in such soils, decreased turnover rate was associated withincreased SOC concentration (Fig. 2b). Decreased microbialgrowth slows down the decomposition, leading to accumulationof plant and microbial organic matter. Evidence for highermicrobial biomass accumulation in the acidic soils comes fromthe observation that the total microbial DNA pool in these soilswas large relative to the amount of newly formed DNA. Theseresults highlight the importance of considering both growth rate(the number of progeny produced per unit time) and ef ﬁciency(the number of progeny produced per unit of resource consumed)in examining microbial degradation and accumulation of organicmatter35.Across all soils, speci ﬁc respiration (qCO2) increased withdecreasing SOC concentration (Fig. 2c), corroborating evidencefrom isotope tracer measurements of the interdependence ofmicrobial growth ef ﬁciency and SOC accumulation. Microbialbiomass measured as total soil DNA-C concentration36,37washigher in soils with higher SOC (Fig. 2d), highlighting positiverelationship between microbial biomass and SOC10,11,18. We notethat using DNA-C concentration as biomass proxy could lead toan underestimation of total microbial biomass and the absolutevalue of microbial CUE compared with approaches that employother biomarkers. Despite a positive correlation between thepotential activity of acetyl esterase38and SOC, a negativerelationship was observed with enzyme production per unitbiomass (Fig. 2e). Thus, at higher soil pH increasing CUE isassociated with decreasing extracellular enzyme investment insubstrate acquisition (Fig. 2a, e). This validates the physiologicaltrade-offs theory suggesting that an increase in microbial enzymeinvestment in soils with depleted organic resources leads toreduced growth ef ﬁciency20,25. These relationships across soilsvarying in physico-chemical conditions and land use intensityprovide a multitude of empirical evidence directly linkingmicrobial ecophysiology to soil ’s C storage potential. We alsoobserved signi ﬁcant relationships of taxonomic indicators likebacterial alpha diversity with SOC concentration (Fig. 2f);however, these were weaker than SOC correlations with keyecophysiological traits. This indicates that community-levelphysiological traits could be more strongly coupled toSOC accumulation than the assessed taxonomic diversityindices; this was further tested using structural equation modeling(SEM).Distinct SOC accumulation mechanisms across a pH threshold .Empirical trends from recursive partitioning and generalizedlinear models suggest two distinct mechanisms of SOC accu-mulation across a soil pH threshold of ~6.2 for the sites assessedhere: at sites above the threshold pH, greater microbial growthefﬁciency leads to increased microbial biomass that causes greaterSOC accumulation;11,18,25and at sites below the threshold pH,acidity and wetness (Supplementary Fig. 3) leads to slowermicrobial growth rates (Fig. 2b) that limits decomposition ofextant organic matter39. We sought to validate these mechanismsusing path analysis of SEM40. Using a con ﬁrmatory approach, weaimed to test direct and indirect effects of microbial diversity andecophysiology on SOC accumulation with the abovementioneddistinct causal relationships. A latent biodiversity variable wasderived as a common factor from independently assayed bacterialand fungal alpha diversity. Diversity here was simply used as aunivariate predictor to represent these large multivariate mole-cular datasets. We analyzed a path structure based on a propo-sition that taxonomic diversity drives the trait response,12,41withhigher metabolic ef ﬁciency causing greater microbial biomass andconsequently leading to higher soil carbon accumulation. Thismodel was valid only across higher pH soils (Fig. 3). At pH belowthe threshold value of 6.2, this model structure did not adequatelyreﬂect our dataset, disproving the potential chain of causality(Fig. 3) and indicating decoupling of relationships between CUE,microbial biomass, and carbon accumulation. The doctrine thatgrowth ef ﬁciency and high biomass are associated with SOCaccumulation is therefore not true in acidic soils. Here, microbialgrowth or turnover is a bigger constraint on decompositionresulting in higher organic matter accumulation, although com-munities exhibited low growth ef ﬁciency.Microbial physiological response to land use intensi ﬁcation .The soils investigated here come from a range of land use types,from permanent grasslands with a long-term history of minimalagricultural improvement (low intensity) to intensively managedgrasslands or arable croplands (high intensity). To test the effectof land use intensi ﬁcation on the ecophysiology of the soilmicrobial community, we used 21 locally paired low- and high-intensity land use contrasts from within this survey (Table 1,Supplementary Table 1).

Instead, weassessed the impact of land use intensi ﬁcation on edaphic prop-erties and used the observed changes in soil physico-chemicalparameters to evaluate the microbial ecophysiological response.Land use intensi ﬁcation from more pristine grasslands to inten-sive agricultural systems generally tends to increase the soil pHand typically leads to decreased soil carbon concentration,reduced water retention and poorer soil structure1,17.W eobserved similar results (Fig. 4a–c). There were no coherentglobal effects of land use intensi ﬁcation on microbial ecophy-siology, and the direction of change was not uniform across landuse contrasts. Finer assessment pointed to characteristic trendsthat were linked to distinct mechanisms of microbial C cyclingacross the soil pH threshold described above. The effect of landuse intensi ﬁcation depended on the quantity and direction ofchange in soil pH. We thus identi ﬁed the following three cate-gories of effects resulting from the various impacts of land useintensi ﬁcation on soil edaphic properties.Type 1 effect of land use intensi ﬁcation: Plant productivity ishighest in soils at the higher end of the pH spectrum, makingsuch soils more favorable for agriculture; evidence suggests thatthe land cover area under intensive management tends to increasewith an increase in mean soil pH1. In the high pH (>6.2) sitesunder investigation, intensi ﬁcation lead to a shift towardsalkalinity, microbial community CUE generally decreased andgrowth rate increased (Fig. 4a), suggesting a shift towardscopiotrophic life strategies with a wasteful metabolism. Theresultant decrease in microbial biomass and increase in speci ﬁcrespiration (qCO 2) can be linked to SOC loss in intensive land usesystems.Type 2 effect of land use intensi ﬁcation: Liming acidic soils is awidespread agricultural practice used to improve the suitability ofsuch soils for plant production30,32. In the low pH sites in ourstudy where intensi ﬁcation lead to increased soil pH crossing thethreshold (less intensive sites: pH < 6.2, adjacent more intensivesites: pH > 6.2), microbial CUE and turnover rates were bothhigher in more intensive soil systems, with a decrease in microbialbiomass and increase in speci ﬁc respiration (Fig. 4b). Thissuggests a shift in microbial physiology from the dominance ofmaintenance respiration in less-intensive acidic soils to increasedgrowth and decomposition in higher-intensive pH soils. Wepostulate that SOC loss in such intensive soils is not a re ﬂection ofincreased growth ef ﬁciency of microorganisms, but rather a resultof the depletion in acid retardation of microbial growth indicatedby increased growth rates that lead to increased organic matterdecomposition30.Type 3 effect of land use intensi ﬁcation: This includes low pHsites (pH < 6.2), where the increase in soil pH on intensi ﬁcationdoes not cross the threshold of 6.2. Microbial CUE and turnoverrates in both land use contrasts were systematically lower relativeto the high pH sites, and intensi ﬁcation leads to a small decreasein both parameters (Fig. 4c). This is in line with our hypothesizedSOC accumulation mechanism in low pH soils, where microbialgrowth and decomposition rates were lower (Fig. 2b) due toacidity and higher soil moisture content.Trade-offs in traits have consequences for SOC accumulation .Soil metaproteomics was used to determine the physiologicalbasis of microbial control on soil C transformations. This wasachieved by analyzing functional changes across representativeland use contrasts for each of the three types of land use inten-siﬁcation effects (Table 1).

On the contrary, loweravailability of organic substrates in the intensive systems isreﬂected in lower relative abundance of ABC transporters andhigher abundance of proteins linked to maintenance pathways,such as large and small subunit ribosomal protein synthesis,amino acid synthesis, purine metabolism (DNA-directed RNApolymerase subunits), and energy generating oxidative phos-phorylation proteins like ATPase (Fig. 5b). Thus, the reduction insalvage pathways of resource acquisition, leads to a higherinvestment into non-growth maintenance activities like molecularturnover of proteins/enzymes for resource acquisition, and theenergy generating pathways needed to fuel those activities.Microbial communities in high intensity soils also invest a higherproportion of resources and energy into stress alleviation indi-cated by a signi ﬁcant increase in stress protein indicators likeChaperonin GroEL (level 1 class: genetic information processing,level 3 class: RNA degradation; Fig. 5a, b)17. These molecularchaperones prevent protein aggregation by either refolding ordegrading stress-induced misfolded proteins. The increased cel-lular investment into stress alleviation trades off with reduction inmicrobial growth ef ﬁciency measured as CUE (Fig. 4a). Thus,although soil communities in intensive soil systems at higher soilpH have greater turnover rate, low growth ef ﬁciency means agreater proportion of organic matter inputs are mineralized andlost in maintenance respiration (Fig. 4a). This ecophysiologicalunderstanding of microbial trade-offs further reiterates the sig-niﬁcant microbial control on soil C cycling in high pH soils. Insuch intensive systems, soil management strategies that increasethe microbial growth ef ﬁciency could help maximize organicmatter accumulation and soil carbon storage. We suggest thatcover crops and other restorative conservation approaches thatare aimed at increasing plant carbon input into soils would over aperiod of time promote microbially mediated reiterative soilorganic matter formation and decrease the resource limitationand water stress. Our functional assessments show that this wouldlower the metabolic constraints on microbial growth leading to apositive feedback on microbial growth ef ﬁciency, causing anincreased channeling of substrates into biomass synthesis, thusfostering additional soil organic matter accumulation.The microbial metabolic constraints in stressed environmentssuch as arable croplands are also apparent in the type 2 effect ofland use intensi ﬁcation (which increases the soil pH above thethreshold value of 6.2) but the mechanisms here are distinct.Differences in the frequency and relative abundance of proteinindicators under type 2 scenarios highlights several physiologicaladaptations. A decrease in acidity and moisture levels in theintensive land use system leads to increased microbial turnover(Fig. 4b) that is also re ﬂected in increased investment in a numberof metabolic pathways to fuel the need for energy andbiosynthesis of the active microbial population (Fig. 5a). Theseincluded small and large subunit ribosomal protein synthesis,central metabolic pathways like glycolysis and TCA cycle,oxidative phosphorylation, purine metabolism, and amino acidbiosynthesis (Fig. 5b). There was also an increase in ABCtransporters, particularly the transport system for branched chainamino acids and phosphate in high intensity soils, as a result ofhigher substrate availability through increased degradation ofextant organic matter34,42,43. Different stress proteins belongingto the families Chaperonin GroEL and molecular chaperoneDnaK (level 3 class: RNA degradation) were identi ﬁed asindicators of high and low intensity land use treatments buttheir relative abundances were signi ﬁcantly higher in the moreacidic low intensity soils as an acid tolerance response44.

Keyindicators were stress proteins that were more abundant in high-intensity soils; it is worthwhile to note that these were globalindicators of intensive land use systems across all three land usecontrasts, and have been previously reported in agriculturalsystems17. As highlighted earlier, the microbial controls on soil Ccycling processes were much lower in low pH soils, as evidencedby lower microbial turnover rates. However, soil microorganismscontinued to respire possibly using non-plant C sources likedirect C ﬁxation34, although we did not ﬁnd any evidence fromproteomic analyses about alternative C respiration redoxstrategies. Observations emphasizing that microbial physiologicaltrade-offs are key determinants of the microbial contribution tosoil organic matter formation thus need to be further tested tofully understand the biochemical basis of soil carbon accumula-tion. Nevertheless, we present strong evidence of such trade-offsin microbial traits being important in near-neutral soils, which iswhere the majority of productive agriculture occurs.DiscussionWe established landscape-scale empirical links between keymicrobial ecophysiological traits and soil C concentration sup-porting the central role of microorganisms in belowground car-bon cycling. Results show that an ef ﬁcient microbial physiologywith a greater proportion of substrate allocated to biosynthesismanifests in the increased ability of such communities to store Cin near-neutral pH soils. Trade-offs in microbial physiologicaltraits determine the proportion of microbial organic C investmentinto biosynthesis. Growth and biosynthesis decline in scenarios ofstress and resource limitation when cellular investment is farhigher in traits focussed on stress tolerance and resource acqui-sition. We discern two distinct mechanisms of soil carbon accu-mulation across a pH threshold of 6.2 for these soils: at higher pH(>6.2), an ef ﬁcient substrate metabolism leads to increased SOCaccumulation; and in acidic wet environments (pH < 6.2), abioticfactors limit microbial growth and decomposition causing accu-mulation of SOC. This evidence supports the use of soil pH as anintegrated proxy of land use change, parent material and cli-mate39to determine the site-speci ﬁc effects of land managementstrategies on SOC accumulation.

Intensi-ﬁcation in low pH soils leads to alleviation of acid-related retar-dation of microbial growth and organic matter degradation,leading to large losses of carbon through microbial decomposi-tion. In these systems, preserving equivalent amounts of organicC would involve managing the abiotic C-accumulating factors,like acidity and wetness, whilst enhancing plant production. Wethus highlight the importance of including physiological attri-butes of soil microorganisms in designing restorative land man-agement strategies aimed at mitigating losses of soil C byintensive agricultural practices.MethodsSampling regime . Soil samples were collected from 56 geographically distributedsites that differed in their edaphic properties (Fig. 1). From these sites, 21 localcontrasts of land use intensity with relevant historical knowledge of land man-agement scenarios were chosen to study the effect of land use intensity onmicrobial functionality (Table 1). Research experiments, working farms or farmsunder management by local wildlife trusts were targeted to provide two nearbyﬁelds of differing long-term management intensity. The low-intensity sites weregenerally permanent unimproved grasslands, often with low-density grazing. Thehigh-intensity sites were mostly arable fertilized croplands or intensive grasslands.The subset of 21 local contrasts were selected based on the criteria that the higher-intensity treatment had a signi ﬁcant reduction in organic matter and an increase inpH re ﬂecting nationwide trends of intensi ﬁcation effects (Table 1, SupplementaryTable 1). From each of the identi ﬁed sites at a single time point, three spatiallydispersed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 15 cm deep) were sampled to capture thenatural spatial variability at each site. After all the visible roots were removed,aliquots of the homogenized soil were frozen at −20 °C until the following func-tional analyses.Soil chemistry . Loss on ignition (LOI), C, N, pH, moisture, and clay content wereassessed in replicated soil samples from each site using standard protocols. Soiltotal C concentration strongly correlated with LOI ( R2=0.93), with the onlydeviations being for the calcareous soils with high inorganic C. For soil from thesesites, total C was predicted based on the LOI –C regression model for the non-calcareous sites. Soil pH was measured in deionised water and moisture contentwas determined by the gravimetric method.Microbial respiration . For microbial basal respiration measurements, an aliquot(1 g) of the ﬁeld-moist soil was placed in a 10-mL glass vial and incubated over-night (for ~16 h) in the dark at room temperature (21 °C) without manipulatingthe moisture levels. Respired CO2collected in the headspace was measured using agas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-IRMS, Delta +XL,Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Germany) coupled to a PAL autosampler (CTC Analy-tics) with general purpose (GP) interface (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Germany).Following the basal respiration measurement, vials with soils were opened andincubated in the dark for 8 h before adding 100 µL of13C-labeled DOC solution(0.13 mgC). The ﬁlter-sterilized solution was prepared from13C-labeled powderedplant leaf litter, containing a range of compounds varying in their decomposability.Leaf litter was produced by growing a temperate herb in a13CO 2atmosphere (~1atom%13C at 400 ppm)45. Respiration measurements were repeated following thesame incubation procedure as mentioned above to obtain the proportion of DO13Cin respired CO 2.Microbial biomass, CUE and turnover rate . Soil microbial total DNA-C con-centration was used as a proxy for biomass C; DNA extraction was carried out on asoil aliquot of 0.25 g using PowerSoil-htp 96-well soil DNA isolation kit followingthe manufacturer's instructions (MO BIO Laboratories, UK). Another set ofidentical DNA extraction was performed following addition of 25 µL of DO13Csolution and overnight (16 h) incubation in the dark at ﬁeld moisture capacity.Both extracts were analyzed in the size-exclusion chromatographic (SEC) mode ona liquid chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometer LC-IRMS (HPLC systemcoupled to a Delta +XP IRMS through an LC IsoLink interface; Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc, Germany)46. This allowed us to obtain the DNA-C content and theproportion of DO13C in microbial DNA from soils with and without substrateaddition. Microbial CUE was estimated as DNA-13C/(DNA-13C+∑CO 2-13C),where ∑CO 2-13C is the cumulative DO13C lost during respiration. Microbialturnover rate (synonymously referred to as growth rate) was calculated as DNA-13C/DNA-C.Taxonomic diversity . An aliquot of the DNA was used to perform 16 s rRNAgene- and ITS region-tagged amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platformto estimate the bacterial and fungal taxonomic diversity, respectively, usingpreviously reported dual index methods47,48. Raw sequences from ampliconsequencing were quality ﬁltered, merged and clustered to generate OTU ’s at 97%sequence similarity. Richness was calculated on rari ﬁed data (2000 reads) using theR vegan library.Extracellular enzyme assay . The potential activity of the enzyme acetyl esterasewas estimated with the common assay protocol using ﬂuorigenic substrates. Theenzyme acetylxylan esterase is the most relevant acetyl esterase in soil; it belongs tothe family of hydrolases that catalyzes the deacetylation of xylans (the mainhemicelluloses in hardwoods and annual plants) and was chosen as it is involved inthe initial stages of depolymerization of complex plant substrates38. Brie ﬂy, the soilwashes were obtained using 1.5 g of homogenized soil shaken in 20 ml of deionizedwater49. The resultant slurry was used to perform esterase activity assay using 4-Methylumbelliferyl acetate esterase substrate. The reaction was performed for 3 h at28 °C, with one ﬂuorometric measure every 30 min (BioSpa 8 Automated Incu-bator). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Cytation 5 spectrophotometerlinked to the automated incubator.Metaproteomics . For proteomic analysis of microbial communities, three repli-cated samples were used from both high- and low-intensity land use, consisting ofsix sites, each contrast representing one of the three types of hypothesized land useintensi ﬁcation effects (Table 1). A total of 5 g of soil was used for protein extraction(with two technical replicates) using the SDS buffer –phenol extraction method45.The protein extract was puri ﬁed using 1D SDS-PAGE and the resultant productwas subjected to tryptic digestion. Proteolytically cleaved peptides were separatedprior to mass spectrometric analyses by reverse-phase nano HPLC on a nano-HPLC system (Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano system, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, SanJose, CA, USA) coupled online for analysis with a Q Exactive HF mass spectro-meter (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a nano elec-trospray ion source (Advion Triversa Nanomate, Ithaca, NY, USA). Raw data fromthe MS instrument were searched using Proteome Discoverer v1.4.1.14 (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc) against a FASTA-formatted database (protein coding sequences ofbacteria, fungi and archaea, Uniprot 05/2016) using the SEQUEST HT algorithm.Database searches were performed with carbamidomethylation on cysteine as aﬁxed modi ﬁcation and oxidation on methionine as a variable modi ﬁcation. Enzymespeciﬁcity was selected to trypsin with up to two missed cleavages allowed using 10ppm peptide ion and 0.02 Da MS/MS tolerances. Only peptides with a false dis-covery rate (FDR) < 1% estimated by Percolator50and only rank 1 peptides wereaccepted as identi ﬁed. Unipept v3.251was applied to assign proteins to theirphylogenetic origin. GhostKoala52and KEGG classi ﬁer were used for functionalannotation.Regression analyses . Statistical analyses were performed under the R environ-ment software 2.14.053. Regression tree analysis for recursive partitioning ofmicrobial CUE data by edaphic properties that included soil pH, moisture, total Cand N concentration, C:N ratio and clay content was performed on the entiredataset (56 sites) using the rpart package. Here, all three replicates from each sitewere treated independently to account for spatial non-independence. Slope failuretest or piecewise regression for the CUE –soil C linear regression was performed byrecurrent movement of the soil pH window over a range of 1.4 units, withincrements of 0.1 units. The threshold pH value was determined as the last pH unitbefore the R2of the CUE –soil C regression dropped dramatically (SupplementaryFig. 2). Following threshold pH determination, the data were segregated into low(<6.2, n=50) and high (>6.2, n=113), and generalized linear models of variousphysiological traits and soil C were run for both datasets separately.Structural equation modeling . This was applied to test direct and indirect effectsof microbial diversity and ecophysiology on soil carbon accumulation by orga-nizing the dataset into a path relation network. Using a con ﬁrmatory approach, weaimed to test the maximum likelihood of data ﬁt to the hypothesized path modelinferring microbial taxonomy and function in ﬂuences soil C accumulation.Microbial functional traits that were included as predictor variables were CUE andbiomass, and a latent variable for microbial taxonomy was generated using bac-terial and fungal alpha diversity. The ﬁt of the path model and structural rela-tionships with data were veri ﬁed using SEM analysis conducted with the lavan Rpackage54. The most parsimonious model was identi ﬁed by non-signi ﬁcant X2 tests(P≥0.05), low Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), low Root Mean Square Errorof Approximation index (RMSEA ≤0.1), low Standardized Root Mean SquareResidual index (SRMR ≤0.1) and high Comparative Fit Index (CFI ≥0.90).Analysis of treatment effect size . To assess the effect of land use intensi ﬁcation,we determined the quantity and direction of change in the measured microbialtraits across the 21 chosen land use contrasts (42 sites with three replicates at eachsite). Fold change on intensi ﬁcation was calculated for each contrast as the ratio ofmean trait values from low- and high-intensity treatments. Following the failure toelucidate any global patterns, we segregated the data based on our mechanisticunderstanding of soil C cycling into categories of contrasts that fall above andbelow the hypothesized threshold soil pH and into a third category of contrastsARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05980-18 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |  (2018) 9:3591 | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05980-1 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationswhere land use intensi ﬁcation leads to soil pH shift from below to above thethreshold value (Table 1, Fig. 4a–c).Protein indicator analysis . Pairwise Indicator Species Analysis was used toidentify the protein functions (from soil metaproteomics) that were signi ﬁcantlyassociated with low- and high-intensity land use treatment for each contrast55. Thiswas implemented within the R library labdsv ( http://ecology.msu.montana.edu/labdsv/R ). The IndVal score for each protein is the product of the relative fre-quency and relative average abundance within each land use treatment, and sig-niﬁcance was calculated through random reassignment of groups (1000permutations).Data availabilityThe authors declare that the data supporting the ﬁndings of this study are availablewithin the article and its Supplementary Information ﬁle, and from the correspondingauthor on request.
