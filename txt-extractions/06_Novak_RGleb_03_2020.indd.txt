GlinaAbstractAbandoned vineyard soils show quick recharge of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after cancel-lation of cultivation. In the study abandoned vineyards with six different age classes concerning the duration of postagricultural development, organized along two lines in different exposures on slope (one S and one SW exposed chronosequence) were selected. Involving an additional recently cultivated vineyard location, totally 13 sites were sampled for topsoil characteristics. In each bulk soil sample density fractions, hot water extraction, and microbial samples were sepa-rated. Accordingly the C and N content and C/N ratio of free particulate organic matter (FPOM), occluded particulate organic matter (OPOM), clay-, silt- and sand sized microaggregates, hot wa-ter soluble organic matter, and microbial biomass were measured and discussed in the study. We found that labile, active carbon pool (FPOM) have relatively low share of the TOC (in average 11.6% in S and 4.6% in SW sequence) and showed no increase with the time since the cancellation of cultivation. Also this pool has generally higher C/N ratio (20.6±3.7), as more stable pools (OPOM: 19.2±9.6; clay fraction: 9.2±1.2,). Highest part of TOC is stored in clay-sized microaggregates (in average 37.2% in S and 41.5% SW sequence) and its amount correlates signi ﬁ cantly with the time since the cancellation of cultivation. By comparison, in recently cultivated soil lower share of C in clay sized microaggregates and (24.0% of TOC) and higher share of labile, FPOM (26.6% of TOC) was found. C-pools in microbial and hot water extractable C forms showed signi ﬁ cant changes with the time. Based on exposure and cultivation also proved different, anyway, their contribu-tion to TOC are low.KeywordsPostagricultural soilsChronosequenceOrganic carbon fractionsFree particulate organic matterOccluded particulate organic matter1. IntroductionSoil organic matter (SOM) could be divided on different fractions according to that, how far it is physically protected against further oxidation and mineralization processes, and how sensitive it responds to changes of land use. Density frac-tionation of SOM allows differentiation of light, and heavy fractions. In light fractions free particulate organic matter (FPOM), and occluded particulate organic matter (OPOM) could be distinguished according to that, if the SOM is occlud-ed and therefore slightly protected within aggregates, or not. In case of heavy fractions SOM is so inseparably connected to the mineral particles, and therefore it is usually regarded to be a passive pool within SOM. Heavy fraction can be further separated according the particle size distribution, belong-ing into sand (2–0.063 mm), silt (0.063–0.002 mm) and clay (< 0.002 mm) size. Occlusion of SOM into stabile soil aggre-gates and following stronger connection to mineral particles is regarded as the most important stabilization process of the SOM (Dilly and Blume, 1998). In consequence of vineyard abandonment and subsequent self-restoration significant C-sequestration in soils consider-ing the total organic carbon (TOC) content (Novák et al., 2014; Spohn et al., 2015) can be observed. Nevertheless, it is unknown which kind of C pools were affected. Many studies show that the conversion of arable land to abandoned soils, or conversion of conventional tillage to no tillage management caused predomi-nantly an increase of the FPOM (Coneiç ăo et al., 2013), which belongs to the active C pool, and considered as most sensitive indicator for land use changes. For the dynamic of different SOM pools during self-restora-tion of vineyard soils no data are available so far. Hence, the aim of this study was to fill this knowledge gap, and investigate, which fractions contributes most effectively to carbon seques-tration during the spontaneous restoration of soils after aban-donment of cultivation.237SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Deve lopment of soil organic carbon pools after vineyard abandonment3. Materials and methods3.1. Study areaThe study was carried out on the southest part of the Tokaj-Hegyalja Wine Region (Hungary), on Tokaj Nagy-Hill (Fig. 1). It is a traditional wine production area with almost thousand years old tradition. The physico-geographical conditions and soil forming factors of the area show big diversity within the area. The hill rises from the alluvial plain of the Bodrog, Tisza and Takta rivers starting at 100 m and reaches the elevation of 514 m a.s.l. The main mass of the hill is built up from late Miocene vol-canic materials (Pécskay et al., 1995; Rózsa et al., 2006), which are mostly covered by aeolian loess sediments from lower to up-per Weichselian ice age and their derivates, as colluvial materi-als (gravel, blocks, eroded and redeposited loess and soil). On the steepest sections of slopes volcanic rocks outcrop since the rapid erosion removed completely the overlaying loess cover. Rem-nants of interlayered fossil soil layers and preglacial weathering products of volcanic materials increase the spatial heterogene-ity of parent materials of soils. The mean annual temperature varies between 8.5°C on the top and almost 10°C at the base due to the microclimatic variability influenced by the topography. The average annual number of sunny hours is about 2000–2050. The mean annual precipitation is between 580 and 617 mm (Justyák, 1981). The duration of snow cover is short, does not reach 40 days and the mean thickness is less than 20 cm. The soil temperature regime could be given in mesic, the soil mois-ture regime in ustic (Füleky et al., 2007) and presumably xeric in some of the years. Vegetation, soils, and geomorphology on major part of the hill has been affected by cultivation during the last centuries (Balassa, 1975, 1991; Rózsa, 2007). The changes of the socio-eco-nomic environment during the last centuries were reflected also in land use changes (Boros, 2008) resulting the fluctuation of the extent of cultivated vineyards (Nyizsalovszki and Fórián, 2007). Remarkable part of them were abandoned or restored accord-ing the changes of actual demand for wines (Boros, 2008). Af-ter abandonment of vineyards spontaneous reforestation and shrub development could start (Sendtko, 1999), which might be interrupted by later restoration of plantations during conjunc-ture periods.Soils of the Hill therefore shows also frequently evidence of former or recent disturbances (Novák et al., 2014). Still the high diversity of parent materials, topography, and vegetation and land use history resulted high diversity in soils as well. Earlier studies (Kerényi, 1994; Stefanovits et al., 1999) reported about eroded Luvisols, Chernozems, Phaeozems from the Hill, later on weathering products of volcanic rocks Phaeozems, Luvisols, Cambisols, Leptosols and Umbrisols were described (Füleky et al., 2004, 2007; Madarász et al., 2013). Skeletal soils (Dövényi, 2010) and slope deposits (Kerényi, 1994) were also frequently found, which could be assigned to Leptosols and Regosols ac-cording to the WRB.3.2. Sampling design and settingsFor study site selection land use change data compiled from historical maps and remotely sensed data were used starting with the I. Military Survey (date: 1783), II Military Sur-vey (1858), III Military Survey (1884), topographic maps from the period of World War II (1940), New Survey Topography Map (1960), Topography Map (1989) and orthophoto from 2010. The extent and location of vineyards were identified, vector-Fig. 1.  Location of study area238SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Novák et al.ized and transformed into unified projection system (Unified National Projection, EOV). Elevation deformation of air pho-tographs was offset. For the processing of maps and remotely sensed land use data Quantum GIS 1.7 and Erdas Imagine 8.5 software were applied. Changes between the mapped periods described the vine-yard abandonments between two consecutive maps. The aban-doned vineyards were assigned into the following age classes based on the number of years since the abandonment: 193; 142; 101; 63; 39; 14 which are the midpoints of the time inter-vals between the releases of two consecutive maps. These age classes were delineated with polygons on the maps of the Hill. We supposed, that similarly to other regions slope grade and exposition affect development of soils and vegetation (Koulou-ri and Giourga, 2007; Leeschen et al., 2008) the study design was extended accordingly. Based on the topographic map the slope gradient and exposition were assigned to the abandon-ment data. Slope grade categories were applied as in Hungar-ian agricultural practices (0–5%, 5–12%, 12–17%, 17–25% and 25–35%), exposition was ranked according the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions. Based on cross sectioning of the slope-grade data, slope-exposition, and abandonment-age map two chronosequences were constituted (Table 1). One sequence was set on 25–35% slopes exposed to south (S-sequence, sites S1-S6), and one oth-er one on 17–25% slopes exposed to southwest (SW-sequence, sites SW7-SW12), both including sites of same ages of abandon-ment (193; 142; 101; 63; 39; 14 years). Depending on the suc-cession grade and time left since abandonment the sampling sites are overgrown by grasslands, shrubs, or secondary forest vegetation. In closest vicinity of S-sequence sites a cultivated vineyard (25% slope and southwest exposition) was sampled as reference (S/SW0) site.3.3. Field soil samplingOn each sampling site mixed surface samples were collect-ed from the top 0–10 cm layer of soils, in three replicates. The same time soil profiles were prepared, sampled, and described to classify the soils according the WRB. A detailed description of soil profiles, and vegetation and the evaluation of carbon stocks was published by Novák et al. (2014). From the evaluation of car-bon fractions subsequently the data of sampling site SW9 were excluded due to visible evidence of later disturbances affecting the shallow topsoil. 3.4. Standard soil analyticsBulk soil samples were grounded to fine powder with a ball mill for 5 minutes and dried at 105°C for 24 hours. For the ex-act determination of soil texture class grain size distribution was analyzed by combined wet sieving (2–0.2 mm fractions) and pipette method (< 0.2 mm fractions) (Pansu and Gatheyrou, 2006). Total organic carbon of bulk samples were determined by both wet oxidation method (Ponomareva and Plotnikova, 1980) and using CHNS analyzer (Flash EA CHNS 112 series, Thermo Electron Cooperation). pHH2O and pHKCl were measured in 1:2.5 suspensions with standard glass electrode. Inorganic carbon in both, in bulk soil and fractionated samples were measured by volumetric calcimeter (Scheibler) method (Chaney et al., 1982).SamplingsiteElevation a.s.l.(meter)Exposition Slope Time since abandonment (years)Vegetation type WRB RSGS1 362 S 25–35% 193 Forest CalcisolS2 305 142 Grassland/shrub LeptosolS3 203 101 Shrub CalcisolS4 233 63 Grassland/shrub CalcisolS5 155 39 Grassland/shrub CalcisolS6 114 14 Fallow RegosolSW7 426 SW 17–25% 193 Forest ChernozemSW8 377 142 Afforestation CambisolSW9 335 101 Forest CambisolSW10 275 63 Grassland PhaeozemSW11 236 39 Shrub CambisolSW12 257 14 Fallow/shrub RegosolS/SW0 145 SSW 25% 0 Cultivated vineyard RegosolTable 1Sampling site characteristics239SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Deve lopment of soil organic carbon pools after vineyard abandonment3.5. Soil organic matter fractionation3.5.1. Density fractionsThe SOM fractionation was conducted to obtain light (< 1.8 g cm–3) fractions (FPOM and OPOM) and OM of the heavy (> 1.8 g cm–3) fractions (associated with grain size fractions as sand, silt and clay) according to Kalinina et al. (2009, 2010, 2011, 2015) (Fig. 2). The fractionation was carried out on dried (105°C) and sieved (2 mm) soil samples in portions of 7 g per measurement. Fractionation and measurements were done in triplicates. To separate light and heavy fractions a sodium polytungstate (SPT) solution with a special density of 1.8 g cm–3 were used to soak soil aggregates and particles for 12 hours. The FPOM fractions were separated as the overfloating soil particles (lighter than 1.8 g cm–3) due filtration by cellulose-nitrate membrane filters (1.2 μm). Before determining the weight of the light fractions remained on the filter, SPT solution had to be removed from the filtrate (Ahmed and Oades, 1984) therefore after each filtra-tion, the soil was washed with deionized water and the wash-water’s electrical conductivity was measured until having val-ues lower than 100 S cm–1. To determine the separate’s weight, the filtered and washed soil fraction was dried at 105°C. To gain the OPOM fractions in the next step the heavy frac-tions (heavier than 1:8 g cm–3) were dispersed with help of ultra-sonic sound treatments in order to crack aggregates and free the OPOM. Optimization of the energy intensity was necessary, to avoid destroying organo-mineral complex, and mutate grain size distribution applying to high energy, or preserving uncracked aggregates and underestimate of the OPOM by applying to low energy (Leifeld and Kögel-Knabner, 2005; Schmidt et al., 1999; Steffens et al., 2009). For determination of the optimal treat-ment time a sonotrode was carried out by measuring the heat-ing of 100 ml H2O during a time of 120 seconds. The resulting time for treating the samples was calculated and set to 10 min-utes, whereby approximately 450 Jml–1 energy output had been reached. The aggregates after this treatment were cracked and the OPOM lighter than 1.8 g cm–3 freed. Ultrasound dispersion was followed by centrifugation (15 minutes at a speed of 10 000 spins per minute) and again filtering, washing, drying. The left-over heavy soil fractions (heavier than 1 : 8 g cm–3) of all three parallels were mixed together for grain size analysis without H2O2 pre-treatment to avoid destruction of organo-min-eral complexes. Therefore the separated fractions are not in fact mineral grain particles but are denominated as i.e. sand sized(2–0.63 mm), silt sized (0.63–0.002 mm), and clay sized Fig. 2.  Processing of separation of OM fractions240SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Novák et al.(< 0.002 mm) microaggregates according definitions (Blume et al., 2011). From each separated fraction 2 mg was weighed for C/N analysis in triplicates.The amounts of OC in particular fractions (g ∙kg–1 soil) were calculated as follows:୧ൌ	୧σ	୧୬୧ୀଵή୧ήͳͲͲwhere OCi is the amount of OC in i fraction in g in 1 kg of soil (g∙kg–1), Fi is the mass of the i fraction in kg, Ci is the concen-tration of organic C in i fraction in g ∙kg–1. In a similar way the amounts of N for each fraction were calculated. 3.5.2. Hot water extractable C (Chwe)Hot water extractable C (Chwe) was gained by reflushing 5 g of soil with 25 ml of H2Odest for 60 min with an attached reflux condenser, which was prewetted previously with 25 ml moder-ately boiling distilled water, following the VDLUFA–Methoden-buch, (2004)). Subsequently, the samples were cooled down in a water bath to room temperature, 2 droplets of MgSO4 solution (490 g · l–1) were added and was centrifuged (3500 U/min with Labofuge 400/Heraeus company/swing-bucket rotor) for 10 min-utes at 2600 g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore), acidified to pH 2 with 6M HCl (10 ml filtrate+40 μl 6M HCl) to prevent possible CO2 absorption from the air, and stored at 4°C. The Chwe concentration was meas-ured using a TOC analyzer (TOC-V CSH, Shimadzu) and calcu-lated for g kg–1. 3.5.3. Microbial C (Cm)Microbial C was determined according to Vance et al. (1987). Five g sieved, field moist soil was fumigated with chloroform for 24 h and was subsequently extracted in 0.5MK2SO4 for 1 hour on a shaker. Another 5 g were directly extracted in 0.5 M K2SO4 for 1 h on a shaker. The organic C in both extracts was deter-mined with a CN Analyzer (Multi 2100 Analytik Jena) after acidi-fication to pH 3 in order to remove inorganic C. The difference between the organic C in the extract of the fumigated and the non-fumigated soil was multiplied by the conversion factor 2.64 for C (Vance et al., 1987), and the result of this multiplication is considered as the microbial C.3.6. Chemical analysisTotal carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in bulk soil samples and in particular fractions were measured with a CHNS analyzer (Flash EA CHNS 112 series, Thermo Electron Cooperation) after the fractionations were separated by the above-mentioned way. Three repetitions were conducted per measurement. The amount of TC and TN are given in m/m % and calculated to g kg–1. The standard values used for this measure-ment are 10.36% for N and 69.38% for C. Inorganic carbon content in the bulk soil samples and in density fractions were measured by volumetric method (Schei-bler calcimeter), and total carbon data were corrected with the measured values to calculate the total organic carbon (TOC). Since inorganic carbon was found almost exclusively in sand and silt fractions in higher amount, which could influence strongly the results of carbon measurements, in the fractionated carbon content only the clay and the light organic carbon fractions were taken into consideration.3.7. Data analysis and evaluationBefore statistical analysis of relationships between vari-ables, all datasets were tested for normality with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the equal variance of homogeneity. Since we found the data not to follow normal distribution, non-parametric statistical tests (Spearman’s rank correlation) were applied. Sta-tistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. Since carbon content of density fractions (FPOM, OPOM, and heavy fractions) are overlapping with Cm and Chwe, the evaluation was carried out separately for density fractions and Chwe and Cm.4. Results4.1. Dynamic of TOC and TNThe TOC concentrations in S-sequence were varying be-tween 11.03 g  kg–1 (S6) and 45.59 g  kg–1 (S1) values were increas-ing with the age of abandonment (Table 2). In comparison the cultivated reference site (S/SW0) had 14.85 g  kg–1. In the SW-se-quence lowest TOC-concentration was also measured in most recent abandonment 5.30 g  kg–1 (SW12), and the oldest aban-doned site had 26.96 g  kg–1 (SW7). The increase of TOC concen-tration showed significant correlation with the duration of abandonment in both sequences. Spearman’s rho was in case of S-sequence 0.786 (p < 0.05) in SW-sequence 0.886 (p < 0.01).TN-concentration in S-sequence was also increasing with years since abandonment from 0.835 g  kg–1 in the youngest (S6), and 5.076 g  kg–1 in the oldest abandonment (S1). The TN concen-tration correlates significantly with the years since abandon-ment (Spearman’s rho = 0.965; p < 0.01). We measured the low-est TN concentration in the cultivated reference site (S/SW0) 0.276 g kg–1. In case of the SW-sequence, similarly to the TOC, TN concentrations were lower consequently. In most recent abandoned site (SW12) TN concentration was 0.523 g  kg–1, in the oldest abandonment (SW7) 2.383 g  kg–1. TN increase with the time since abandonment proved to be significant in case of SW-sequence as well (Spearman’s rho = 0.872; p < 0.05). 4.2. Dynamics of fractionated SOC poolsIn average 82.1% of OC was found in clay and light (OPOM and FPOM) fractions, and only 17.9% in silt and sand sized parti-cles, additionally the inorganic carbonates were found mostly in silt and sand fractions which variated on wide range depending from carbonate contents of parent material, therefore only OC in clay and light (OPOM, FPOM) fractions were evaluated sepa-rately. 241SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Deve lopment of soil organic carbon pools after vineyard abandonmentOC content of OPOM and the clay fractions proved to be in significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the TOC of the samples, therefore similarly to TOC they increased with the time since abandonment. Spearman’s rho in case of heavy (clay) fraction was 0.961 (p = 0.0001), and in case of OPOM fraction was 0.807 (p = 0.001). The OC content of FPOM fractions do not show sig-nificant relation to the TOC content, therefore also not related with the time since abandonment (Fig. 3). The clay fraction contained the highest proportion of TOC in every case, in exception of the recently cultivated S/SW0, where OC content of both OPOM and FPOM fractions exceeded the OC content of clay fraction. After the clay-sized particles, the second largest OC pool proved to be in the OPOM fraction, with excep-tion of the 39 years old abandonment of S-sequence (S5) and the cultivated reference (S/SW0) samples, where OC content of FPOM was higher.Highest proportion of light POM (OPOM and FPOM) within the TOC was found in the cultivated site (S/SW0) 52.5%. In aban-doned soils the contribution of light POM to the TOC was sub-stantially lower, in average 26.3% in S-sequence, and 11.8% in Table 2Amount and share of organic carbon in fractions of soil organic matter in abandoned vineyard soils#Sampling siteDensity fractions OChweCmTOCg/kg(bulksoil)FPOM* OPOM** clay sized g/kg % of TOC g/kg % of TOC g/kg % of TOC g/kg % of TOC g/kg % of TOCS1 9.35 20.5% 14.04 30.8% 17.18 37.8% 1.83 4.0% 0.321 0.7% 45.51S2 3.02 9.3% 11.15 34.2% 15.86 48.6% 1.46 4.5% 0.128 0.3% 32.60S3 3.42 7.5% 13.50 29.6% 16.47 36.1% 1.81 4.0% 0.294 0.6% 45.59S4 4.10 11.3% 8.01 22.1% 13.99 38.7% 1.51 4.2% 0.360 0.9% 36.18S5 4.46 19.3% 1.06 4.6% 8.17 35.3% 1.42 6.1% 0.284 1.2% 23.15S6 1.37 12.4% 4.02 36.5% 2.97 26.9% 0.38 3.4% 0.060 0.5% 11.03SW7 0.43 1.6% 9.71 36.0% 14.40 53.4% 1.70 6.3% 0.105 0.4% 26.96SW8 1.37 5.5% 9.53 38.7% 6.96 28.2% 1.13 4.6% 0.146 0.6% 24.64SW10 0.41 2.3% 8.32 46.8% 6.42 36.1% 0.87 4.9% 0.101 0.6% 17.79SW11 1.18 6.6% 7.19 40.2% 7.27 40.7% 1.05 5.8% 0.134 0.7% 17.87SW12 0.21 4.0% 2.09 39.5% 2.61 49.3% 0.45 8.5% 0.177 3.3% 5.30S/SW/0 3.95 26.6% 4.76 32.0% 3.57 24.0% 0.34 2.3% 0.105 0.7% 14.85*FPOM = free particulate organic matter; **OPOM = occluded particulate organic matterFig. 3. OC in fractions (clay, OPOM, FPOM) plotted against the TOC content of samples242SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Novák et al.SW-sequence. Consequently, low proportion of TOC was found in clay sized POM in case of the cultivated S/SW0 reference site (47.5%), and much higher part of it in cases of abandoned soils: 73.3% in S-sequence, and 88.2% in SW-sequence in average. The OC content of OPOM and clay fractions increased sig-nificantly with the time since abandonment of the cultivation parallel with the TOC content of the samples in both, S- and SW-sequences (Fig. 4). In S-sequence the OC content of clay fraction showed stronger relation with time and faster growth (Spearman’s rho = 0.929; p < 0.01) than OC content of the OPOM fraction (Spearman’s rho = 0.821; p < 0.05). In the SW-sequence the increase OC content was faster in case of OPOM (Spear-man’s rho = 0.943; p < 0.01), than in clay fraction (Spearman’s rho = 0.8771; p < 0.05). In case of FPOM no significant relation with the duration of self-restoration was found in none of the sequences (Fig. 4).Contribution of Cm to the TOC of the bulk soil proved to be evenly very low, in average 0.75% in the S, and 1.13% in the SW sequence. It was in both cases higher than in the reference cul-tivated S/SW0 site (0.71%). Lower Cm contribution and activity in the S sequence are related to the limited access to soil moisture on these exposed slopes. Lowest contribution in case of the cul-tivated S/SW0 site refers to reduced microbial life under culti-vated soil conditions.4.3. Dynamics of N in fractionsParallel with the TOC content N content showed an in-creasing dynamic with the time in both S and SW sequences. Highest part of TN was stored in almost every samples in clay fraction, followed by the OPOM fraction, and lowest in FPOM (Fig. 5). Fig. 4.  Changes of OC content in fractions (clay, OPOM, FPOM) after abandonment in S- and SW-sequenceFig. 5. Changes of total N content in fractions (clay, OPOM, FPOM) after abandonment in S- and SW-sequence243SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL Deve lopment of soil organic carbon pools after vineyard abandonment4.4. Dynamics of Chwe fractionChwe represents the relatively stable but small part of the TOC pool. Respectively, highest values were measured in the samples with higher postagricultural development, and it shows significant increase with the time (Fig. 6). Anyway, it contributes to the TOC only in very low amount, varying between 0.38 and 1.83 g kg–1 in abandoned soils and having the lowest value in the cultivated soil (0.34 g  kg–1). 4.5. C/N ratio in total soil and in fractions C/N ratio of the not fractioned samples proved to be slightly different in the two sequences: 11.1 (±3.2) in S- and 10.6 (±1.9) SW-sequence (Table 3). In fractioned samples of the S sequence the highest C/N values were found in FPOM 20.1 (±1.01). In the OPOM it was lower, 16.2 (±3.1), and in clay sized fraction was the lowest 9.7 (±0.7). In the SW sequence the C/N values of FPOM and OPOM fractions were similar 21.1 (±2.5) and 22.4 (±5.9), consecu-tively. In clay sized fraction it was lowest, 8.7 (0.4). Fig. 6.

DiscussionIn contrast to other studies (John et al., 2005; Poeplau and Don, 2013) with development to forest vegetation we found less C sequestered in FPOM fractions, and it is not increasing with the time. The reason for this might be, that it must be dif-ferentiated among forest types developing during the second-ary succession and the quality of the produced biomass. Much FPOM is always related to forests with ‘moder’ and ‘rohhumus’ organic layers, producing much more FPOM than forest sites with ‘mull’ layers, which was the case in our study. Particulate organic matter (POM) responds often more rapidly to land use conversions or changes in management practice (Leifeld and Kögel-Knabner, 2005; Six et al., 1998), than heavy fractions. Conversion of cultivated land to forest or grasslands results in rapid growing of POM under wet tem-perate climatic conditions (Poeplau and Don, 2013). Peoplau and Don (2013) also found POM to be a very sensitive indicator of changed SOC sequestration pattern after land use change. Other studies show additionally an increasing change of POM in aggregates (Kalinina et al., 2014, 2015). Passive OC pools (OC in silt and clay fractions (Christensen, 2001) were found to participate in the process of OC sequestration during self-restoration (Jastrow, 1996; McLauchlan, 2006; Floote and Gro-gan, 2010) however others shows no substantial participation of this fractions.Similarly to statements in other studies, smallest contribu-tion to TOC was found in FPOM, and highest in the mineral (clay) fraction (Coneiç ăo et al., 2013), anyway differences between the S and SW sequences and the cultivated reference place were considerable. Only 4.0% of the TOC took place in FPOM in average of the samples from SW-sequence, 13.4% in average ofS-sequence and 26.6% in case of the cultivated reference (S/SW) site. This relation proved to be not varying with the time since the abandonment, but the difference between the S and SW se-quences was significant. In contrast of other studies, we did not find  increasing amount of FPOM, which could be because of the shortest turnover time of this fraction. It seems to be, that in these conditions (dry microclimatic conditions on ex-posed slopes) SOM of FPOM will be either quickly decomposed or moved into the OPOM and the heavy OM fractions. The C/N ratio was more variable within the different frac-tions and did not show any clear development with the time of self-restoring. Generally the lowest C/N ratio was found in clay fraction 9.2 ±1.2 and in both of the light fractions were more than double higher, being 19.3 ±9.7 in OPOM and 20.6 ±3.7 in FPOM.6. ConclusionsThe chronosequential study of the SOC sequestration after vineyard abandonment on S and SW exposed slopes showed that the separate fractions have different contributions to in-crease of th TOC content. Considering the duration of postcul-tivation development of the soils a relatively quick C seques-tration rate could be pointed on, which is also influenced by the slope exposition. The well-known considerable C decrease and exhaustion of C pools caused by vineyard land use can be the reason for the fast recharge of them after leaving off it. Al-most independently from the duration of postagricultural soil development, the largest part of TOC is stored in form of stable organic compounds bound in clay-sized microaggregates. The contribution of the labile fractions (FPOM, OPOM) to the TOC proved to be relatively low in abandoned vineyards soils, since in the cultivated vineyard soil it is significantly higher – besides lower TOC content. More labile pools (FPOM) represent very limited capacity, even if presumably the C in this fraction is the first steps in C sequestration, providing sources to sequester the C in further, more stable pools, but this process proved to be rapid under the conditions of our study.AcknowledgementsThe research was financed by the Higher Education In-stitutional Excellence Programme (NKFIH-1150-6/2019) of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology in Hungary, within the framework of the 4th thematic programme of the University of Debrecen.
