Moderate increases in soil temperature are generally related to faster rates of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition in Northern ecosystems, but there is evidence that SOC stocks have remained remarkably stable or even increased on the Tibetan Plateau under these conditions. This intriguing observation points to altered soil microbial mediation of carbon-  cycling feedbacks in this region that might be re -lated to seasonal warming. This study investigated the unexplained SOC stabilization observed on the Tibetan Plateau by quantifying microbial responses to experimental seasonal warming in a typical alpine meadow. Ecosystem respiration was reduced by 17%–  38% under winter warming compared with year- round warming or no warming and coincided with decreased abundances of fungi and functional genes that control labile and stable organic carbon decomposition. Compared with year-  round warm -ing, winter warming slowed macroaggregate turnover rates by 1.6 times, increased fine intra-  aggregate particulate organic matter content by 75%, and increased carbon stabilized in microaggregates within stable macroaggregates by 56%.

Non-  growing win -ter seasons experience larger temperature increases than summer growing seasons, especially in high-  latitude, temperature-  sensitive areas (Kreyling et al., 2019; Piao et al., 2010). This “asymmetric sea -sonal warming” (with the most significant temperature increase in winter) has been evident on the Tibetan Plateau over the last several decades (Li et al., 2010; Liu & Chen, 2000).The Tibetan Plateau holds 30–  40 Gt of soil organic carbon (SOC), which accounts for 2%–  3% of the global SOC stock (Shang et al., 2016). Increased losses of SOC to the atmosphere as CO2 across this vast area, caused by accelerated microbial decomposition driven by warming, could constitute an important positive feedback to further climate change. The average temperature increase in the region is approximately twice the average global warming rate (Chen et al., 2013) and winter temperatures have risen by 0.3°C per decade in the winter compared with 0.2°C during the summer (Li et al., 2010; Lu & Liu, 2010). Despite this tangible warming trend, there is evidence that topsoil SOC stocks have remained remarkably stable (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2009) or even increased (Ding et al., 2017). This suggests that the underlying processes controlling the capacity of Tibetan grasslands to maintain SOC stocks under global warming are not fully understood and require investigation.The regulation of SOC turnover is increasingly conceptualized as part of a dynamic soil pore system, where the construction and destruction of pores control SOC availability to decomposing agents in the context of global change challenges (Franko & Schulz, 2020; Kravchenko et al., 2019). Long-  term physical protection of SOC through aggregation afforded by the enmeshment of mineral parti -cles by biological agents is widely recognized (Lehmann et al., 2017; Rillig & Mummey, 2006; Six et al., 2002; Tisdall & Oades, 1982). The association of microbial “necromass” (e.g., amino sugars from the residues of fungal and bacterial cell walls) and mineral-  associated fractions (Glaser et al., 2006; Gunina et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 1998) represents a direct link between the stabilizing action of biota and microbial anabolism as a major contributor to the stable SOC pool (Kallenbach et al., 2016) that is incorporated into conceptual models and experiments (Gunina et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2017; Sokol et al., 2019). Nevertheless, despite the acknowledged stability of mineral- associated carbon, it is vulnerable to climate change.Soil warming experiments, for example at the Harvard Forest (Pold et al., 2017), and an annual grassland in California (Liang & Balser, 2012; Rillig et al., 2002) revealed the depletion of mineral-  associated organic carbon. This is because increased temperature shifts the sorption-  desorption balance toward desorption (Conant et al., 2011) and decreases supplies of carbon as energy source and organic substances that bind soil particles together (Giovannini et al., 1988). However, the effects of soil warming in mesic regions may be different from that at high latitudes in (semi)arid alpine regions, where warming is often accompanied by severe summer droughts and fre -quent soil drying and rewetting, or freezing and thawing in winter and spring. Increasing intensity and duration of dry periods may pro -gressively preserve SOC stocks (Borken & Matzner, 2009) through the formation of new and/or stronger organo-  mineral interactions (Kaiser et al., 2015) and may stabilize aggregates rather than disrupt them (Denef et al., 2001; Najera et al., 2020). Continuous warming led to increase of mineral-  associated carbon along with suppressed soil respiration in a semiarid grassland (Bai et al., 2020). Microorganisms have specific adaptations depending on the local climate; for example, fungi in arid grasslands are less sensitive to drought than those in tem -perate grasslands (Ochoa-  Hueso et al., 2018), and this will influence the amount and stability of the microbial necromass (Ding et al., 2019; Liang & Balser, 2012). For instance, in cold, wet alpine ecosystems, plants may take up more nitrogen in the warmer growing season, while microbial nitrogen pools increase later in the year (Edwards & Jefferies, 2010; Jaeger III et al., 1999; Kuzyakov & Xu, 2013) poten -tially alleviating competition for nitrogen in the cooler non-  growing season. Thus, the tendency toward SOC stabilization observed in the warming Tibetan Plateau may be a product of the effects of climate on soil physical, biogeochemical, and microbiological processes.Manipulation experiments simulating climate change commonly apply uniform warming treatments (Jia et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018), “necromass” (amino sugars) concentrations in soil under winter warming coincided with a 12% increase in carboxyl-  C. These results indicate the enhanced physical pres -ervation of SOC under winter warming and emphasize the role of soil microorganisms in aggregate life cycles. In summary, the divergent responses of SOC persistence in soils exposed to winter warming compared to year- round warming are explained by the slowing of microbial decomposition but increasing physical protection of microbi -ally derived organic compounds. Consequently, the soil microbial response to win -ter warming on the Tibetan Plateau may cause negative feedbacks to global climate change and should be considered in Earth system models.KEYWORDScarbon degradation genes, microbial anabolism, microbial community, SOC stabilization, soil aggregate turnover, winter warming 13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15538 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/04/2023].

To disentangle the processes caused by the observed temperature increases at different times of year on the Tibetan Plateau, a specific winter warming treatment was imposed in addi -tion to a year-  round warming treatment that would allow the identi -fication and isolation of physical (soil aggregate size), chemical (labile and stable organic carbon pools), and biological (community struc -ture and carbon degradation genes) processes specifically related to winter warming in this study. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that SOC stabilization on the Tibetan Plateau is caused by the effect of winter warming on the carbon cycling functions of the soil micro -bial community.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  |  Experimental site and designThe study was conducted in an alpine meadow at the Damxung Grassland Station, located in the central, southern Tibetan Plateau (30°51′N and 90°05′E; 4333  m a.s.l.). The region has a semiarid con -tinental climate (mean annual temperature 1.3°C, annual precipita -tion 477 mm) with 85% of precipitation occurring between June and August and the soil being frozen for 3 months, from November to January. The growing season is from late May to September. The shallow soil (0.3–  0.5 m) is a Gelic Cambisol with 67% sand, 18% silt, 15% clay, and a pH of 6.95 (Shi et al., 2006). The vegetation cover is approximately 30%–  50% Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke var. pyg-maea , Carex montis-  everestii and Stipa capillacea  Keng as dominant species (Table S1).Field manipulations consisted of three warming treatments, in -cluding year-  round warming (YW), winter-  warming (WW) and no warming (control). The field experiment was established in 2010. In brief, 12 plots of three treatments with four replicates were laid out in a completely randomized block design. Each plot was 1 m × 1 m. Open-  top chambers were used to generate artificially warmed conditions using the same methods as the International Tundra Experiment that was established to study the responses of alpine ecosystems to experimental warming (Birkemoe et al., 2016). The open-  top chambers were constructed using 3  mm thick polycarbonate plastic (40 cm high ×140 cm diameter base with a 100-  cm diameter aperture at the top). The open-  top chambers were removed from the plots from late May to late September each year in the WW treatment plots. Air and soil (5 cm) tem -perature and soil moisture were recorded every 30 min (HOBO Weather Station, Onset Inc.).2.2  |  Ecosystem respirationEcosystem respiration ( Reco) was measured three times per month at 10-  day intervals from June to September in 2015 using a LI-  8100 (LI- COR Biosciences). PVC chambers (20 cm in diameter, 5 cm height) were inserted into the soil to a depth of 3 cm with plants intact. Reco was measured from the linear rate of CO2 accumulation within the sealed cylindrical headspaces. During the Reco measurement pro -cess, PVC collars were covered by a removable lid that contained an opening with a CO2 sensor . After closing the lid, CO2 monitor -ing within the cylindrical headspace lasted for 1.5 min. Ecosystem CO2 flux rates were calculated as a linear CO2 increase using the 1-  s readings during the 1.5-  min closure time, with the initial 15 s mixing time after lid closure discarded in a LI-  8100 file viewer application software (Zong et al., 2018).2.3  |  Soil sampling and analysisSoil samples (0–  20 cm depth) were taken using a soil corer (5 cm inner diameter) in June 2015. The soil samples were stored in airtight polypropylene bags and placed in a cool box at 4°C during transpor -tation to the laboratory, where litter, roots, and gravel were carefully removed by hand, and the soil was divided into several subsamples for different analyses.Subsamples of fresh soil for analysis of ammonium-  nitrogen (NH4+- N) and nitrate-  nitrogen (NO3−- N) concentration were stored at 4°C for no longer than 1 week before analysis using an autoanalyzer (TRAACS-  2000, Bran+Luebbe) following 0.01  M KCL (1:10 w/v) extraction for 30 min. Subsamples for pH, SOC, and total nitrogen analyses were air dried at room temperature. Inorganic carbon was removed from the soil samples using an HCl-  fumigation. The SOC and total nitrogen contents of bulk and aggregate size fractions were determined by combustion using a Vario EL III Elemental Analyzer (Elementar). Soil pH was measured with a pH meter after shaking the soil in deionized water (1:2.5 w/v) suspensions for 30  min. Subsamples for microbial community composition and functional gene (GeoChip) analysis were stored at −80°C.2.4  |  Soil aggregate size fractionationSoil aggregate size separation was performed using a three-  step fractionation method (Yan et al., 2012; Figure S1). Bulk soil was separated into three size fractions: macroaggregates (M, >0.25 mm), free microaggregates (Fm, 0.25–  0.053  mm), and non-  aggregated silt+clay (<0.053 mm). The macroaggregates were fractionated into coarse intra-  aggregate particulate organic matter (Coarse iPOM, >0.25  mm), microaggregates-  within-  macroaggregates (mM), and silt+clay fractions using a microaggregate isolator (Six et al., 2000). The mM fraction was inverted in NaI solution (1.85 g cm−3). The light fraction obtained by centrifugation was non-  occluded intra-  aggregate POM inside macroaggregates but outside micro-aggregates (Fine iPOM, 0.25–  0.053 mm). The heavy fraction was dispersed by shaking in 0.5% sodium hexametaphosphate solution for 18 h with 10 glass beads. The dispersed samples were rinsed over  13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15538 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/04/2023].

Soil sam -ples were treated with 10% HF-  HCL solution to concentrate the organic matter and to remove paramagnetic minerals. 13C - C P M A S  NMR spectra were acquired using an AVANCE III 400 WB spec -trometer (Bruker BioSpin AG) at 100 MHz for 13C and 400 MHz for 1H with a spinning rate of 8 kHz, an acquisition of 20 ms, a recycle time of 3 s and contact time of 2 ms. The spectra were integrated into four chemical shift regions corresponding to alkyl C (0–  50 ppm), O-  alkyl C (50–  110 ppm), aromatic C (110–  160 ppm), carboxyl-  C (160–  190 ppm) functional groups (Mathers & Xu, 2003; Skjemstad et al., 1994). The NMR spectra were processed with MestReNova 5.3.1 software (Mestrelab Research S. L. Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The raw 13C CPMAS NMR spectra are pro -vided in Figure S2.2.6  |  Microbial residue analysisGlucosamine, galactosamine, and muramic acid were used as bio-markers for microbial residues (“necromass”). The compounds were extracted from air-  dried soil samples ground to <0.25 mm and ana -lyzed as their aldononitrile derivatives following the methods of Zhang and Amelung (1996) using myo-  inositol as an internal stand -ard. The derivatized compounds were separated on a gas chroma -tograph equipped with an HP-  5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×0.25 μm) and quantified using a flame ionization detector (Agilent 6890A, Agilent Technologies). Total microbial residues were estimated as the sum of glucosamine, galactosamine, and muramic acid. To cal -culate bacterial residues, we assumed that all muramic acid was de -rived from bacteria:where 45 is the conversion value to bacterial residue (Appuhn et al., 2006; van Groenigen et al., 2010).Fungal residue was calculated by subtracting bacterial-  derived glucosamine from total glucosamine, assuming a 1:2 molar ratio for muramic acid and glucosamine in bacterial cells (Engelking et al., 2007):where 179.2 is the molecular weight of glucosamine and 9 is the conversion factor of fungal glucosamine to fungal residue (Joergensen & Wichern, 2008; van Groenigen et al., 2010). Total microbial residue was estimated as the sum of fungal and bacterial residue.2.7  |  DNA extraction, quantitative PCR, and amplicon sequencingDNA was extracted from 0.25 g of well-  mixed soil using the PowerSoil Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the purified DNA was assessed based on the 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm absorbance ratios obtained, using a NanoDrop ND-  1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.). The DNA was stored at −80°C until use.B a c t e r i a l  a n d  f u n g a l  a b u n d a n c e s  w e r e  d e t e r m i n e d  b y  q P C R  u s i n g  the Power SYBR Green PCR Master MIX (Biosystems) on an ABI 7500 Real-  Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following primer sets were used: 515F (5 ′- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-  3′) and 909R (5 ′- CCCCGYCAATTCMTTTRAGT-  3′) for bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance and fungal ITS1 (5 ′- CTTGGTCATTTAGA  GGAAGTAA-  3′) and 2043R (5 ′- GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-  3′). The following program was used for 16S rRNA gene amplification: initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, followed by 34 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 56°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 30 s; for analysis of ITS1: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min.The V4-  V5 region of 16S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region of the rRNA, were then amplified in order to construct bacterial and fungal community profiles, respec -tively, using high-  throughput sequencing. The primers F515 (5 ′- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGC-  3′) and R907 (5′-  CCGTCAATTCMTTTRA   GTTT-  3′) were used to target the V4-  V5 region of 16S rRNA because of the broad coverage to capture as wide diversity as possible (Yusoff et al., 2013). We used the ITS1 region for fungi due to its ability to discriminate against plant (Adams et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020). The following thermal program was used for amplification of 16S rRNA gene: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 45  s, and single extension at 72°C for 10  min, and end at 4°C. The PCR amplification of ITS1 rRNA gene was performed as fol -lows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 45  s, and single extension at 72°C for 10  min, and end at 4°C. PCR amplicons were extracted from 2% agarose gels and puri -fied using an AxyPrep DNA Gel ExtractionKit (Axygen Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired-  end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq PE300 platform (Illumina) according to the standard protocols by Majorbio Bio-  Pharm Technology Co. Ltd.The raw sequences were subjected to quality control with the following criteria: (i) the 300  bp reads were truncated at any site re -ceiving an average quality score of <20 over a 50-  bp sliding window, and the truncated reads shorter than 50 bp were discarded; reads (1)Bacterial residue C =muramic acid ×45,(2) Fungal residue C =(mmol glucosamine −2×mmol muramic acid )×179.2 ×9, 13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15538 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/04/2023].

The maximum mismatch ratio of overlap region is 0.2. Reads that could not be assembled were discarded; (iii) primers were exactly matched allowing two-  nucleotide mismatch -ing. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity cutoff were clustered using UPARSE version 7.1 (Edgar et al., 2011), and chimeric sequences were identified and removed. The taxonomy of each OTU representative sequence was analyzed by RDP Classifier Bayesian algorithm (Wang et al., 2007) against the Silva database (https://www.arb-  silva.de/) and the UNITE database (https://unite.ut.ee/) using confidence threshold of 0.7. We used a randomly se -lected subset of 24,183 and 33,197 sequences per sample for subse -quent bacterial and fungal communities' analysis.2.8  |  Microbial functional communities and intensities of carbon decomposition genesMicrobial functional communities and intensities of carbon degra -dation genes were determined using DNA hybridization performed using GeoChip 5.0 according to He et al. (2007) and Yang et al. (2013). Briefly, DNA samples were labeled with Cy-  5 fluorescent dye using a random priming method and purified with the QIA quick purifica -tion kit (Qiagen). The DNA was dried in a SpeedVac (ThermoSavant) at 45°C for 45 min. GeoChip hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 16 h on a MAUI® hybridization station (BioMicro). After hybridi -zation, GeoChips were scanned by a NimbleGenMS200 scanner (Roche) at 633 nm, using a laser power and photomultiplier tube gain of 100% and 75%, respectively. Raw GeoChip data were ana -lyzed using a data analysis pipeline as described previously (He et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2013). The data were logarithmically transformed, and then divided by the mean value of each slide. Spots that were flagged or with a signal-  to- noise ratio less than 2.0 were considered poor in quality and removed from statistical analysis (He et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2013).2.9  |  Statistical analysisSoil organic carbon chemistry (functional groups), physical frac -tions, and other variables were analyzed using a one-  way ANOVA with randomized block design by using SAS (SAS, 1996). Differences were considered significant at p < 0 . 0 5 ,  a n d  a  p o st  h o c  l e a st  s i g -nificant difference test was carried out to compare differences be -tween warming treatments. The normal distribution of residues of the model was tested by using “shapiro.test” function of the stats  package in R v.3.2.1 (R Core Team, 2018). The relationships between microbial residues and SOC physical and chemical fractions were as -sessed with linear regression analyses using the “lm” function of the vegan  package in R v.3.2.1 (R Core Team, 2018).Matrices of the pairwise taxonomic distance between bacterial, fungal, and functional microbial communities (Bray–  Curtis) were constructed in R v.3.2.1 with the vegan  package (R Core Team, 2018). Non-  metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to assess changes in the bacterial, fungal, and microbial functional communi -ties. Adonis analyses were further performed to confirm significant changes in community structures under influence of warming and in any pair of samples. NMDS and statistical analyses were performed in R v.3.2.1 with the vegan  package (R Core Team, 2018).Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was performed to identify significant differences in bacterial and fungal taxa among treatments (Segata et al., 2011). The significant differences were analyzed by using the nonparametric factorial Kruskal–  Wallis (KW) sumrank test and then estimate the effect size of each feature of each differentially abundant feature with linear discriminant analysis (http://hutte  nhower.sph.harva rd.edu/lefse/). A significance alpha of 0.05 and an effect size threshold of 2 were used for all of the bio -markers evaluated.To further investigate the relationship between Reco with  en -vironmental variables and biogeochemical processes, partial least squares path modeling (PLS-  PM) analysis was performed. PLS-  PM is a data analysis method for variables that can be summarized by using latent variables, and the fact that linear relationships exist between latent variables (Sanchez, 2013). Models with different structures are evaluated using the goodness of fit (GOF) statistics, a measure of their overall predictive power, with GOF > 0.7 con -sidered acceptable values (Sanchez, 2013). The models were con -structed using the “inner plot” function of the R package ( plspm ; R Core Team, 2018). The environmental drivers selected in the model were the main predictors according to their contribution for variation based on Random Forest analysis (% of increase of MSE). Based on the importance and the maximum explanation for variations of Reco, the environmental drivers selected in the model include soil water and temperature, carbon degradation genes, fungal residue, aboveground biomass, bacterial/fungal ratio, and aggregate size fractions (non-  aggregated silt and clay, mM, mM-  silt and clay; Figure S3).3 | RESULTS3.1  |  Soil temperature and moistureWarming increased average topsoil temperature and decreased soil moisture compared with the ambient control soil (no warming; p < 0.05; Figure S4). The average change in soil temperature for the duration of the experiment was +1.3°C under YW and +1.0°C under WW. The average change in soil moisture for the duration of the experiment was −4.7% under YW and −3.3% under WW. During the growing season (June–  September), soil temperature under YW in -creased by 1.2°C and soil moisture decreased by 4.5%. During the non-  growing season, incorporating “winter” (October–  May), the soil temperature increased by 1.3°C under YW and 1.4°C under WW, and average soil moisture was decreased by 4.9% in both YW and WW treatments. 13652486, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15538 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/04/2023].

Soil mineral nitrogen concentrations [NO3— N + NH4+- N] under YW and WW were 60% and 25% less, respectively, than in the control treatment ( p < 0.05; Figure 1c). Compared to the control treatment, warming decreased the aver -age Reco during the growing season (June–  September) by 17% and 38% under YW and WW, respectively ( p < 0.05; Figure  1d). The CP-  MAS NMR spectra of soils from all warming treatments had similar proportions of major functional groups, with O-  alkyl-  C comprising about 40% of the total in all treatments. Phenol-  C was proportion -ately less in the YW plots than the control. Carboxyl-  C was propor -tionately larger under WW than YW or control ( p < 0.05; Figure 1e).3.3  |  SOC in aggregate size fractionsThe warming treatments changed the percentage of aggregate-  size fractions and their SOC content. YW and WW increased the propor -tion and carbon contents of the non-  aggregated silt+clay fraction compared with control ( p < 0.05; Table 1). Soils under YW had the smallest proportion of fine iPOM and associated carbon ( p < 0.05; Table 1). The proportion of mM increased by 22% under WW com -pared to the control ( p < 0.05; Table 1). The SOC in mM under WW was 1.57 times more than under YW ( p < 0.05; Table  1). The propor -tions of mM-  silt+clay and associated SOC were greater under WW than under YW ( p < 0.05; Table 1).

The abundance of bacteria did not change (Figure 2a). The bacterial/fungal ratio under WW was larger than YW ( p < 0.05; Figure  2c). NMDS of the sequencing data followed by Adonis analysis indicated that warming altered bacterial and fun -gal community composition ( p < 0.05; Figure  S5). Further pairwise comparison indicated that the microbial community was changed in response to warming, and suggested that the difference was be -tween the control and YW for the bacterial community, and control and YW, and YW and WW, for the fungal community ( p < 0.05; Table S2).The outcome of the LEfSe analysis indicated that the rel -ative abundances of bacterial taxa from Acidobacteria (from phylum to class), Anaerolineae (from class to genus), and Longimicrobiaceae (from family to genus) were larger in the un -warmed control treatments relative to the warmed plots ( p < 0.05; Figure 3). Further pairwise comparison revealed that the rela -tive abundances of taxa from Acidobacteria, Fibrobacteres, and Gemmatimonadetes were smaller under YW treatment relative to control ( p < 0.05; Figure  S6). In contrast, abundant genera such as Microbacterium, Friedmanniella, Sciscionella, Flavobacterium, Pedobacter, Paenibacillus, Methylobacterium, Roseomonas, and Sphingomonas were enriched in YW plots ( p < 0.05; Figure  S6). Regarding soil fungal taxa, YW increased Cystobasidiomycetes abundance (from class to genus) as compared to WW and control treatments ( p < 0.05; Figure 3).

The soil water content and temperature showed the largest effect on Reco variance via direct effect (path coefficient  = −0.793). There were cor -responding direct positive effects of carbon degradation genes on Reco variance (path coefficient  =0.687). The fungal residue and stable C fractions (silt+clay, mM, and mM-  silt+clay) both resulted in a di -rect negative effect on Reco variance (path coefficient  = −0.426 and −0.240).4 | DISCUSSIONThe combination of physical (soil aggregate fractions), chemical (13C NMR-  CPMAS), and microbiological ( Reco, community composition, and carbon degradation genes) analysis allowed us to explore the effects of different seasonal warming (year-  round or asymmetric winter warming) compared to ambient conditions on SOC dynamics and stabilization in this study. Using this multi-  proxy approach, we determined divergent responses of the soil microbial community to differential seasonal warming that may explain the observed SOC stabilization in Tibetan steppe grasslands under different seasonal warming. Two major mechanisms emerged related to the effects of the treatments on microbial activity that affected the balance be -tween SOC mineralization and stabilization in the alpine meadow topsoils (Figure 8): (1) increased physical protection of larger amounts of microbially derived SOC in soil stable aggregates and (2) decreased microbial decomposition caused by changes in the micro-bial community composition and the expression of carbon decom -position genes.4.1  |  Winter warming decreased microbial decomposition via changes in microbial function and community structureReco i n  b o t h  y e a r -  r o u n d  a n d  a s y m m e t r i c  w i n t e r  w a r m i n g  t r e a t -ments was substantially depressed, and to a much greater extent under the winter warming treatment (Figure 1). This was related to the combination of increased soil temperature and decreased soil moisture over several years (Figure 7). We did not separate autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration as individual contribu -tors to Reco in this study, so cannot partition Reco between plants and soil microorganisms. However, we determined that chang -ing aboveground plant biomass in response to warming was not a strong determining factor of Reco at the experimental site using PLS-  PM analysis (Figure 7), which agrees with our previous re -port (Zong et al., 2018), and there was no difference in the much larger amounts of root biomass in response to warming (Table  S4). A positive correlation between temperature increase and rates of soil respiration after warming is widely reported (Melillo et al., 2002; Rustad et al., 2001). In general, warming initially promotes microbial growth which stimulates decomposition, driving signifi -cant CO2 losses in the early stages of many soil warming experi -ments (e.g., Garcia-  Palacios et al., 2015; Karhu et al., 2014; Melillo et al., 2002; Romero-  Olivares et al., 2017; Rustad et al., 2001). Soil moisture is an important factor regulating large-  scale spatial patterns of Reco in Tibetan alpine grasslands (Geng et al., 2012) and inconsistent effects of experimental warming on soil CO2 flux that are related to interannual fluctuations in rainfall have been reported in semiarid steppe grasslands (Liu et al., 2009). Persistent moisture deficits in warmed soils may subsequently reduce soil CO2 efflux and microbial biomass content (Liu et al., 2009; Quan et al., 2019). Thus, the reduction in Reco with warming may be due FIGURE 2 Effects of soil warming on (a) bacterial and (b) fungal abundances and (c) bacteria/fungi ratio.

This effect coincided with an increase in the intensities of stress response genes (Figure S7), suggesting a potential trade-  off between stress tolerance versus FIGURE 3 LEfSe analysis of significantly abundant taxa of bacteria (a) and fungi (b) in soil microbial communities under different treatments.

(2020). In support of this explanation, the abundance of functional genes involved in both labile and recalcitrant carbon cycling was significantly elevated by experimental increases in precipitation (Li et al., 2017). The larger reduction of carbon decomposition genes in the winter warming treatment (Figure  6) indicated that winter warming also inhibited the production of carbon decomposition enzymes through a decrease of soil fungal abundance and altered fungal community (Table S3). Decreases in genes for labile and recalcitrant carbon decomposition in response to soil drying caused by winter warming could indicate a negative feedback mechanism that reduces SOC losses. Warming also decreased the relative abundance of carbon decomposition genes in transplanted intact soil monoliths moved between sites at different altitudes in Tibet (Yue et al., 2015). The opposite was ob -served in irrigated arid soils where, for example, Li et al. (2017) de -termined an increase in the abundance of functional genes involved in both labile and recalcitrant carbon cycling after warming. This also contrasts with results from temperate prairies, where microbial genes for complex organic compound degradation were increased by warming (Feng et al., 2017). Our study therefore provides further evidence that changes in the water cycle caused by climate change have the potential to moderate warming-  induced carbon losses and could even reverse the expected trend on the Tibetan Plateau. This implies a more prominent role for soil moisture in regulating SOC processing in the future than it has played in the past by enhanc -ing the feedback between soil warming and global climate change (Werner et al., 2020).4.2  |  Stronger physical protection of SOC under winter warmingSoil organic carbon associated with minerals is considered as one of the most fundamental long-  term, stable carbon pools (Cotrufo et al., 2015; Six & Paustian, 2014). The mM fraction is suggested as a ro -bust indicator for management-  induced SOC changes over decadal time scales (Six & Paustian, 2014). In this study, as with bulk SOC, there was no difference between warming treatments in coarse FIGURE 4 Effect of soil warming on amino sugar abundances (a, b), bacterial, fungal and total residue-  derived carbon (c, d, e) and the ratio of bacterial to fungal residue C (f).

However, macroaggregate turnover rates (based on the ratio of fine iPOM to coarse iPOM within macroaggregates; Six et al., 2000) were up to 1.6 times less in the winter warming treatments compared to the control. So, in contrast to year-  round warming which decreased soil aggregate stability, winter warming had slower macroaggregate turnover and increased carbon con -tents in smaller aggregate size fractions, indicating increased carbon stabilization via organo-  mineral interactions and microaggregation (Table 1).The enmeshing action of fungal mycelia in the formation of soil aggregates is widely recognized (Lehmann et al., 2017; Rillig & Mummey, 2006). Rillig et al. (2002) reported that warming of an an -nual grassland in the United States decreased the water stability of soil aggregate and abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) hy -phae ( Glomus  sp.). In this study, AMF were not measured directly, but a reduction in phylum Glomeromycotina abundance was determined under year-  round warming (Figure S6) indicating a mechanism for the reduction in macroaggregate stability under this treatment. The changes in the AMF fungi response to warming and their relation -ship to the soil aggregation represent a key focus for further study.Microbial residue (“necromass”) is an important constituent of stable SOC due to its tendency for sorption to mineral surfaces or protection within stable aggregates (Kuzyakov & Mason-  Jones, 2018; Liang et al., 2017; Miltner et al., 2012), described as the “en -tombing effect” by Liang et al. (2017). Soil water content was up to ~5% less in the warmed treatments in this study (Figure S4). Soil drying can promote the formation of new and/or stronger organo-  mineral interactions with microbial by-  products (e.g., amino sugars; Bai et al., 2020; Kaiser et al., 2015). The importance of the con -tribution of microbial necromass to stable SOC pools has recently been reassessed (Liang et al., 2019). This was confirmed in our study where up to half of total SOC was derived from amino sugars, and ~60% were of fungal origin (Figure 5). Fungi tend to be more resis -tant to drought, while bacteria are more resilient (de Vries et al., 2012) and can return close to control conditions upon rewetting (Canarini et al., 2017). In our study, soils under winter warming con -tained more of the mM and mM-  silt+clay fraction than year-  round warmed soils. Bacterial residue carbon content was positively re -lated to the carbon content of the mM and mM-  silt+clay fractions (Figure 5) revealing the enhanced physical preservation of SOC under winter warming.FIGURE 6 Effects of soil warming on functional microbial communities (a) and carbon degradation genes (b).

Like Jia et al. (2019), we determined a decrease in plant-  derived phenols from lignin and suberin (identified herein as the phenol-  C functional group by 13C NMR) in topsoils after 5 years of continuous warming experiment (YW treatment). A reduction in lignin content of plant inputs was previously identified in warmed temperate grasslands suggesting a potential mechanism (Henry et al., 2005; Sanaullah et al., 2014). An increased abundance of carboxyl-  C was unique to winter-  warmed soils (Figure 1). Although carboxylic (fatty) acids are susceptible to rapid oxidation by soil microorganisms, they have the potential for sequestration within the soil by complexing with clay minerals and other forms of organic matter (Bull et al., 2000) sug -gesting a route to enhanced physical protection (Figure 5; Table 1) of plant and microbial derived carbon. The analysis of lipid biomarkers has the potential to assign source of the carboxyl-  C in future analysis of warmed soils to complement the analysis of amino sugars as indi -cators of soil microbial contributions to SOC.Unlike winter warming, year-  round warming caused a decline in total microbial residues and bacterial residue carbon (Figure  4). This observation is similar to the observed reduction of total mi -crobial residues in soils in an annual grassland after 9 years of continuous warming in the United States (Liang & Balser, 2012). Inorganic nitrogen content was significantly less under year-  round warming (Figure  1c) indicating nitrogen limitation due to climate change in Tibetan alpine meadow ecosystems previously recog -nized by Ding et al. (2019) that may be exacerbated by drought stress. A recent large-  scale field investigation along a 1000-  km transect in the Tibetan Plateau revealed that gross rates of N mineralization were positively associated with soil moisture (Mao et al., 2020). Microbial residues are comparatively rich in nitrogen (Cotrufo et al., 2015) and fungal residues (derived from chitin) are considered to be more persistent than bacterial residues (derived from peptidoglycan; Ding et al., 2019; Six et al., 2006) making the latter more susceptible to nitrogen mining during the growing FIGURE 7 Partial least squares path analysis for ecosystem respiration, showing the relationship between selected biogeochemical processes, microbial community composition, and functional gene abundance.

Jaeger III et al. (1999) reported the transfer of microbial ni -trogen to plant-  available pools was observed in the early growing season in an alpine ecosystem. Most organic nitrogen is associated with clay-  sized particles where physicochemical interactions may limit the accessibility of N- containing compounds (Jilling et al., 2018). From an alternative perspective, the greater aggregate turnover under year-  round warming may result in potential de -stabilization of bacterial residues from clay-  silt fractions (Table 1; Figure  5) due to microbial exploitation of organic nitrogen sources under conditions of low mineral-  N availability (Figure 1).5 | CONCLUSIONSWith respect to other grassland ecosystems, alpine grassland sys -tems account for more than 40% of the Tibetan Plateau area and are considered to be particularly sensitive to climatic change. Compared to year-  round warming, winter warming reduced macroaggregate turnover, increased bacterial residues (necromass), and increased mM, an aggregate size fraction that is closely related to the long- term physical protection of SOC of microbial origin. Winter warming decreased the activity of carbon decomposition genes to a greater extent than year-  round warming.The deliberate isolation of winter warming from year-  round warming in our field experiment allowed us to disentangle its ef -fects in situ, to reveal potential mechanisms for observed SOC sta -bilization as a climate-  C feedback. The fact that this was different from the year-  round warming treatments suggests that summer can weaken the effects of winter warming, and further study is required to determine the relative importance of winter versus summer warming in controlling SOC protection mechanisms. In this context, it would be valuable to establish experiments in which year-  round FIGURE 8 A conceptual diagram illustrating the increasing or decreasing impact of warming on aggregate turnover, microbial community, necromass, and the activity of microbial functional genes that control carbon cycling after year-  round or winter warming as compared to control.
