Typically, reinforcements utilized incementitious composites range from nanometer scale to millimeter scale by using nano-, micro-, andmillimeter-sized ﬁbers and particles. These reinforcements provide the crack arresting mechanismsat the nano/microscale and restrict the growth of the cracks under service loads, but usually, thesynthesis of nano/microﬁbers, and afterward their dispersion in the cementitious materials, posedifﬁculty, thus limiting their vast application in the construction industry. Carbonaceous inerts aregreen materials since they are capable of capturing and storing carbon, thus limiting the emission ofCO 2to the atmosphere. In the present study, a comprehensive review of the synthesis of low costand environmentally friendly nano/micro carbonaceous inerts from pyrolysis of different agricul-tural/industrial wastes, and afterward, their application in the cementitious materials for producinghigh performance cementitious composites is presented, which have the potential to be used asnano/micro reinforcement in the cementitious matrix.Keywords: cementitious composites; fracture energy; pyrolysis; biochar; high performance1. IntroductionCementitious materials are one of the most used infrastructure materials worldwidedue to their low cost, well-developed production methods, and well adaptability to varyingenvironmental conditions. Cementitious composites are mainly divided into three groups,i.e., concrete, mortar and paste. Being quasi brittle, they are prone to cracking, whichgreatly compromises their strength and durability [ 1–3]. Due signiﬁcance has been givento mitigate the brittle behavior of cementitious composites in the past: Various studies areavailable, intended at improving the tensile strain capacity of the cementitious materials.Apart from conventional steel reinforcement, inclusion of ﬁbers has remained the focus ofmany studies [4–6].Fiber-reinforced cementitious materials consist of synthetic or natural materials. Theﬁbers are intended to provide resistance against cracking both in plastic and hardenedforms of composite materials. The synthetic ﬁbers comprise metals such as steel, aluminumor polymers such as polypropylene, polyester, nylon, acrylic, aramid, and carbon [ 7]. Thenatural ﬁbers include coir, jute, pineapple leaf, kenaf bast, bamboo, palm, hemp, sugarcanebagasse, etc. [ 8,9]. In the following paragraphs, a brief introduction to the application ofﬁbers in cementitious materials is presented.Eren et al. studied the effect of steel ﬁbers on the tensile strength of concrete [ 10].Their study revealed that steel ﬁbers with an aspect ratio of 80 and ﬁber content of 1.5% canCrystals 2021 ,11, 527. https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11050527 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/crystalsCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 2 of 22increase the tensile strength of the concrete by 111%. Tiberti et al. evaluated the capabilityof steel ﬁber reinforced concrete in controlling cracks and reducing crack spacing [ 11].They have reported that the crack spacing reduced by 30% with 0.5% ﬁber content and by37% with 1% ﬁber content. Paj ˛ ak et al. evaluated the ﬂexural behavior of self-compactingconcrete reinforced with straight and hooked-end steel ﬁbers (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% volumecontent) [ 12]. They have concluded that the fracture energy increased with the increasein ﬁber content and the fracture energy is always greater for hooked end ﬁbers at thesame dosage. Doo-Yeol et al. studied the tensile performance of ultra-high-performanceconcrete through straight and half-hooked steel ﬁbers [ 13]. They have reported that alesser quantity of hooked ﬁbers, compared to the straight ones, is required for the sametensile strength. Düzgün et al. studied the effect of steel ﬁbers on strength of lightweightpumice aggregate concrete [ 14]. They have reported that the reinforcement increases bothstrength and ductility up to 1.5% ﬁbers. Vandewalle studied the cracking behavior ofconcrete beams, reinforced with combined longitudinal steel rebars and steel ﬁbers [ 15].They have reported that the combined reinforcement reduces both the crack spacing andthe crack width.Alhozaimy et al. examined the mechanical properties of concrete reinforced withpolypropylene ﬁbers (below 0.3% ﬁber content) [ 16]. They have reported an increase of387% in ﬂexural toughness at 0.3% ﬁber content. Kakooei et al. studied concrete samplesreinforced with 0–2 kg/m3polypropylene ﬁbers. They have reported that reinforcementof 1.5 kg/m3gives optimum results vis àvis compressive strength of the concrete [ 1].Afroughsabet et al. evaluated the strength and durability of high strength concrete, re-inforced with steel and polypropylene ﬁbers [ 17]. Their resulting concrete at failure isshown in Figure 1. They have reported that 1% steel ﬁbers enhance the splitting tensileand ﬂexural strengths signiﬁcantly. They have also claimed the best performance with1% hybrid combination (0.85% steel and 0.15% polypropylene), with regard to mechanicalstrength, electrical resistivity and water absorption. Song et al. investigated the mechani-cal properties of concrete reinforced with nylon and polypropylene ﬁbers at a dosage of0.6 kg/m3[18]. They have reported that nylon-reinforced concrete had superior strength,and crack-resistant properties than the polypropylene reinforced one. They have attributedthe enhanced properties to higher tensile strength and better distribution of nylon ﬁbers inconcrete matrix than the polypropylene ﬁbers.Figure 1.

Elsevier.Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 3 of 22As far as the incorporation of natural ﬁbers is concerned, there are some problems, aspointed out by various researchers, which need to be addressed prior to their applicationfor reinforcement in cementitious composites: The natural ﬁbers have a degrading effectin alkaline cementitious environments, and their pretreatment is required prior to theutilization [ 19]. Bilba et al. studied the silane-treated bagasse ﬁbers in cementitiousmaterials, using two silane, alkyltrialkoxysilane and dialkyldialkoxysilane [ 20]. The SEMimages of the composites reinforced with bagasse ash ﬁbers with and without salinetreatment are shown in Figure 2. Their study revealed that saline treatment improves thewater resistance of the ﬁbers and make them hydrophobic. Andiç-Çakir et al. studied themechanical properties of coir ﬁber-reinforced cementitious mortars. Their study revealedthat the alkali-treated coir ﬁbers enhanced the compressive and ﬂexural characteristics ofthe mortars [ 21]. Khan et al. studied the effect of 5 cm long coconut ﬁbers on the strengthof concrete with a ﬁber content of 2% by mass of cement [ 22]. They have reported 15%silica fume, 2% coconut ﬁbers, and 1% super plasticizer as the optimum mix compositionfor enhancing the strength and cracking resistance of the mortars. Islam et al. evaluatedthe effect of jute ﬁbers on concrete properties [ 23]. Their study revealed that smaller ﬁbercontent (0.25% by mass of cement) had positive effect on the strength of the concrete.Figure 2. SEM images of composites: ( a) composite reinforced with bagasse ﬁber and ( b) composite reinforced with bagasseﬁber treated with silane, reprinted with permission from K. Bilba and M. Arsene. Elsevier.Many researchers have outlined the problems with natural ﬁbers, including theirbiodegradation in an alkaline environment, their non-uniform distribution, and ballingeffect at higher ﬁber doses [ 19]. Special techniques, such as silane treatment, can addressthe issues encountered with the use of natural ﬁbers as a crack-arresting medium incementitious composites. Apart from ﬁbers, another cost-effective method to enhancethe fracture energy and crack resistance of the cementitious composites is the use ofcarbonaceous inerts (biochar) obtained from pyrolysis [ 24]. The biochars are reportedto retain carbon from hundreds to thousands of years; thus, the synthesis and use ofbiochar are highly ecological, reducing the discharge of CO 2back to the atmosphere [ 25].This review paper intends to address the enhancement of crack resisting properties byusing carbonaceous inerts obtained from pyrolysis of different industrial, municipal, andagricultural wastes.2. Carbonaceous InertsCarbonaceous inerts are deﬁned as materials derived from organic and/or inorganicfeedstock that contain a high amount of carbon. They include coal, petroleum products,carbon black, tar, and many carbon-containing alloys. Pakistan is an agricultural countryCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 4 of 22and abundant quantities of agricultural waste are produced every year. If properly reﬁnedand treated, these wastes can be employed for many useful purposes [ 26–28]. As in manyother scientiﬁc ﬁelds, construction material technology has also beneﬁted from agriculturalwastes: These wastes have been extensively used as natural ﬁbers, as discussed in theintroduction section. Additionally, many studies have shown that if these wastes areburnt, their ashes can be used as cementing or pozzolanic materials for enhancing theproperties of the cementitious composites [ 29–31]. The microscopic images of the burntwheat straw ash, used by Biricik et al., are shown in Figure 3 [ 32]. However, it has beenindicated that the direct combustion of crop residues in agricultural ﬁelds is harmful tothe environment, owing to the emission of greenhouse gases [ 33,34]. Many researchershave suggested alternate ways for useful application of the agricultural wastes, whichinvolve the extraction of carbonaceous inerts via several techniques such as hydrogenation,fermentation, combustion, bioconversion, etc. [ 35,36] According to a number of otherresearchers, pyrolysis is the most effective technique for extracting useful carbonaceousinerts from agricultural wastes [37–39].Figure 3. SEM image of wheat straw ash burned at 570C (a) and at 670C (b), reprinted with permission from Biricik,Hasan Aköz, Fevziye Berktay, I.lhan Tulgar, and Ali N. Elsevier [32].3. PyrolysisPyrolysis is an endothermic process that involves the thermochemical decompositionof raw biomass in an inert environment at a high temperature and pressure [ 40]. Thisprocess produces various useful products such as solid biochar, liquid bio-oil, and fuelgases, as highlighted in Equation (1) below [41]:BiomassHeat!Biochar (s)+Bio oil (l)+Fuel gas (g) (1)Pyrolysis has the potential to transform environmentally hazardous wastes into stablevaluable products, which are less harmful to life and the environment [ 42]. Accordingto Ruan et al., one of the main advantages pyrolysis offers over other techniques is thatthe desired product (liquid, solid, or gas) can be produced by adjusting the operationalparameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, heating rate, and residence time [ 43]. It has alsobeen reported that biochar produced from slow pyrolysis having low heating ramp withlonger residence time exhibit a more homogeneous character than those produced byfast pyrolysis [ 44]. A typical pyrolysis process is shown in Figure 4 in the form of a ﬂowdiagram [ 45], whereas the general layout of the pyrolysis process is shown in Figure 5 [ 46].Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 5 of 22Figure 4. Flow diagram of pyrolysis.Figure 5. General layout of pyrolysis process.Pyrolysis is termed as slow or fast, depending on the heating ramps and the operatingtemperature: slow pyrolysis is characterized by low heating ramp (<100 K/min) and lowtemperature (~300C), whereas fast pyrolysis refers to that carried out at high heatingramp (>100 K/min) and higher operating temperature (~500C or more) [ 47]. Pyrolysis isreported to lack synergetic effects, and it has been indicated that the yield is proportionalto the percentage of biomasses in the feedstock [48].Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 6 of 223.1. Materials and Operating Conditions3.1.1. MaterialsBiochar is a lightweight black carbon residue, obtained after eliminating water andother volatile ingredients, mainly by pyrolysis. Various researchers have used numerousfeedstock for producing biochar: They can be agricultural waste such as wheat, rice, andsugarcane or forest residues such as water hyacinth, beech trunk, hemp hurd, sawdust,etc. In the following paragraph, different raw materials used for producing biochar bypyrolysis are described.Carnaje et al. prepared biochar briquettes from water hyacinth [ 49]. Their biocharis shown in Figure 6 (microscopic images). They have reported that at a temperature of425C, the yield of water hyacinth biochar was 55%. Aburas et al. used oriental beech(Fagus orientalis L.) for the synthesis of biochar by pyrolysis at temperatures of 493,523 and593 K [ 50]. They have reported a high yield of carbon-rich biochar at lower temperatures.Taralas et al. carried out steam pyrolysis of olive husk, having a particle size between0.34 mm and 0.5 mm [ 51]. They have reported a yield of 29–40% at a temperature of 900 K.Gupta et al. carried out pyrolysis of untreated and phosphoric acid-treated corncob attemperatures ranging from 400 to 600C at a constant heating rate of 16C/min in aquartz reactor [ 52]. They have reported that the biochar yield decreases with the increase intemperature; however, pretreatment increases the yield. Akgül et al. carried out pyrolysisof tea waste at temperatures of 300–400C [53]. They have reported that the carbonizationand aromaticity of biochar improve with the increase in pyrolysis temperature.Figure 6. SEM images: ( a) water hyacinth charcoal and ( b) water hyacinth briquette, reprinted with permission fromCarnaje, Naomi P . Talagon, Romel B. Peralta, Jose P . Shah, Kalpit Paz-Ferreiro, and Jorge. Elsevier [49].Uçar et al. conducted pyrolysis of pomegranate seeds at temperatures, rangingfrom 400C to 800C [54]. They have claimed that the biochar contains high carboncontent, having high bulk density and caloriﬁc value. Tay et al. prepared biochar fromthe pyrolysis of chemically activated soybean oil cake with K 2CO 3and KO at 600C and800C [55]. They have reported a high yield of biochar with K 2CO 3, having a surfacearea of 1353 m2/g at 800C. Solar et al. carried out pyrolysis of woody waste (Pinusradiata) at a temperature range of 500–900C [56]. They have reported a high yield ofbiochar at a lower temperature. They have also emphasized that the yield decreaseswith the increase in temperature. Shaﬁque Ullah et al. pyrolyzed rice husk (having aparticle size of 0.5–7 mm ) [57]. They obtained a 35% yield of biochar at 480C. Suman et al.pyrolyzed coconut husk for producing biochar at temperatures ranging from 400C to1000C [58]. They have reported a decrease in yield and increase in aromaticity with theincrease in temperature. Georgin et al. prepared biochar by conventional and microwaveirradiation pyrolysis of peanut shells [ 59]. They have claimed that microwave irradiationfollowed by pyrolysis produces biochar with enhanced adsorption characteristics. IqbalCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 7 of 22et al. carried out pyrolysis of chickpeas waste and peanut shells for biochar production,using a temperature range from 350C to 600C [60]. They have a reported biochar yieldof 28% and 46%, using chickpeas waste and peanut shells, respectively, at 350C with aheating rate of 15C per minute. They have further described that the yield decreases withthe increase in temperature. Jagdale et al. prepared biochar from waste coffee at 700C forone hour in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature range from 250C to 400C, using aheating rate of 5C/min [ 61]. They have reported a yield of 18%, with the biochar havinghigh porosity and an average diameter of pores of about 7 m. Pottmaier et al. comparedtwo waste materials—rice husk and wheat straw—for producing biochar, using slow andfast pyrolysis [ 44]. Their biochar is shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, whereas theraw form of the materials is shown in Figure 9. They have reported 19.4% yield for ricehusk and 25.4% yield for wheat straw at 900C. They have further emphasized that theyield decreases with the increase in pyrolysis temperature. Yang et al. pyrolyzed sawdustfor producing biochar, using temperatures from 250 to 950C [62]. They have reportedthat biochar with the highest caloriﬁc value can be produced using temperatures in therange of 450 to 650C. Cao et al. investigated the physical and mechanical propertiesof biochar, prepared from sawdust, cotton stalk, and their blend at a temperature rangeof 400–600C [63]. They have reported that the density and compressive strength of thebiochar briquettes ﬁrst decreased and then increased with the increase in temperature. Theyhave further elaborated that the cotton stalk biochar briquettes have superior propertiesthan those of sawdust and the blend showed poorer characteristics than those of cottonstalk and sawdust. Liu et al. studied the pyrolysis of hemp hurd and retted hemp hurd,without and with the treatment of ZnCl 2at a temperature of 800C, using a heating rateof 10C/min [ 64]. They have revealed that untreated hemp hurd and retted hemp hurdproduced a yield of 20.7 and 20.2%, respectively. They have further elaborated that theZnCl 2activation enhanced the yield to 30.3 and 28.6%, respectively, for untreated hemphurd and retted hemp hurd. Guo et al. produced Nano biochar using soybean and cattlemanure at 500C in a hydrothermal reactor [ 65]. The SEM images of their biochar havinghighly porous structure are shown in Figure 10, whereas the TEM images are shown inFigure 11. The TEM images reveal carbon nanodots of sizes 2–10 nm (8.5–10% overallnano content).Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 8 of 22Figure 7.

TEM images of soybean ( a,b) and cattle manure ( c,d), showing nanodots [ 65] (open access).Choice of material for biochar is signiﬁcant: According to Zanzi et al., the agriculturalresidues, having high ash and lignin (wood content of plants) contents favor biocharproduction and enhance its yield [66].3.1.2. Particle SizeMany àet al. studied the effect of particle size on the pyrolysis of vine shoots [ 67]. Theyhave reported that larger feedstock particles, to a lesser extent and at higher temperatures,lead to more stable biochar products. Sundaram et al. studied the pyrolysis of coconutshells, with particle size ranging from 1.18 to 1.80 mm [ 68]. They have reported an increasein biochar yield with the increase in particle size. Zanzi et al. studied the fast pyrolysisof olive waste, straw, and birch (hardwood) at temperatures 800–1000C, using particlesizes from 0.5 to 0.8 mm and from 0.8 to 1.0 mm [ 66]. They have reported an increase inbiochar yield with the increase in particle size. Luo et al. studied the effect of particle size(0–5 mm, 5–10 mm, and 10–20 mm) on pyrolysis of municipal solid waste, using 800Ctemperature [ 69]. They have reported that smaller particle size resulted in higher syngasyield with less biochar. The gas yield and weight percentages of char for plastic, wood, andkitchen garbage as a function of particle size are shown in Figure 12. They have furtherelaborated that smaller size also leads to the lesser carbon content in biochar.Figure 12. Gas yield of plastic, wood, and kitchen garbage as a function of particle size ( a) and weight percentages of charand tar as a function of particle size ( b), reprinted with permission from S. Luo, B. Xiao, Z. Hu, and S. Liu. Elsevier [69].Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 11 of 22According to Sundaram et al. and Zanzi et al. [ 66,68], the larger particles induce ahigher temperature gradient inside them, and therefore, the core temperature is lower thanthat at the surface, which leads to an increase in solid and decrease in syngas contents.3.2. Operating Conditions3.2.1. TemperatureThe temperature has the most signiﬁcant effect on the outcomes of a pyrolysis process,as pointed out by numerous researchers. Demirbas has described that the solid (biochar)content decreases, while the carbon content of biochar and the liquid (bio-oil) contentincrease with the increase in temperature [ 70]. He has mentioned that the highest liquidyield can be obtained within the range of 650 to 800 K. Zhang et al., while studying thepyrolysis of wheat straw and lignosulfonate, have mentioned that while carbon contentincreased, the yield of biochar decreased with the increase in temperature [ 71]. Theyhave further stated that highly porous and aromatic biochar can be produced at highertemperatures. Williams et al. investigated the effect of temperature (up to 720C) onpyrolysis of scrap tires [ 72]. They have reported that the solid biochar content decreased,while the liquid and gas contents increased up to 600C. From the feedstock, they produced35% solid biochar, 55% bio-oil, and 10% syngas. Hernandez-Mena et al. studied pyrolysisof bamboo at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600C. They have a reported a biocharyield of 80% at 300C, as compared to 30% at 600C [73]. Mimmo et al. studied theeffect of temperature on miscanthus (perennial grass with bamboo-like stems) biochar attemperatures between 350 and 450C [74]. They have highlighted that higher temperaturesresult in more stable biochar materials. Kloss et al. carried out slow pyrolysis of wheatstraw and woodchips in the temperature range of 400–525C [75]. They have reported thatthe surface area of biochar particles increased with the increase in temperature. Sun et al.studied the effect of temperature on the outcome of pyrolysis [ 76]. Their reported effect oftemperature is shown in Figure 13. They have indicated that lower temperatures increasedthe yield, while higher temperatures increased the carbon content and produced thermallystable products.Figure 13. Production of different biochar samples, HHW, HW300, HW450, HW600, HBG, BG300,BG450, BG600, HBB, BB300, BB450, and BB600 are hydrochars and/or biochars produced fromhickory wood (HW), bagasse (BG), and bamboo (BB) feedstocks under different temperatures (300C,450C, and 600C), respectively, reprinted with permission from Y. Sun, B. Gao, Y. Yao, J. Fang, M.Zhang, Y. Zhou, H. Chen, L. Yang Elsevier [76].Ahmad et al. studied the characteristics of biochar produced from soybean stover andpeanut shells at 300C and 700C [33]. They have mentioned that the higher temperatureenhanced the surface area and aromaticity of biochar. Li et al. studied the effect of tem-perature on pyrolysis of oil distillation residue by ﬁxing three temperatures 400, 600, andCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 12 of 22800C [77]. Their study revealed that higher temperatures lead to higher carbon content,surface area, and pore volume. Zhao et al. studied the effect of temperature (200–700Cin 50C increment), heating ramp, and residence time on pyrolysis of rapeseed stem [ 34].They have declared temperature as the most effective parameter, inﬂuencing the biocharproperties. According to Zhao et al., higher temperatures increase the carbon content,surface area, and aromaticity and decrease the yield and pore size. Angın investigated theeffect of temperature on pyrolysis of safﬂower seed press cake [ 78]. He is also of the viewthat temperature has a more pronounced effect than the heating rate. He has describedthat higher temperatures (~600C) lead to higher carbon content (80.7%) and aromaticity,and lower surface area. Devi et al. studied the effect of temperature (500–700C) onpyrolysis of paper mill sludge [ 79]. They have reported reduced yield, enhanced surfacearea, and higher alkalinity with the increase in temperature. Yuan et al. investigated theeffect of temperature on pyrolysis of medicinal herb (Radix isatidis) residue over a rangeof 300–700C [80]. They have concluded that higher temperatures lead to higher carboncontent, aromaticity, alkalinity, surface area, and porosity. Fu et al. investigated the effectof temperature (600–1000C) on pyrolysis of rice straw [ 81]. They have reported a 16%reduction in biochar yield from 600 to 1000C, with maximum porosity and surface area at900C. Gupta et al. carried out pyrolysis of untreated and phosphoric acid-treated corncob,at temperatures ranging from 400 to 600C at a constant heating rate of 16C/min in aquartz reactor [ 64]. They have reported that the biochar yield decreases with increase intemperature; however, pretreatment increases the yield. Effect of (a) temperature and (b)pretreatment on % yield of biochar from corncob at different temperature and pretreatmentratio are shown in Figure 14.Figure 14. Effects of ( a) temperature and ( b) pretreatment on % yield of biochar from corncob at different temperature andpretreatment ratio, reprinted with permission from G.K Gupta, M. Ram, R. Bala, M. Kapur, and M.K. Mandol. Elsevier [ 52].Based on the studies, intended to evaluate the effect of pyrolysis temperature on theproduction of biochar, it is concluded that regardless of material (1) temperature is the mostinﬂuential parameter, controlling pyrolysis; (2) higher temperatures decrease the yield ofbiochar; (3) higher temperatures enhance the carbon content; and (4) higher temperatures(600C and above) signiﬁcantly enhance porosity, pore volume, aromaticity, and alkalinity.3.2.2. Heating RateHaykiri-Acma et al. studied the pyrolysis of rapeseed, using heating ramps of 5, 10, 20,30, 40, and 50 K/min [ 82]. They have reported higher rates of mass loss at higher heatingramps. Cetin et al. investigated the effect of heating ramps on the pyrolysis of radiata pine(softwood) [ 83]. They have described that higher heating ramps resulted in the meltingof the particles and imparted smoother surfaces and induced large cavities. Chen et al.studied the effects of heating rates of 5, 10, 20, and 30C/min on characteristics of theproducts using moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) [ 84]. They have reported that higherCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 13 of 22rates lead to lower liquid and solid contents and enhance the speciﬁc area of the biochar.Williams et al. investigated the effect of heating rates (5–80C/min) on pyrolysis of scraptires [ 72]. They have reported enhancement of surface area with the increase in heating rate.Fu et al. have reported increase in pore size and surface area of biochar with the increase inheating rate, while pyrolyzing rice straw from 600 to 1000C temperature [ 81]. ¸ Sensöz et al.studied the pyrolysis of pine chips (Pinus brutia) using temperatures (300–550C) andheating rate of 7 and 40C/min [ 85]. They produced the highest yield of 36% of biochar ata temperature of 300C with a 7C/min heating rate. They have described that an increasein heating rate decreases biochar yield at a particular temperature. Mani et al. investigatedthe effect of heating rate varying from 5 to 20C/min on the pyrolysis of wheat straw [ 86].They have reported an increase in biochar yield with increase in heating rate.The previous studies show that heating rate has both positive and negative effects onthe production of biochar via pyrolysis. According to Mani et al., at lower heating rates,most of the materials show effective heat transfer, leading to more efﬁcient cracking andmore weight loss in the form of volatiles. This leads to an increase in biochar yield with anincrease in heating rate [86].3.2.3. PressureCetin et al., while pyrolyzing radiata pine, have indicated that the pressure inﬂuencesthe size and the shape of the biochar particles [ 83]. Mok et al. studied the inﬂuenceof pressure on pyrolysis [ 87]. They have reported that biochar yield increases with theincrease in pressure. Newalkar et al. studied the effect of pressure (5–20 bar) on thepyrolysis of pine at 800C [88]. They have reported that pressure affects the physicaland chemical properties of biochar. Yun et al. studied the pyrolysis of coal using steamunder high pressure [ 89]. They have mentioned that the reaction rate decreases withthe increase in pressure. Basile et al . studied the effect of pressure on the pyrolysis ofLignocellulose (plant dry matter) [ 90]. They have reported that an increase in pressurereduces the heating needs for pyrolysis. Waghmare et al. studied the effect of pressure (4, 7,and 10 bars) on the pyrolysis of rice husk and sawdust [ 91]. They have reported an increasein biochar yield from 4 to 7 bar pressure and an overall increase in liquid oil yield with theincrease in pressure at the same temperature. Noumi et al. studied the effect of pressureon pyrolysis of Acacia wood (hardwood, native in Australia) in the range of 1–6 bar [ 92].They have reported increased biochar yield and reactivity with the increase in pressure.They have further reported an optimum temperature of 617C and optimum pressure of6 bar for biochar yield. Many àet al. studied the effect of pressure on the pyrolysis of vineshoots [ 67]. They have reported that an increase in pressure decreases the tar content insyngas. Baiqing et al. studied the effect of pressure on pyrolysis of pine sawdust usingpressures (0–50 bar) [93]. They have reported that high pressures promoted more yield ofbiochar by secondary cracking of oil. They have also indicated that high pressure enhancesthe structures and compactness of the biochar.According to Basile et al., the enhanced pressure increases the retention time of thevolatiles; the volatiles react further with the pyrolysis products, making secondary biochar.The secondary reactions are of exothermic nature and thus decrease the heating demand ofpyrolysis and enrich secondary products with additional carbon content. Additionally, theoverall yield of biochar increases with the increase in pressure [90].3.2.4. Residence TimeThe effect of residence time on the characteristics of biochar is often neglected; how-ever, some researchers have highlighted that this parameter is not insigniﬁcant. Zhao et al .,while studying the pyrolysis of rapeseed stem, have pointed out that an increase in resi-dence time enhances the surface area and morphology of the biochar [ 34]. Cao et al. studiedthe combined effect of residence time (1 and 60 min) and temperature (200–700C) on thepyrolysis of cornstalk, rice husk, peanut husk, and tobacco stalk [ 94]. They have reporteddecreased yield, enhanced pH, and carbon content of the biochar products at higher tem-Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 14 of 22peratures and larger residence time. Sun et al. studied the synergetic effect of residencetime (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h) and temperature (300, 400, 500, and 600C) on the pyrolysis ofdifferent raw materials [ 95]. They have reported that at a lower temperature (300C), thebiochar yield decreased, while its pH increased with the increase in residence time. Theyhave further emphasized that at a higher temperature, residence time had negligible effectson the yield and pH of biochar. Hasan et al. studied the effect of residence time (30–75 min)on the characteristics of palm kernel shell biochar [ 96]. They have reported that the yielddecreased and the pH of the biochar increased with the increase in residence time.From the above paragraphs, it is concluded that lower temperatures (<400C), slowerheating rates, shorter residence times, larger particles, and higher pressures enhancethe yield, while higher temperatures, longer residence times, slow heating ramps, andhigh pressures lead to stable and aromatic biochars. According to Rasul et al., differentreactions take place at different temperatures, and at high temperatures, the liquid andsolid molecules break down enriching the gas phase [97].3.3. MethodsAccording to Simmons et al., several methods of biomass pyrolysis have been de-veloped by researchers and industrial experts [ 86]. They include basic or conventionalpyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and thermal plasma pyrolysis. Conventionalpyrolysis is carried out at low temperatures and low heating ramps and therefore favorsa high yield of biochar. Fast pyrolysis is characterized by high temperature and heatingrate, short vapor residence time, and rapid cooling of vapors; all favor a high yield of bio-oil [98]. According to Pattiya, fast pyrolysis liqueﬁes solid biomass into liquid bio-oil [99].Dhyani et al . have stated that a required amount of bio-oil can be extracted in fast pyrol-ysis, by controlling operating conditions, and most importantly, by quick condensationand by limiting the vapors’ residence time to less than 2 s [ 100]. According to Jourabchiet al., rapid heating fast pyrolysis reduces bio-oil yield but enhances its caloriﬁc valueand water content [ 101]. Catalytic pyrolysis takes place in the presence of a catalyst. Thecatalyst is intended to lower the reaction temperature and time. This makes the process costeffective. According to Cleetus et al., the most commonly applied catalysts for pyrolyzingplastic waste are silica, alumina, and zeolites [ 102]. However, some concerns have alsobeen shown as regards performance deterioration of the catalyst with time during thepyrolysis, necessitating consideration of its lifetime and regeneration for its cost-effectiveuse [ 103]. Plasma, considered to be the fourth type of matter, is produced when the atomsof a gas ionize, or more simply, it is a hot ionized gas. In thermal plasma pyrolysis, thefeedstock is inserted into a plasma: This consequently heats up the raw material veryrapidly. High temperature and heating rate quickly destroy the waste, producing gas andsolid residue [104].4. Use of Biochar in the Cement and ConcreteThe use of biochar for enhancing soil fertility and sequestration of carbon is not anew topic [ 105–108]. However, its use for enhancing concrete properties is quite new. Itis expected that the use of biochar in building materials might reduce as much as 25%emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere [ 109]. The use of biochar is summarizedin Figure 15 and described in what follows.Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 15 of 22Figure 15. Beneﬁts of biochars for cementitious composites.Khushnood et al. studied the effect of biochar obtained by pyrolysis of peanut andhazelnut shells on the properties of cement paste [ 110]. They have reported that theaddition of biochar by 1% mass of cement increases the ﬂexural strength and toughness ofthe paste. Resheidat et al. added biochar powder at the rate of 2.5–10% by mass of cementin a concrete specimen, using accelerated curing and heat treatment [ 111]. They havereported a lightweight concrete with uniform porosity and a considerable saving in theoverall cost of the material. Mrad et al. studied the effect of partial replacement (5–45%) ofsand by biochar, obtained by pyrolysis of municipal solid waste in preparing cementitiousmortars [ 112]. They have reported that the porous structure of biochar particles absorbswater, which is available for internal curing of the material. They have further reportedthat the absorption of water from micro pores leads to the densiﬁcation of ITZ aroundbiochar particles. Gupta et al. used biochar, prepared from pyrolysis of sawdust at 300C,as additive in cementitious mortars at the rate of 2% by mass of cement [ 109]. Theyhave reported that the reinforcement enhances early compressive strength and impartsductility, density, and imperviousness to the specimens. Restuccia et al. investigated theuse of biochar, obtained by pyrolysis of hazelnut shells as an additive in mortars [ 24]. Forpyrolysis, 3 g of feedstock was inserted, employing a heating rate of 6C/min, with a ﬁnaltemperature at 800C. The ﬁne char particles ranging from a few nanometers to 10 m wereadded to mortar at a rate of 0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0% by mass of cement. They have reportedthe highest ﬂexural strength and the best post-cracking behavior with 0.8% carbonaceousmaterials. Choi et al. investigated the use of biochar (hardwood) obtained by slow pyrolysisprocess, as replacement of cement (5% by mass of cement) in mortars and concrete [ 25].They have reported reduced evaporation of water and concrete compressive strength withCrystals 2021 ,11, 527 16 of 22the increase in biochar content. The reduced water evaporation was attributed to thewater-retention capability of biochar, whereas reduced compressive strength was creditedto lower workability and difﬁculty in compaction. Cuthbertson et al. investigated the useof biochar, obtained from pyrolysis of dry distillers grains from the bioethanol industry, asﬁller in concrete [ 113]. They have reported enhanced sound absorption, reduced thermalconductivity, material density, and compressive strength. The obtained results have beenattributed to the porous structure of the biochar. Wang et al. investigated the effect ofbamboo biochar on the characteristics of cementitious composites [ 114]. They have reportedreduced strength, increased porosity, and pore volume. The strength decreases with theincrease in biochar content and particle size. Cosentino et al. studied the effect of nanosoftwood biochar, obtained by pyrolysis at a peak temperature of 700C and added atthe rate of 0.8 and 1% by mass of cement on the characteristics of cement paste [ 115].They have reported enhancement in ﬂexural strength, fracture energy, toughness, andductility. They have further emphasized that the effect of biochar on the properties ofcementitious composites is linked to the nature and particle size of the feedstock andoperating conditions of the pyrolysis. Cheng studied the effect of partial replacementof sand by biochar obtained from pyrolysis of timber on the properties of cementitiousmortars with ﬁxed ﬂow ability by adjusting water content [ 116]. They have reported anexponential decrease in strength with increase in biochar content. Cuthbertson studied theinﬂuence of three biochar (woodchips, Miscanthus, and distiller grains) particles (passingthrough 840 m sieve) on the properties of concrete [ 117]. He has reported that the concretedensity decreases from 2200 to 1450 kg/m3at 15% biochar content (by mass of concrete),the water requirements increase linearly with the increase in biochar content for a ﬁxedworkability, sound absorption and heat insulation increase, and compressive strengthapparently remained unchanged with the increase in biochar content.Biochar is a highly porous material, which leads to the reduction of workability;nevertheless, the adsorbed water is not chemically bound and is released during hydrationreactions. This makes the biochar an internal curing agent that assists in developing themicropores and pore structure of the parent materials. Additionally, biochar decreaseswater evaporation, which is the cause of plastic and drying shrinkages in cementitiousmaterials [ 25,112]. Gupta et al. studied the inﬂuence of sawdust charcoal, prepared at 300and 500C, on the characteristics of cementitious mortars [ 118]. They have reported anenhanced early compressive strength (1–2% addition), enhanced water tightness, and noeffect on ﬂexural strength and drying shrinkage.Carbonaceous inerts are also useful for enhancing the cracking resistance, toughness,and energy-absorbing capacity of cementitious materials. As indicated in the introductionpart of this review, polypropylene (PP) ﬁbers are added to cementing materials for manybeneﬁts; however, it has been pointed out that the smooth surface of PP ﬁbers hindersthe formation of bonds with the surrounding cement matrix [ 119]. Additionally, thehydrophobic surface of ﬁbers leads to the formation of a thin water layer on PP ﬁbers,which weakens its ITZ, known as the wall effect [ 120]. Gupta et al. studied the effectof sawdust biochar prepared at 300C, as coating material of PP ﬁbers in cementitiousmortars [ 121]. They have reported reduced workability, enhanced strength, post-crackingductility, and impermeability.According to Gupta et al., due to high water-absorbing capacity, biochars hold asigniﬁcant amount of water during the mixing phase of cementitious composites, whichadversely affects the ﬂowability [ 121]. According to Ghani et al., biochars are hydrophilic innature and thus have the capacity to absorb water in the early stages of hardening. This, inturn, hinders the formation of capillary pores, enhancing the density and early compressivestrength [ 122]. The reduced plastic shrinkage can also be addressed by using biochars,owing to their hydrophilic properties. Another potential advantage with these particlesmight be the reduction of bleeding as pointed out by Elyamany et al. while working on theuse of nonpozzolanic ﬁllers in self-compacting concrete [123].Crystals 2021 ,11, 527 17 of 225. ConclusionsBiochar is a versatile material having a high potential for utilization in various ﬁelds.In the current paper, a brief summary of the literature has been reported on the subjectwith emphasis on the pyrolysis mechanism, the inﬂuence of operating conditions on theﬁnal products, and its potential application in the production of high-performance cementand concrete composites.It is concluded that biochar may be produced from almost all types of feedstock;however, the characteristics of the ﬁnal product strictly depend upon the constituentsof the feedstock and operating conditions. On the basis of numerous research studies,it is concluded that slow pyrolysis up to 300C produces the optimum yield since thistemperature is sufﬁcient to decompose the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin effectively.The operating pressure plays an important role by increasing the biochar yield with lesserenergy requirements at higher pressures.The useful application of biochar in cementitious composites has been highlightedby various researchers and is presented in Figure 15. In cement and concrete composites,biochar produces a positive effect by increasing the strength due to the internal curingmechanism and pore reﬁnement effect. The introduction of biochar also tends to enhancethe fracture energy and tensile load carrying capacity due to the phenomenon of crackentrapment, crack bridging, and crack contouring.However, almost all researchers have reported that the workability/ﬂowability re-duces with the incorporation of biochar in the cementitious composites, which can beovercome by using ﬂow-enhancing admixtures. Nevertheless, the reinforcement of cemen-titious composites with biochar is an effective method of carbon sequestration, which isbeneﬁcial to human health and the environment.Funding: This research was funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Government ofPakistan, grant number 7984.
