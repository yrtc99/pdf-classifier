ORIGINAL ARTICLEOrganic carbon transformations in high-Arctic peatsoils: key functions and microorganismsAlexander Tveit1, Rainer Schwacke1, Mette M Svenning1and Tim Urich21Department of Arctic and Marine Biology, University of Tromsø, Tromsø, Norway and2Departmentof Genetics in Ecology, University of Vienna, Vienna, AustriaA substantial part of the Earths’ soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in Arctic permafrost peatlands,which represent large potential sources for increased emissions of the greenhouse gases CH 4andCO 2in a warming climate. The microbial communities and their genetic repertoire involved in thebreakdown and mineralisation of SOC in these soils are, however, poorly understood. In this study,we applied a combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach on two Arctic peat soils toinvestigate the identity and the gene pool of the microbiota driving the SOC degradation in theseasonally thawed active layers. A large and diverse set of genes encoding plant polymer-degradingenzymes was found, comparable to microbiotas from temperate and subtropical soils. This indicatesthat the metabolic potential for SOC degradation in Arctic peat is not different from that of otherclimatic zones. The majority of these genes were assigned to three bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria,Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. Anaerobic metabolic pathways and the fraction of methano-genic archaea increased with peat depth, evident for a gradual transition from aerobic to anaerobiclifestyles. A population of CH4-oxidising bacteria closely related to Methylobacter tundripaludumwas the dominating active group of methanotrophs. Based on the in-depth characterisation of themicrobes and their genes, we conclude that these Arctic peat soils will turn into CO2sources owingto increased active layer depth and prolonged growing season. However, the extent of future CH 4emissions will critically depend on the response of the methanotrophic bacteria.The ISME Journal (2013) 7,299–311; doi:10.1038/ismej.2012.99; published online 6 September 2012Subject Category:integrated genomics and post-genomics approaches in microbial ecologyKeywords: microbial communities; metagenomics; metatranscriptomics; Arctic peat soils; soil organiccarbon; methaneIntroductionRecent estimates point out that 277 Pg of soil organiccarbon (SOC) are stored in Arctic peatlands(Tarnocai et al. , 2009), which corresponds to 1/3 ofthe CO 2in the atmosphere. These peat soils haveacted as carbon sinks since the Holocene (Post et al. ,1982; Harden et al. , 1992). In contrast, they aresubstantial sources of methane (CH 4), releasingB35 Tg per year, B6% of the global CH 4emissions(Cao et al. , 1996). CH 4is a more potent greenhousegas than carbon dioxide (CO 2), having 25 times theglobal warming potential of CO 2on a 100-yeartimescale (Forster et al. , 2007). Arctic and especiallyhigh-Arctic regions are already exposed to, andpredicted to experience, a strong temperatureincrease until the end of the century (4–8 1C higherannual surface air temperatures) (IPCC, 2007),which is expected to lead to expanded frost-freevegetation periods and increased active layer depthsin permafrost soils (Tarnocai et al. , 2009).The major factors in SOC degradation in peat-lands, like in mineral soils, are microorganisms ofthe bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic (fungi)domains of life, participating in a cascade of aerobicand anaerobic degradation steps, eventually result-ing in the emission of CH4and CO 2. Major parts ofthe peat carbon are plant polymers such as celluloseand hemicellulose. The degradation of these tooligomeric and monomeric sugars is consideredone of the most important steps in anaerobicdegradation of SOC (Kotsyurbenko, 2005) and iscatalysed by a diverse set of hydrolytic extracellularenzymes produced by microorganisms. Furthersteps in the anaerobic degradation are carried outthrough anaerobic respiration (like denitrification),fermentative and methanogenic pathways, whilemicrobial methane oxidation constitutes the biolo-gical filter for methane emissions from peat. Phe-nolic substances accumulate to high concentrationsin the anaerobic, water-logged layers of peat soils,partly owing to low activity of phenol oxidases,Correspondence: MM Svenning, Department of Arctic and MarineBiology, University of Tromsø, Tromsø, 9037, Norway.E-mail: mette.svenning@uit.noor T Urich, Department of Genetics in Ecology, University ofVienna, Althanstrasse 14, Vienna 1090, Austria.E-mail: tim.urich@univie.ac.atReceived 29 March 2012; revised 16 July 2012; accepted 16 July2012; published online 6 September 2012The ISME Journal (2013) 7, 299–311&2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/13www.nature.com/ismejwhich require oxygen for function. The inhibitingeffect of phenolic substances has been suggested as amajor factor for the low SOC degradation rates inpeat soils (Fenner and Freeman, 2011).Several studies have targeted the microorganismsinvolved in CH4formation (for example, Ganzertet al. , 2007; Kotsyurbenko et al., 2007; Metje andFrenzel, 2007; Høj et al., 2008) and oxidation (forexample, Wartiainen et al., 2003; Liebner et al.,2009; Martineau et al. , 2010; Graef et al. , 2011) inArctic soils. Broader studies have also been con-ducted, for example, on the biogeography of soilbacterial communities in different climatic zones(Chu et al. , 2010), the dynamics of Arctic soil micro-bial communities in relation to the composition ofplant communities (Zak and Kling, 2006) and theavailability of SOC (Waldrop et al. , 2010 and Coolenet al. , 2011). In recent years, metagenomics andmetatranscriptomics have developed into powerfultools in microbial ecology that enable non-targetedstudies of the genetic potential, gene expression andthe composition of soil microbial communities (forexample, Tringe et al. , 2005 and Urich et al. , 2008).Until now only two metagenomic studies on Arcticsoils have been conducted, comparing the commu-nity in the permafrost with its overlaying activelayer (Yergeau et al. , 2010) and investigating theresponse of a permafrost microbial community tothaw (Mackelprang et al. , 2011).It is in the active layers, where the SOC degrada-tion in Arctic peat soils occurs, that more knowledgeabout the processes and organisms involved isrequired to understand these and to predict themagnitude of CH4and CO 2emissions from Arcticpeat in a warmer climate. We have in this studyapplied, for the first time, a combined metagenomicand metatranscriptomic approach on high-Arcticpeat soils to obtain on-site information about thegenomic potential for SOC transformation and toidentify the active microorganisms driving theseprocesses. We compared the Arctic peat metagenomeswith metagenomes from temperate soils and proposeda model of SOC degradation in Arctic peat, includinganaerobic respiratory and fermentative pathways, andmethanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms.The data allow some predictions about future CH4and CO 2emissions from Arctic peat soils.Materials and methodsStudy sites and samplingWe have investigated the active layers of two high-Arctic fens on Svalbard (Norway). Solvatn(N78 155.550 E11 156.611) and Knudsenheia (N78 156.544 E11 149.055) were sampled in August 2009 atthe peak of the growing season (SupplementaryFigure S1 and S2). Both sites are located in thevicinity of the research settlement Ny-A ˚lesund.Solvatn is situated on a marine terrace right nextto the settlement, while Knudsenheia is locatedB5 km northwest of Ny-A ˚lesund. For both sites,Knudsenheia and Solvatn, two biological replicateswere prepared. Three peat blocks (20 /C230/C220 cm)were cut from each of the replicate sites, S1 and S2(Solvatn) and K1 and K2 (Knudsenheia; seeSupplementary Figures S1–S3), and transported tothe laboratory within 2 h after sampling. The activelayer depths was B40 cm at both sites. The peatblocks were subsequently stored for 2–3 h at 4 1Cuntil further processing. The three blocks wereseparated into upper (more oxic) and lower (moreanoxic) layers, and the corresponding layers, withineach replicate site, were pooled to account forheterogeneity of each replicate site (SupplementaryFigure S3). The layer separation was based on visualdistinction of the layers based on its colour andstructure. The lower layers were processed undernitrogen atmosphere to avoid extensive oxygencontamination. After pooling, samples were imme-diately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. The wholeprocedure took B5–10 min. Soil pH was measuredusing the KCl extraction method on fresh peatsamples. Water content was estimated by dryingpeat over night at 120 1C and reweighing thesamples. To estimate organic matter contents, thedried samples were combusted at 450 1C overnight.The samples were reweighed, and the ash weightwas calculated and added to the weight of organicmatter. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids andethanol were determined by high pressure liquidchromatography analysis of pore water (Metje andFrenzel, 2005) extracted from soil samples beforefreezing. Results were integrated using peak simpleversion 393, and 1 mMstandards.Nucleic acids extraction, reverse transcription and 454sequencingFrom each layer of the biological duplicates(Supplementary Figure S3), six or more parallelextractions of nucleic acids were performed using amodified version of the Griffith’s protocol (Urichet al. , 2008). In samples for metatranscriptomicanalysis, DNA was digested using the RQ1 DNasetreatment (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), followed byRNA purification using the MEGAclear kit (Ambion,Austin, TX, USA). Samples were subjected to reversetranscription using the Superscript II double-strandcomplementary DNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol,with the exception that both first- and second-strandsynthesis was carried out for 4 h. RNA templateaddition was in the range of 500–1000 ng.Concentrations of double-stranded complementaryDNA were estimated by SYBR Green I (Invitrogen)assay (Leininger et al. , 2006). Nucleic acids formetagenomic analysis were subjected to RNase Atreatment for 20 min at 37 1C, followed by phenol:-chloroform:isoamylalcohol e xtraction and chloroform:isoamylalcohol extraction. DNA concentrationswere estimated using a NanoDrop spectrophot-ometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI,USA). Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencingMicrobes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al300The ISME Journal(454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA) was carriedout at the CEES at the University of Oslo.Bioinformatic analysisMetatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequenceswere first filtered using LUCY (Chou and Holmes,2001), removing short ( o150 bp) and low-qualitysequences ( 40.2% error probability). Metatranscrip-tomic sequences stemming from ribosomal RNA(rRNA) and putative messenger RNAs (mRNAs)were separated by comparing all sequences againsta combined database of small and large subunits ofrRNA (SSU and LSU rRNA) using BLASTN(Altschul et al. , 1997) and MEGAN (Huson et al. ,2007; Urich et al. , 2008). Sequences with a bit scoreo50 were assigned as putative mRNA tags. Metage-nomic and putative mRNA tags in the metatran-scriptomes were subjected to the 454 Replicate filter(Gomez-Alvarez et al. , 2009) for the removal ofartificially replicated sequences. The filter wasapplied to remove exact duplicate sequences fromthe metatranscriptomes (settings: sequence identitycutoff: 1.0, length difference requirement: 1.0 andnumber of beginning base pairs to check: 3). For themetagenomes, the default settings were applied.SSU ribo-tags were taxonomically assigned byMEGAN analysis of a BLASTN file against a SSUrRNA reference database (parameters: min. bit score150, min. support 1, top percent 10; 50 best blasthits) (Urich et al. , 2008; Lanzen et al. , 2011). SSUribo-tags assigned to the order Methylococcales wereassembled into ribo-contigs using CAP3 (Huang andMadan, 1999), using two subsequent rounds ofassembly with (1) a minimum overlap of 150 bpwith a minimum similarity threshold of 99% andmismatch and gap scores of /C0130 and 150, and (2)minimum overlap of 150 bp and minimum 97%similarity threshold, respectively. Contigs wereuploaded in ARB (http://www.arb-home.de/), andcontigs longer than 1300 bp together with selectedreference sequences were used to generate a max-imum likelihood tree with the RAxML (Stamatakiset al ., 2005) algorithm implemented in ARB usingdefault settings.The metagenome sequences and the mRNA frac-tion of the metatranscriptome were functionallyannotated for initial screening using the metage-nomics (MG)-RAST server with maximum e-valuefor a significant match set to 1e /C04 (Meyer et al. ,2008). The sequences were also taxonomicallybinned by MEGAN analysis (parameters: min. bitscore 50, min. support 1, top percent 2; 50 best blasthits) of BLASTX files against the RefSeq proteindatabase ( e-valueo1e/C04). Screening for specificfunctional genes and transcripts were carried outusing custom reference databases generated from theUniProtKB/Swiss-Prot or UniProtKB/TrEMBL data-bases. BLASTX searches were carried out with ane-value threshold of 1e /C010. All sequences belowthreshold were selected as query sequences for aBLASTX search with the same parameters againstthe RefSeq database. Only those that were assignedthe same function in the second round wereconsidered positives.In the metagenomes, the genes encoding carbohy-drate-active enzymes were annotated. The metage-nomic reads were translated into all six frames, eachframe into separate ORFs (open reading frames),avoiding any ‘*’ characters marking stop codons in aresulting ORF. All ORFs equal to 40 amino acids orlarger were screened for assignable conservedprotein domains. Glycoside hydrolases (GH), pro-teins with a carbohydrate-binding motif, carbohy-drate esterases, polysaccharide lyases and othercarbohydrate-active enzymes were inspected byreference HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) usingHMMER tools (http://hmmer.janelia.org/) with thePFAM database HMMs (PFAM release 25, http://pfam.janelia.org). All database hits with e-valuesbelow a threshold of 10–4 were counted. Forthe GH44 family, no PFAM HMM is available.Therefore, representative sequences were selectedfrom the CAZy website (http://www.cazy.org), thesequence regions corresponding to the family weredetermined and used to create a HMM for the GH44family. The screening was performed on the HPCcomputer STALLO at the University of Tromsø(http://docs.notur.no/uit). A selection of sequenceswas also used as query sequences in BLASTPsearches against the RefSeq database of the NCBI.Within the chosen threshold of the HMMER, allidentified carbohydrate-active enzymes gave either acorresponding hit or no hit in the RefSeq database.For the taxonomic assignment of gene and transcriptsequences, the corresponding BLAST outputs wereuploaded in MEGAN (parameters: min. bit score 35,min. support 1, top percent 10; 50 best blast hits).Statistical analysisSignificant differences between the frequencies ofconserved protein domains in ORFs of different soilswere evaluated statistically by using the R package(R_Development_Core_Team, 2009) using the w2con-tingency table test. The contingency table holds thefrequency counts of hits an d non-hits for a certainPFAM domain category of two different soils. Thetotal frequency count is given by all hits found for anydomain in the PFAM database. In cases where thefrequencies are too low to meet the rules of the test,the probabilities of observing a sample statistic as highas the test statistic were calculated by Monte Carlosimulations with 100 000 replicates.Data depositionThe sequence data generated in this study wasdeposited in the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI andare accessible through accession number SRP014474.Results and discussionThe active layers of the two permafrost fensat Solvatn and Knudsenheia were slightly acidicMicrobes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al301The ISME Journal(pH5–6), had a water content of B70–90%, anorganic matter content of 40–90% (SupplementaryTable S1) and were characterised by a moss coverdominated by Calliergon richardsonii (Solheimet al. , 1996; Wartiainen et al. , 2003; Høj et al. ,2005). The mosses were interspersed by grasses(Dupontia pelligera) , which were heavily sup-pressed by grazing Barnacle geese. High concentra-tions of acetate, lactate and ethanol indicatedanaerobic metabolisms through fermentative andacetogenic pathways, even in the top layers(Supplementary Table S1). Remarkably high yieldsof nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) per gram dry peatwere obtained from all samples and layers(Supplementary Table S2), which suggests a highmicrobial abundance and activity at the peak of thegrowing season. The yields, especially of RNA,decreased with depth, indicative of decreasingmicrobial activity. Replicated metatranscriptomedata sets were obtained from all upper layers(Supplementary Figure S3) whereas the reversetranscription was severely inhibited in the lowerlayers, presumably owing to phenolic substances(Supplementary Table S2). Metagenomic librarieswere obtained from all layers of one duplicate fromSolvatn and Knudsenheia (K1 and S2, Supplement-ary Figure S3). 454 Titanium pyrosequencing of themetatranscriptomes and metagenomes resulted in120 000–190 000 sequences per library, with oneexception (S2b complementary DNA, Supplement-ary Table S3). The number of rRNA sequences inthese libraries ranged from 100 000 to 150 000 whilethe number of putative mRNA sequences rangedfrom 7000 to 8500.Community structure of active microorganismsThe community composition of bacteria, archaeaand eukaryotes, as determined from the smallsubunit rRNA fragments (SSU ribo-tags) of themetatranscriptomes (up to 74 000 ribo-tags),revealed that the biological replicates of bothsites had a similar composition of taxa atdomain, phylum and class levels of resolution(Supplementary Figure S4). Ribo-tags are consid-ered a measure of living biomass, as they stem fromribosomes, most likely indicative of active organ-isms (Urich et al. , 2008; Urich and Schleper, 2011).Bacteria comprised most ribo-tags; B70%–80% inall upper layers and B84% in the lower, anoxiclayer of Solvatn, S2b (Figure 1). Eukaryotic ribo-tagscomprised B15%–30%, whereas the fraction ofArchaea was surprisingly small in all the upperlayers (B0.01%–0.13%), but higher in S2b ( B1%).The majority of archaeal sequences stemmed frommethanogenic archaea. Similar low relative abun-dances of Archaea have been reported from Alaskanpermafrost soils (for example, Waldrop et al. , 2010;Wilhelm et al., 2011). The bacterial communitycomposition in both peat soils was very similar,with most ribo-tags stemming from eight phyla, mostnotably the Proteobacteria ( B37%–45% of bacterialribo-tags), Actinobacteria ( B15%), Planctomycetes(B9%–14%), Verrucomicrobia ( B9%–11%), Acid-obacteria ( B8%–10%) and the Chloroflexi ( B7%–9%). Within the Proteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria(mainly Myxococcales ) were the most abundantclass (B19%–21% of bacterial ribo-tags). Alphapro-teobacteria made up B8%, Betaproteobacteriacomprised B5% while Gammaproteobacteria repre-sented on average 3.2% of the total community. Themajor eukaryotic taxon was the Protist kingdomAlveolata, putative grazers of bacteria, which repre-sentedB17%–20% of eukaryotic ribo-tags in bothlayers of Solvatn and 6%–8% in the top layer ofKnudsenheia (Figure 1). Other abundant Protistswere the Amoebozoa, Rhizaria (both predators ofbacteria) and Stramenopiles. Interestingly, the Pro-tists constituted the major eukaryotic group, exceed-ing even the fraction of fungal ( B2%–8%) andmetazoan ( B11%–13%) ribo-tags (Figure 1). This isin contrast to temperate and boreal mineral soils,where the fungi and metazoa comprise the majorityof either eukaryotic ribo-tags (Urich et al. , 2008) orbiomass (Schaefer, 1990; Berg and Bengtsson, 2007)and the Protists are much less abundant. Our dataindicate that the bacterial energy channel might bemore important than the fungal energy channel inthese peat soils. Metazoan ribo-tags originated fromtypical micro- and meso-faunal groups of highertrophic levels, including Nematoda, Tardigrada,Rotifera and Arthropoda. Ascomycota, and to aminor extent Basidiomycota, dominated the smallfungal community. At Solvatn, a change in abun-dance with depth was observed for several taxa(Figure 1). While Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteo-bacteria and Chloroflexi were present in largerfractions in the lower layer, Planctomycetes andVerrucomicrobia decreased with depth. Most notably,however, was the increase in the fraction of Archaeaand the decrease of Protists and fungi with depth. Theribo-tags originated mostly from actively transcribingorganisms, indicated by a taxonomic binning of themRNA fraction, which showed similar communityprofiles for the bacterial taxa (Figure 2a).There are few studies addressing Arctic peat soilsto compare our metatranscriptomic data with. 16SrRNA gene clone library, and metagenomic studiesof permafrost mineral soils have shown that theActinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteriadominate these environments (Hansen et al. , 2007;Liebner et al. , 2008; Steven et al. , 2008; Chu et al. ,2010; Yergeau et al. , 2010; Wilhelm et al. , 2011),while clone library, T-RFLP and FISH studies of asub-Arctic acidic sphagnum peat report a domi-nance of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes(Dedysh et al. , 2006; Pankratov et al. , 2011). A recentstudy of permafrost peat showed that the activelayer communities were dominated by Actino-bacteria, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi, whilethe permafrost microbiota also contained largeMicrobes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al302The ISME Journalpopulations of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes(Mackelprang et al. ,2 0 1 1 ) .I n t e r e s t i n g l y ,t a x as u c ha sthe Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes, which wereamong the most abundant taxa in the Svalbard peatsoils as well as the acidic Sphagnum peat, were notreported as major taxa in the studies on mineral soils.Genomic potential for degradation of plant polymersPlant polymer and phenolic compound degradationare key processes of SOC decomposition in peatsoils.

Despitethe rather uniform plant cover, dominated by themoss C. richardsonii, we identified a large variety ofCAZy (carbohydrate-active enzyme) families,including 76 GH families, 36 carbohydrate-bindingmodule, 3 phenol oxidase, 3 polysaccharide lyaseand 5 carbohydrate esterase families (Supplement-ary Table S4). GH5 were the most abundant amongthe families of cellulases. Genes encoding endohe-micellulases (especially GH families 10 and 26that target xylan), debranching enzymes andphenol oxidases involved in the degradation ofphenolic compounds were also abundant (Table 1).We wanted to know if the microbiotas of ourmoss-dominated, carbon-accumulating high-Arcticpeat soils contain a different genetic potential for thedegradation of plant polymers and recalcitrantphenolic compounds than the microbiota of soilsfrom other climate zones, having a vascular plantcover. Therefore, we compared our metagenomicdata sets with metagenomes from temperate grass-lands and farmlands, subtropic rain forest soils andArctic permafrost mineral soils (see SupplementaryTable S5 for details about the soil data sets),focussing on the PFAMs relevant for plant polymersand phenolic compound degradation. The functionalpotential was similar in all soils, and genes for thesame PFAMs dominated the metagenomes (Supple-mentary Table S6). A w2test did not detect statisticallysignificant differences betw een the metagenomes fromarctic peat and the other metagenomes (Supplement-ary Table S7), regardless of the variations in geographyor plant coverage.The chemical composition of moss cell walls isgenerally considered to be simpler than the one fromvacular plants; mosses have a different and lesscomplex hemicellulose composition, and do notcontain lignin, but a simpler and less abundantphenolic compound called lignan (Pena et al. , 2008;Sarkar et al. , 2009; Popper et al. , 2011), with theexception of Sphagnum species containing anabundant lignin-like polymer (Ligrone et al. , 2008).It was therefore surprising that the microbiotasharboured such a similar genomic potential. Thisresult might to some extent be explained bymethodological constraints. Fon instance, thePFAMs for phenolic compound degradation do notdistinguish between lignin and lignan as substrate.Also, the enzymes themselves might have a broadsubstrate specificity. Finally, the presence of manysimilar types of polymers in both mosses andvascular plants should be reflected in an overallsimilar genetic repertoire for degradation in therespective soil microbiotas. It might well be that theactual composition of plant polymers is onlyreflected in the gene expression patterns of themicrobiota and not in its genetic potential. However,the rather small number of mRNAs in the metatran-scriptome prevented us from studying this.Another major constraint for SOC degradation,besides the short growing season, is the accumula-tion of phenolic compounds in the water-logged,predominantly anaerobic peat soils, which inhibitsenzymatic activity (Fenner and Freeman, 2011).Expression of phenol oxidases was detected in thetop layer of Solvatn. However, the genetic potentialfor phenol oxidases was observed in all peat layers,indicating that a degradation of these inhibitorycompounds can occur if the peat soils get oxyge-nated, possibly through more pronounced drought-rewetting cycles at higher temperatures, like it hasrecently been shown for temperate peatlands(Fenner and Freeman, 2011).Figure 2 Taxonomic assignment of metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequences. The community structure is displayed at phylumlevel resolution with Proteobacteria split into classes. Sequences assigned to Proteobacteria refer to sequences that could not be assignedto class level resolution. S2 and K1 indicates where the samples were collected, in Solvatn and Knudsenheia respectively, while a, b andc indicates the depth of the sample from top and down (Supplementary Figure S3). ( a) Taxonomic assignment of ribo-tags, mRNA andmetagenomic DNA (gDNA) to the domain bacteria. ( b) Taxonomic assignment of the metagenomic sequences encoding polysaccharide-degrading enzymes (cellulases, endohemicellulases and debranching enzymes). All sequences assigned to these categories were pooledtogether and taxonomically binned using MEGAN (see Materials and methods for details).Microbes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al304The ISME JournalWe aimed to identify the microorganisms posses-ing the genes encoding these hydrolytic enzymes byusing taxonomic binning with the MEGAN software(See Materials and methods for details). However,this type of taxonomic binning is problematic,owing to the unequal representation of referencegenomes for many taxa in the public databases(Urich et al. , 2008) and horizontal gene transfer. Wetherefore compared the community profiles fromSSU ribo-tags with the taxonomically assignedmetagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencesfrom the peat top layers using MEGAN (Figure 2a).These profiles were similar for many taxa, suggest-ing that genes and transcripts can be used astaxonomic markers with some level of confidence.The genes assigned to the three major categories ofpolysaccharide degradation (cellulases, endohemi-cellulases and debranching enzymes; see Table 1)were taxonomically annotated. The bacterial phylaBacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobiapossessed the majority ( 470%) of these genes(Figure 2b).

Surprisingly,few genes were taxonomically assigned to fungi(Figure 2b). This was in accordance with the lowabundance of fungal, and especially basidiomycotalribo-tags (Figure 1). The latter have been reported asparticularly potent decomposers of SOC (Waldropet al. , 2010). Low fungal abundances in permafrostsoils and the influence of plant community compo-sition on fungal population size have been shownbefore (Zak and Kling, 2006; Yergeau et al. , 2010;Waldrop et al. , 2010).Anaerobic respiration and fermentationWe investigated the genomic potential for and theexpression of key enzymes in anaerobic respirationand fermentation, processes which drive the anae-robic decomposition of SOC. Especially the genesencoding dissimilatory nitrate reductases wereabundant (Table 2). This suggests that denitrifica-tion is important, which is supported by the highnitrate concentrations detected (70 and 84 mg pergram soil in Solvatn and Knudsenheia, respectively;Alves, 2011). An important role of denitrificationhas also been suggested by recent metagenomicstudies of permafrost affected soils (Yergeau et al. ,2010; Mackelprang et al. , 2011). Despite the highabundance of denitrification genes, only nirS (nitritereductase) and norB (nitric oxide reductase) tran-scripts were identified (Table 2); however, the smallsize of the mRNA pools in the metatranscriptomicdata sets prevented further statements. Also sulphatereduction might have a role, as genes of the keyenzyme DSR were found and their abundanceincreased with soil depth in Knudsenheia (Table 2).The majority of the identifie d anaerobic respirationgenes were assigned to taxa within Actinobacteria andProteobacteria (Supplementary Figure S5), althoughthe genes were broadly distributed among severaldifferent taxa, as previously described for denitrifyers(Philippot and Hallin, 2005) and sulphate reducers(Wagner et al. , 2005). Genes and transcripts of severalfermentative pathways were detected (Table 2),explaining the high concentration of fermentationproducts in the peat soils (Supplementary Table S1).Likewise, genes encoding the terminal hydrogenase ofH2-evolving fermentations ( hydA) were found. Theirabundance increased with depth, as did the abun-dance of formyltetrahydro folate synthetase genes ( fhs),which encodes the key enzyme of the Acetyl-CoApathway of homoacetogen esis. The majority of hydAand fhsgenes were assigned to Firmicutes andActinobacteria, suggesting an important role of taxawithin these phyla in the anaerobic degradation ofSOC in the Svalbard peat (Supplementary Figure S6).Taken together, these findings indicate a gradualtransition from aerobic to anaerobic degr adation ofSOC with depth.Methane cyclingThe fraction of methanogenic archaea increased withdepth (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S6),reflecting the presumably more anoxic conditionsand higher concentrations of fermentation inter-mediates (Supplementary Table S1). Three orders ofmethanogenic archaea were found, Methanobacter-iales ,Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales ,Table 2 Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads assigned to enzyme classes that catalyse key steps in anaerobic respiration andfermentation, and fermentative pathwaysPathway/function E.C.

The phylogenetic tree shows assembled SSU rRNA contigs of type I methanotrophs.Most of the nearly full-length ribo-contigs (14 out of 16) are 497% identical to M. tundripaludum . Ribo-contig description includes thefollowing: contig id, site (Knudsenheia-green, Solvatn-red), contig length and the number of single ribo-tags that went into the assembly.The reference sequence description (black) includes sequence length and accession number. The length of the bar indicates 0.10 changesper nucleotide. The tree was constructed using the ARB software (See Materials and methods for details). The insert shows the nitratereductase (open reading frames (ORFs) 3936–3940) and nitrite reductase operons (ORFs 3936–3940) identified in the genome ofM.tundripaludum .Microbes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al307The ISME Journalof which the first two are hydrogenotrophic, produ-cing CH 4from H 2and CO 2, whereas the Methano-sarcinales are metabolically more versatile, carryingout hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic and methylo-trophic methanogenesis. These findings are similarto previous studies of methanogens from Solvatn(Høj et al. , 2005; Høj et al. , 2006). In Solvatn, theincreased abundance of acetotrophic methanogenswith depth correlated with a decrease in theconcentration of acetate, indicating that the aceto-trophic Methanosarcinales acted as the sink foracetate. In general, the high concentrations offermentation products like ethanol, especially inthe lower layers of Knudsenheia, indicated a lowefficiency in the terminal fermentation steps, possi-bly owing to low activity of, or a lack of, establishedinteractions between fermentative syntrophic bac-teria and their methanogenic counterparts.Type I methanotrophs of the order Methylococ-cales were abundant in both peat soils (0.1%–2.4%of ribo-tags). We did not detect active type IImethanotrophs, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea(ANME), the recently described anaerobic methano-troph Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera of theNC10 candidate phylum (Ettwig et al. , 2010) or theVerrucomicrobium Methylacidiphilium (Islam et al. ,2008). We assembled long, sometimes full-length,SSU rRNAs from the ribo-tags of the type Imethanotrophs to determine the phylogenetic posi-tion (See Materials and methods (Urich et al. , 2008;Radax et al. , 2012)). The vast majority of theassembled ribo-contigs was closely related toM. tundripaludum (Figure 3), an arctic methano-troph originally isolated from Solvatn (Wartiainenet al. , 2006). We could taxonomically assign 104mRNA tags to genes encoded in the genome ofM. tundripaludum (Svenning et al. , 2011). Althoughthis is a small number, it allowed a superficialview into the gene expression and metabolism ofM. tundripaludum in situ . Remarkably, as much as33% of the transcripts encoded subunits of the keyenzyme particulate methane monooxygenase(Table 3). This highlights the importance of particu-late methane monooxygenase for M. tundripaludumcells, as this enzyme catalyses the initial step of boththe carbon and energy metabolism through theoxidation of methane to methanol. Transcripts ofthe methanol dehydrogenase that catalyses theFigure 4 Schematic overview of the main degradation pathways of plant polymers in the high-Arctic peatlands of Svalbard. Thepathways are divided into three categories; aerobic (beige), anaerobic (light brown) and processes occurring under both conditions (darkbrown). Key microbial taxa for the different degradation steps are presented (orange boxes). The figure is adapted from Figure 1 in(Conrad, 1999).Microbes in Arctic peat soilA Tveit et al308The ISME Journalsecond step of complete oxidation of methane toCO 2and the ribulose monophosphate pathway forcarbon assimilation, as well as transcripts encodingenzymes of the aerobic respiratory chain, were alsoidentified (Table 3). Recently, M. tundripaludumwas shown to be the dominating methanotroph in aSIP-RNA experiment with Solvatn peat (Graef et al. ,2011). It was also shown to be the dominantmethanotroph in two soils from the Siberian andthe Canadian Arctic (Liebner et al. , 2009; Martineauet al. , 2010). Although these are few studies, theypoint to the importance of methanotrophs closelyrelated to M. tundripaludum having a key role in thebiological CH4filter in Arctic soils. The seeminglyecological advantage of M. tundripaludum in theseoften water-logged Arctic soils might be owing to itsN2-fixation capability (Wartiainen et al. , 2006;Svenning et al. , 2011), as well as to the presence ofnitrate reductase ( nar) and nitrite reductase ( nir)operons in its genome (Figure 3) (Svenning et al. ,2011). It is tempting to speculate that M. tundripa-ludum could employ the NAR and NIR enzymes indenitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation, utilisinga pathway similar to that of Candidatus M. oxyfera(Ettwig et al. , 2010). Alternatively, it could have theability to grow anaerobically on simple organiccompounds using denitrification. Experiments areunderway to test these hypotheses.ConclusionWe have described the metabolic potential andactivity of microorganisms involved in SOC degra-dation in high-Arctic peat soils (Figure 4). This firstcombined metagenomic and metatranscriptomicstudy on any soil (to our knowledge), revealed taxathat are important to specific processes such ashydrolysis of plant polymers (for example, Verruco-microbia and Bacteroidetes), fermentations (forexample, Firmicutes), methanogenesis and metha-notrophy. Actinobacteria seemed to be particularlyimportant, having a metabolic potential for carryingout several of the key steps in SOC degradation(Figure 4). Based on their relative abundance, fungiappeared to not have an important role. However, aswarming will lead to an extended growing season,this might result in a change of the plant covers frommosses to vascular plants and in more oxygenatedactive layers, where fungi might become moreimportant for SOC decomposition. Dryer and moreoxygenated active layers will then likely lead toincreased peat decomposition, owing to loweredconcentrations of phenolic substances, caused byincreased activity of aerobic microorganisms thatsynthesise phenol oxidases (Fenner and Freeman,2011). These combined effects might increase therate of SOC degradation above that of carbonsequestration, and turn these peat soils into CO2sources. Increased active layer depth and higher soiltemperatures will likely result in bigger habitat sizefor anaerobic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, inthe cases where the peat soils remain water-saturated. Here, CH 4production likely will increase,although this might well be balanced by methano-trophic bacteria, of which M. tundripaludum seemsto be particularly important. However, to whichextent such key populations can adapt to thechanging conditions remains a crucial question.AcknowledgementsWe thank Peter Frenzel, Vigdis Torsvik and Ricardo Alvesfor important contributions during the fieldwork inNy-A˚lesund, Svalbard.
