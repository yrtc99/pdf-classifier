T RUMBOREDepartment of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3100ABSTRACT Recent improvements in our understandingof the dynamics of soil carbon have shown that 20–40% of theapproximately 1,500 Pg of C stored as organic matter in theupper meter of soils has turnover times of centuries or less.This fast-cycling organic matter is largely comprised of un-decomposed plant material and hydrolyzable componentsassociated with mineral surfaces. Turnover times of fast-cycling carbon vary with climate and vegetation, and rangefrom <20 years at low latitudes to >60 years at high latitudes.The amount and turnover time of C in passive soil carbonpools (organic matter strongly stabilized on mineral surfaceswith turnover times of millennia and longer) depend onfactors like soil maturity and mineralogy, which, in turn,reflect long-term climate conditions. Transient sources orsinks in terrestrial carbon pools result from the time lagbetween photosynthetic uptake of CO2by plants and thesubsequent return of C to the atmosphere through plant,heterotrophic, and microbial respiration. Differential re-sponses of primary production and respiration to climatechange or ecosystem fertilization have the potential to causesignificant interrannual to decadal imbalances in terrestrialC storage and release. Rates of carbon storage and release inrecently disturbed ecosystems can be much larger than ratesin more mature ecosystems. Changes in disturbance frequencyand regime resulting from future climate change may be moreimportant than equilibrium responses in determining thecarbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.Soil carbon inventories and turnover rates are influenced byclimate, vegetation, parent material, topography, and time, thefundamental state factors outlined by Jenny (1, 2). Studiesattempting to understand the influence of a specific factor(e.g., temperature or moisture) on soil properties have foundit useful to identify a suite of soils for which the factor inquestion varies whereas the others are held constant (1–4).This approach has been used successfully to look at the role oftemperature (3, 5) and time (6–10) on the turnover of soil C.Ecosystem models such asCENTURY (11, 12), CASA (13), or theRothamsted model (14, 15) predict the sensitivity of soil Cinventory and turnover to climate, vegetation, and parentmaterial, but as yet few data exist to test these predictions.Parameterizations of decomposition used in these models arebased on empirical fits to specific calibration sites and may notinclude enough basic understanding of the interaction betweenplant substrates and the soil environment to make successfulpredictions in different environments (16).The reservoir of soil carbon has been proposed as both asignificant source and sink of atmospheric CO2. A soil sourceresults when net decomposition exceeds C inputs to the soil,either as a result of human activities such as clearing forests foragriculture (17, 18) or because of increased decompositionrates due to global warming (12, 14, 19, 20). Net sinks of C insoils are postulated from the difference between net ecosystemC uptake and tree growth rates (21) or from presumedincreases in net C inputs from CO2or N-fertilization of plants(19, 20, 22–24). In both cases, the magnitude and timing of theresponse depends on the amount of carbon in pools thatrespond quickly to changes in climate and vegetation, and tothe time lag between fixation of C by plants and its subsequentrelease to the atmosphere during decomposition.This paper will describe recent approaches used to study soilC dynamics, and preliminary applications of these tools to theproblems of soil C response to global environmental changes.The results indicate the importance of the global soil C poolto the global C cycle on interrannual to century time scales andsuggest profitable areas for future research.The Nature of Soil Organic Matter (SOM)SOM is defined here as the nonliving component of organicmatter in soil. The ultimate source of organic matter in soils isCO2fixed by plants, including leaf litter, roots, and rootexudates. The activity of soil fauna (especially fungi andmicrobial communities) metabolizes some of these substratesand transforms others into more resistant organic compounds(collectively referred to as humus). The stabilization and fateof organic matter residues is affected by the quality of theoriginal plant substrate (25), and the physical environment inthe soil [clay content and mineralogy (26), pH, O2availability(27), formation and disruption of soil aggregates (28–30)].Carbon is lost from soil mostly as CO2produced duringdecomposition of organic matter, though losses of carbonthrough leaching or erosion may be important when consid-ering C balance in soils on long time scales (29, 31, 32). Organicmatter in soils plays important roles in determining soilwater-holding capacity and soil structure, and provides along-term store of nutrients needed by plants. Thus changes inSOM will have important feedbacks on hydrology and plantproductivity (33).SOM is difficult to study because it is a complex mixture ofsubstances having turnover rates that range from days tomillennia. The average global turnover time for soil organiccarbon (to 1-m depth) was estimated as 32 years by Raich andSchlesinger (34), who divided the total C stock in soils by theaverage CO2flux from soil (corrected for root respirationcontribution). Turnover times varied from 14 years to 400 yearsfor different ecosystems in their study. Radiocarbon measure-ments of bulk soil C, however, often show that the average ageof C in soils is several hundred to several thousand years(35–38). Both results are explained if SOM contains compo-nents that turn over slower and faster than the several-decadeaverage.© 1997 by The National Academy of Sciences 0027-8424 y97y948284-8$2.00 y0PNAS is available online at http: yywww.pnas.org.

While organic mat-ter may actually be a continuum, best represented by adistribution of turnover times (39), continuous distributionsare difficult to constrain with field measurements. There isgeneral agreement that SOM contains at least three identifi-able C pools: root exudates and rapidly decomposed compo-nents of fresh plant litter (‘‘active’’ pool); stabilized organicmatter that persists in soils over several thousands of years(‘‘passive’’ pool); and a poorly defined ‘‘intermediate’’ or‘‘slow’’ C pool that has turnover times in the range of years tocenturies (Fig. 1). I will use these terms in this paper, and inaddition will refer to fast-cycling C as the combined active andintermediate pools (all nonpassive C).The mechanisms through which climate or land-use changemay influence soil carbon cycling include a combination ofbiotic controls that affect the amount and resistance to decayof C added to soils by plants, and physical controls, includingthe area and chemistry of surfaces for stabilization of organicmatter, and the availability of oxidants to decomposers. Thesemechanisms operate on vastly different time scales. Plantproductivity and soil microbial communities respond to shift-ing climate conditions within hours (41), whereas changes inproduction and respiration on an annual basis are linked tointerrannual variability in climate (42, 43). Persistent changesin climate can lead to species changes over time scales ofdecades to centuries (44), with concomitant shifts in plantproduction and litter quality (45). Soil minerals, forming overmillennial time scales, control how much of the soil carbon ischemically yphysically protected from decomposition (46–49).Finally, ecosystem disturbance caused by fire, flooding, treeblow-down, etc. will cause drastic changes in plant productionand soil conditions for decomposition that far exceed thoseassociated with interrannual variability. Thus the generaldesign of experiments to understand soil C dynamics shoulddepend on sampling existing environmental and disturbancegradients as well as manipulations to test soil forming factoreffects on the amount and turnover times of C in active,intermediate, and passive C pools.Tools to Study SOMNo single, satisfactory method yet exists to separate soil C intocomponents with different turnover times. Instead, the dy-namic makeup of soil C is deduced using many constraints,including: physical and chemical fractionation of organic mat-ter, field and laboratory decomposition studies, measures of Cfluxes into and out of the soil, measurements of14C in soilssampled at various times before and after the peak of atmo-spheric nuclear weapons testing, changes in the13C content ofSOM after a vegetation change from plants with C3 to C4photosynthetic pathway, and measurements of changes in thetotal amount of C in soils of different age or after disturbance.Each of these tools is suitable for determining different timescales of soil C dynamics, and much confusion may result frommixing of terms related to turnover times (active, intermediate,or passive) with those derived from measured soil parameters.For example, the increase in bomb14C, or changes in13Ci nSOM during the first several decades after conversion of aC3-dominated forest vegetation to C4-dominated pasture veg-etation may be used to determine the amount and averageturnover time of C that is fast-cycling (nonpassive). Fast-cycling C may be further comprised of active and intermediatepools with different turnover times, but isotopic techniques arenot suitable for distinguishing this split.Active Carbon Pools. Field decomposition studies involveboth observation of loss of native plant litter and differencesin decomposition of a common litter substrate at differentsites. Isotope labeling studies usually follow specific com-pounds or compound classes (such as amino acids or carbo-hydrates), but also may follow the fate of below-ground Callocation, as in pulse-labeling studies. Although some incu-bations have been followed over periods of more than 10 years(26, 50), most are designed for shorter time periods. Thesestudies are used to provide multiple rate constants for decom-position models like those of Jenkinson and Raynor (15).Soil-respired CO2is produced either by metabolic rootrespiration or by decomposition of fast-cycling SOM pools(Fig. 1). In addition, CO2fluxes measured at the soil surfaceare most likely dominated by decomposition in near-surfacelayers (including surface detritus). With these caveats, CO2flux measurements provide an estimate of total decompositionC flux from the soil, if correction for root-respiration can bemade (34). Radiocarbon measurements of respired CO2mayhelp distinguish sources of respiration experimentally. Rootrespiration and CO2derived from decomposition of C withvery rapid turnover should have D14C close to atmosphericvalues for the year of sampling, whereas CO 2derived from slowC pools will have higher or lower D14C values, depending onthe average turnover time.Field measurements of decomposition and CO 2flux oftenare complicated by seasonal differences in the quality andquantity of detrital material (for example, in temperate zones,deciduous leaves are shed in autumn, but may be responsiblefor a pulse of decomposition the next spring). Laboratoryincubations, where soil is separated from roots, allow obser-vation of the CO2evolved from decomposition alone (51).Long-term incubations ( .1 year) allow estimation of therelative contributions of active and slow pools to soil CO 2flux(5). However, the magnitude of laboratory fluxes of C may notbe easily mapped to field conditions.Experiments manipulating soil temperature to determinethe net response of soils (19) or soils plus vegetation (52) toincreased temperature are now in progress in several places.These treatments have been in place in most cases for ,10years, and preliminary results are reflective of adjustments inthe fast-cycling pools.Passive Soil Carbon and the Depth Distribution of14C.Theexistence of passive SOM is deduced from radiocarbon mea-surements and the fact that some C3-plant-derived organicmatter persists in disturbed soils even after a century or moreof cultivation with C4 plants. In general, the amount and14Ccontent of SOM decrease with depth in soil profiles, indicatingthe increasing importance of passive organic matter with depthin the soil (37, 53).FIG. 1. Conceptual model of SOM dynamics used in this paper(after ref. 40).Colloquium Paper: Trumbore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 8285Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 9, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.The14C age of passive organic matter may give clues to themechanisms that cause C to persist in soil over millennial timescales. Three approaches to isolating the properties of passiveC from the bulk soil have been used. The first, proposed byO’Brien and Stout (37, 54) and used by Harrison et al. (22) usesa14C measurement from deep in the soil as an estimate of thepassive pool14C content. This approach attributes decreases inC and14C with increasing soil depth to a decrease in theabundance of fast-cycling C pools to near-zero at depth, whileassuming that the abundance and properties of passive Cremain constant over the same depth interval.A second approach toward determining the14C content ofpassive SOM is based on operationally defined physical andchemical fractionation of the organic matter. Several investi-gators (36, 38, 53, 55–58) have shown that repeated extractionsof SOM with acids and bases of increasing strength will leavea residue with a lower14Cy12C ratio than the starting material(a density separation is performed first to remove relativelyintact vascular plant material, which can represent up to 80%of the C in soil A horizons).A third way to estimate the turnover rates in the passivefraction is based on a chronosequence approach (9, 59, 60). Achronosequence is a series of soils of different age, butdeveloped on the same parent material with the same vege-tation and climate (for example, soils formed on a series of lavaflows or river terraces of different age). During the first severalhundred years of soil formation, C accumulation in chrono-sequences is rapid as vegetation is assumed to establish steadystate with fast-cycling soil C components. Accumulation ofpassive C over millennial time scales in soils (perhaps asauthigenic soil minerals are formed and provide new surfacesfor organic matter stabilization) is presumably responsible forlong-term C increases. Increases in the amount of passive Cover time should cause a steepening of the14C-depth curve (6,61). Goh et al. (8) reported decreasing14C contents in deepersoil horizons with increasing soil age in a chronosequencedeveloped on aeolean sand.Tools to Study the Intermediate Pool. The intermediate poolof soil C, with turnover times that vary from years to decades,is the largest fraction of organic matter in most soils. It is alsothe most difficult to study, as it is itself almost certainly madeup of fractions with different turnover times. Ecosystemmodels such asCENTURY and the Rothamsted model subdividefast-cycling soil C into readily decomposable and resistantplant debris, as well as an intermediate C pool. In temperateforests soils with low clay content, relatively undecomposedplant debris (the low-density fraction of SOM) can representup to 80% of the C in A horizon SOM (3) and have turnovertimes of years to several decades. In tropical soils, low-densityorganic matter has turnover times of ,5 years and makes uproughly 10–30% of the total SOM in the upper 10 cm of soil.Mineral-associated (high-density) C that is hydrolyzable inacids and bases, makes up about 50% of the A horizon C, andhas turnover times of 20–30 years (62). While it is tempting tomap the hydrolyzable C onto the models’ intermediate C pool,operationally defined extraction methods give little practicalinsight into the mechanisms that are stabilizing this organicmatter fraction.The Bomb14C Tracer. The incorporation of14C produced inthe early 1960s by atmospheric thermonuclear weapons testing(bomb14C) into SOM during the past 30 years provides a directmeasure of the amount of fast-cycling (active 1slow) SOM (5,22, 35, 37, 63–67). The most straightforward approach, whichcompares14C measurements of SOM sampled before 1960with contemporary samples from the same location, is sum-marized in Fig. 2 (62, 64, 68). A large increase in14C contentover the past 30 years indicates that significant portions of theSOM are exchanging carbon with atmospheric CO2on decadaland shorter time scales. Harrison et al. (22) modeled the14Cincrease with time for SOM measured over the past 30 yearsand reported in the literature (for mostly temperate soils) andobtained an average turnover time of about 25 years forfast-cycling C. Work in other locations has shown that turnovertimes may be either faster or slower than this average value.Trumbore et al. (3) used the bomb14C technique to deter-mine how the turnover time of fast-cycling organic mattervaried along an elevation transect in the Sierra Nevada moun-tains of central California. Temperature decreases with ele-vation along the transect, though vegetation and annual pre-cipitation also vary. C inventory in soil A horizons is predom-inantly in low-density fractions ( ,2.0 g ycm3; 50–80% of thetotal SOM), with another 10–30% in the hydrolyzable fractionof organic matter in the .2.0 g ycm3fraction. Comparison ofthe14C content of these fractions isolated from 0–20 cm soilFIG.2 . ( Left) Change in D14C in atmospheric CO 2and in two homogeneous C pools with turnover times of 5, 10, 50, and 70 years. ( Right ) Effectof passive organic matter on D(D14C) values in bulk SOM. Failure to account for 10% of the carbon in a passive fraction that does not change in14C content between 1959 and 1992 will result in an underestimate of the increase in fast-cycling D14C and therefore of turnover time in that fraction.Thus it is important to assess whether passive components such as charcoal are present in presumed fast-cycling pools (such as low-density carbon).8286 Colloquium Paper: Trumbore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 9, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.collected in 1959 and 1992 (Fig. 3) shows turnover is fastest inlow-density material and slowest in nonhydrolyzable organicmatter. Translating the14C increases into turnover timesaccording to procedures in Fig. 2 for the low-density 1hydrolyzable organic matter gives turnover times of 8–12 yearsat low elevation (highest temperature) and 60 years at highelevation (low temperature). Fig. 3 also shows that the residueafter repeated hydrolysis of mineral-associated organic matterin acids and bases still may contain some fast-cycling carbon (asevidenced by an increase in14C in the past 40 years).Without prebomb samples for comparison,14C measure-ments of contemporary soils may yield a very misleadingpicture of soil C dynamics. For example, the bulk14C contentsof the 0–20 cm layer of tropical soils sampled in the early 1990srange from 270% (Hawaii; ref. 5) to 1210% (Manaus; ref.67). The average turnover times of fast-cycling components ofthese soils, derived from14C and other measures (see below),is similar (10–20 years). The amounts and14C contents ofcarbon in the passive carbon pool are responsible for bulk14Cdifferences between these sites. The Hawaiian soils are devel-oped on basaltic lava (Andisols) and stabilize large amounts ofold carbon in noncrystalline minerals (6), whereas the soils inManaus have very high percentages of sesquioxides that do notstabilize organic matter as well. Based on14C measured onbulk SOM alone, one could mistakenly assume very slowturnover rates for the Hawaiian soils. While this is true foraverage soil C, the average is not a useful number for predict-ing the response of Hawaiian soils to climate or land-usechange.Townsend et al. (5) report soil C turnover times for fast-cycling C along an elevation-based temperature transect ofAndisols on the slope of Mauna Kea, near Lapahoehoe,Hawaii. No prebomb archived soil samples were available fromthese sites. Therefore, a suite of constraints, including14Cmeasurements, were used to determine turnover times ofactive, slow, and passive organic matter. The13C changes inSOM accompanying C3 forest to C4 pasture conversion fromthree sites reflect the partitioning of fast-cycling ( '75% of thetotal SOM) vs. passive ( '25%) carbon pools in pastures thatwere roughly a century old. The application of this method ismuch the same as looking for the increase in bomb14C in soils;carbon turning over on decadal and shorter time scales willreflect recent isotopic changes in C sources, whereas passivecarbon pools will not (26, 69–72). Townsend et al. (5) esti-mated the breakdown of fast-cycling C into active and inter-mediate C pools using long-term (1 year) incubations—theratio of CO2evolution after 1 year to the initially observed CO 2evolution was assumed to equal the ratio of CO 2contributedfrom decomposition of intermediate C pools to that fromactive C pools. Estimates of passive pool14C content weremade in two ways: using the method of O’Brien and Stout (37)or calculating from a knowledge of the soil age (15,000 years)and assuming constant accumulation of passive C since thetime of soil formation (73). Intermediate pool turnover timesthen were constrained to reproduce 199014C values and CO 2fluxes.Trumbore et al. (62) use a different set of constraints with14C measurements to deduce the amount and turnover time offast-cycling C in tropical forest soils in eastern Amazonia.Estimates of annual carbon input to the soil were derived frommeasurements of litterfall and fine root biomass. The14Ccontent of CO 2measured in the soil air space was greater thanthat of atmospheric CO 2for the year in which it was measured(73, 74), indicating that a large portion of the carbon contrib-uting to soil respiration was fixed from the atmosphere byplants over the past several years to decades. The14C contentof CO 2evolved from SOM decomposition can be used as anadditional constraint to break fast-cycling organic matter intoactive and intermediate pools.C Inventory Changes with Land Use. Changes in soil carbonaccompanying human or natural disturbance also provideclues about C dynamics in soils. Decreases in soil C inventoryassociated with cultivation on average may be of the order of10–40% of initial C inventories (18), but may be smaller anddifficult to measure in some areas (62). Changes in13Cabundance in SOM after a shift in vegetation with C3 to C4photosynthetic pathway (or vice versa) can be used to identifyfast-cycling organic matter. These methods rely on accurateFIG. 3. Increases in D14C between 1959 (1964 for lowest elevationsite) and 1992 for ( a) low density ( ,2.0 g ycm3), (b) hydrolyzable ( .2.0gycm3), and ( c) nonhydrolyzable ( .2.0 g ycm3) portions of SOM froman elevation transect in the Sierra Nevada (3). The fraction of organicmatter with the fastest turnover time will have the highest pre-196314Cvalues and show the largest increase in14C between 1959 and 1992 ( a)while the fraction with slowest turnover has lowest initial14C valuesand shows little increase in14C over the past 30 years ( c).Colloquium Paper: Trumbore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 8287Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 9, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.measures of C inventory change over time (26, 69–72), and aknowledge of the13C content of new and old vegetation Cinputs to soil. Comparison of14C in paired undisturbed anddisturbed ecosystems can be a sensitive measure of net Cstorage or loss over the past 30 years (62, 75). Soils that areaccumulating C will have higher D14C values compared with anundisturbed ecosystem (presumed at steady state), whereassoils that are losing C will have lower14C than the undisturbedsite (73).Prediction of the Response of Soil C to Global ChangeTotal C Inventory in Soils. Estimates of the amount of Cstored in soils fall in the range of 1,200 to 1,500 Pg C (46, 76,77). These estimates are based on relatively few soil C inven-tory data from many important regions, especially the tropicsand northern wetlands. Global estimates are extrapolatedusing correlations of SOM content with vegetation yclimateregime (46, 76) or by soil mapping unit (77). The apparentoverall agreement between these estimates masks large un-certainties at the regional scale. For example, moist and wettropical forest profiles reported in Schlesinger (76) have Cinventories ranging from 6.5 to 20.5 kg C m22(average of 10.4k gCm22). Post et al. (46) use values of 11.5 and 21 kg C m22as averages for tropical moist and wet forests, respectively.Davidson and Lefebvre (78) discuss potential uncertaintiesinvolved in estimating C stores from large-scale soil map units.Present estimates of global soil C stocks are based on theupper meter of soils, without reference to what fraction of thatorganic matter is in active, intermediate, or passive pools.Sombroek (79) points out that many tropical soils extenddeeper than 1 m, and adding deep C inventories can increasesoil C stocks in the tropics markedly. The question of whatdepth should be the cutoff for counting soil C stores reallydepends on where and how much of the C is in fast-cyclingpools, and how much of the passive soil C pool may beinherited in the case of sedimentary parent material. Ecolog-ical models that include cycling of SOM generally assume thatonly the 0- to 20- or 0- to 30-cm layer of soils containssignificant amounts of fast-cycling organic matter. Estimates offast-cycling SOM pools derived from these models (12, 13)range from about 250 to 530 Pg C globally.The assumption that organic matter deep in soils is notimportant in C cycling is not always correct. The presence oflive roots to depths greater than 15 m in 40-m deep soils ofseasonal tropical forests in eastern Amazonia (74) drives a fastcarbon cycle to depths of at leas t 8 m (62, 74). Although bulkC concentrations and14C contents of SOM at .1-m depths arelow, estimates of turnover from fine-root inputs, CO 2produc-tion, and the14C content of CO 2produced at depth show thatup to 15% of the carbon inventory in the deep soil has turnovertimes of decades or less. In these soils, the amount of fast-cycling soil carbon between 1- and 8-m depths (2–3 kg C m22,out of 17–18 kg C m22) is significant compared with theamount present in the upper meter of soil (3–4 kg C m22outof 10–11 kg C m22) (62).Predicted Changes in Soil C Due to Increased Plant Pro-duction. The simplest approach to predicting the response ofsoil C changes in plant productivity is to assume that the sizeof C pools will adjust to a new steady state with increased inC inputs. Fast-cycling pools will adjust most rapidly to newsteady state conditions. Harrison et al. (22), assuming ab(growth-enhancement) factor of 0.35 and turnover time offast-cycling C of 25 years, calculated that increased C inputs tosoils should have resulted in net storage of 0.5 Gt C yyr infast-cycling C in the 1980s (with an additional 0.1 Gt C yyradded to surface litter). This approach assumes no change indecomposition rates due to changes in the quality of thoseplant substrates, an assumption that has yet to be tested.The changes in C inventory predicted by Harrison et al. (22)are almost impossible to measure directly (62, 80). For exam-ple, even a predicted 0.5 Gt C yyr sink integrated over 30 yearsincreases the total soil C pool only 1% (the fast-cycling pool by3%). C inventory measurements, plagued by small-scale het-erogeneity and comparatively large analytical uncertainties(for example, in bulk density measurements), cannot distin-guish such small increases on local to regional scales. Thus,other methods must be discovered to determine whether Caccumulation of this magnitude is actually occurring in soils.After CO2fertilization, the most often-cited mechanismleading to a terrestrial carbon sink is enhanced nitrogenavailability to plants due to enhanced nitrate deposition (19,20, 22, 23, 81). Nitrogen availability also will be increased ifthere is net decomposition of SOM, because SOM is a majorsource of nitrogen for plants. Although nitrogen mineraliza-tion is accompanied by CO2efflux, the transfer of nitrogenfrom soil to plants would result in net carbon sequestrationbecause the C:N ratio of plants is roughly 10 times the ratio inSOM. Decomposition rates are predicted to increase as a resultof warmer temperatures (see below).Response of Fast-Cycling Soil C to Climate Change. Theamount of organic matter in soils is positively correlated withmoisture and negatively correlated with precipitation (2, 46).Carbon turnover rates for combined fast-cycling C poolsdiscussed above from the Sierra Nevada, Hawaii, and Parag-ominas, Brazil are plotted against mean annual temperature inFig. 4. Although these soils differ in vegetation cover, precip-itation (greater than 90 cm yyr with one exception), and soilparent material, a strong relation between turnover time of thefast-cycling C pools and mean annual (air) temperature isobserved. This suggests that temperature is a major control ofthe turnover rate of fast-cycling soil C, in accord with recentmodeling and data-based studies (5, 12, 20, 34, 50, 82–84). Theoverall gradient with latitude from the tropics to boreal forestsis in accord with trend derived from local elevation gradients.Fig. 4 also plots temperature-turnover time relations pre-dicted by theCENTURY model (12) and a literature review ofsurface litter decomposition rates (51). Turnover times derivedfromCENTURY are longer than values derived from fieldmeasurements, and show a less steep relation to temperature.The relation derived by Kirschbaum (51) plotted on Fig. 4 isa literature summary of the rates of decomposition derivedfrom laboratory incubations of surface litter. These datasuggest turnover of surface detrital pools is faster and hasgreater temperature dependence than fast-cycling organicmatter in soils. Mean annual air temperature is plotted in Fig.4, but obviously soils (especially surface detritus) experienceseasonal and diurnal temperature extremes that may exceedthose of the air above.Both vegetation inputs and decomposition rates are ex-pected to increase with increases in temperature (all otherfactors remaining equal). Soils become an amplifying feedbackif the temperature dependence of decomposition is steeperthan that of plant productivity (e.g. ref. 5). At present, this isstill an open question. Kirschbaum (51) summarized data fromincubation experiments for various types of plant litter andfound that Q10values for decomposition ranged from about 2.5at 20°C to about 4.5 at 10°C. Data from field-based studiesusing climosequences (summarized in Fig. 4) suggest a Q10forfast-cycling SOM of around 3, but are too few (particularly intropical regions) to distinguish between cases with constantand changing Q10values over a wide range of temperatures.Schimel et al. (12) summarize modeling and data-basedpredictions of C release from SOM for a 1°C increase in globalmean annual temperature. The calculated net release rangesfrom 11.1 to 33.8 Pg C once a new steady state is reached. Thelowest value is predicted byCENTURY , which accounts forfeedbacks between plant productivity and release of nutrientsthat accompanies net SOM decomposition. In N-limited plant8288 Colloquium Paper: Trumbore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997)Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 9, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.communities, the release of N through increased decomposi-tion in a warmer world could further stimulate plant growth,and even cause net sequestering of C as nutrients are trans-ferred from soils (low C:N ratios) to plant reservoirs withhigher C:N ratios (19).One consequence of all studies of C turnover as function oftemperature is that soils already should be a net source of Cto the atmosphere due to increased decomposition ratesbecause of documented temperature increases over the pastcentury. This present net C loss presumably would offsethypothetical increases in soil C stores from increased plantproduction due to CO2fertilization.The rate at which steady state is approached when fast-cycling C pools respond to a temperature change demonstratesthe importance of recognizing differences in turnover rates ofsoil C between ecosystems. Trumbore et al. (3) estimate theresponse after changes in net primary production in tropical,temperate, and boreal forest soils. According to these calcu-lations, interrannual variations in net primary production maycause significant interrannual variability in soil-atmosphereCO2fluxes, with largest and fastest response in tropicalregions.Moisture changes. Soil organic carbon inventories increaseregionally from arid to wet environments (2, 46), whereasincubation and field decomposition studies show increases indecomposition rates with added moisture in aerobic soils.Decomposition rates for organic matter decrease dramaticallyunder waterlogged conditions. Low C inventories in arid soilsmay be due to decreased C inputs, faster C turnover, ordifferences in the quality of plant material. As yet, the relativecontributions of these factors are unknown.Disturbance. Soils accumulate organic carbon over at leastthe first 10,000 years of development (1, 9). Schlesinger (7)showed that the rates of C accumulation in young (thousandsof years old) soils are an order of magnitude lower thoseneeded for soils to be a significant C sink for anthropogenicCO2. The changes in C inventory over millennial time scales insoils most likely are caused by the development of secondarysoils minerals with stabilization on new mineral surfaces (6).More rapid rates of C accumulation and loss may occur overshorter time scales as the large component of fast-cycling soilC responds to disturbance such as a change in vegetation. Asdiscussed above, soils may lose a significant portion of theircarbon after cultivation; these changes represent a loss offast-cycling C rather than passive C pools (30, 33, 62). Work inboreal forest ecosystems (85) shows high rates of net Csequestration in regrowing surface moss layers in the decadesafter stand-killing fire events. In these systems, decompositionin mosses is so slow as to be less important than periodic fireat controlling the status of these soils as net C sinks. Thus,particularly in regions where decomposition rates are slow,changes in fire frequency linked to climate or to land use (firesuppression) may be the ultimate control of regional status asa C source or sink. The same may be true in other fire-dominated ecosystems, such as chaparral (68), where organicmatter accumulates rapidly between fire events.Wetland areas store organic matter that is climaticallystabilized; it is decomposing slowly only because of a lack ofoxidants. Warming and draining of wetlands results in a loss ofthis stored organic matter (86, 87). In northern wetland soils(which contain an estimated one-fifth of total global soil Creservoir), this could lead to large positive feedbacks inwarming.ConclusionsClimate, vegetation, parent material, and time all affect theprocesses controlling accumulation and decomposition of or-ganic matter in soils as has been known for decades. Thequantification of these insights, however, is still in the begin-ning stages. Of the roughly 1,500 Gt of C stored in organicmatter in soils, an estimated 250–530 Gt resides in C pools withturnover times of decades or less. Models extrapolating theresponse of the fast-cycling soil C pool on the global scale showits importance in affecting atmospheric CO2. A great deal ofwork remains to be done to improve our assessments of the roleof soils in the global C cycle. Some areas of particularimportance are:(i) Tying soil C pools with different turnover times to specificorganic compound classes or structures found in soils, tounderstand how soil environment and plant litter qualityinteract to stabilize organic matter.(ii) Better understanding of C accumulation and turnover inwetlands and how these will be affected by climatic and landuse change. Present ecosystems models usually exclude wet-land C pools from global studies.(iii) Investigation of the role of landscape-scale disturbances,such as fire, in switching soils from net sinks to net sources ofC.FIG. 4. Turnover times for fast-cycling fractions for a number ofsites plotted against mean annual temperature: ( a) low-density C in theSierra Nevada transect (3); combined active plus slow C from theHawaii temperature transect (5); low-density C from a mature sea-sonal tropical forest in eastern Amazonia (60); ( b) using low-densityplus hydrolyzable carbon for Sierra and Brazil sites. All data representapproximately the upper 20 cm of soil. Also shown are predictedturnover time-temperature relationships estimated from theCENTURYmodel and from the literature review of Kirschbaum (51). TheCENTURY curve is based on model results reported in Schimel et al. (12)assuming the temperature dependence reported in that paper, andcombining pools assuming 5% of the C to 0–20 cm is containedmicrobial biomass pool, 20% in the detrital pool, and 50% in the slowpool.Colloquium Paper: Trumbore Proc.

Most manipulationspresently are taking place in temperate ecosystems; short-termmanipulations may yield larger signals in the tropics, whereturnover times for fast-cycling soil C are shorter.(v) For larger scale responses over longer timescales, morework needs to be done along naturally occurring environmen-tal gradients, especially those that may have been previouslystudied and may have archived soils for isotopic analysis.Data presented here are the result of collaborative work with EricDavidson, Dan Nepstad, Oliver Chadwick, Ron Amundson, JenniferHarden, Alan Townsend, Margaret Torn, and Peter Vitousek.
