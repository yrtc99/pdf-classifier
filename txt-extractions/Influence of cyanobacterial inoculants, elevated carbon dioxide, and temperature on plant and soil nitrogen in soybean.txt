The interactions of three cyano-bacterial formulations ( Anabaena laxa, Calothrix elenkinii and Anabaenatorulosa –Bradyrhizobium japonicum biofilm) on plant and soil nitrogen insoybean, were investigated under elevated CO 2and temperature conditions.Soybean plants were grown inside Open Top Chambers under ambient andelevated (550 ± 25 ppm) CO2concentrations and elevated temperature(+2.5 –2.8°C). Interactive effect of elevated CO 2and cyanobacterial inoculationthrough A. laxa and Anabaena torulosa –B. japonicum biofilm led to improvedgrowth, yield, nodulation, nitrogen fixation, and seed N in soybean crop.Nitrogenase activity in nodules increased in A. laxa and biofilm treatments,with an increase of 55% and 72%, respectively, over no cyanobacterialinoculation treatment. Although high temperature alone reduced soilmicrobial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase activity, and soil available N, thecombined effect of CO2and temperature were stimulatory; cyanobacterialinoculation further led to an increase under all the conditions. The highestseed N uptake (758 mg plant−1) was recorded with cyanobacterial biofilminoculation under elevated CO 2with control temperature conditions. Thepositive interactions of elevated CO 2and cyanobacterial inoculation,particularly through A. laxa and A. torulosa –B. japonicum biofilm inoculationhighlights their potential in counteracting the negative impact of changingclimate along with enhancing plant and soil N in soybean.J Basic Microbiol . 2022;62:1216 –1228. www.jbm-journal.com 1216 |© 2022 Wiley ‐VCH GmbH.Abbreviations: ARA, acetylene reduction assay; CFU, colony forming units; DAP, diammonium phosphate; FACE, free air carbon dioxideenrichment; GC, gas chromatograph; GI, galvanized iron; ICAR ‐IARI, Indian Council of Agricultural Research ‐Indian Agriculture ResearchInstitute; IPCC, Intergovernmental panel on climate change; IRGA, Infrared gas analyser; MBC, microbial biomass carbon; MBN, microbial biomassnitrogen; MOP, muriate of potash; OTC, Open top chambers; PGPR, Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria; PVC, polyvinyl chloride;TPF, triphenylformazan; TTC, triphenyltetrazolium chloride.KEYWORDScyanobacteria, elevated CO 2, high temperature, soil N, soybean1|INTRODUCTIONThe last few decades have witnessed a rapid rise in theearth's surface temperatures, along with an increase inthe atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases(GHGs) due to different anthropogenic activities. Carbondioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere hasincreased from 280 to 400 ppm [ 1], and the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporthas reiterated that the warming of the climate system isunequivocal [ 2]. The increased concentration of atmo-spheric CO 2has a fertilization effect on plants while anincrease in temperature shortens the crop growth periodand reduces yield [ 3–6]. A rise in temperature alsohastens organic matter mineralization [ 7] and elevatedCO 2concentrations might increase nutrient require-ments thereby causing N limitation in crop plants [ 8,9].This is supported by reports that many C3 crops grownunder elevated CO2concentrations have less proteincontent [ 10,11 ]. Leguminous crops have an advantage,due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N 2),hence, can use the additional carbon for nitrogen fixationunder elevated CO 2concentration more effectively[12,13 ]. In cropland and other managed ecosystems,leguminous crops are known to respond to high CO 2levels, as compared with other crops such as rice, maize,sorghum, and so on [ 14].Soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is an importantleguminous crop, being the richest and cheapest sourceof high ‐quality proteins and fats. Soybean grows well in awarm and moist climate. Free air carbon dioxideenrichment (FACE) studies showed an increase inaboveground biomass in soybean under elevated CO2conditions [ 15] and also a significant yield increase underelevated CO 2and temperature than ambient conditions[16]. Rogers et al. [ 13] reported that under elevated CO 2concentration, leaf nitrogen in soybean decreased at theinitial growth stages, but once the N 2fixation processwas initiated, nitrogen levels were moderated. A studyconducted in central India showed that the N require-ment in soybean will be more under elevated CO2conditions [ 17]. The legume –rhizobia symbiosis is sensi-tive to temperature, and root temperature affects theformation and development of nodules as well as itsactivity [ 18]. Although rhizobial inoculants are widelyused for enhancing the yields of leguminous crops,recent reports illustrate the significant role of augment-ing with Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR)to alleviate the negative effects of abiotic stresses likehigh‐temperature stress, sodicity, water stress, etc, andstimulating crop yields [ 19].Cyanobacteria are known for their diazotrophicpotential and are widely used as inoculants in differentcrops, besides rice [ 20,21 ]. Biofilms represent robustassemblages, with the mucilaginous sheath serving as ahabitat for one or more types of organisms, belonging tothe same/different phyla, which can survive andproliferate even under extremes of environment andfacilitate better nutrient translocation [ 22]. Beneficialbiofilms, comprising fungi/cyanobacteria/bacteria havebeen developed which can grow and colonize plant rootsto facilitate more efficient nutrient cycling and act asbiocontrol agents [ 23–25]. With their CO2sequesteringability, resilience and adaptation to abiotic stresses, andnitrogen ‐fixing potential [ 26], cyanobacteria representideal candidates for stress alleviation in soybean grownunder elevated CO2and temperature. Cyanobacteriasuch as Anabaena laxa (RPAN8) and Calothrix elenkinii(RPC1) have been evaluated for their plant ‐growth ‐promoting and biocontrol potential and found promisingin several legumes [ 12,27 ]. Earlier reports of increasedyield and biomass accumulation in mungbean crops atelevated CO2levels, using cyanobacterial inoculation[28,29 ] support our hypothesis that similar beneficialchanges may be observed in soybean. Cyanobacterialinoculation and nitrogen fixation can help in improvingsoil N status under changing climatic conditions.However, the response to cyanobacterial inoculation toboth high temperature and elevated CO2conditions, andtheir effect on crops has not been investigated. Overall,very limited information is available on the interactiveeffect of elevated CO2and temperature on soil nitrogen[30]. Hence, this study was undertaken to investigate theinteractive effect of elevated CO 2and temperature, onplant and soil nitrogen (N) in soybean receivingcyanobacterial inoculation.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Experimental setupAn experiment was conducted at the Genetics ‐Hf i e l do fICAR ‐Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), NewDelhi situated at 28°35 ʹN and 77°12 ʹEw i t ha na l t i t u d eo f228 m above mean sea level. The climate of the experimentalsite was semi ‐arid and subtropical. The mean annualmaximum and minimum temperatures were 35°C andSANYAL ET AL . |1217 15214028, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jobm.202200046 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

The seasonal mean temperature during the cropgrowth period was 28°C. Soybean variety Pusa 9712 wasgrown in pots during the Kharif season (July to October) ofthe year 2018 inside the Open Top Chambers (OTC) locatedin the field (Supporting Information: Figure S1a). The OTCswere cylindrical in shape and fabricated with galvanized iron(GI) pipe (Supporting Information: Figure S1b). The side-walls of the OTCs were made up of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)sheets having 90% transparency. The top of the OTCs waskept open to provide natural air exchange, as well as tomaintain ambient humidity and temperature [ 31]. SeparateOTCs were there for each treatment, that is, chambercontrol, elevated CO2, elevated temperature, and bothelevated CO 2plus temperature. Two levels of carbon dioxideconcentrations were maintain ed inside the OTCs, that is,ambient concentration of around 400 ppm and elevated CO 2concentration (550 ± 25 ppm). Since plants use CO 2forphotosynthesis during the daytime, the elevated CO 2levelwas maintained only during the daytime. Carbon dioxide gaswas supplied into the OTCs from CO 2gas cylinders(commercial grade) of 30 kg capacity through 6 mmp o l y u r e t h a n et u b e st om a i n t a i ne l e v a t e dC O2concentrationinside the OTCs. Desired CO 2concentration inside the OTCswas maintained using solenoid valves and rotameters [ 31].Air inside the OTCs was pumped and analyzed usingInfrared Gas Analyser (IRGA) (Supporting Information:Figure S1c). Besides CO 2, the elevated temperature was alsomaintained inside the OTCs by partially covering the upperportion of the OTCs (Support ing Information: Figure S1d).Two temperature levels, that is, chamber control andelevated temperatures were maintained. Daily maximumtemperature and minimum temperatures were recorded ineach OTC, using a digital thermometer kept within theOTCs. From the daily temperature data, daily mean andseasonal mean temperature were calculated for all the OTCs.The seasonal mean temperature in the elevated temperaturetreatment was 2.5°C higher than chamber control, while thetemperature in the elevated CO2plus temperature treatmentwas 2.8°C higher than the chamber control treatment. Soiltemperature was measured at weekly intervals using a soilthermometer and it was observed that it was 0.8°C –1°Chigher in elevated CO2plus temperature treatment than inchamber control.2.2 |Crop managementSoybean variety, Pusa 9712 was grown in pots insidethe OTCs. The bulk soil was collected from the fieldand each pot was filled with 15 kg of soil. The soil wasslightly alkaline (pH 7.8) in reaction with nonsalinenature (EC 0.47 dS m−1). It contained 0.5% organic Cand 200.4 kg ha−1available N. Soybean seeds for alltreatments were inoculated with Bradyrhizobiumjaponicum obtained from the Division of Micro-biology, ICAR ‐IARI New Delhi and coated usingcarboxymethyl cellulose (1%) as adherent, based onthe recommended rate. During sowing, diammoniumphosphate (DAP) was applied to supply a recom-mended dose of nitrogen (20 kg N ha−1) and phospho-rus (60 kg P ha−1) to the crop while muriate of potash(MOP; potassium chloride) was applied to supplypotassium (40 kg K ha−1). Four different treatmentswere used for the B. japonicum coated seeds (i) nocyanobacterial inoculation, cyanobacterial inocula-tion with (ii) Calothrix elenkinii (C. elenkinii),(iii) Anabaena laxa (A. laxa ;R P A N 8 ) ,a n d( i v )Anabaena torulosa —Bradyrhizobium japonicum bio-film. Treatment details are given in SupportingInformation: Table S1. The cyanobacterial culturesobtained from the Division of Microbiology, ICAR ‐IARI, New Delhi, were grown in Haffkine flasks withN‐free BG ‐11 medium at 27 ± 2°C, maintained at16:8 h light and dark cycles under white light(50–55μmol photons m−2s−1) for a period of 21 days[32], harvested and kept for drying. Dried sampleswere powdered, and formulations were preparedby mixing with a carrier material (Paddy strawand vermiculite 1:1 ratio). For biofilm preparation,A. torulosa and B. japonicum were grown under theirrespective optimized condi tions, with the former usedas the matrix for developing biofilms [ 23,33 ]. Har-vested biofilms were mixed with the carrier vermicu-lite: compost (1:1), keeping the cyanobacterial andrhizobial colony forming units (CFU) of inoculants as104and 108, respectively (based on plate count) and10 µg chlorophyll ag−1carrier, as optimized in earlierstudies [ 20]. Aliquots of formulations (1 g) were addedto each hole, before sowing the B. japonicum coatedseeds, as optimized earlier [ 11,34 ]. For each treatment,there were six pots. The crop was sown in the lastweek of June and three plants were maintained ineach pot.2.3 |Crop growth and yield parametersPhotosynthesis rate was recorded using Infrared GasAnalyzer (LI ‐6400XT, LiCOR) during the vegetative stageof the crop. Observations were recorded between 9:00and 11:00 a.m. in the morning on physiologicallymatured leaves. Plant samples were collected at maturityand seed weight per plant was recorded.1218 | SANYAL ET AL . 15214028, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jobm.202200046 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

The adhering soil was removed byplacing it in flowing water. The weight of roots alongwith the nodules was recorded using a weighing balance.2.4.1 |Nitrogenase activityAcetylene reduction assay (ARA), an index of nitrogenaseactivity was estimated in the root nodules with the help of agas chromatograph (GC), Model Bruker 450. Roots alongwith the nodules collected at t he flowering stage were keptin test tubes (55 ml) and sealed by stoppers. The tubes wereincubated for 1 h after replacing 10% of the air space (v/v)i n s i d et h et u b e sw i t ha c e t y l e n ef o l l o w i n gt h em e t h o d o l o g ydescribed by Prasanna et al. [ 35]. After 1 h of incubation, gassamples were analyzed in GC and the amount of ethyleneproduced was calculated and expressed as nmoles ofethylene per gram fresh weight of nodules per hour [ 12].2.5 |Collection, preparation, andprocessing of soil samplesAt the flowering stage (50 days after sowing), soilsamples were collected from each pot. Soil samples werestored in the refrigerator at 4°C.2.5.1 |Soil available nitrogenSoil samples were collected fr om three pots and analyzed fortheir available nitrogen content using the method given bySubbiah and Asija [ 36]. Soil samples were distilled withalkaline potassium permanganate (KMnO 4)a n ds o d i u mhydroxide (NaOH). The released ammonia was estimated bytitrating it with standard sulfuric acid (H 2SO4).2.5.2 |Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) andmicrobial biomass nitrogen (MBN)The MBC in soil samples collected at the flowering stagewas analyzed as per the method given by Jenkinson andPowlson [ 37]. Both fumigated and unfumigated soilsamples were extracted with 0.5 M potassium sulfate(K2SO4). The extracts were treated and digested underrefluxing conditions. Cooled samples were then titratedwith ferrous ammonium sulfate solution. The samesolution was used to extract MBN in soil by fumigationextraction method [ 37].2.5.3 |Dehydrogenase activitySoil samples collected at the flowering stage weresaturated with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)solution. The dehydrogenase activity in soils wasestimated following the method given by Klein et al.[38] and expressed as µg TPF formed g−1soil h−1.2.6 |Plant nitrogenThe crop was harvested during the third week ofOctober. After harvest, soybean seeds were collectedfrom each treatment and were dried in an oven at65 ± 2°C for 72 h. Dried samples were ground in a Wileymill and stored in an airtight container for furtheranalysis. Nitrogen concentration in soybean seeds wasanalyzed by the method given by Jackson [ 39].2.6.1 |Seed N uptakeN uptake in seed was calculated using the formula:xSeed N uptake(mg plant ) = Seed weight(mg plant ) Seed Nconcentration(%)/100 .−1−1(1)2.7 |Statistical analysisThe experiment was set up as a factorial completelyrandomized design. There were 16 treatments, with 6pots for each treatment. (Supporting Information:Table S1). Statistical analysis of the data was done withthe help of SAS software (ver. 9.3; SAS Institute Inc.).3|RESULTS3.1 |Interactive effect of elevated CO 2and temperature on growth and yield ofsoybeanThe photosynthesis rate of soybean ranged from 15.8 to24.6μmol m−2s−1in different treatments (Figure 1a).The photosynthesis rate significantly increased underSANYAL ET AL . |1219 15214028, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jobm.202200046 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseelevated CO 2conditions. Soybean plants grown withcyanobacterial biofilm inoculation showed a higherphotosynthesis rate than others. Elevated CO2levelssignificantly increased the seed weight per plant whileelevated temperature reduced seed yield (Figure 1bandTable 1). Application of cyanobacterial biofilm increasedseed weight in soybean as compared with othertreatments. The highest seed yield (10.9 g plant−1) wasrecorded in cyanobacterial biofilm applied treatmentunder elevated CO2and chamber with control tempera-ture conditions. Photosynthesis rate was found to bepositively correlated with seed weight ( r= 0.84) of thecrop (Table 2).3.2 |Interactive effect of elevated CO 2and temperature on nodulation andnitrogen fixation in soybean3.2.1 |Root and nodule weightElevated CO 2levels significantly increased root withnodule weight in soybean plants at the flowering stage ofthe crop (Figure 2a). All the three cyanobacterialinoculations significantly increased root and noduleweight per plant as compared with no cyanobacteriatreatment. Root with nodule weight was highest (5 gplant−1) in cyanobacterial biofilm treatment underelevated CO 2conditions.3.2.2 |Nitrogenase activityARA is an index of nitrogenase activity of the nodules oflegume crops. ARA was significantly higher in elevatedCO2treatment than in ambient treatment (Figure 2b).Elevated CO 2level increased nitrogenase activity by47.8% over ambient conditions at the flowering stage ofthe crop. However, high temperature decreased thenitrogenase activity by 28.8%, as compared with chambercontrol treatment. Cyanobacterial inoculation as A. laxaand biofilm significantly increased the nitrogenaseactivity in soybean nodules by 55% and 72%, respectively,over treatment with no inoculation. Positive interactionsof elevated CO2and cyanobacterial inoculation led to anoverall enhancement in nitrogenase activity at theflowering stage in soybean crops. Nitrogenase activitywas found to be positively correlated with the weight ofroot with nodules ( r= 0.78). This indicated that morenodules weight under elevated CO2conditions and withcyanobacterial inoculation led to more N 2fixation insoybean (Table 2).FIGURE 1 (a) Photosynthesis rate and (b)seed weight in soybean under elevated CO 2,high temperature, and cyanobacterialinoculation treatment at flowering stage.Column with different alphabets is significantlydifferent ( p≤0.05).1220 | SANYAL ET AL . 15214028, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jobm.202200046 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

The value of soil MBC was 314.6 μgg−1inelevated CO 2treatment, while in ambient treatment it was263.0 μgg−1. MBC significantly reduced from 314.2 to263.4 μgg−1in high ‐temperature treatment. Although hightemperature reduced the MBC of soil, in elevated CO 2plushigh‐temperature treatment, MBC was similar to chambercontrol. Elevated CO 2levels might have increased themicrobial activity as well as microbial biomass leading tohigher MBC in soils under elevated CO2plus high ‐temperature treatment. The MBC of soil in the differenttreatments ( C. elenkinii, A. laxa , and cyanobacterial biofilm)was 292.8, 283.8, and 340.7 μgg−1, respectively.3.3.2 |MBNElevated CO 2concentration significantly increased MBN ofsoil at the flowering stage of the crop (Figure 3b). Thehighest value of soil MBN (84.1 μgg−1) was recorded underelevated CO 2conditions and chamber control temperaturewith cyanobacterial biofilm inoculation. Cyanobacterialinoculation with biofilm sign ificantly increased soil MBNthan other treatments by 16.3% −20.2%. Under ambient CO2and temperature control conditions, MBN was 73.5 μgg−1incyanobacterial biofilm applied treatment while it was61.9μgg−1in treatment without cyanobacterial inoculation.3.3.3 |Dehydrogenase activityDehydrogenase activity of soil at the flowering stageranged from 1.3 to 5.6 µg TPF g−1h−1in differenttreatments (Figure 4). Elevated CO 2treatment showedsignificantly higher values of dehydrogenase activity(3.8 TPF g−1h−1) than ambient (2.9 TPF g−1h−1).

Cyanobacterial inoculation asA. laxa ,C. elenkinii , and cyanobacterial biofilm signifi-cantly increased dehydrogenase activity with values of3.2, 3.7, and 4.5 TPF g−1h−1. In all the treatments, thedehydrogenase activity of soil showed a close relation-ship with soil available N (Figure 4, SupportingInformation: Table S2).3.4 |Interactive effect of elevated CO 2and temperature on plant and soilnitrogen in soybean3.4.1 |Seed NSoybean seeds had higher nitrogen concentration underelevated CO 2concentration, while the N concentration inseeds was lower under elevated temperature conditions. SeedN concentration was 5.4% in elevated CO2conditions, whileit was 5.1% in ambient conditions (Table 1). Hightemperature reduced seed N to 5.0%, as compared with5.4% in the chamber control t reatment. Cyanobacterialinoculation with A. laxa and biofilm brought about asignificant increase in seed N concentration. The highestseed nitrogen concentration (6.9%) was recorded underelevated CO2and chamber control temperature treatmentwith cyanobacterial biofilm inoculation. Multiple linearregression analysis revealed that seed N uptake wassignificantly related to nitr ogenase activity in chambercontrol, elevated CO2, and elevated CO 2plus temperaturetreatment (Supporting Information: Table S2). But inelevated temperature treatments, seed N uptake was notsignificantly related to nitrogenase activity.Higher seed N concentration along with higher seedweight increased seed N uptake under elevated CO 2concentration.

On the other hand, the relation-ship between nitrogenase activity and soil available Nwas not significant in elevated temperature treatment.However, soil available N was found to be significantlyrelated to seed N uptake in all the treatments (SupportingInformation: Table 2).4|DISCUSSIONAn increase in atmospheric CO 2concentration is knownto enhance the productivity of C3 crops like soybean, andin managed ecosystems, leguminous crops respond toelevated CO2levels more than nonlegumes [ 14]. Underelevated CO 2conditions, legumes have an additionalbenefit over other crops due to their capacity to fixatmospheric N2[13]. But this benefit to legumes may bereduced, due to a rise in temperature, as it is one of theimportant limiting factors affecting the distributionand productivity of both crop species [ 40] and soilmicrobial communities [ 41]. In the present investigation,photosynthesis rate, seed weight, modulation, andnitrogen fixation in soybean significantly increasedunder elevated CO2concentration, with the increasedweight of root with nodules and nitrogenase activityrecorded. But the increase in temperature decreased seedweight, N2fixation, and seed N. Interactive effect ofelevated CO 2and cyanobacterial inoculation throughA. laxa and biofilm further improved the growth, yield,nodulation, nitrogen fixation, and seed N in soybeancrops. Contrasting reports on the effects of the increase intemperature on the growth and productivity of soybeanare available; some researchers illustrate reduced growth[42,43 ], while several workers reported that underelevated CO2concentration, nitrogen fixation by legumesincreases [ 12,44 ]. The positive effect of elevated CO 2onnitrogen fixation is often limited by other nutrientdeficiency [ 45], therefore, C and other macro andmicronutrients in sufficient amounts are essential forimproving productivity under these conditions. IncreasedCO2leads to greater carbon assimilation and morecarbon partitioning to roots and nodules, thereby morenodulation and nitrogen fixation. However, high temper-ature significantly reduces total nitrogenase activity insoybean crops.Land ecosystems are known to sequester carbonrapidly to counteract CO2emissions through stimulationin photosynthesis mediated carbon fixation by plants andphotosynthetic microflora [ 46]. The role of photo-synthetic microbes for CO 2sequestration is of emerginginterest as they are autotrophs and use sunlight and CO 2.Among them, diazotrophic cyanobacteria help in savingsof nitrogenous fertilizers, and also improve plant growthand soil fertility [ 26,47 ]. As they utilize CO2forphotosynthesis and evolve oxygen it can be a potentialsink for atmospheric CO 2[48]. The presence of mucilageor polysaccharide ‐rich sheath leads to the growth ofmicroorganisms as biofilms, which are robust underextremes of environment and facilitate better nutrienttranslocation. Such biofilms may comprise single, ormultiple organisms belonging to single genera or phyla[20,21 ] and can be interesting models of antagonism,synergism, and nutritional linkages. Cyanobacterialinoculation through biofilm was observed to significantlyincrease the belowground biomass of the crop, leading tothe formation of more nodules, thereby fixing moreamount of nitrogen. The study by Dey et al. [ 12]elaborated on the synergistic effect of elevated CO2andcyanobacteria in enhancing biological nitrogen fixationin cowpea crops. Enhancement of nitrogenase activity inchickpea was also recorded earlier in cyanobacteriainoculated treatments [ 21]. In this study, more N2fixation resulted in more N concentration and N uptakein soybean plants in elevated CO 2and elevated CO 2plusSANYAL ET AL . |1225 15214028, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jobm.202200046 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [11/05/2023].

Besides this, more biomassaccumulation under elevated CO2conditions and cyano-bacteria applied treatments led to increased seed N. Morecrop growth under elevated CO 2conditions and cyano-bacterial biofilm applied treatment led to the accumula-tion of more belowground biomass, and more N 2fixation. Soil biological activity also increased underelevated CO 2along with cyanobacterial inoculation.Higher N 2fixation also increased soil available N inelevated CO 2and elevated CO 2plus temperaturetreatment which further improved seed N in the soybeanplant. These organisms are promising as biofertilizingoptions and can improve crop yields as well as thenutrient status of soil [ 49]. It is well established thatcyanobacteria fix atmospheric N2leading to enhance-ment of soil available N resulting in 25% N savings[21,34,50 ]. Hence, they can help in reducing theconsumption of inorganic chemical fertilizers, providingboth economic and environmental benefits.The study illustrated that the performance of soybean interms of N 2fixation, as well as soil N, was superior tocyanobacterial biofilm inoculation under elevated CO 2andhigh‐temperature conditions. Hence, cyanobacterial inocula-tion, particularly, novel cyanobacteria ‐based biofilm devel-oped using Bradyrhizobium sp. as a partner can be exploredas a promising option to improve crop productivity, seed Ncontent and soil N status in soybean cultivation underelevated temperature and CO2scenarios.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors are thankful to PG School and Director,ICAR ‐IARI, for the fellowship provided to the firstauthor for pursuing her M.Sc. program.
