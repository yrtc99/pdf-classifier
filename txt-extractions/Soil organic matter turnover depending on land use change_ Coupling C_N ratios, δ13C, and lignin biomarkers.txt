Here, we investi-gated SOC distribution and turnover in four land use types: a wetland, cropland,forestland, and construction land in the Baiyangdian Wetland, Northern China. TheC : N ratios were up to 1.70-times larger in cropland, forestland, and constructionland than in the original wetland because of faster N losses compared to C followingwetland conversion. The δ13C values of SOC increased with depth in wetland, andshowed an overall depletion compared with the other three land use types. Acid-to-Aldehyde ratios of syringyl in wetland were 0.72 –1.14-, 0.72 –1.72-, and 1.18 –-1.43-times, and cinnamyl/vanillyl ratios were 0.56 –1.05-, 0.22 –0.48-, and 0.40 –-0.76-times those of cropland, forestland, and construction land, which reflects fasterlignin decomposition rate in wetlands. The βvalue was defined by the slope of thelinear regression between the logarithm of SOC and δ13SOC values, and decreasedfrom cropland over construction land and forestland to wetland, reflecting the fasterSOC turnover with the lower βvalues. However, SOC content and storage were upto 2.29- and 2.07-times higher in wetlands than in soils of other land use types. Thecombination of C : N ratios, δ13C, and lignin monomer composition can explain thedecrease of βvalue (corresponding to faster SOC turnover), and can be used as effec-tive proxies to evaluate the sources and turnover of SOC in response to land usechanges.KEYWORDSland use change, lignin composition, soil organic carbon turnover, stable carbon isotopes,βvalueReceived: 17 December 2019 Revised: 15 May 2020 Accepted: 10 July 2020DOI: 10.1002/ldr.3720Land Degrad Dev. 2021;32:1591 –1605. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ldr © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 15911|INTRODUCTIONAnthropogenic disturbances such as land use change (Don,Schumacher, & Freibauer, 2011; Yu, Lu, Tian, & Canadell, 2019,including deforestation (Fujisaki, Perrin, Garric, Balesdent, &Brossard, 2017), agriculture (Poeplau & Don, 2015), and urban devel-opment (Sica, Quintana, Radeloff, & Gavier-Pizarro, 2016) have verystrongly depleted SOC stocks with a substantial release of CO2intothe atmosphere (Sanderman, Hengl, & Fiske, 2017). Based on a meta-analysis, including 160 sites of 7 land use change types in 29 countries,C stocks were found to be reduced at the average rate of0.39 Mg ha−1yr−1across all land use changes (Deng, Zhu, Tang, &Shangguan, 2016). Wu, Guo, and Peng (2003) assessed that land usechange decreased SOC by approximately 7.1 Pg during 1997 –2007because of average SOC density decreases of 0.8 kg C m−2for culti-vated soils within semiarid/semihumid areas. Zhu et al. (2020) showedthat conversion (>60 years) of two marshes to cropland decreasedSOC storage by up to 3.1-times at 0 –30 cm depth in Northern China.The conversion of peatland to flooded forest accelerates the decom-position of plant litter and SOC in tropical wetlands and thus influ-ences SOC pools in wetlands (Sjögersten et al., 2014). However, Postand Kwon (2000) reported that SOC sequestration increased at anaverage of 33 t C ha−1yr−1during the 100 years following farmlandconversion into grasslands and forests. Therefore, whether thedecrease or increase in the SOC stocks by land use changes dependson the change types and conversion chronosequence.Wetlands cover only /C246% of the Earth's land surface and storeabout one-third of the total SOC pool in terrestrial ecosystems,whereas more than 70% of C is stored in the top 100 cm (Nahlik &Fennessy, 2016). Half of the world's wetlands have been degraded,altered, or even lost owing to anthropogenic activities over the past150 years (Hu, Niu, Chen, Li, & Zhang, 2017; Kirwan &Megonigal, 2013; Zhao et al., 2016). The contribution of land usechange to anthropogenic CO2emissions is about 12 –15% of totalanthropogenic emissions at a rate of 1.2 Pg yr−1(Deng et al., 2016).For example, land use change contributed approximately 36% of theanthropogenic CO 2emissions into the atmosphere during 1985 –2000(Houghton, 2007). Wetlands are one of the most important types ofterrestrial ecosystems suffering from land use change. Losses of SOCin wetlands caused by land use change through human activities areone of the greatest sources of anthropogenic C emissions (Petrescuet al., 2015). Thus, it is urgent that we better understand how theseland conversions influence soil physicochemical properties controllingthe SOC dynamics.Stable carbon isotope signature ( δ13C) and C : N ratios are power-ful tools to elucidate sources, mixing and transformations of SOC interrestrial, estuarine, coastal, and marine soils (Khan, Vane, &Horton, 2015; Sasmito et al., 2020). The δ13C composition can pro-vide evidence of SOC turnover (Guillaume, Damris, &Kuzyakov, 2015; Zhao et al., 2019), because plant residues are themain source of SOC, and δ13C also reflects the combined effects ofthe residues δ13C signature and consecutive fractionation processes(Brüggemann et al., 2011; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014). Monitoring ofδ13C of SOC through land use change provides an effective approachto appraise microbial decomposition rates and organic matter turn-over (Blagodatskaya, Yuyukina, Blagodatsky, & Kuzyakov, 2011;Drollinger, Kuzyakov, & Glatzel, 2019; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014;Wang, Wei, et al., 2017). The C : N ratio is another important indicatorof the quality and degree of SOC degradation (Batjes, 2014), espe-cially in wetlands (Drollinger et al., 2019). Ratios of C : N in soils usu-ally changes in response to land use changes, and thus reflect SOCstability and decomposition that further affect SOC storing capacity(Wang, Sardans, et al., 2014).Empirical models showed a significant fit of linear regressionbetween the logarithm of SOC content and its δ13C for most of thesoils worldwide. The slope of the linear regression (defined as the βvalue) indicates a proxy for SOC turnover (e.g., Acton, Fox, Campbell,Rowe, & Wilkinson, 2013; Wang et al., 2018; Wang, Wei, et al., 2017;Zhao et al., 2019). In detail, Acton et al. (2013) supported that a pro-nounced negative slope (the βvalue) is indicative for C isotopic frac-tionation during decomposition and physical mixing processes of SOCturnover across cold temperate to tropical forests. Wang, Wei,et al. (2017) found significant relationships between βvalue and SOCdecomposition rate along a 2,200 km semiarid grassland transect,North China, and the13C enrichment was mainly due to isotopic frac-tionation during SOC microbial decomposition. Wang et al. (2018)analyzed the βvalues with climate factors, soil properties, litter androot decomposition rates from 176 soil profiles worldwide, and dem-onstrated the efficiency of δ13C for SOC turnover on large spatial andtemporal scales. Zhao et al. (2019) monitored the βvalues to studySOC dynamics in soils of differently degraded alpine meadows. Theseecosystems had C3 plants, C4 plants, no plants, vegetation changesecotone under environmental impact and human intervention. Thesefindings showed that βvalue is affected by the interactions of meanannual temperature, mean annual precipitation, soil texture, C : Nratios, aridity index, litter and root decomposition rates under differ-ent ecosystems, which provides an approach to SOC turnover inresponse to land use and global climate change.Lignin is one of the most abundant components of higher plants interrestrial ecosystems and represents an important part of plant-derivedC input into soils. Because of the high litter input into soils and thechemical recalcitrance (abundant aromatic structures), lignin is consid-ered as an important source of SOC (Zhu et al., 2019). Lignin contains asuite of single-ring phenol compounds, including vanillyl (V), syringyl (S),and cinnamyl (C). The contents and ratios of these phenol compoundsare biochemical indicators of sources and state of decomposition of lig-nin and SOC (Thevenot, Dignac, & Rumpel, 2010).Early studies of SOC turnover were based on bulk proxies such asC : N ratios and δ13C and δ15N in response to land use changes(Andrews, Greenaway, & Dennis, 1998; Del Galdo, Six, Peressotti, &Francesca Cotrufo, 2003; Geissen et al., 2009; Zhang, Dang, Zhang, &Cheng, 2015). These analyses are useful for distinguishing SOC of dif-ferent land use types in simple, two-end-member systems, but SOCsources are more complex and often have overlapping values (Cloern,Canuel, & Harris, 2002). For example, Li et al. (2016) used δ13C,δ15Nand C/N ratios to assess the sources and fate of SOM from wetland1592 XIA ET AL. 1099145x, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.3720 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Biomarker can pro-vide a detailed information in describing SOC molecular compositionand stability, increasing the ability to distinguish the SOM sourcesafter one land-use conversion to other systems (Fisher et al., 2003).Recently, the application of lignin biomarkers to wetland systems hasincreased dramatically, and the combination of lignin monomer com-position, C : N ratios, and δ13C has contributed substantially to ourcognition to study the SOC stocks, stability and sources under landuse changes.The present debate on global warming highlights the demand forcontinuing research on SOC sequestration and management, espe-cially in converted or coastal wetlands. The pursuit of socio-economicbenefits accelerated wetland loss and conversion to other land usetypes (Sica et al., 2016). Until now, many investigations have evalu-ated the changes of SOC after the conversion of wetlands to agricul-ture (Wang, Wang, Feng, Guo, & Chen, 2014) and forestry activities(Ramesh et al., 2019), pastures (Steinman, Conklin, Bohlen, &Uzarski, 2003), aquaculture (Yang et al., 2018), and urbanizationdevelopment (Pouyat, Yesilonis, & Nowak, 2006), but the depths ofsoil sampling in these studies were less than 30 cm (e.g., Chen,Arrouays, Angers, Martin, & Walter, 2019; Xu et al., 2017). Many ofthese studies have just compared SOC contents, fractions, aggregate-associated organic C and stocks (e.g., dos Santos et al., 2019; Huoet al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020) rather than SOCsources, stability and the mechanisms controlling SOC turnoverbetween wetlands and other land use types. For example, Huoet al. (2018) found that dissolved organic carbon, microbial bio-mass carbon, readily oxidized carbon and readily mineralized car-b o ni nap a d d yf i e l dw e r el o w e rt h a nt h o s ei nn a t u r a lw e t l a n db y13.8, 35.1, 59.0, and 17.9%, respectively. Wang, Song, Wang, andSong (2012) found the distribution and SOC of soil aggregateswere decreased from wetland conversion to cropland, and <53 μmand >1,000 μm soil aggregate size classes were more sensitive toland use change. Little is known about the response of δ13C,βvalue, and lignin phenols composition by land use conversion(Guillaume et al., 2015).The Baiyangdian wetland is of importance in Hebei Province ofNorthern China, especially in the context of construction ofXiong'an New Area. The Baiyangdian Wetland and adjacent areasare excellent examples of land use changes of wetland conversionto cropland, forestland, or cons truction land. We measured soilorganic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC), total nitrogen(TN), δ13Co fS O C( δ13C-SOC), and lignin phenols composition.B a s e do nt h i sd a t a ,w ec a l c u l a t e dt h e βvalue and various character-istic ratios, such as lignin monomer composition (V%, S%, and C%),their monomer ratios (C/V, S/V) a nd Acid-to-Aldehyde ratios (Ad-to-Al) in soils up to 1.0 m depth. The objectives of this study wereto evaluate the effects of wetland conversion to cropland, forest-land, or construction land on: (a) SOC stocks and propertiesdepending on soil depth; (b) soil C : N ratio, δ13C signature, βvalueand lignin phenols; and finally; (c) the assessment of SOC stabilityand fate to reveal mechanisms a nd controlling factors afterwetlands conversion to other three land use types. Thus, a compre-hensive understanding of the distribution and turnover of SOC invarious land use types will allow to predict the response of wetlandconversion to intensive land use.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Study sites descriptionThe Baiyangdian wetland (N38/C14–39/C14N, E115/C14–116/C14E) is located inalluvial lowland of the Yongding River and the Hutuo River of HebeiProvince, and it is the largest freshwater lake wetland (366 km2)o fthe North China Plain (Figure S1). The mean annual precipitation(MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) are 564 mm and 12.1/C14C,respectively. The rainy season is mainly in June –August. The warmestmonth is July, and coldest month is January. Land use types in thisarea are mainly wetland, cropland, forestland, and construction land(Table 1; Zhang, Gong, Zhao, & Duo, 2016).2.2 |Sample collectionField sampling was conducted in September 2018. Before the sam-pling, the land use history was investigated integrated with field inter-views with local leaders and villagers, and land use database. Threeindependent replicate sites were selected for each land use type, atotal of 12 sampling sites. We gathered general background informa-tion of each sampling site by consulting with farmers or land-ownersto select replicates with similar management practices (Table 1). Eachindependent replicate soil is a mixed soil homogenized from threesubsamples (with a distance of <50 m). Soil samples were collected atthe depths of 0 –10, 10 –20, 20 –30, 30 –40, 40 –60, 60 –80, and80–100 cm using a soil auger. Before the analysis, visible stones androot residues were removed. Soil samples were air-dried in the shadeat room temperature, then gently ground and sieved through a0.15 mm sieve.2.3 |Soil carbon fraction and nitrogen analysisBulk density (BD, g cm−3) was determined by the cutting ring method(100 cm3) and weighting the dry weight. Soil samples (about 0.50 g)were acidified with 1.0 mol L−1HCl (20 mL) to remove carbonates, andthen washed 3 –4-times with distilled water until neutral reaction. Thecontent of TC, TN in bulk soils and SOC in acidified soils were measuredusing an Elementar Vario EL III (Elementar Analysensysteme, GmbH,Germany). The SIC content was estimated by subtracting the SOC con-tent from TC content. The equation is as follows:SIC = TC −SOCWe then calculated SOC storage (SOCs) as follows:XIA ET AL. 1593 1099145x, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.3720 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Rela-tive isotope abundances are denoted as δ-values, which is calculatedusing the following equation:δ‰ðÞ =RsampleRstandard−1/C18/C19×1000Where :Rsample andRstandard are the ratios of13Ct o12C of the sampleand respective standard.2.4 |Soil lignin analysisFor lignin phenol analysis, soil samples (about 1.00 g) were mixed with1.00 g copper oxide (CuO), 0.10 g ammonium iron (II) sulphate [Fe(NH 4)2(SO 4)2/C16H2O] and 15 mL of nitrogen (N 2)-purged NaOH solu-tion (2 mmol L−1) in Teflon-lined bombs. Then all bombs were flushedwith N 2in the headspace for 10 min and heated at 150/C14C for 2.5 hr inan oven. The lignin oxidation products (LOPs) were incorporated witha surrogate standard (ethyl vanillin) to calculate the sample recoveryrate. The LOPs were concentrated to dryness under a gentle streamof N2, and derivatized with N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide(BSTFA) and pyridine at 70/C14C for 3 hr to yield trimethylsilyl (TMS)derivatives for quantification (Ma et al., 2018).Trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of LOPs were quantified usinginternal standards on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupledwith an 7010B TQ mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) usinga DB-5MS column (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm). A constant currentmode was used, with a controlled flow rate of carrier gas (high-purityHe; 1.0 mL min−1). Oven temperature increased from 65 to 300/C14Ca ta rate of 6/C14C min−1with final isothermal hold at 300/C14C for 5 min. Themass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode (EI) at70 eV and scanned with MRM. Vanillyl (vanillin, acetovanillone, van-illic acid), syringyl (syringaldehyde, acetosyringone, syringic acid), andcinnamyl ( p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid) of VSC phenols were summa-rized to represent lignin content in soils. Lignin content was normal-ized to SOC content to reflect its relative abundance in SOC (Zhuet al., 2019).2.5 |Statistical analysesData were checked for homogeneity of variance and normality beforeanalysis. The results were expressed with the mean ± SE. SOC con-tent, SOC stock, δ13C-SOC, SIC content and lignin phenols wereassessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and com-pared the significance ( p< .05) with Tukey's test by SPSS ver.21.0.We conducted an ordinary least squares ( OLS) regression analysisbetween the log10-transformed SOC content and δ13C for each soildepth profile. The slope of the regression was defined as the βvalue,which is considered as a proxy for SOC turnover (Acton et al., 2013;Zhao et al., 2019; Figure 2a).3|RESULTS3.1 |Depth distribution of total carbon, totalnitrogen, and carbon: Nitrogen ratios in soilsConverting wetland to forestland increased TC contents by12.8–27.6% in the top 40 cm, but converting to cropland andTABLE 1 Geographic locations and short description of the sampling sites in Baiyangdian Wetland, Northern ChinaSites Geographic location Land use types Land use changeWetland 1 E115/C1459.4070, N38/C1452.2120Reeds Natural wetlandWetland 2 E116/C1400.0000, N38/C1452.0710Reeds Natural wetlandWetland 3 E115/C1456.7760, N38/C1449.4000Reeds Natural wetlandCropland 1 E115/C1458.9520, N38/C1452.7680Wheat-corn rotation /C2410 years, close to wetlandCropland 2 E115/C1458.1120, N38/C1452.4660Wheat-corn rotation >30 yearsCropland 3 E115/C1458.8420, N38/C1446.2400Wheat-corn rotation >40 yearsForestland 1 E115/C1457.4550, N38/C1451.6500Poplar trees 8 –10 years, close to wetlandForestland 2 E115/C1454.3260, N38/C1453.8400Poplar trees 15 –20 yearsForestland 3 E115/C1458.8400, N38/C1446.2440Poplar trees >30 yearsConstruction land 1 E115/C1458.9480, N38/C1450.8390Village 5 –8 years, close to wetlandConstruction land 2 E115/C1458.1120, N38/C1452.4660Village 15 –20 yearsConstruction land 3 E115/C1458.6320, N38/C1449.2680Village >30 years1594 XIA ET AL. 1099145x, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.3720 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The TC contentsbelow 40 cm were almost equivalent for all land use types (13.8 –-15.7 g kg−1) (Figure S2A).

Moreover, thedegree of decreased SOC content with soil depth was far lower thanthe other three land use types (Figures 1b and S3A).SOC storage above 0 –30 cm (4.87 kg C m−2) and below30–100 cm (8.27 kg C m−2) in wetland were 41.8, 34.6, and 76.2%and 67.6, 63.3, and 73.8% higher than in cropland, forestland and con-struction land, respectively.

The δ13C values increased with the depth in wetland;while decreased in cropland; the δ13C values increased above 30 cmin forestland, then it did not vary evidently below 30 cm; for construc-tion land, the δ13C values overall kept a slight decline in the differentsoil layers (Figures 1d and S3C).The slope of the linear regression between the logarithm of SOCandδ13C values of SOC (defined as the βvalue) indicates a proxy forSOC turnover (Figure 2a). The wetland had the lowest βvalues(−3.54), followed by forestland ( −2.13) and construction land ( −0.21),and then cropland with the highest βvalues (1.95). The βvalues dif-fered significantly ( p< .05) between wetland and the other three landuse types (Figure 2b).3.3 |The distribution of plant-derived ligninphenols in soilsThe contents of plant-derived phenols decreased with soil depth. Theplant-derived phenols decreased ( p< .05) after wetland conversion tocropland, forestland and construction land (Figures 3 and S4). Vanillylphenols increased by 1.83 –9.40, 19.4 –40.5, and 9.88 –32.9% afterwetland conversion to cropland, forestland, and construction land,respectively; Cinnamyl phenols decreased by 4.26 –37.8, 40.8 –72.3,and 9.27 –49.1%, respectively; and syringyl phenols overall increased,but the variance was irregular. Syringyl phenols had the highest per-cent (40 –50%) accounting for total lignin phenols, while cinnamylphenols had the lowest percent (5 –20%), and vanillyl phenolsaccounted for 30 –50% in four land use types (Figure S5).4|DISCUSSION4.1 |Effects of land use change on soil organiccarbon distributionSOC content is considerably depleted after wetland conversion toother land use types, which is consistent with other studies(e.g., Fenstermacher, Rabenhorst, Lang, McCarty, & Needelman, 2016;Guillaume et al., 2015; Hopkinson, Cai, & Hu, 2012; Jinbo, Chang-chun, & Shenmin, 2007). The percent of SOC in TC was more than70% in the topsoil (0 –30 cm), and decreased to ≤50% below the30 cm in wetland. The proportions of SOC in wetland were far morethan the other three land use types, which were especially evident inthe subsoil (Figure S6). Based on our investigations, when wetland isconverted to cropland, crop biomass is usually manually or mechani-cally removed (e.g., crushed to feed livestock or burnt for heating),which resulted in a very strong reduction in the input of plant resi-dues. Mechanical tillage disrupts soil aggregates and thus acceleratethe SOC decomposition via exposing organic macromolecules to air orbiological attack (Aziz, Mahmood, & Islam, 2013; Choudhuryet al., 2014). Although forestland is natural and human disturbancesare very small, the arid conditions may not be conducive to the accu-mulation of SOC in North China. In addition, the substancesdecomposed faster under aerobic conditions, especially for complexand phenolic compounds (Yu, Xie, Khan, & Shen, 2019). ForFIGURE 2 Theoretical trends of SOC (red line) and carbon stable isotopic composition ( δ13C) (blue line) with depth in undisturbed soils.

However, we found the decreasedegree of SOC contents below 30 cm was also equivalent than thatabove 30 cm when wetland is converted to cropland, forestland, andconstruction land (Figure 1b), which indicated that SOC in subsoil canalso be reduced by land use changes (Wiesmeier et al., 2012). Surfacesoil is exposed to air and thus subjected to the intensive aerobicdecomposition, while deeper soil in wetlands is generally subjected toanaerobic decomposition due to high water contents (Wang, Song,et al., 2012). The decay of detritus under anaerobic environments ismuch slower than under aerobic conditions (Page, Rieley, &Banks, 2011), which resulted in a larger SOC accumulation in deeperlayers compared to other land use types. The dissolved organic carbon(DOC), root biomass, and root exudates are the primary SOC sourcesin subsoil (Hafner & Kuzyakov, 2016; Rumpel & Kögel-Knabner, 2011).IPCC (2003) recommended soil sampling depth of 30 cm for evalua-tion of SOC change with land use change. Most investigations(e.g., Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018) of SOC losses after landuse change only focused on the topsoil (0 –30 cm), where containedhigh SOC contents and was mainly affected by human disturbanceand environmental factors. The changes of C pools in the top 30 cmare likely to be fast enough to be detected (IPCC, 2003). Thus, currentstudies often ignored the SOC dynamics in subsoil. Generally, SOChas a turnover time up to hundreds or thousands of years in deep soilsand is relatively stable in response to land use change (Hou, Chen,Chen, He, & Zhu, 2019). Previous investigations (e.g., Huoet al., 2018; Ma et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2015) have also demon-strated that SOC in subsoil can be decreased when wetland wasconverted to other land use types. We found SOC storage in the sub-soil (30 –100 cm) was much higher than that in the topsoil (0 –30 cm)for four land use types (Figure 1c), which implies the capability ofSOC storage in subsoil. The global estimate of SOC storage was in therange of 684 –724 Pg of C in the top 30 cm, and 1,462 –1,548 Pg of Cin the top 100 cm (Batjes, 2014), thus subsoil could have the potentialto sequester high SOC amounts (Salome, Nunan, Pouteau, Lerch, &Chenu, 2010; Poeplau & Don, 2013). Therefore, only focusing on sur-face soil would give an incomplete estimation for the SOC changesafter land conversion. We recommend that soil sampling depth infuture studies should be up to 100 cm to assess changes of SOCstocks through land use changes.The time scale of wetland conversion years is different and notprecise (Table 1). SOC content and storage overall decreased with theconversion period after wetland conversion to forestland and con-struction land, but not to cropland (Table S1), but the decrease wasnot linear with the age of wetland conversion. This agreed with otherstudies (e.g., Cui et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2016; Wang, Liu,et al., 2012), for example, Wang, Liu, et al. (2012) reported bothorganic carbon in bulk soils and water-stable aggregates decreasedafter native wetland conversion to cultivated cropland, and the age of16 cultivation years was regarded as the threshold point of short- andlong-term effects. Concluding, potential of SOC sequestrationdepends not only on the age of wetland conversions, but also on con-version types, initial soil properties of original wetlands, hydrologicalconditions after conversions, and climate factors on a global scale.4.2 |Effects of land use change on βvaluesdepending on carbon: Nitrogen ratios and δ13CSoil C/N ratio indicates vegetation N availability and uptake, andnature and intensity of organic matter mineralization processes, thuscharacterizing an important indicator of the quality and degree ofSOC degradation, and microbial transformation processes(Batjes, 2014). Vascular plants with higher cellulose and lower proteincontent implied a reduced N availability due to greater C/N ratios(>20) compared with algae (<10). A lower C : N ratio implies a higherdegree of SOC decomposition (Paul, 2016). Many studies showed it isbeneficial for the microbial decomposition of SOC when the C : Nratio is lower than 25:1 (e.g., Cleveland & Liptzin, 2007; Yuet al., 2010). However, changes in soil C : N ratios after land usechange would induce alteration of SOC decomposition. Based on adata-assimilation approach, Xu et al. (2016) reported a negative rela-tionship between the SOC decomposition rate and the C : N ratios. Inour study, C : N ratios evidently increased from wetland (10.9 –13.9)conversion to cropland (11.9 –21.7), forestland (13.8 –19.6), and con-struction land (10.7 –18.7). It implies higher SOC decomposition rates0204060801000 5 10 15 20Soil depth (cm)Soil lignin content (mg g-1OC)WetLandCropLandForestConstrLandFIGURE 3 Vertical distributions of lignin phenols ( Λ8) dependingon soil depth and land use type.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensein wetlands compared with the other three land use types, however,wetland had the highest SOC contents. Similarly, Powers and Schle-singer (2002) have reported that SOC content was inversely propor-tional to the SOC decomposition rate. In our study, dry –wet cyclesoften occur in wetland, and the sampling sites were not in the peren-nial flooded environment (the water level is about −80 cm, evenbelow −100 cm). Thus, the lower C : N ratios and favorable watercontent may contribute to the reproduction of aerobic microorgan-isms, and further accelerates SOC decomposition and nutrient avail-ability including aggregate destruction and increased SOCmineralization (Denef et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2016; Harrison-Kirk,Beare, Meenken, & Condron, 2014). Jiang et al. (2013) also demon-strated that the SOC decomposition rate was negatively related toC : N ratios in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau, that is, soilCO2emission rate was faster associated with lower C : N ratios. TheC : N ratio also indirectly indicates the SOC sources. A lower C : Nratio can indicate organic matter from the sea sources(Redfield, 1963), while a higher C : N ratio can indicate organic matterfrom terrestrial sources (Naik, Naqvi, & Araujo, 2017). Algae typicallyhave C : N ratios from 5 to 8, while vascular terrestrial plants have theC : N ratios higher than 15 (Meyers, 1994). However, the soil C : Nratios ( /C2410:1) in study wetland were in the middle of terrestrialorganic matter and marine sediments, which indicated a mixture ofterrestrial and few marine sources. This is because Baiyangdian Wet-land is largely a lake through which run many rivers that finally flowinto the ocean, and the topography is formed by the repeated evolu-tion of the lake and the ocean (Chen et al., 2017; Wang, Min, Dong,Yao, & Chi, 2015).Theδ13C values of surface soils directly reflect C inputs from cur-rent plant litter (Bird, Veenendaal, & Lloyd, 2004), but have a smallisotopic shift due to13C fractionation by microbial transformations(Werth & Kuzyakov, 2010). The δ13C composition of plants is mainlycontrolled by their photosynthesis type (i.e., C3 or C4) and is alsoinfluenced by environmental factors (Kohn, 2010; Wang et al., 2013).Plants via the C3 photosynthetic pathway have δ13C values varyingfrom−22‰to−32‰(mean, −27‰), while δ13C values of C4 plantsvary from −9t o−17‰(mean, −13‰) (Alonso-Cantabrana & vonCaemmerer, 2016). The average δ13C value in wetland was −24.2‰,which was within the range of the δ13C values for general C3 plants.It implied that SOC was mainly sourced from the input and decompo-sition of fresh litter of Phragmites australis dominated in theBaiyangdian Wetland. Importantly, the δ13C values of C3 plants inwetter conditions are likely to be more depleted δ13C than those indrier regions (Bowling, Pataki, & Randerson, 2008), because highhumidity/precipitation can increase and strengthen stomatal conduc-tance while to increase the Pi/Pa ratio (Farquhar, O'Leary, &Berry, 1982). Therefore, δ13C values in wetland soils were relativelymore negative than other land use change types (Figure 1d). Themaize (C4) –wheat (C3) rotation has been used by farmers in croplandsof North China. Therefore, the generally enriched δ13C values couldbe partly ascribed to the increased proportions of C4 plant-derived Cin soils when converted from wetland to cropland, especially in thetillage horizon. For the forestland soils, it was in the middle of wetlandand cropland, because all woody plants belong to C3 plants. The aver-ageδ13C values in construction land were equivalent to wetland, butwere enriched in δ13C in the topsoil and depleted δ13C in the subsoil,and this is because no plants are growing in the construction landconverted from wetland.δ13C of SOC generally increases with soil depth (e.g., Brunn,Spielvogel, Sauer, & Oelmann, 2014; Guillaume et al., 2015; Wang,Wei, et al., 2017). δ13C changes with soil depth are related to fourprocesses: (a) physical mixing (Bird et al., 2004; Brunn et al., 2014),showing that it increased promoted homogenization of soil columnbased on one process-based modeling, and in return decreased theδ13C gradients with depth (Acton et al., 2013); (b) microbial decompo-sition (Gautam, Lee, Song, & Bong, 2017; Wang, Wei, et al., 2017), thisis one commonly held cognition that isotopic fractionation oftenoccurs during microbial decomposition (Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014).Microbes degrade12C more readily than13C during SOC decomposi-tion (Lerch, Nunan, Dignac, Chenu, & Mariotti, 2011), and thus theresidual SOC is enriched more13C components in deeper soil layers(Diochon & Kellman, 2008; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014). The ratio ofbacteria to fungi increased with soil depth, which may be beneficial toenriched13C with the depth, as bacteria are more enriched in13Ccompared with fungi (Kohl et al., 2015); (c) root zone, where increasedproportions of roots (13C enriched) relative to shoots (13C depleted)may also enrich SOC with13C in deeper soils (Werth &Kuzyakov, 2010); (d) Suess effect, leading to much faster13C deple-tion of the topsoil compared to the subsoil (Eide, Olsen, Ninnemann, &Eldevik, 2017). δ13C values increased with the increasing soil depth inwetland that related to perennial root litter from P. australis . Com-bined with the above, microbial decomposition was one of the mostimportant factors to control the δ13C gradient with soil depth becauseof lower C : N ratios and suitable water conditions for microbes inwetlands. In our sites, the water level was about −80 cm in wetland,even blow −100 cm, and thus physical mixing might be one of the lim-ited factors to exert the δ13C gradient with depth. In addition,P. australis has a developed perennial root system, which is conduciveto form the δ13C gradient. When converted to forestland, the δ13Cvalue increased above 30 cm, then presented a steady state below30–100 cm, and this is possibly related to fine roots enriched in13Ci nthe 0–30 cm soil layer. It ranged from −24.0 to −24.4‰ofδ13C valuein all depths in construction land, which is mainly caused by less exis-ting microbes, no root functions, and weak physical mixing. However,δ13C value appeared a decreasing tendency with soil depth after wet-land conversion to cropland, which is related to long-term farmingwith the changes of vegetable type, and further studies are needed asfor whether there are other factors involved, including irrigation andfertilization (Cui et al., 2009; Yao, Wang, Liu, & Song, 2011).Many studies showed that changes in SOC and δ13Ca l o n gt h es o i lprofile were correlated with isotopic fractionation (e.g., Actonet al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018; Wang, Wei, et al., 2017; Werth &Kuzyakov, 2010; Zhao et al., 2019). The relationship between SOC turn-over and soil δ13C enrichment was confirmed by C isotope mass balancemodeling, a meta-analysis (Acton et al., 2013) and laboratory analyses ofSOC decomposition (Wang, Wei, et al., 2017). Generally, higher SOC1598 XIA ET AL. 1099145x, 2021, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.3720 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseturnover rates and faster microbial decomposition rates result in lower βvalues (Acton et al., 2013). In our study, the βvalues increased fromwetland < forestland < construction land < cropland, which indicated theturnover rate of SOC was wetland > forestland > construction land-> cropland. This is completely contrary to C : N ratios ofwetland < construction land < forestland < cropland. Similarly, Zhaoet al. (2019) proposed that the C : N ratios was a determinant factor thatexplained 67.5% variance of the βvalue. Wang, Wei, et al. (2017) alsoidentified a significant relationship between the C : N ratio and βvalue.Microbial decomposition is faster in soils with lower C : N ratios, whichdecreases the βvalue (Acton et al., 2013). Therefore, low C : N ratios areinterrelated to the SOC decomposition rate with lower βvalues. Con-cluding, the δ13C integrated with C : N ratios is an effective method todistinguish the sources and decomposition of SOC that determines the βvalue for characterizing SOC dynamics through land use changes(Figure 7). However, whether βvalue under complex ecosystems can beused to constrain decomposition rates and controls on SOC turnover isyet to be explored at the large regional and global scale.4.3 |Effects of land use change on lignindistribution characteristicsThe SOC stability also depends on labile and recalcitrant fractions,and their molecular structures. Relative to a labile C, the dominantproportion of SOC is the recalcitrant (Lian et al., 2018). Lignin is con-sidered as a recalcitrant organic C due to its nonhydrolyzable C Cand C OC bonds and the richness of aromatic structures (Crowet al., 2009). Therefore, lignin is generally considered to be an impor-tant indicator for assessing SOC quality and long-term SOCsequestration.(a) (b)FIGURE 4 The linear relationships between soil lignin phenols and SOC content (a), δ13C values of SOC (b).

The sum of VSC phenols(a quantitative measure of lignin), increased with SOC content(R2= 0.29, p< .01; Figure 4a), indicating that lignin plays an importantrole in SOC quality and storage. Biomarkers take advantage of theunique biochemical classes that make up different maternal vegeta-tion carrier as well as the geochemical stability of specific biochemi-cals under different land use types (Fisher et al., 2003). The Ad-to-Alratio is an indicator of the lignin degradation state, that is, the Ad-to-Al ratios of V and S units will increase accompanied by the increase ofSOC decomposition. The Ad-to-Al ratios of S unit in all soil layersoverall decreased when wetland was converted to other land usetypes (Figure 5), suggesting a state that easier to decompose bymicrobes in wetland soils, and no differences in the Ad-to-Al ratios ofV unit were found in soils of all land use types. The Ad-to-Al ratios ofS unit overall decreased with the depth, implying the decompositionrate of lignin phenols in the topsoil was larger than in the subsoil(Figure 5). We cannot only deduce the decomposition degree of ligninbased on the Ad-to-Al ratios of S unit, because lignin decomposition isrelated to C : N ratios in soils, soil substrate quality, and environmen-tal factors (Thevenot et al., 2010).The decomposition rate of the three lignin monomers increasefrom V through S to C (i.e., V phenols is most difficult to degrade).Thus, C/V and S/V are also used to indicate the stability and decom-position degree of lignin in soils (Bahri et al., 2006). Wetland had themost C phenols and lowest V phenols compared to other three landuse change types (Figure S5). The C- and S-to-V ratios are often usedas source indicators (Thevenot et al., 2010). C/V in soils of wetlandand cropland varied from 0.35 to 0.70, and S/V varied from 1.02 to1.66 (Figure 5). Consequently, the sources of lignin phenols arederived from nonwoody angiosperm tissues (Anw), while C/V values inFIGURE 6 S/V versus C/V scatter plot with boundaries of fourplant sources (referred from Jex et al., 2014).

Both C/V and S/V decreasewith the depth (Figure 5), reflecting the decreasing contribution ofplant litter to lignin accumulation in subsoil (Figure 7). Consequently,despite lignin sources differ between vegetation types, and thedecomposition led to similar lignin characteristics in soils, onlyinherited some differences in (Ad/Al)sand C/V from the lignin sourcesin plant litter (Wang, Tian, et al., 2017). These processes diminish thedifferences in lignin content and its biogeochemical characteristics insoils (Walela et al., 2014; Xie, Xie, & Xiao, 2019). These resultssupported the hypothesis of 'biochemical convergence', suggesting lit-ter chemistry will eventually tend to common chemistry after trans-formations in soils (Bore, Kuzyakov, & Dippold, 2019; Wickings,Grandy, Reed, & Cleveland, 2012).In all plant tissues, lignin is13C depleted by 2 –6‰compared withthe whole-plant material and by 4 –7‰compared with cellulose(Benner, Fogel, Sprague, & Hodson, 1987). A negative relationshipbetween the contents of VSC phenols and δ13C (Figure 4b) is causedby the differences in the decomposition degree of individual plant lit-ter components. The polysaccharides are degraded 2 –5 times morequickly than the lignin, which result in the gradual enrichment of plantdetritus in lignin-derived C (Rejmánková & Houdková, 2006).5|CONCLUSIONSLand conversion of wetland to cropland, forestland and constructionland altered the quality of organic C inputs and hydrological condi-tions. The C : N ratios and δ13C values increased with soil depth inwetland, and were overall lower than other three land use types. The(Ad/Al) sand C/V from the lignin sources in soils increased when wet-land was converted to other three land use types. The C : N ratios,δ13C, and soil lignin composition characteristics explained large pro-portions of the variance in lowest βvalue in wetland, and lower βvalue is characterized as higher SOC turnover. Wetland had thehighest SOC content and storage. Based on our field investigations,this is caused by litter inputs (e.g., plant litter quality and biomass),hydrological conditions (e.g., drying –wetting cycles, unflooded condi-tions) and soil physicochemical properties (e.g., C : N ratios) and lead-ing to large variance in SOC turnover rate. The C : N ratios, δ13C, andlignin monomer composition are combined tools to evaluate thesources, decomposition and SOC turnover in response to land usechanges.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was financially supported by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (Grant Nos. 41930862, 41571130042, and41522207) and the State's Key Project of Research and DevelopmentPlan of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFA0601002 and 2017YFC0212700).We thank technical staff Xiaoli Fu for assistance with the establish-ment of the lignin measurement method.
