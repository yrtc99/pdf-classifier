In dryland regions, however, soil inorganic carbon (SIC) has receivedincreasing attention due to the high accumulation of SIC in arid soils contributed by its high tem-perature, low soil moisture, less vegetation, high salinity, and poor microbial activities. SIC storagein dryland soils is a complex process comprising multiple interactions of several factors such asclimate, land use types, farm management practices, irrigation, inherent soil properties, soil bioticfactors, etc. In addition, soil C studies in deeper layers of drylands have opened-up several studyaspects on SIC storage. This review explains the mechanisms of SIC formation in dryland soils andcritically discusses the SIC content in arid and semi-arid soils as compared to SOC. It also addressesthe complex relationship between SIC and SOC in dryland soils. This review gives an overview ofhow climate change and anthropogenic management of soil might affect the SIC storage in drylandsoils. Dryland soils could be an efﬁcient sink in C sequestration through the formation of secondarycarbonates. The review highlights the importance of an in-depth understanding of the C cycle inarid soils and emphasizes that SIC dynamics must be looked into broader perspective vis- à-vis Csequestration and climate change mitigation.Keywords: arid; carbonate; carbon sequestration; climate change; pedogenic carbonate1. IntroductionThe dynamics of total soil carbon (C) are inﬂuenced by rising temperatures, high CO 2concentrations in the atmosphere [ 1], land use changes, and soil management methods [ 2].In this regard, C sequestration is being extensively researched to mitigate the negativeimpacts of rising atmospheric CO 2levels. Carbon sequestration entails trapping CO 2atlarge and stationary sources, transporting CO 2from the source to a sink, and storing CO 2in a large sink such as a soil system [ 3]. The soil system is a clear example of a signiﬁcantsink as well as a source of atmospheric CO 2, making it one of the primary regulators of Ccapture and storage and plays a signiﬁcant role in the C cycle [ 4]. As a result, soil C is oneof the largest C pools in the terrestrial ecosystem, even greater than the combined C poolsof the biosphere and atmosphere [ 5]. The major C pools in the Earth system can be dividedinto ﬁve groups. Figure 1 depicts the ﬁve global C pools in the Earth: lithosphere (mainlyfossil fuel, mined and combusted at 8 Pg C per year), oceanic (increasing at 2.3 Pg C peryear), soil C comprising both SOC and SIC, atmospheric (increasing at 4 Pg C per year)Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081256 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agricultureAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 2 of 20and the biotic C pool comprising both detritus material/necromass and live biomass). Theterrestrial pools (both the soil and biotic C pools) is 3.2 times larger than the atmosphericpool. However, these terrestrial pools are frequently altered by anthropogenic activities.Agriculture  2022,  12, 1256  2 of 20   year), soil C comprising both SOC and SIC, atmospheric (increasing at 4 Pg C per year) and the biotic C pool comprising both detritus material/necromass and live biomass). The terrestrial pools (both the soil and biotic C pools) is 3.2 times larger than the atmospheric pool. However, these terrestrial pools are frequently altered by anthropogenic activities.   Figure 1. Major pools of carbon in the Earth System (P g = P etagram s = 1015 g) [5–10].  Figure 2 depicts the distribution of total C stock in dryland soils from various regions throughout the world [11]. C storage estimates in these regions are sensitive to changes in land use types. However, this global overview shows that dryland C stock ac counts for more than one -third of the global C stock. It is important to note that a large percentage of C is concentrated in dryland ecosystems. Regions such as Africa and the Middle East have a high proportion of C in drylands. However, in other regions such as South East Asia , where moist forests contain a higher amount of C, dryland C storage is still signifi-cant. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) storage under 1 m soil depth are estimated to be 120 0–1600 and 69 5–940 Pg, respecti vely, on a global scale [6,12–14]. Even though worldwide SIC storage is less than SOC, the majority of SIC is stored in arid and semi -arid regions [15] . SIC is an unsung player in the global C cycle and needs in-depth and detailed studies and understanding . Thus, dryland soils could be an efficient sink in C sequestration via carbonate formation [16] . Given the large demographic area covered by arid and semi -arid ecosystems, it is hypothesized that these soils can absorb up to 5.2 Pg of C per year [17]. Und erstanding the factors that influence SIC change/vari-ation is critical for comprehending the potential implications of both climatic and anthro-pogenic effects on SIC storage in dryland soils. The purpose of this review is to better understand the mechanism s of SIC formation, particularly in dryland soils, which receive less attention and relevance globally.  Furthermore, the integrated studies conducted in dryland areas shed light on the dynamic nature of carbonates and the capacity of arid soils in C seques tration and long -term crop productivity. This review paper also emphasizes the importance of a thorough understanding of the C cycle in arid soils and SIC dynamics in relation to C sequestration, as well as the need to mitigate the effects of climate chang e.

Understanding the factors that inﬂuence SIC change/variation is criticalfor comprehending the potential implications of both climatic and anthropogenic effectson SIC storage in dryland soils.

Methodological ApproachA systematic procedure was followed to ensure a good quality review of the literatureon the SIC in dryland soils. First, using Web of Science, a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed publications ( n= 2600) was followed based on the query: ((TS =) soil inorganiccarbon) OR TS = (carbonate)) AND TS = (arid). Second, the reference section of each paperwas critically studied to access additional papers ( n= 3) relevant to this review topic. Afterremoving duplicates ( n= 543) using Mendeley Desktop, 2060 publications were screenedbased on their relevance to SIC in dryland soils. A total of 307 publications were assessedfor eligibility to include in the review. Three main selection criteria were used during theeligibility section: (a) the publication must discuss the inorganic C in the soil system, (b) thepublication must either discuss the factors affecting SIC and/or mechanisms involved informing SIC and/or comparison between SIC and SOC, (c) the study must be conducted ina dryland ecosystem. A total of 72 papers were selected for review (Figure 3 and Table S1).Agriculture  2022, 12, 1256  3 of 20    Figure 2. Comparison  of total soil carbon stock in drylands  (Gt) in different  regions of the world and share of regional carbon stock held in drylands  (%) (Graph created using data from [11]). 2. Methodological  Approach  A systematic  procedure  was followed  to ensure a good quality review of the litera‐ture on the SIC in dryland soils. First, using Web of Science, a comprehensive  search of peer‐reviewed  publications  (n = 2600) was followed  based on the query: ((TS =) soil inor‐ganic carbon) OR TS = (carbonate))  AND TS = (arid). Second, the reference  section of each paper was critically  studied to access additional  papers (n = 3) relevant to this review topic. After removing  duplicates  (n = 543) using Mendeley  Desktop,  2060 publications  were screened  based on their relevance  to SIC in dryland soils. A total of 307 publications  were assessed  for eligibility  to include in the review. Three main selection  criteria were used during the eligibility  section: (a) the publication  must discuss the inorganic  C in the soil system, (b) the publication  must either discuss the factors affecting  SIC and/or mech‐anisms involved  in forming SIC and/or comparison  between SIC and SOC, (c) the study must be conducted  in a dryland ecosystem.  A total of 72 papers were selected for review (Figure 3 and Table S1).  Figure 3. Flowchart  of the methodologies  followed  for the review. Figure 3. Flowchart of the methodologies followed for the review.3. Distribution of Arid Soils and Their Soil ConstraintsApproximately 41% of Earth’s land surface is covered by arid and semi-arid areas [ 18](Figure 4). Based on the aridity index, there are four major classes of arid lands: hyper-arid,Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 4 of 20arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid [ 19]. Semi-arid regions are more extensive (15.2% ofEarth’s land surface), followed by arid regions (10.6%), dry sub-humid (8.7%), and hyper-arid (6.6%). Water scarcity, food scarcity, and harsh weather conditions are all commonproblems in dry regions [ 19]. Arid areas are characterized by high aridity (>70% aridityindex), extreme temperature, high solar radiation, low and non-uniform distribution ofrainfall, low humidity, and high wind velocity. Moreover, the soil is a sandy type with lowwater holding capacity, low organic C, and deﬁcient in available nitrogen and phosphorus.Shortage of water, as well as the uneven distribution of available water, further restrictscrop production and agricultural development in arid regions [20].Agriculture  2022, 12, 1256  4 of 20   3. Distribution  of Arid Soils and Their Soil Constraints  Approximately  41% of Earth’s land surface is covered by arid and semi‐arid areas [18] (Figure 4). Based on the aridity index, there are four major classes of arid lands: hyper‐arid, arid, semi‐arid and dry subhumid  [19]. Semi‐arid regions are more extensive  (15.2% of Earth’s land surface),  followed  by arid regions (10.6%), dry sub‐humid (8.7%), and hy‐per‐arid (6.6%). Water scarcity, food scarcity, and harsh weather conditions  are all com‐mon problems  in dry regions [19]. Arid areas are characterized  by high aridity (>70% arid‐ity index), extreme temperature,  high solar radiation,  low and non‐uniform distribution  of rainfall, low humidity,  and high wind velocity. Moreover,  the soil is a sandy type with low water holding capacity,  low organic C, and deficient  in available  nitrogen and phos‐phorus. Shortage  of water, as well as the uneven distribution  of available  water, further restricts crop production  and agricultural  development  in arid regions [20].  Figure 4. The regional extent of arid and semi‐arid soils in different  parts of the world (Modified  from [19]). 4. Mechanism  of SIC Formation  in Dryland  Areas Not all arid regions are favorable  for the formation  of pedogenic  carbonate.  For ex‐ample, the driest zones of the Atacama  are too dry, which limits pedogenic  inorganic  C (PIC) formation  [21]. Four conditions  are essential  for the formation  of PIC [22]: (a) high soil pH (alkaline),  (b) an active source of CO 2 in soil for HCO 3− production,  (c) a large amount of available  Ca2+ and (d) an optimum  level of soil moisture.  In arid regions, SIC, particularly  calcium (and magnesium)  carbonates,  are formed through the following  two reactions  [23]: 2COଶ൅2HଶO→2HCOଷି൅ 2Hା  (1)Caଶା൅2HCOଷି→CaCOଷ൅HଶO൅COଶ  (2)The development  of calcium carbonates  (CaCO 3) is influenced  by soil CO 2, soil pH, soil moisture  content, and soil calcium concentration  [24]. High soil pH will result in the generation  of HCO 3− since a drop in soil H+ will lead the reaction (1) to proceed to the right. Likewise,  a decrease  in pH or an increase in soil CO 2 content would cause a reaction (2) to shift to the left. The CO 2 consumed  in carbonate  formation  is mainly derived from Figure 4. The regional extent of arid and semi-arid soils in different parts of the world (Modiﬁedfrom [19]).4. Mechanism of SIC Formation in Dryland AreasNot all arid regions are favorable for the formation of pedogenic carbonate. Forexample, the driest zones of the Atacama are too dry, which limits pedogenic inorganic C(PIC) formation [ 21]. Four conditions are essential for the formation of PIC [ 22]: (a) highsoil pH (alkaline), (b) an active source of CO 2in soil for HCO 3 production, (c) a largeamount of available Ca2+and (d) an optimum level of soil moisture. In arid regions, SIC,particularly calcium (and magnesium) carbonates, are formed through the following tworeactions [23]:2CO 2+2H2O!2HCO 3+2H+(1)Ca2++2HCO 3!CaCO 3+H2O+CO 2 (2)The development of calcium carbonates (CaCO 3) is inﬂuenced by soil CO 2, soil pH,soil moisture content, and soil calcium concentration [ 24]. High soil pH will result in thegeneration of HCO 3 since a drop in soil H+will lead the reaction (1) to proceed to theright. Likewise, a decrease in pH or an increase in soil CO 2content would cause a reaction(2) to shift to the left. The CO 2consumed in carbonate formation is mainly derived from soilrespiration, including autotrophic root respiration and heterotrophic microbial respiration.The majority of arid soils are non-ﬂushing, where there is often less soil moisture to leachbicarbonate out of the soil proﬁle [ 25]. Therefore, SIC stock may decrease in acidic soils dueto the dissolution of carbonate, while an alkaline environment may provide the optimumenvironment for carbonate formation [4].Many researchers have reported various formation mechanisms of PIC in arid andsemi-arid soils [ 26,27]. Some have considered the abiotic mechanism of PIC formation inAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 5 of 20which the dissolved CaCO 3crystallizes in low soil water content [ 28,29]. On the other hand,other researchers suggested the biotic mechanism of pedogenic CaCO 3formation in whichsoil biota signiﬁcantly inﬂuences CaCO 3precipitation [ 30–34]. In the biotic process, soilorganic matter (SOM) is predicted to play an important role in SIC formation in arid soils.SOM is derived from plant above-ground biomass, soil micro- and macro-organisms, andplant roots [ 35]. It is well known that SOM inﬂuences not only the soil enzyme activities butalso the soil microbial activities [ 36]. Soil enzymes such as dehydrogenase activity (DHA)affect SOM decomposition and release of CaCO 3. Zhang et al. [ 37] showed a positivecorrelation between DHA, SOM, and CaCO 3. The above-ground plant parts can directlyaffect soil carbonate formation [ 38] because CaCO 3content in the plant leaves can rangefrom 0.4–1.06 mg cm 2[30]. Furthermore, CaCO 3can be found crystallized around roothairs [39].The optimum pH of the soil to form secondary carbonate is 7.3–8.5 in the presence ofCa2+in the soil solution [40]. PICs are formed through several mechanisms such as:(a) The Per Descendum model: The dissolved carbonate from the upper proﬁle leachdown through the soil proﬁle and re-precipitate in the subsoil [41].(b) The Per Ascendum model: Ca2+rises from the shallow water table through capillarymovement and forms carbonates [42].(c) The In situ model: The dissolution of carbonates is followed by re-precipitation nearthe bedrock [42].(d) The Biogenic model: Secondary carbonates are formed through the activities of soilﬂora and fauna [32].(e) Complex mechanisms: All the above-given mechanisms work simultaneously or in asequential manner based on the prevailing environmental conditions [43].5. SIC and C Sequestration in Dryland SoilsWhy should we be concerned about SIC and C sequestration in dryland soils? Unlikea shift in SOC stocks, an increase in SIC content does not necessarily indicate atmosphericCO 2sequestration [ 44]. Consequently, various scientists have questioned whether ornot PIC precipitation is a C sequestration process [ 45–47]. The SIC literature is full ofcontradicting ﬁndings. There are three main SIC processes that affect the soil-atmosphereexchange of CO 2in dryland soils [44].(a) silicate mineral weatheringTwo moles of CO 2are consumed and produce bicarbonate during silicate weathering.However, the rate of silicate weathering is very slow (on the order of 50–500 mol Ca2+ha 1yr 1) [48], which means only 0.001–0.01 t CO 2ha 1yr 1will be consumed during theprocess [ 49]. Even if the rate of silicate weathering is accelerated, the subsequent C sinkwould still be inconsistent [44].(b) carbonate dissolutionCarbonate dissolution is another SIC-related soil process that consumes CO 2duringa series of reactions. To consider carbonate dissolution a SIC sequestration process, thesource and the fate of HCO 3 must be known [ 44]. The CO 2must be derived from soilrespiration or decomposition of SOM. The HCO 3 must be leached out from the soil proﬁleand join the oceanic pool in which SIC is stored for thousands of years or even longer period.Otherwise, incomplete leaching of HCO 3 from the soil proﬁle leads to re-precipitationof carbonate in deeper layers of soil with the release of CO 2and thus no net change inatmospheric CO 2[50].(c) Pedogenic inorganic carbonate formationIn arid and semi-arid areas, pedogenic carbonates are precipitated due to high evap-orative demand and incomplete leaching of salts. The formation of PIC consumes twomoles of HCO 3 to precipitate one mole of CaCO 3and release one mole of CO 2. The abovenatural reaction can be accelerated by irrigation. A clear description of inorganic soil Cdistributions and its controlling factors that leads to either C sequestration or loss as CO 2Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 6 of 20will facilitate us in predicting the possible consequences of climate change on C cycling inarid and semi-arid areas.6. Factors Affecting SIC Formation in Arid Soils6.1. Climatic FactorsA growing body of research suggests that SIC may be just as dynamic as SOC [ 51–53].Kim et al. [ 54] pointed out a potentially dynamic SIC pool that is sensitive to hydrologicalchanges. SIC storage can be affected by a wide number of factors, including climate, landuse, and soil characteristics (Figure 5). Precipitation, temperature, and other climate factorssigniﬁcantly affect the processes of evaporation and leaching, which in turn inﬂuence thedissolution and re-precipitation of carbonates (Figure 5). Raheb et al. [ 55] investigated theinﬂuence of climates on soil C pools under arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid conditionsalong a soil climosequence. With the increase in mean annual precipitation, total SOCand SIC storage increased from 3.75 and 6.28 kg m 2under arid and semi-arid conditions,respectively, to 11.32 kg m 2under dry sub-humid conditions. Although SOC was foundto be low in arid soils, the ratio of SIC/SOC was the highest in arid regions. The high valueof this ratio depicts the crucial role of climate on SIC storage as compared to SOC [ 55].However, the time required for SIC storage was found to be higher in drier conditionsas Raheb et al. [ 55] calculated the average time (in years) needed to store SIC in arid(26,000 years), semi-arid (23,100 years), and sub-humid conditions (15,400 years).Agriculture  2022, 12, 1256  6 of 20   period. Otherwise,  incomplete  leaching of HCO 3− from the soil profile leads to re‐precipi‐tation of carbonate  in deeper layers of soil with the release of CO 2 and thus no net change in atmospheric  CO 2 [50]. (c) Pedogenic  inorganic  carbonate  formation  In arid and semi‐arid areas, pedogenic  carbonates  are precipitated  due to high evap‐orative demand and incomplete  leaching of salts. The formation  of PIC consumes  two moles of HCO 3− to precipitate  one mole of CaCO 3 and release one mole of CO 2. The above natural reaction can be accelerated  by irrigation.  A clear description  of inorganic  soil C distributions  and its controlling  factors that leads to either C sequestration  or loss as CO 2 will facilitate  us in predicting  the possible consequences  of climate change on C cycling in arid and semi‐arid areas. 6. Factors Affecting  SIC Formation  in Arid Soils 6.1. Climatic Factors A growing  body of research suggests  that SIC may be just as dynamic  as SOC [51–53]. Kim et al. [54] pointed out a potentially  dynamic  SIC pool that is sensitive  to hydro‐logical changes.  SIC storage can be affected by a wide number of factors, including  cli‐mate, land use, and soil characteristics  (Figure 5). Precipitation,  temperature,  and other climate factors significantly  affect the processes  of evaporation  and leaching,  which in turn influence  the dissolution  and re‐precipitation  of carbonates  (Figure 5). Raheb et al. [55] investigated  the influence  of climates on soil C pools under arid, semi‐arid, and dry sub‐humid conditions  along a soil climosequence.  With the increase in mean annual pre‐cipitation,  total SOC and SIC storage increased  from 3.75 and 6.28 kg m−2 under arid and semi‐arid conditions,  respectively,  to 11.32 kg m−2 under dry sub‐humid conditions.  Alt‐hough SOC was found to be low in arid soils, the ratio of SIC/SOC  was the highest in arid regions. The high value of this ratio depicts the crucial role of climate on SIC storage as compared  to SOC [55]. However,  the time required  for SIC storage was found to be higher in drier conditions  as Raheb et al. [55] calculated  the average time (in years) needed to store SIC in arid (26,000 years), semi‐arid (23,100 years), and sub‐humid conditions  (15,400 years).  Figure 5. Natural and anthropogenic  factors influencing  the formation  of soil inorganic  carbon in dryland soils. Figure 5. Natural and anthropogenic factors inﬂuencing the formation of soil inorganic carbon indryland soils.High evaporation: precipitation ratio inhibits carbonate dissolution and leaching,making arid soils rich in PIC [ 56]. According to Wu et al. [ 57], increasing aridity wasassociated with an increase in SIC content. This encourages the production and buildup ofpetrocalcic and calcic strata in arid places where there is little effective precipitation [ 45].The humid circumstances, on the other hand, encourage a vigorous carbonate leachingprocess. Areas with annual precipitation of <500 mm have a greater concentration ofSIC pool [ 45]. Mi et al. [ 58] revealed that 84% of China’s total SIC pool was concentratedin locations with an annual rainfall of <500 mm. A total of 4.19 Pg C is also storedin areas with mean annual precipitation between 500 and 800 mm. In another studyconducted by Tan et al. [ 59] in the Loess Plateau region of China, 84% of SIC stock wasconcentrated in the regions with an annual rainfall of <500 mm. There are two waysAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 7 of 20that mean annual precipitation could inﬂuence carbonate formation: directly by changingthe CaCO 3equilibrium solubility constant and indirectly by distributing precipitationinputs between leaching and evapotranspiration [ 60]. The seasonal drought period is theconducive time for precipitation of carbonates since both soil moisture and root activity areless during seasonal drought [12]. Additionally, elevation has a positive relationship withSIC due to its indirect effects on mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperaturewith increasing elevation [58].6.2. Land Cover and Land UseDue to changes in vegetation species and soil management approaches, land coverand land use types have a substantial impact on SIC content. Land-use changes fromnatural vegetation to cropland can rapidly induce the loss of SIC that has been stable forseveral years due to increased soil water ﬂuxes [ 54]. SIC distribution patterns and stocksare also impacted by the vertical distribution of roots and SOC content in various land covertypes [ 61]. Multiple biological parameters affecting the SIC pool can be altered by landuse, including plant above- and below-ground biomass productivity, soil characteristics,and microbial processes [ 62]. Mi et al. [ 58] highlighted that the desert has the highestSIC, followed by grassland, farmland, marsh, shrubland, meadow, and forest. Throughchanges in C allocation, plant functional types could inﬂuence SIC distribution in deepersoil layers. Chang et al. [ 63] reported that the conversion of cropland to a forest in thecentral Loess Plateau led to the redistribution of SIC along the soil proﬁle, but no increasein net SIC was observed. Jin et al. [ 64] found lower values of 13CSICin grassland than inthe forest, indicating a greater generation of secondary carbonates in grassland than in theforest. SIC content and stock decreased during the conversion of cropland to grassland.During the tillage practices in grassland restoration, the SIC is vertically mixed, andfurther dissolution and leaching of carbonates to deeper soil layers might lower SIC duringgrassland restoration. However, the dissolution and leaching of SIC contribute to a littleloss of SIC stock since restoration treatments signiﬁcantly reduce surface runoff, which isone of the major causes of SIC loss [ 65]. Additionally, the rapidly growing plant biomassin a restored grassland takes up a considerable amount of Ca2+in the soil and leads to adecline of Ca2+in the soil. Moreover, the soil water content and high root biomass promotemicrobial activity and increase soil CO 2production, leading to higher soluble SIC [ 58]. SICformation is found to be more sensitive in sandy soil than the clayey type of soil [66].Other land-use studies in dryland soils reported a higher contribution of PIC to SICin croplands than in grasslands [ 67]. Several authors have reported a high rate of SICsequestration of 0.02 Mg C ha 1year 1under natural vegetation and up to 0.4 Mg C ha 1year 1in managed lands [ 68]. Murty et al. [ 69] indicated that in temperate and tropicalconditions, conversion of grassland to agricultural land had increased CO 2emission witha decrease in soil C stock. Zhao et al. [ 70] found relatively higher SIC under the shrubcover than in forests and grassland. The larger quantity of PIC under the shrub cover isdue to more Ca produced from litter under shrub cover, higher soil microbial biomass, andslow transfer of PIC owing to low soil water content under shrub cover. This indicates thatshrubland is one of the best vegetations for the ﬁxation of inorganic C in the soil.Intensive cultivation practices such as deep tillage disturb the soil and break downsoil aggregates [ 71]. Moreover, plant-derived C inputs to soil are generally less in farmland,thus affecting the dissolution and precipitation of SIC. Therefore, in general, cultivationleads to a decrease in SIC, and restoration of cropped lands could signiﬁcantly promote SICstorage [ 72]. However, it is not necessarily true in all cases since carbonate precipitationor dissolution largely depends on soil pH and Ca2+/Mg2+source. Soil pH and source ofCa2+or Mg2+control SIC and its precipitation, respectively [ 73]. Other researchers showedgreater accumulation of both SOC and SIC stocks in agricultural than in non-agriculturallands under arid and semi-arid conditions, e.g., in the middle of the Hexi Corridor, Gansu,China [ 74], around the Yunwu Mountain, Ningxia, China and other parts of China [ 75],and in the Russian Chernozems [76] and Loess soils of Russia [77].Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 8 of 20Wu et al. [ 57] reported that 51% of total cultivated soil in China showed SIC loss atthe rate of 0.5–4.0 kg C m 2, from the 1980s to 2008, especially in paddy ﬁelds, irrigatedfarms, and dry farmland. Irrigation practices coupled with the application of acidifyingfertilizers increase the loss of SIC from soil proﬁle [ 78]. The carbonate weathering anderosion are further increased through agricultural practices by exposing the calciferoushorizon to the soil surface [ 45]. On the other hand, an increase in SIC was observed inirrigated silty soils, irrigated desert soils, seirozems, and black soils [ 57]. Irrigation in aridand semi-arid soils increases plant biomass production, thus increasing plant respirationand microbial decomposition of SOM, releasing CO 2[45]. The elevated CO 2leads toincreased weathering [ 29] and promotes the consumption of atmospheric CO 2. Anotherprobable reason is the external addition of Ca2+and Mg2+from irrigation water or theaddition of fertilizer and manure that increases carbonate formation [ 71]. However, whensuch irrigation water is applied to arid non-alkaline soil where groundwater contains ahigh bicarbonate concentration, CO 2is released during carbonate precipitation [ 29]. Thesediscrepancies complicate our comprehension of the effect of land use changes on SIC orSOC dynamics in arid and semi-arid environments. Such inconsistencies between SIC stockand land use systems may also highlight the intricate interaction between climate, landmanagement, and soil conditions and the formation of carbonates in arid soils [79].6.3. Farm Management PracticesFarming practices such as intensive cropping, irrigation, residue, and fertilizer ap-plication/management may also increase SOC stock in agricultural lands, which leads toenhanced CO 2production and ultimately increased SIC stock [ 57]. Higher SIC densityin agricultural land than in other land uses [ 80] may be due to the increased availabilityof Ca2+/Mg2+associated with irrigation and fertilization [ 81]. To enhance carbonate ac-cumulation in the soil proﬁle, it is also essential to increase soil fertility. Wang et al. [ 81]demonstrated signiﬁcant enhancement of carbonate accumulation (especially in subsoil)with the application of organic amendments in the cropland of North China. These resultswere also supported by Zhang et al. [ 82], who reported an increased SIC stock in fertilesoils than in low fertile loess soils of the Lanzhou area, China. Few long-term experimentsreported a varying contribution of PIC to SIC (29%–89%) [ 68,81,82], which indicates thepossible major inﬂuence of crop management practices on SIC formation. Although, thereis limited literature on pedogenic inorganic carbonates (PIC) contribution to SIC. In fact,intensive cropping may enhance PIC formation, and therefore, proper agricultural manage-ment is also essential to increase both the SOC and SIC storage in arid soils [ 5]. Thus, inorder to understand SIC variability, it is important to study PIC dynamics in various soiltypes. Intensive tillage practices expose the calciferous horizon to the soil surface, therebyincreasing carbonate weathering [ 45]. The possible fate of the SIC can be either it is leacheddown to deeper soil layers or has converted into bicarbonate that is further transportedto groundwater or joined the river surfaces or lakes and ultimately to the ocean [ 83]. Forexample, the Yellow River across northern China has been experiencing an increase indissolved Ca2+and inorganic C over the past 40 years [84].6.4. IrrigationIn croplands, irrigation has more pronounced effects on SIC losses than tillage orfertilization [ 54]. SIC studies under long-term irrigation have shown mixed results: SICincreases in irrigated treatment [ 47,57], null effect on SIC [ 85], and SIC increases only inlimited irrigation [ 86]. Greater water content not only acts as a medium for dissolution andtransport of carbonates but also allows SIC to rapidly re-equilibrate with CO 2present in soilpores [ 87]. The greater loss of SIC in irrigated cropland through carbonate dissolution is dueto increased reactive area of dampened ﬁner laminar coating of disseminated carbonatesunder croplands [ 56]. However, it is equally important to understand whether this SICmobilization indicates a net C source or sink. The majority of irrigation water in such aridregions contains up to 1% dissolved CO 2[88]; increasing this concentration can accelerateAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 9 of 20the rate of carbonate production [ 29]. Due to high solar radiation in arid regions, irrigationwater is typically warmer than groundwater [ 47]. The solubility of CO 2at 0C, 25C, and400C is 0.02, 0.03, and 0.08 molL 1, respectively [ 29], demonstrating the solubility of CO 2in irrigation water is signiﬁcantly temperature sensitive. When irrigation water reachesa ﬁeld, its temperature can climb to as high as 2000C and is further elevated when itcomes into touch with the soil surface on hot days. The higher temperature of irrigationwater increases the response time and, under favorable conditions, may increase carbonateprecipitation. In addition, as irrigation water runs through canals and agricultural ﬁelds,dissolved cations can cause its pH to rise. The high pH of the irrigation water may alsopromote SIC formation. Entry et al. [ 47] reported that there is a greater possibility of ahigher potential amount of SIC sequestration if irrigated areas are enlarged, and land usepatterns are altered.Irrigation in arid areas is advantageous for SIC accumulation. Irrigating with Ca2+-richwater favor bicarbonate formation and an increase in SIC. It also helps in the redistributionof SIC to deeper soil layers. The increase in SIC in irrigated land as compared to rainfedsoils is attributed to the dramatic increase in plant biomass production [ 57]. High biomassproduction enhances plant respiration and SOM decomposition, thus increasing soil CO 2levels [ 45]. Higher soil CO 2favors increased carbonate weathering and consumption ofatmospheric CO 2[29]. Irrigated soils showing a decrease in SIC is primarily due to highleaching and maintenance of high water content at the soil surface, which is responsible forelevated CO 2concentration and greater dissolution of soil carbonates [ 89]. Efﬁcient irriga-tion with leaching less than 30% of the applied water could favor carbonate accumulationin semi-arid and arid regions.6.5. Soil Acidiﬁcation through FertilizersA decrease in SIC in topsoil in croplands might possibly be due to a drop in soil pHlinked to soil acidiﬁcation from the application of chemical fertilizers [ 90]. The decline in soilpH will aid in the dissolution of soil carbonate and low SIC content. According to recentstudies, fertilizer may increase soil acidity and cause soil carbonate to dissolve [ 56,91].Soil acidiﬁcation is one of the major global threats to the sustainable development ofecosystems [ 92] because a change in soil pH can regulate both the SOC and SIC dynamics.Although soil acidiﬁcation is a natural process, it is accelerated by anthropogenic activitiessuch as the long-term overuse of nitrogen fertilizers [93].NH+4+2O2!NO 3+H2O+2H+(3)Organic C!RCOOH!RCOO +H+(4)CaCO 3+H2O+CO 2!Ca2++2HCO 3(5)HCO 3+H+!H2O+CO 2 (6)The change in soil pH in calcareous soil could be explained through three processes:(a) Equations (3) and (4) depict the release of proton ions through nitriﬁcation and soilorganic matter decomposition, respectively [70].(b) Equations (5) and (6) depict the consumption of H+ions during the dissolution of SIC,thus releasing CO 2[94].(c) Leaching of dissolved inorganic C to groundwater [95].The application of nitrogen fertilizer can reduce soil pH and alter the C balance incalcareous soils and promote acidiﬁcation in soils [ 96]. In Equation (3), it is shown thatwith one mole of nitrate produced, two moles of H+ions will be generated under aerobicconditions [ 97]. These protons are neutralized by SIC in calcareous soils [ 90]. Therefore,a lower soil pH in calcareous soils leads to a decline in SIC [ 96,98]. If the soil is limed,SIC will be released faster than the C from SOC [ 99]. In addition, although fertilizers areapplied in topsoil, they can still cause soil acidiﬁcation in deeper soil layers through themovement of protons, which is expected to induce SIC loss in the deeper soil layer [92].Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 10 of 20SIC lost through degassing depends on the type and amount of fertilizers applied inthe soil. Long-term application of nitrogen fertilizers causes agricultural acidiﬁcation ata rate of 30–240 kmol H+ha 1year 1, leading to a maximum loss of 0.36–2.8 Mg C ha 1year 1[90,100]. Soil acidiﬁcation is generated by nitrate leaching, removal of alkalinityduring crop harvest, accelerated nitrogen ﬁxation by legumes, and the application ofammonium-based fertilizers [ 101,102]. Soil acidiﬁcation rates of 10 kmol H+ha-1yr 1were found in highly exploitative agricultural soils [ 103]. This can be partially offset byaccelerated calcite dissolution in calcareous soils, creating a potential net C sink on theorder of 0.03–0.12 t C ha 1yr 1if all of the HCO 3leached down the soil proﬁle and joina long-lived reservoir [44].6.6. TemperatureTemperature is another important factor that governs SIC storage in an arid region. Anincrease in global temperature could alter the dissolution of carbonate directly or indirectlythrough the products of SOC decomposition [ 4]. With the increase in temperature, thesolubility of CO 2in water decreases, affecting the solubility of carbonates [ 104]. Forexample, Buysse et al. [ 105] reported greater CO 2emissions (due to greater CO 2solubility)from limed farmland soils at 5–15C than 15–25C. On the other hand, in an incubatedstudy, Ahmad et al. [ 4] contradicted and reported a 59% increase in CO 2emissions fromlimed soils when the temperature increased from 20C to 40C. Surface reactions andmass transfer could be inﬂuenced by higher temperature, which further leads to highercarbonate dissolution and C release from soil carbonates. The increase in temperature alsoaccelerates the supply of protons (through nitriﬁcation and/or humiﬁcation) and the rateof lime dissolution. Higher temperature during the plant growing season also increasesthe release of CO 2from the rhizosphere due to higher soil respiration. The increased rateof proton release in the rhizosphere affects the soil pH and further increases carbonatedissolution. The temperature sensitivity of carbonate dissolution must be further studiedto understand the effect of climate change on SIC sequestration.6.7. Microbial Soil FactorsWhile most researchers considered the main mechanism of PIC formation as anabiotic process, some have identiﬁed the role of soil (micro) organisms in inducing CaCO 3precipitation [ 37]. Any biotic factors that affect the deposition rate of SOM also inﬂuencesoil CaCO 3content [ 106]. Due to more soil microbial biomass, the unstabilized SOC ismineralized to produce more CO 2, which further dissolves in the soil solution and formscarbonates, which later precipitate to CaCO 3in the presence of Ca released from thedecomposed litter. This reaction sequesters one mole of CO 2to form one mole of PIC. Onthe other hand, high soil microbial biomass also means higher production of CO 2sincehalf of the soil respiration is derived from microbial respiration [ 70]. The higher partialpressure of CO 2could promote the dissolution of PIC in the topsoil layer, which laterbecomes distributed to deeper soil layers and re-crystallizes under low soil water content.This process neither generates nor consumes CO 2[70].6.8. Soil DepthWhile assessing SOC and SIC stocks in desert soils, including shrub soils and agri-cultural soils, SOC showed a decreasing trend with an increase in depth, whereas theopposite trend was observed in the case of SIC. One of the most prevalent errors in Csequestration research under arid conditions is focusing solely on changes in soil totalorganic C at the surface (e.g., 0–20 cm depth) because sampling and data collection arerelatively simple [ 107]. However, in shrublands, Jobb ágy and Jackson [ 108] found that therelative distribution of SOC was signiﬁcantly deeper in arid conditions (0–250 mm yr 1)than in semi-arid conditions (250–500 mm yr 1), while no such difference in the verticaldistribution of SOC was observed in grasslands regardless of climates. This trend might beAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 11 of 20attributed to the fact that in arid shrublands, the relatively deep root system of the shrubsmay lead to deeper soil C proﬁles than in arid grasslands [108].Xie et al. [ 109] also reported the downward leaching of soil C containing water whendry areas are irrigated sufﬁciently. The amount of irrigation water used in dry areasinﬂuences the depth of water movement and thereby affecting the rate of inorganic Ctransportation throughout the soil proﬁle. Higher SIC levels are formed in deeper soillayers, even below 2 m in the loess soil [ 75]. Therefore, the depth of the soil layer is one ofthe major factors in determining the proﬁle distribution of inorganic C in saline/alkalineareas [ 79]. Management practices that increase soil erosion remove more weathered surfacesoils. While SIC is generally found in deeper soil layers, eroded soils show an increasein SIC in surface soils [ 89]. Approximately 80% of SIC is captured below 1 m, and 50% isstored below 3 m [79].6.9. Parent MaterialThe parent material and its weathering behavior are other aspects that inﬂuence SICformation [ 110]. For example, high SIC content in the Loess Plateau of China is associatedwith the primary aeolian deposit rich in CaCO 3[57]. Basalt weathering is crucial in theterrestrial C cycle because it exposes H+(dissociated from H 2CO 3) and releases Ca2+andMg2+cations, which combine with bicarbonates to form carbonates in soil [ 111]. Therefore,pedogenic forms of SIC are found in soil with carbonate-free parent rocks. In arid andsemi-arid regions, PIC can also be accumulated in non-carbonate parent materials throughthe reaction of Ca2+ions with water (from rainfall) and CO 2(derived from plant rootrespiration) [ 112]. Because the weathering rate of parent materials increases with thetemperature only in the presence of water, the weathering rate in arid regions is slow.6.10. SIC in Salt-Affected SoilsSalt-affected soils tend to dominate in arid and semi-arid regions. Generally, owing tothe poor soil’s physical and chemical properties and harsh climate, the plant productivityin salt-affected soils is generally poor. This leads to low plant biomass and lower inputsof organic materials, and low SOC. On the other hand, SIC levels can be high in salt-affected soils and are attributed to the high soil pH and high soil Ca2+and Mg2+that canenhance carbonate precipitation [ 113]. Schlesinger [ 114] reported poor SIC exchange withthe atmosphere, as low as 1.0–5.0 g C m 2yr 1in the desert soils. However, it could alsobe as high as 62–622 g C m 2yr 1in salt-affected soils [ 53]. Sodic soil reclamation canboth reduce or favor SIC accumulation in the soil [ 89]. With the application of gypsum toalkaline or sodic soils, the Ca precipitates the soluble bicarbonates and carbonates in the soil,resulting in an increase in SIC. On the other hand, green manuring and the application ofsulfur and sulphuric acid tend to elevate CO 2concentration in the soil resulting dissolutionof carbonate. Widespread use of acids to prevent emitter clogging in drip irrigation alsoremoves a signiﬁcant amount of carbonates within 10–20 years and for soils with <3%carbonates [89].7. Relationship between SIC and SOC in Dryland SoilsThe relationship between SIC and SOC processes in arid soils is another source ofcomplexity of SIC dynamics in arid soils. The SIC–SOC relationship in croplands could beeither positive [ 80], negative [ 70,82], or null [ 5]. In surface soils of North China Plain [ 115]and west Loess Plateau [ 116], negative relationships were found between SOC and SIC,whereas positive relationships between SIC and SOC in arid areas were established bySu et al. [74] in the Badan Jaran Desert, Gansu (0–30 cm depth) and Wang et al. [ 81] in theYanqi Basin, Xinjiang (0–100 cm depth). Guo et al. [ 90] also found a signiﬁcantly positivecorrelation between SOC and SIC in the cropland of North China Plains, suggesting theincreasing SOC might lead to an increase in SIC stocks. SIC and SOC showed a signiﬁcantpositive correlation in croplands [ 80,90] shrub land [ 37,74] and afforestation soil [ 18,67].The quality of irrigation water during cultivation strongly affects the SIC content in the soil.Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 12 of 20For example, irrigation with alkaline pH water, the presence of alkaline parent material, andthe application of alkaline fertilizers such as urea supplied the opportunity for carbonateprecipitation in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, Northern China [ 96]. On the other hand,due to increased plant biomass in restored cropland, the soil pH declined, accompaniedby greater water retention promoting dissolution of SIC. The Ca2+/Mg2+rich soils incroplands of Northern China, because of long-term and extensive application of Ca2+/Mg2+rich fertilizers and irrigation water, not only promotes SIC precipitation but also aids inconsuming CO 2from the atmosphere through soil calciﬁcation. Dissolved SIC could belost to the atmosphere as CO 2or transferred to another region through soil erosion andrunoff, or redistributed into the deeper soil layers [ 96]. Therefore, the net decrease in SICin grassland could be due to release to the atmosphere or redistribution of SIC along thesoil proﬁle since vegetation recovery reduces the surface runoff and erosion. Moreover,increased root biomass lowers soil pH and inevitably decomposes a part of total carbonate,and releases CO 2.Soil pH could play an important role in maintaining the relationship between SIC andSOC under arid conditions [ 80]. Decomposition of SOC and high root respiration releasesmore CO 2into soil, thus creating acidic conditions in soil [ 80]. The low soil pH favors thedissolution of carbonate and thus results in a negative relationship between SOC and SICin the surface layer [ 117]. Therefore, a positive relationship could be predicted in soils withhigher pH and without Ca/Mg limitation [ 80]. The increasing acidity of soils with highamounts of SIC leads to a significant decrease in carbonate formation [ 96], indicating SIC as adynamic rather than stable C pool. Therefore, soil acidity could influence the C sequestrationprocess through sedimentation of carbonates or the release of CO 2into the atmosphere.The discrepancies found in the relationship between SIC and SOC indicate that bothSIC and SOC might respond differently to the changes in environmental conditions. Forexample, soil salinity restricts the accumulation of SOC due to the low stability of SOCin high soil pH. On the other hand, it increases Ca2+/Mg2+concentration in the soil andpromotes SIC accumulation, thus generating a negative relationship between SIC andSOC [ 118]. Under high soil moisture coupled with high soil pH, desorption of dissolvedorganic C and SIC dissolution increases, thus showing a positive relationship between SICand SOC [ 119]. Additionally, a high concentration of CaCO 3improves soil aggregation andincreases SOC stabilization [ 120]. Shi et al. [ 121] did not observe any signiﬁcant relationshipbetween SOC and SIC in the top soil but showed a positive relationship within 0–100 cmsoil depth in croplands of North China Plain. Interestingly, Guo et al. [ 90] estimated apositive relationship between SOC and SIC in the same study area. These contradictoryﬁndings indicate the relationship between SOC and SIC is complex, which may be a resultof the decoupling of multiple processes associated with carbonate formation over timeand space. Higher SOC content releases a high concentration of CO 2in the soil, leading tomore production of H+and HCO 3 . High levels of H+help in the dissolution of carbonate,and thus, a negative relationship exists between SOC and SIC. On the other hand, thehigher production of HCO 3 will favor the precipitation of SIC and generate a positiverelationship [ 80]. Therefore, a negative relationship is generally observed in topsoil ofcropland and grassland where SOC is high [ 95]. Higher CO 2production reduces soil pHand leads to the dissolution of carbonates. However, it is always not true. Soils with highpH (>8) have a high buffering capacity that even after the high production of CO 2, theresulting soil pH is still alkaline, showing a positive relationship [121].8. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) as a “Missing Sink” in C Sequestration StudiesAlthough the global C balance includes a large C sink in the terrestrial ecosystem, it isdifﬁcult to fully identify the potential of each terrestrial C sink and understand its mech-anisms [ 122]. In a few recent ﬁndings, a part of the “missing C sink” could be explainedby the removal of atmospheric CO 2through desert soil, capturing CO 2at a magnitude ofapproximately 100 g C m 2yr 1[123]. However, it has caused many controversies as asimilar magnitude of C has not been observed in terrestrial ecosystems [ 25]. Li et al. [ 124]Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 13 of 20discovered a potentially large C sink in irrigated saline/alkaline desert regions. Throughconventional radiometric analysis, Li et al. [ 124] identiﬁed DIC, which was retained neitherin the plant nor in the soil. The DIC was leached out from the irrigated arid soils anddeposited in the saline or alkaline aquifers in deserts under sparse vegetation cover.The origin of DIC is from the dissolution of CO 2released from soil respiration into thesoil solution of irrigated saline or alkaline soil [ 125]. It is then transported downward intothe groundwater aquifers [ 123]. Kessler and Harvey [ 126] reported the average C inputrate as 1.34 g C m 2yr 1but lower in the case of arid soils in the Tarim Basin. The DICsequestration rates in irrigated saline or alkaline arid soils can be even greater than 20g C m 2yr 1which is 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than earlier reported [ 124]. TheDIC is regarded as a hidden, untouched inorganic C pool in saline or alkaline aquifersin desert areas. Arid areas are deﬁned by higher evaporation than precipitation, therebyincreasing soil salinity or alkalinity. One of the generally recommended practices to reducesoil salinity is over-irrigation, where good quality irrigation water is applied more than thecrop requirement to leach away the salts [ 127]. Lindsay [ 128] stated that the solubility ofCO 2increases linearly with electrical conductivity and exponentially with the pH of thesoil solution. Therefore, it is obvious that in arid saline/alkaline water, the CO 2solubilitywill be much higher than that of pure water, thus containing a high amount of dissolvedCO 2or DIC in saline/alkaline aquifer.Sources of water, such as rainfall and glacier, are nearly C free. However, as it ﬂowsinto rivers of a mountain, it contains a considerable amount of CO 2. However, the DICcontent in the groundwater leached out from the saline/alkaline soils is more than twicethat of the irrigation water [ 124]. These ﬁndings might not be applicable where goodquality irrigation water is not available for over-irrigation. One of the major problemsassociated with these ﬁndings is the quantiﬁcation of DIC sink strength and its size. Thisis due to the fact that in order to estimate sink strength, it is necessary to understand therecharge rate of groundwater, which still remains a challenge in hydrological research [ 129].Secondly, different factors of soil inﬂuence CO 2solubilities, such as salinity/alkalinity ofsoil [ 130], rate of root respiration [ 131], and soil temperature [ 130], which are season- andtime-dependent. The large spatial and temporal variability also affects the feasibility of DICquantiﬁcation in leaching water. Despite all these ﬁndings, over-irrigation and leaching ofgroundwater in arid saline/alkaline soils do not necessarily depict the creation of a C sinkas this hidden C may be released back into the atmosphere if it is discharged into rivers,lakes, and streams.9. Inorganic C Fluxes in Dry Land Systems: Their Role in Gaseous Ecosystem C FluxIn spite of the widespread distribution of arid soil, little attention has been paid toestimating the C ﬂuxes in arid soils and ecosystems under prolonged dry periods. Multiplestudies have mentioned potential abiotic implications on net CO 2exchange, starting withEmmerich’s [ 46] study on the behavior of CO 2ﬂuxes across high-carbonate soils. Largedaily CO 2emissions were detected in the summer in combination with rain events, as deter-mined by long-term CO 2ﬂux measurements in the New Mexico Chihuahuan desert [ 132].An abiotic CO 2source (the dissolution of carbonates) might be responsible for some of theCO 2emissions. As shown by Inglima et al. [ 133], in a carbonate Mediterranean ecosystem,SIC release accounts for 40% of the total soil CO 2ﬂux when soil moisture levels are low.Rain events led to a decrease in the relative inorganic contribution as a result of a signiﬁcantincrease in the organic ﬂux. Large magnitudes of CO 2uptake have been recorded, bothfrom soil chambers in the Gobi Desert [ 134] and also with open- and close-path eddysystems in the Mojave Desert [ 52], including net C uptake even at night. Stone [ 17] high-lighted these two articles to argue that arid ecosystems may be the long-sought-after C sink.Although there are numerous hypotheses on the abiotic mechanisms involved in such CO 2uptake, the actual mechanisms remain still unknown [25].Here are the main findings from a few studies on soil CO 2fluxes in dryland ecosystems:Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 14 of 20(a) In the Chihuahuan Desert, soil CO 2proﬁles and ﬂuxes, as well as volumetric soilmoisture and temperature, were recorded by Hammerlynck et al. [ 135] throughouta three-month hot and dry period in both bare interplant canopy soils and underplant canopies. The results indicated that elevated CO 2might directly affect abiotic Cdynamics in the dry season. Even if temperature and precipitation have no effect onthe dynamics of soil CO 2and temperature, increasing atmospheric CO 2will speed upnocturnal carbonate dissolution. This could result in more carbonate dissolution andsoil uptake beneath the canopy. Increasing levels of CO 2could alter the spatial andtemporal patterns of PIC development during warm, dry seasons.(b) To explore how climate inﬂuences the CO 2ﬂuxes and C balances in soil by interactingwith biotic drivers, Ball et al. [ 136] measured soil CO 2ﬂux in experimental ﬁeldmanipulations, microcosm incubations, and across natural environmental gradientsof soil moisture and found that CO 2ﬂux in dry valley soils is driven primarily byphysical factors such as soil temperature and moisture, suggesting that future climatechange may alter the dry valley soil C cycle. This shows the potential for arid polarsoils to absorb CO 2, mostly driven by abiotic factors related to climate change.(c) Soils rich in carbonaceous parent material are associated with CO 2exchange pat-terns that cannot be explained by biological processes, such as asymmetric daytimeoutgassing or nighttime CO 2uptake during times when all vegetation is senescent.Carbonate weathering reactions cannot account for either of these events because therates of CO 2exchange are too low. By imposing ventilation-driven CO 2outgassing ina carbonate weathering model, Roland et al. [ 137] showed that carbonate geochemistryis accelerated and plays a substantial role in a semi-arid ecosystem’s CO 2exchangepattern. Ventilation depletes soil CO 2during the day, disrupting carbonate equilibriaand accelerating carbonate precipitation and CO 2generation. At night, ventilationstops, and CO 2levels rise steadily. Increased carbonate dissolution consumes CO 2and compensates for increased daytime precipitation. This is why only a minimaleffect on worldwide carbonate weathering rates is expected.(d) Pedogenic carbonate formation occurs when the soil is warm and extremely dry, notduring the mean growing season, as is commonly believed [138].(e) Roby et al. [ 139] investigated the ways in which soil temperature, soil moisture,and gross ecosystem photosynthesis control soil CO 2ﬂux in semi-arid ecosystems.Including soil moisture and gross ecosystem photosynthesis in the models of soil CO 2ﬂux can help reduce the amount of uncertainty in semi-arid ecosystem C dynamics.(f) A large carbonate pool exists in arid soils, which may contribute to surface-atmosphereCO 2exchange via a diurnal cycle of carbonate dissolution and exsolution. Abioticprocesses have a signiﬁcant role in the C cycle of desert soils. Soper et al. [ 140]demonstrate that diurnally evolving CO 2occurs in part from carbonate sources,providing a source to balance the nocturnal CO 2uptake found in arid areas and likelymaintaining the system at (or close to) C equilibrium.(g) Kowalski et al. [ 141] tested the idea that surface-atmosphere CO 2exchanges in ter-restrial ecosystems can always be explained by biological processes alone, withoutconsidering geochemical cycling by karst systems. Further, large daytime CO 2emis-sions during prolonged drought and plant senescence contradict ecophysiologicalexplanations. CO 2emissions in the afternoon during the summer in a temperatepasture above an accessible cave are hard to explain biologically, but they occur at thesame time as cave ventilation. These studies reveal that CO 2exchanges between theatmosphere, ecosystems, and carbonate substrates are occasionally related directly.(h) Based on isotope analysis, the SIC pool adds significantly to soil CO 2and, in turn, tothe average CO 2outflow [ 142]. This contribution was season and location sensitive.During daily cycles, the inorganic source contributed significantly to soil CO 2, with thelargest levels occurring during the day in tandem with the maximum respiration rates.Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1256 15 of 2010. ConclusionsThis review highlights that SIC is the main form of soil C in arid and semi-arid regions;desertiﬁcation could affect SIC content in many parts of the world. Soil C dynamics indry and semi-arid ecosystems must be considered to comprehend the global C cycle andassess terrestrial ecosystem responses to rising global temperature. The theory of ‘missingsink’ hidden underneath the deserts must be studied further in areas where irrigation is amajor issue, or good quality irrigation water is not available. The chemistry of SIC and itsinteraction with SOC in arid regions must be understood/identiﬁed clearly. If the focus ofstudy needs to shift from SOC to SIC in arid soils, the C sequestration potential of SIC inarid soils must be studied under different soil types and land use system/managementpractices under diverse climatic conditions. Future detailed studies must be conductedon the use of stable isotopes of C and O to demonstrate the origin of pedogenic carbonateminerals and how this relates to land use change. In addition, there is also a need for anin-depth understanding of soil management and fertilization, including liming of acidicsoils on mineralization of native soil C and geochemical solution modeling to predict thestability of calcite in arid regions. Finally, this review highlights the need for generatinginformation on SIC potential in C sequestration, which can deﬁnitely form a part of climatechange mitigation strategies in arid soils and it will also assist policymakers and researchersmake land-use and soil-management decisions.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agriculture12081256/s1, Table S1: Important studies included inthe review.Author Contributions: Conceptualization—S.J., A.N., R.C.D. and R.L.; writing—original draft prepa-ration, A.N. and S.J. writing—review and editing, R.C.D., R.L., C.S.R., A.P ., A.N. and S.J.
