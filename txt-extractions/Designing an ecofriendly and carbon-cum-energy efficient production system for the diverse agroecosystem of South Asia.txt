The four years study was conducted from 2016 to 2019, where the dominant rice-wheatcropping system is practiced extensively after ‘Green Revolution ’. The objectives of the experiment wereto evaluate: (1) energy budgeting, (2) carbon auditing, (3) production and economic ef ﬁciency of diversecropping systems for upland rainfed as well as irrigated ecosystems of eastern India. Tillage and croppingsystem treatments were laid out according to a completely randomized block design and replicatedthrice. Ten cropping sequences were comprised of: T1) a farmers ’practice of transplanted rice-wheat-mungbean, T2) conventional till-direct seeded rice (CTDSR)-wheat-mungbean, T3) soybean-maize, T4)CTDSR-mustard-urdbean, T5) foxtail millet-lentil-fallow, T6) pearl millet-chickpea-fallow, T7) ﬁngermillet- toria -fallow, T8) sorghum (grain)-chickpea-fallow, T9) maize cob epigeon pea, and T10) sorghum(fodder)-mustard-urdbean. Energy contributions of different inputs were 42 e55, 12 e21, 8e18, and 4e12% for fertilizers, diesel, labour, and electricity, respectively. The amount of indirect (fertilizer,chemicals, and machinery) and direct (diesel and electricity) non-renewable energy inputs were 40 e60and 18 e26%, respectively. Indirect renewable energy input (seed and crop residues) was 1 e7% ascompared to 15 e24% of direct-renewable energy (human labour and irrigation water). The maximumenergy input was recorded for T1 (53511 MJ ha/C01). The maximum biomass production (40.2 Mg ha/C01)was recorded with T9, while the maximum bene ﬁt: cost ratio (3.64) was noted for T10 and T8. Thehighest speci ﬁc energy (33.5 MJ kg/C01) and energy productivity (0.92 kg MJ/C01) were recorded in T8treatment. Irrespective of cropping systems, retention of crop residues accounted for 28.6 e58.5% of totalcarbon input. The carbon sustainability index was 5 e7 times higher for the millet-based productionsystem [T6 (9.32) and T8 (10.27)] compared to cereal-based systems [T1 (1.66) and T2 (1.21)]. Diversi-ﬁcation of the rice-wheat system through climate-resilient millets-based production system reduced 84%energy consumption and 87% carbon footprint. The millet-based production system also helps inreducing the carbon input by 172% and improves the energy use ef ﬁciency by 61% compared to thecereal-based cropping system. Therefore, the study has an innovative idea to support the crop modelling,policymakers, government planners, researchers, and producers to achieve the sustainable developmentgoals in Indo-Gangetic Plains and similar agro-climatic conditions of South Asia.©2020 Elsevier Ltd.

All rights reserved.Energy 214 (2021) 118860change because of its more reliance on agriculture [ 1]. Small land-holdings and poor natural resource management are among themajor issues for lower crop productivity of the agricultural pro-duction systems of South Asia [ 2]. Rice ( Oryza sativa ), a major staplefood crop, is cultivated on ~163 M ha of 114 countries with a totalproduction of ~742.4 MT during 2016 [ 3]. In India, ~12.5 M ha area isunder rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) [ 4], which is lessremunerative due to more labour, water, capital, and energy re-quirements. The erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns pre-vailing during the rainy season, declining ground-water level, andsevere soil degradation, further aggravate the total factor produc-tivity, and sustainability of the system [ 5]. Also, the widespreadpractice of in- ﬁeld burning of crop residues before the planting ofwheat is exacerbating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG. Theemission from global RWCS is estimated at ~523 MT CO 2-e year/C01and contributes ~10% of the total agricultural emission globally [ 6].Achieving the food and nutritional security by increasing cropproductivity and diminishing the inter-annual variations in cropyields in South Asia has become a major challenge. There is strongevidence of the negative impacts of climatic change on the pro-ductivity of wheat and rice by variable magnitude under diverseclimates of the region [ 7]. Composite exposure using different in-dicators (i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures, the intensityof low and high rainfall during rainy and winter seasons) hasrevealed that RWCS in eastern India is highly vulnerable to climaticchange. The yield of wheat and rice is predicted to decline from 10to 40% by 2050 [ 8]. With each degree centigrade rise in tempera-ture, the demand for irrigation water is expected to rise by 10% [ 9].In India, freshwater withdrawals are ~761 billion cubic m(2008e12) and ~90% of this is linked with the agricultural pro-duction system. In order to meet the demands of food for the ever-increasing population, India has to produce 37% extra rice andwheat by 2025 using 10% less irrigation water [ 4].As farmers of South Asia practice different crop rotations, it isimperative to assess the energy budgeting and C-auditing of annualcrop rotations. For developing cleaner and safer production sys-tems, energetics steadiness must be assessed for diverse croppingsystems of upland rainfed as well as irrigated agro-ecosystem ofeastern India [ 10]. Diversi ﬁcation of the existing cropping systemwith non-cereal crops are reported to have a lower emission ofgreenhouse gasses (GHGs) [ 11]. The leguminous crop has a lower C-and water footprint as compared to cereals due to the lesser releaseof GHG [ 12]. Intensive tillage operations, which are an integralcomponent of modern agriculture, require higher inorganic fertil-izers, fossil fuels, and electricity, leading to increased C-footprintsand declined energy use ef ﬁciency [ 13].Designing of the productive and environmentally sustainableproduction systems, with lower emission of GHGs and energy use,is the need of the hour for a cleaner/safer environment and higherproﬁtability of the farmers [ 14]. Zero tillage (ZT), a key componentof conservation agriculture (CA), improves soil health, crop pro-ductivity, and curtails the fuel requirement leading to a signi ﬁcantdecline in CO2emission [ 15]. Thus, it could be an appropriatetechnology for reducing energy input and C -footprint [ 16].Most of the climate-resilient cropping systems include millets,oilseeds, and grain legumes due to their low input requirement,better resilience to adverse climatic conditions and superiority inproductivity under sub-optimal resources. Choudhary et al. [ 13]also highlighted the importance of millets and grain legumes forthe sustainability of the existing production systems in developingcountries like India. Direct seeding of rice and other climate-resilient crops in cereal-based cropping can further reduce theGHGs emission [ 17].Energy is an important input in the modern agricultural pro-duction system and, therefore, the inter-dependence of energetics,and crop production needs to be evaluated for designing an energyand C- ef ﬁcient cropping system [ 18]. The input-output relation-ship of diverse production systems varies with total biomass pro-ductivity, soil type, and diverse tillage practices. The extremedependence on fossil fuels (diesel) and other non-renewable en-ergy sources, and increasing awareness of the emission of GHGshave shifted the focus on the judicious use of renewable energysuch as biofuels [ 19]. Thus, there is a need to assess the energy useefﬁciency (EUE) and C-auditing of the diverse production systemsin the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of South Asia. The rice-basedcropping system, which is critical to food and nutritional securityof the IGP of eastern India, warrants additional research in thecontext of moderating C- and energy uses. The available scienti ﬁcinformation on C-footprint of climate-resilient cropping systems isscanty for designing and developing the strategies of sustainableproduction systems. At the same time, GHG emission and yieldpenalty from the identi ﬁed cropping systems must be minimizedfor a cleaner environment [ 12]. We hypothesized that the diversi-ﬁed crop rotations result in a reduction in energy consumption andcarbon footprints and provide more yields and income under theclimate changing scenario. Thus, the present investigation wasaimed to evaluate the energy use patterns, C-footprints, and eco-nomics of 10-diverse cropping systems in eastern India. The pre-sent study aimed to quantify the energy-cum-carbon budgeting foran eco-friendly low C-emissive and economically-ef ﬁcient sus-tainable production systems in Indo-Gangetic Plains and similaragro-climatic conditions of South Asia.2. Materials and methods2.1. Experiment site and climateThe present investigation was conducted for four consecutiveyears from 2016 to 17 to 2019-20 in the region where the rice-wheat cropping system is widely practiced. The experimental siteis located at the ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna,India, at 25/C14300N, 85/C14150E, 52 m above mean sea levels (MSL)(Fig. 1 ). This region has an annual precipitation of 1168 mm, ofwhich 88% is received between July and September. The meanannual evaporation is 1573 mm. The data on precipitation andtemperature for the study site are presented in Fig. 2 . The soil of theexperimental site was loamy in texture (50.4, 35.0 and 14.6% sand,silt, and clay, respectively) (Typic Haplustept, Fluvisol), with pH of7.5, EC of 0.12 dS m/C01, soil organic carbon (SOC) content of6.0 g kg/C01, KMnO 4oxidizable N of 64.6 mg kg/C01, Olsen phosphorusof 23.9 mg kg/C01,N H 4OAc exchangeable potassium of 78.3 mg kg/C01,and DTPA-extractable zinc of 0.66 mg kg/C01(0e15 cm soil).2.2. Experimental treatments and layoutTreatments were laid out according to the completely ran-domized block design (CRBD) and replicated thrice. Ten croppingsequences included T1: transplanted rice ( Oryza sativa) -wheat(Triticum aestivum) -mungbean ( Vigna radiata) (CT) (Farmers prac-tices, FP), T2: conventional till-direct seeded rice (CTDSR)-wheat-mungbean (ZT), T3: soybean ( Glycine max) -maize ( Zea mays) (ZT),T4: CTDSR-mustard ( Brassica juncea) -urdbean ( Vigna mungo) (ZT),T5: foxtail millet ( Seataria italica) -lentil ( Lens culanaris ) (ZT)-fallow,T6: pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum) -chickpea ( Cicer arietinum )(ZT)-fallow T7: ﬁnger millet ( Eleusine coracana) -toria (Brassica rapa)(ZT)-fallow, T8: sorghum (grain) ( Sorghum bicolor )-chickpea (ZT)-fallow, T9: maize cob ( Zea mays )-pigeonpea ( Cajanus cajan) (ZT),and T10: sorghum (fodder)-mustard-urdbean (ZT). All crops raisedduring the rainy season were grown under CT, while all winter andR. Kumar, J.S. Mishra, S. Mondal et al. Energy 214 (2021) 1188602summer crops were grown under ZT, except in farmers ’practice(T1). In T2 treatment, ~30% residues of rice and wheat wereretained, whereas for other treatments crops were harvested at theground level and removed. Two to three manual harvestings weredone for summer crops (mungbean/urdbean) and then entire cropbiomass was incorporated into the soil .The size of the individualexperimental unit was 8.0 /C25.0 m ( Fig. 1 ).2.3. Crop establishment and managementAll the component crops were grown as per the standard cropcalendar ( Table 1 ). Before initiating the experiment, the land waschisel ploughed to 30 cm depth and levelled. The weed control wasachieved by glyphosate (41% EC) at 1.5 l ha/C01a week before cropseeding/planting. Selective pre-and post-emergence (PE/POE) her-bicides were used to manage the weeds. Atrazine (PE) for maize,pretilachlor (PE) for transplanted rice [2 e3 days after transplanting(DAT)], pendimethalin (PE) followed by bispyribac-sodium (POE)for CTDSR [20 days after sowing (DAS)], pendimethalin (PE) formungbean/urdbean and mustard (2 e3 DAS), and clodinafoppropagyl (POE) for wheat (30 DAS) were used for effective weedmanagement. All crops of the rainy season were planted during thethird week of June and harvested by the second week of Octoberexcept for maize and fodder sorghum in T9 and T10 treatments. TheFig. 1.

Energy 214 (2021) 1188603quality protein maize (QPM), which was grown for dual-purpose(green cob as well as fodder), was seeded on 20th June and har-vested by the end of September in each year. All winter crops (e.g.,wheat, oilseed, and pulses) were sown during the third week ofOctober and harvested in March and April. Summer crops (mung-bean/urdbean) were sown and harvested during the ﬁrst week ofApril and June, respectively.2.4. Energetics input-output relationshipsEnergy budgeting was computed to compare the energy usepattern and energy ratio of diverse cropping systems. The primaryinformation of energy inputs for speci ﬁc crop management prac-tices under the different treatments was used for calculation ofenergetics. All the inputs used in a cropping system were recorded.Energy inputs associated with different cropping systems and theircoefﬁcients collected from published peer-reviewed literature arepresented in Table 2 . Energy inputs include both the operational(direct) and non-operational (indirect) energy. The operationalinputs energy includes human labour, fuels, and machine; and non-operational energy includes seed, chemical fertilizers, and pesti-cides. Energy output (grains, fodder, stover, roots) was computed bymultiplying the quantity of crop production with their respectiveenergy coef ﬁcients [ 23]. In the present study, only the energy in-puts used in crop production were included, but the renewable/built-in sources of energy (solar radiation, wind, inbuilt soilfertility) were not considered, since it has no opportunity cost [ 24].Moreover, these inputs are independent of management practicesduring the experimentation. The ﬂow chart of the methodology ispresented in Fig. 3 .Energy input: Energy equivalent for all inputs were totalled forcomputing cumulative energy input.Energy output: Energy outputs for a product (grain) andbyproducts (straw/stalk/roots) were computed by multiplying thequantity with its corresponding energy equivalents.Net energy returns : Difference between energy output andinput involved for crop production.The following formulae were used for calculating the energy useefﬁciency indices [ 23]:Energy ratio ¼Gross energy outputEnergy input(1)Energy profitability ¼Net energy outputEnergy input(2)Energy productivity/C16kg MJ/C01/C17¼System rice equivalent yieldEnergy input(3)Energy intensiveness/C16MJ US $/C01/C17¼Energy inputCost of cultivation(4)Human energy profitability ¼Gross energy outputLabour input energy(5)Specific energy/C16MJ kg/C01/C17¼Gross energy outputSystem rice equivalent yield(6)Fig. 2.

Carbon auditingCumulative photosynthates of crops, representing total C-output, was computed by multiplying respective crop yields withan average C- content of biomass (~44% on a dry weight basis) [ 25].The C-equivalent (CE) was computed by multiplying the respectiveinputs (diesel, fertilizer, pesticide) with related emission-coefﬁcients ( Table 3 ) as reported by Lal [ 25]. Computed CE wasused in assessing C-emission based on production, transportation,storage, and farm operations. The sum of C-input and output werecomputed by summing up CE of all the inputs and outputs,respectively [ 13]. The C-budgeting of diverse cropping productionsystems was computed by using the following equations [ 28]:Carbon output (kg CE ha/C01)¼Total biomass (economic yields þby-product of yields) /C20.44 (12)Carbon footprint ðCFyÞðkg CE kg/C01 SREY Þ¼Total carbon emission of inputsSystem rice equivalent yield(13)Carbon efficiency ðCEÞ¼Carbon outputCarbon input(14)Carbon sustainability index ðCSIÞ¼Carbon output /C0Carbon inputCarbon input(15)Carbon efficiency ratio ðCERÞ¼Grain yield in terms of carbonCarbon input(16)2.6.

Economic analysisEconomics was worked out by considering all the incurredvariable costs for a diverse cropping system. Major variable costsinclude uses of energy (human/machinery) for land preparations,fertilizer, insecticide, irrigation, harvesting and thrashing. The la-bour cost was computed by multiplying the wage rate of GOI withman-day ha/C01. All the input cost was totalled to get the total vari-able cost (TVC). The gross returns (GR) were computed by multi-plying the marketable outputs (grains/cob/fodder and straw/stoveryield of individual crops) with their market price. Net returns (NR)were computed by taking the difference between gross returns(GR) and TVC (NR ¼GR-TVC).Table 3Emission factors of agriculture inputs used in estimation in the study.Particulars Unit kg CO 2e unit/C01ReferencesElectricity kWh 0.075 [ 25]Human labour man-day 0.86 [ 26]Diesel litre 3.32 [ 26]Diesel farm machinery hour 3.32 [ 26]Seeds kg 1.22 [ 27]Chemical fertilizersN kg 4.96 [ 25]P2O5 kg 1.35 [ 25]K2O kg 0.58 [ 25]Plant protection chemicalsFungicides litre 3.90 [ 25]Herbicides litre 6.30 [ 25]Insecticides litre 5.10 [ 25]REY/C16th a/C01/C17¼Grain yield of the winter =summer crop /C2MSP of winter =summer crops ÞPrice of rice(15)R. Kumar, J.S. Mishra, S. Mondal et al. Energy 214 (2021) 11886062.8. Statistical analysisThe collected data were subjected to analysis of variance(ANOVA) with a general linear model [ 29]. The F etest was done todetermine the signi ﬁcant effect of treatment [ 30].3. Results3.1. Biomass productivityThe total annual biomass production differed among the crop-ping systems ( Table 4 ). Intensive cropping systems [three cropsyear/C01, T1 (farmers ’practice), T2, T4, and T10] produced highertotal biomass (27.6 e32.1 Mg ha-yr/C01) on annual crop rotations.However, the maximum biomass production was registered intreatment T9 (40.2 Mg ha-yr/C01), which was higher by 46, 30, 41, 55,247, 36, 232, 27, and 25% over T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, and T10,respectively. Irrespective of the cropping system, treatment T9, andT10 had higher root biomass (5.4 e5.7 Mg ha-yr/C01) than othertreatments. Among the rainy season crops, sorghum, dual-purposemaize, and pearl millet were the most productive followed bywheat and rice. Among the pulses, pigeonpea produced the higheststover biomass during the winter cropping.3.2. Energy use and input-output relationshipsThe energy requirement for crop production is directly relatedto the management techniques followed and inputs used. Energyanalysis is an important tool for judging the system productionefﬁciency of the diverse production system and achieving theSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A production system isconsidered ef ﬁcient when it produces higher energy output andconsumes comparatively lesser energy. The data on energy usepatterns revealed that rice-based cropping system [T1 (farmers ’practice), T2 and T4] were the most energy-intensive with an en-ergy input of 36872 e53511 MJ ha/C01followed by T3(30596 MJ ha/C01). Whereas, the energy requirement of the millet-based production system was lower and varied between 16353(T5) and 20405 MJ ha/C01(T8). Among the intensive cropping sys-tems (T1, T2, T4, T3 and T10], the lowest energy requirement wasregistered for T10 treatment ( Table 5 ). Total energy input usedfollowed the trends of T1 (53511) >T2 (47403) >T4 (36872) >T3(30596) >T10 (29293) >T9 (22667) >T8 (20405) >T6 (19808) >T7(17999) >T5 (16353) MJ ha/C01.The operation-wise energy use data showed that nutrient andwater management consumed major shares of the total energyinputs (51 e71%). The energy input used for irrigation in rice-basedcropping systems [ T1, T2, and T4 ] was 8356 e13370 MJ ha/C01ascompared to 1672 MJ ha/C01in the millet-based production systems(T5, T6, T7, T8) ( Fig. 4 ). The energy in ﬂow through crop nutritionranged between 43 and 49% being higher in T1, T2, T3, T4, and T10(Fig. 5 ). Among the different millet-based cropping system, themaximum energy input was consumed through inputs of nutrients(Table 5 ).Among the various inputs, diesel was the most energy-intensive. The maximum consumption of diesel was noted in T1treatment ( Fig. 5 ). Diesel and electricity (direct non-renewableenergy) accounted for 11.9 e20.9 and 4.0 e12.3% of energy inputs,respectively ( Fig. 4 ). Overall, these items contributed to themaximum energy inputs, followed by direct-renewable energy(labours and water). The energy used for land preparation washigher in cereal-based production systems and varied from3324 MJ ha/C01(T10) to 6728 MJ ha/C01(T1) compared to millet-basedcropping (2630 MJ ha/C01)(Table 5 ).Among the various sources of energy inputs for different oper-ations, fertilizers contributed a major share of total energy inputsunder cereal and millet-based production systems. The total energyinput (indirect non erenewable energy) by fertilizer for T1 to T10treatments were 23285, 22649, 13210, 16686, 7400, 8732, 9922,8732, 11059, and 13753 MJ ha/C01, respectively ( Table 5 ). The share ofenergy used for fertilizer was the highest followed by irrigation,land preparations, harvesting, and threshing in the cereal-basedcropping systems. A similar trend was also noted in millet-basedproduction system ( Fig. 6 ).The gross energy output of cropping production systems rangedfrom T5 (153699 MJ ha/C01)-T9 (512589 MJ ha/C01)(Table 6 andFig. 7 ).Irrespective of the cropping system, the maximum energy outputwas recorded in T9 (512589 MJ ha/C01), of which 14, 72.1, and 13.9% ofthe energy output were credited by green cob, fodder, and rootbiomass, respectively. The energy ratio and energy pro ﬁtabilitywere also higher with T9 (22.6 and 21.6) followed by T8 (20.2 and19.2). The highest and the lowest energy intensiveness was recor-ded for T1 (0.36 MJ US$/C01) and T9 (0.24 MJ US$/C01), respectively(Table 6 ).

Nutrient and non-renewable energy useefﬁciencies were 55.8 and 58.3% higher, respectively, in the millet-based than cereal-based cropping systems ( Table 6 ).3.3. Carbon budgeting3.3.1. Carbon emissionEnergetics and C-footprints have close nexus to the modernagricultural production systems. Irrespective of the cropping sys-tems, retention of crop residues consumed ~28.6 (T10) to 58.5% (T2)of total C-input in residues recycled plots. Residues retained orincorporated as a source of C- consumed ~29 e59% of the total C-inputs in the cereal-based production system. Next to crop resi-dues, fertilizers consumed ~27.3 (T2) to 69.8% (T7) of total C-inputs(Fig. 8 ). Diesel used for land preparation, planting, threshing op-erations consumed 205.9 e421.2 kg CE ha/C01C-input in cereal-basedcropping and 159.1 e196.6 kg CE ha/C01C-input in the millet-basedproduction system ( Table 7 ). The maximum and minimum C-in-puts were used in T2 (6271 kg CE ha/C01) and T5 (914 kg CE ha/C01). Thetrend followed for C-input was T2 >T1>T4>T10>T9>T3>T8>T6>T7>T5. The treatment T9 had the highest C-output (17200 kg CEha/C01) and the lowest was with T5 (5126 kg CE ha/C01).3.3.2. Carbon sustainability indexThe sustainability of agricultural production systems mainlydepends on their C-footprints. The C-footprints of diverse croppingproduction systems are highly dependent on the ability of crops toconvert the absorbed nutrients into grains. Irrespective of thecropping systems, treatment T8 had the highest C-ef ﬁciency andCSI (11.3 and 10.3) and T2 (2.2 and 1.2) the lowest ( Table 7 ). Themaximum C-footprint was recorded for T2 (0.40 kg CEkg/C01SREY),the maximum CER was for T10 (8.9), and the minimum for the T2treatment (1.9).3.4. EconomicsThe cost of cultivation and economic returns obtained from thediverse cropping systems of the present study are given in Table 8 .The mean cost of cultivation of all the intensi ﬁed cropping systems(triple) was signi ﬁcantly higher than that for the double croppingsystem. The cost of cultivation was higher in cereal-based croppingsystems and varied from US$ 1400 ha/C01(T3) to US$ 2080 ha/C01(T1).The maximum net returns and bene ﬁt: cost ratio (BCR) was notedfor T9 (US$ 3665 ha/C01and 3.75), while the lowest with T7 (US$500 ha/C01and 1.61).3.5. Principal components analysisResults of the PCA bi-plot revealed that the ﬁrst two principalcomponents (PC1 and PC2) were T6 and T8 treatments, which werealso positively correlated with C-auditing (CE, CSI, C-footprints) andenergy budgeting variables (energy ratio, energy pro ﬁtability, en-ergy productivity) ( Fig. 9 ).4. Discussion4.1. Biomass productivityRotation of crop/cultivar and cropping systems, a widely adop-ted management practice in the entire globe, is widely practiced toresolve the issues of the adverse effect of climatic changes in theintensive production system to achieve the environmental sus-tainability [ 21]. Crop diversi ﬁcation through climate-resilientcropping system is one of the main approaches for improving theproductivity of the agro-ecosystem and resolving the issues ofecological sustainability [ 22]. It also helps in a reduction of C-footprint and energy use [ 31]. Thus, designing a resilient cropproduction system must be aimed at optimizing the energy inputand C-footprints (CFs) of the entire production system. The emis-sion of GHG and CFs of the individual crop must be assessedthoroughly. While designing an ef ﬁcient cropping system, it isnecessary to choose the crops/cultivars that require low input andhave lower C-footprints [ 32]. Irrespective of the cropping systems,the maximum biomass production was noted for the T9 treatment.The variation in biomass production was attributed to differencesin the genetic potential of individual crops [ 21]. Higher totalbiomass production in maize/sorghum/pearl millet-based croppingsystem was due to more production potential of C4-plants. Thedual-purpose maize/millets (sorghum/pearl millet) and pigeonpeautilize the solar energy ef ﬁciently, and thus, had higher totalbiomass production [ 23]. The present investigation was also vali-dated for upland rainfed conditions, where the soil moisture is theprimary constraint to achieving high crop yields [ 13]. Further,better crop management practices (residual fertility/moistures) arealso equally responsible for higher yield bene ﬁts [33].4.2. Energy uses and input-output relationshipEnergy-based system productivity, energy output, net energyreturns, and energy ratio are some of the pertinent indicators forefﬁcient appraisal of energy utilization in modern crop production.These indicators are helpful in assessing the enterprises, theircomposition, adoption to the speci ﬁc management practices, andappraising the feasibility of energy requirement [ 11]. The necessityof energy, and its production potential mostly depend on inputsused, crops/cultivars, types of cropping system and crop estab-lishment practices also [ 12]. The total energy input requirementwas the highest in the cereal-based production system for T1(farmers practice) (53511 MJ ha/C01), which was ~2.6 higher than thatof the millet-based production system ( Table 6 ). The key factorTable 5Energy consumption (MJ ha/C01) in different agronomic management practices under diverse cropping system (average of four years).Agronomic practices T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10Field preparation 6728 3324 2630 3324 2630 2630 2630 2630 2630 3324Fertilizer application 23285 22649 13210 16686 7400 8732 9922 8732 11059 13753Seed and sowing/planting 3232 2813 2300 1016 695 1385 250 1605 1332 1111Weeding/thinning/earthing up 1068 1811 1775 2001 1033 1365 969 1444 1542 1132Irrigation 13370 10863 5850 8356 1672 1672 1672 1672 2508 5850Plant protection 855 970 672 1305 843 873 602 1093 957 1234Harvesting and threshing 4973 4973 4159 4184 2080 3151 1954 3229 2639 2889Total 53511 47403 30596 36872 16353 19808 17999 20405 22667 29293T1:Transplanted rice ewheat emungbean (CT) (FP), T2: CTDSR ewheat emungbean (ZT), T3: Soybean emaize (ZT), T4:CTDSR emustard eurdbean (ZT), T5:Foxtail millet elentil(ZT)efallow,T6: Pearl millet echickpea (ZT) efallow, T7: Finger millet etoria (ZT)efallow, T8: Sorghum (Grain) echickpea (ZT) efallow, T9: Maize cob epigeonpea (ZT),T10:Sorghum (F) emustard eurdbean (ZT),ZT: Zero tollage, CTDSR: Conventional-tilled direct seeded rice, F: Fodder, FP: Farmers practices.R.

Kumar, J.S. Mishra, S. Mondal et al. Energy 214 (2021) 1188609responsible for the use of more input energy was intensive cropmanagement practices for better crop productivity in cereal-basedcropping system [ 18]. Crop production based on the CT was energy-input intensive and have lower resources use ef ﬁciency [ 5]. About30e35% of energy input was used for land preparations and cropestablishment as also reported by various researchers [ 32]. Of thetotal inputs for diverse farm operations, fertilizers contributed themaximum share of energy input (42.8 e55.1%) ( Fig. 5 ). Tuti et al.[23] also reported that fertilizer and seeds were the prime con-tributors to energy use (~83%). Next to the fertilizers, diesel used forcrop production was the most energy-intensive item ( Table 6 ).Diesel used was the highest in cereal-based production systems(~11.9e20.9%) and the lowest in millet-based cropping(~4.04 e12.3%) ( Fig. 5 ). It also differs due to the adoption of highyielding crop/cultivars and different farm operations (ploughing,irrigation, machinery) under the diverse production system [ 24].However, ZT production systems had a lower energy requirementowing to the omission of tillage and minimum intercultural oper-ations [ 34].The energy output of diverse production systems is governed bytotal biomass production including the main product and by-products [ 12]. Multiple cropping systems produced a higher en-ergy output by yielding the more grain/seeds/fodder/cob and totalbiomass production except for T6 and T8 ( Table 5 ). Irrespective ofcropping systems, energy input contribution was the maximum forfertilizers (42.8 e55.1%) due to higher levels of nitrogen fertilizationin the rice, wheat, maize and mustard. In terms of energy pro-ductivity, dual-purpose maize, pigeonpea and sorghum grain/fod-der were the most productive compared to rice/wheat. In general,the cereal-based cropping sequence had higher energy outputsthan non-cereal systems. System-based energy ratio ranged from6.8 to 22.6 and it depended on the total biomass production andenergy input used. The energy ratio of the millet-based productionsystem was higher due to the production of more biomass withminimum energy input [ 13]. The treatment of T9 was identi ﬁed asthe most energy-ef ﬁcient. The farmers ’practices (T1) was the leastenergy-ef ﬁcient due to the use of more energy input in the form offertilizer and human labours [ 18]. The treatment T1, involving athird crop in rotation had more energy input and relatively lowerenergy output resulting in a lower energy ratio. The higher energyratio and productivity were noted with higher economic yields[23]. The farmers ’practices (T1) and T2 treatment had minimumenergy productivity. The effectiveness of energy use was better inmaize cob/fodder, sorghum, pigeonpea as indicated by better en-ergy ratio. The most energy-intensive cropping system was T1 dueto the use of more energy inputs for the production of comparableenergy outputs [ 16].Thus, the optimal selection of crop/cultivars is necessary fordesigning the resource, energy, and C-ef ﬁcient production systems[35]. The cropping systems involving maize/sorghum/pearl millethad the highest energy outputs with the use of lower energy input.Higher energy productivity of the millet-based production systemwas due to higher yields of pearl millet/sorghum/maize/sorghumfodder in terms of rice equivalent yield. The key factors responsiblefor higher energy inputs in the cereal-based production system wasdue to more energy input in the form of fertilizers, machinery,diesel and weeding [ 24]. Thus, there is a need to minimize thesecomponents in crop management to increase the EUE. In the pre-sent investigation, millet-based cropping sequences had lowerenergy requirement (16353 e20405 MJ ha/C01) compared to cereal-based cropping systems (30596 e53511 MJ ha/C01). The diminutionin energy input in millet-based cropping system was mostly due tolower fertilizer use and intercultural operations, while intensivetillage in cereal-based cropping increased energy use [ 36]. Theadoption of ZT production system reduced the energy use to someextent, while the use of pesticides augmented the same than that ofCT [ 13]. Thus, the higher biomass of millet-based cropping se-quences resulted in higher energy outputs under poor resourceavailability [ 37].4.3. Carbon budgeting4.3.1. Carbon emissionThe cereal-based cropping system had the highest C-inputs. Thismight be due to residues added and more fertilizers used [T1(farmers practice), T2, T4, T10]. Higher C-inputs in ZT productionsystem were due to applied residues (contai ~n44% C-content on adry weight basis) [ 25]. Goglio et al. [ 38] also noted an increased C-input due to retention of crop residues. In cereal-based productionsystems, fertilization alone contributes ~27.3 [T2] to 51.6% [T3] of C-input, whereas it ranged from 51.8 [T8)] to 69.8% [T7] in millet-based systems ( Fig. 8 ). These differences in C-inputs were due toalteration in existing cropping systems [ 16]. Generally, fertilizerwas the major consumer of C-inputs in cereals as well as in millet-based cropping systems. Among the agronomic management, themaximum shares of C-inputs were noted from residues followed bythat from fertilizer and fossil fuel (diesel) [ 28]. The maximum C-outputs were recorded in T9 due to production of more biomass[12].Substitution of rice-based cropping system by a millet-basedproduction system signi ﬁcantly reduced carbon input and carbonfootprint (CF). Such a trend suggested that CF of crop productionlargely depended on the ability of crop/cultivars to convert themineral nutrition into total biomass [ 16]. These results are inagreement with the view of others who stated that CF of the cereal-based production system can be reduced markedly by the betteragronomic management practices and sustainable croppingintensi ﬁcation through the adoption of climate-resilient produc-tion systems [ 14]. In the present study, regardless of crops andcropping systems, fertilizers contributed to the maximum GHGemissions followed by the use of diesel and machinery. Hence,emphasis should be focused on selecting those crop/cultivars forintensi ﬁcation of the existing rice-wheat system, which requiresless tillage and fertilizers and has a higher conversion ef ﬁciency.4.3.2. Carbon use ef ﬁciencyImprovement in EUE and CUE of all crops in diverse productionsystems have a speci ﬁc role in environmental sustainability bylowering the C-emission.

Kumar, J.S. Mishra, S. Mondal et al. Energy 214 (2021) 11886011production system [T6 and T8)] is explicated by lower C-input dueto lack of residues and the minimal use of inputs (fertilizers/in-secticides/pesticides/irrigation). The highest C-footprint noted fortreatment T2 (0.40 kg CE kg/C01SREY) might be due to the minimumemission of C from fossil fuels [ 13]. Higher C-input has recorded inresidue added plots in ZT compared to that for the control plots.These data are in close agreement with those of Jat et al. [ 28].Higher C-input used in the -based production system was due tomore application of inorganic fertilizers. Higher values of CE/CSI/CER in millet-based production system were due to lower C-inputthrough crop residues, fertilizer use and fossil fuel (diesel) andproduction of more C-outputs [ 16].Diesel use was the 3rd most signi ﬁcant contributor towards C-emission in the cereal-based production system, but these valuesranked 2nd with the adoption of a millet-based cropping system(Table 7 andFig. 5 ). The total CE emission was higher in the cereal-based cropping system (262.1 e421.2 kg CE ha/C01) than that ofmillet-based production system (159.1 e196.6 kg CE ha/C01). This gapof GWP among these cropping systems might be due to differencesin the amount of diesel used [ 39]. The minimum tillage has lowerGHG emissions than that of conventional production systems [ 11].Residues retention increased the C-emission compared to non-residues added plots. This increase in GWP was due to added N-rich crop residues [ 38]. The cereal-based cropping system hadhigher CFs (0.32 e0.40 CE kg Mg/C01SREY) than that to the millet-based production system. Millet-based cropping system requiredlower C-input (913.7 e1236.7 kg CE ha/C01) and had C-output at par(13935 kg CE ha/C01) to those of the cereal-based cropping systems.These results from the present experimentation are in closeagreement to those reported by Choudhary et al. [ 13]. The markedeffects of crop establishment and tillage practices on CE/CSI werereported by other researchers [ 40]. Crop residue retention/mulch-ing on soil enhanced C-output and CE/CSI [ 39]. In the perspective ofthe climatic change scenario and human-induced emission, theviability of the diverse cropping system is based on C-ef ﬁciency[25]. Thus, conversion from the rice-based production system toTable 6Energy input-output relationship of diverse cropping system under the agro-ecosystem of eastern India (average of four years).Cropping system System grossenergyoutput (MJha/C01)System netenergyreturns (MJha/C01)SystemenergyratioSystemenergyproﬁtabilitySystem energyproductivity(kg MJ/C01ha/C01)Systemenergyintensiveness(MJ US$/C01)SystemhumanenergyproﬁtabilitySystemspeci ﬁcenergy (MJkg/C01)NutrientenergyuseefﬁciencyNon/C0renewableenergy useefﬁciencySystem energyoutputefﬁciency (MJha/C01days/C01)T1:Transplantedriceewheatemungbean(CT)365958CD312447E6.84H5.84H0.26G0.36A83.7F25.9C15.8E9.11G1099ET2:CTDSRewheat (ZT)emungbean(ZT)409387B361984D8.64G7.64G0.33F0.35A104.7D26.3BC18.1E11.70F1233DT3:Soybeanemaize (ZT)405075B374479CD13.24E12.24E0.47D0.30BC92.7EF28.1B30.8C18.50D1337CT4:CTDSRemustardeurdbean(ZT)370772C333900E10.06F9.06F0.41E0.28CD176.6A24.3CD22.3D13.49E1204DT5:Foxtailmillet-lentilefallow153699E137346F9.40FG8.40FG0.43DE0.27D53.3G21.6E20.9D12.21EF596GT6:Pearl milletechickpeaefallow337971D318163E17.06C16.06C0.53C0.27D176.9A32.1A39.0B22.86C1271CDT7:Finger milletetoriaefallow173498E155499F9.64FG8.64FG0.34F0.31B51.9G28.1B17.7E11.67F818FT8:Sorghum(Grain)echickpea(ZT)efallow411358B390953BC20.16B19.16B0.60B0.26DE98.1DE33.5A47.5A27.56B1541BT9:Maize cobepigeon pea(ZT)512589A489922A22.61A21.61A0.92A0.24E147.1B24.5CD46.6A31.46A1786AT10:Sorghum (F)emustardeurdbean(ZT)431625B402332B14.73D13.73D0.62B0.27D123.9C23.7DE31.6C19.59D1357CDifferent letters in continuous column are signi ﬁcantly different at p <0.05 according to Duncan ’s multiple range test (DMRT, ZT: Zero tollage, CTDSR: Conventional tilleddirect seeded rice, F: Fodder.Fig. 7.

Hence, the adoption and promotionof a millet-based production system saves the energy, improves theEUE, reduces the C-footprints, and maintains the equilibrium offood, nutritional security, and environmental sustainability issuesin the IGP of South Asia. The Bi-plot PCA analysis also con ﬁrmedthat a millet-based production system (T6 and T7) is highly corre-lated with C-auditing attributes (CE, CSI, C-footprints) and ener-getic variables (energy ratio, energy pro ﬁtability, energyproductivity) ( Fig. 9 ). Similar results were also reported by Kumaret al. [ 41].4.4. EconomicsNet returns are the main evaluation tool to assess the effec-tiveness of enterprises, management options, and productioneconomics [ 32]. The 4-year mean expenditure incurred on thecereal-based production sequences was higher and could beattributed to excessive tillage operation, and high use of fertilizers,irrigation, and human labours ( Table 8 ). Comparatively lower B: Cratio in the cereal-based production system was due to lowerreturns and higher expenditure involved per unit production [ 41].Thus, higher net returns in millet-based cropping system in thepresent investigation suggest that these alternative productionTable 7Carbon consumption or equivalent carbon emission and carbon output (kg CE ha/C01), carbon ef ﬁciency and carbon footprint (kg CE kg/C01SREY) as in ﬂuenced by differentcropping system (average of four years).Inputs T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10Seeds 207.4 219.6 341.6 73.2 54.9 103.7 12.2 109.8 85.4 73.2Fertilizers 1714.3 1714.3 955.9 1340.1 532.8 640.7 740.9 640.7 791.7 1114.7Herbicides 32.8 47.6 25.2 25.2 23.6 25.2 22.1 25.2 25.2 50.4Insecticides 20.25 35.20 32.60 20.19 12.08 12.61 11.90 12.61 27.37 18.35Electricity 33.67 54.40 25.90 5.18 5.18 5.18 5.18 97.89 216.3 33.67Diesel 421.2 271.4 280.8 262.1 168.5 196.6 159.1 196.6 168.5 205.9Crop residues 1840 3668 e 811 ee ee 736 694Human labour 258.0 260.5 191.8 269.2 116.6 123 110.1 153.9 186.6 232.2ParametersTotal carbon input 4528 6271 1854 2806 914 1107 1062 1237 2237 2422Total carbon output 12060 13856 12386 11691 5126 11422 5315 13935 17200 14608Carbon ef ﬁciency 2.66 2.21 6.68 4.17 5.61 10.32 5.01 11.27 7.69 6.03Carbon sustainability index 1.66 1.21 5.68 3.17 4.61 9.32 4.01 10.27 6.69 5.03Carbon foot print 0.32 0.40 0.13 0.18 0.13 0.11 0.17 0.10 0.11 0.13Carbon ef ﬁciency ratio 2.36 1.86 6.97 3.17 4.02 5.58 2.89 5.37 4.65 8.85T1: Transplanted rice ewheat emungbean (CT) (FP), T2: CTDSR ewheat emungbean (ZT), T3: Soybean emaize (ZT), T4:CTDSR emustard eurdbean (ZT), T5:Foxtail millet elentil(ZT)efallow,T6: Pearl millet echickpea (ZT) efallow, T7: Finger millet etoria (ZT)efallow, T8: Sorghum (Grain) echickpea (ZT) efallow, T9: Maize cob epigeon pea (ZT),T10:Sorghum (F) emustard eurdbean (ZT), ZT: Zero tollage, CTDSR: Conventional-tilled direct seeded rice, F: Fodder, FP: Farmers practice.Table 8Economics as in ﬂuenced by of diverse cropping system under the agro-ecosystem of eastern India (average of four years).Cropping system COC (US$ ha/C01) SCOC (US$ha/C01)Gross returns (US$ ha/C01) SGR (US$ha/C01)Net returns (US$ ha/C01) SNR (US$ha/C01)SBCRRainy Winter Summer Rainy Winter Summer Rainy Winter SummerT1:Transplanted rice ewheat emungbean(CT)842 668 570 2080 1148D1425E970A3542C305F757G400A1463E1.70FT2:CTDSR ewheat (ZT) emungbean (ZT) 797 565 520 1882 1260C1520DE817C3597C463DE955E296C1715D1.91ET3:Soybean emaize (ZT) 448 952 e 1400 930E2278Ae 3208D482DE1326Be 1808CD2.29CT4:CTDSR emustard eurdbean (ZT) 797 535 488 1820 1239CD1618CD858B3715C441E1083E370B1894C2.04DET5:Foxtail millet-lentil efallow 420 434 e 854 485F1394Ee 1879F65G960Ee 1025F2.20CDT6:Pearl millet echickpea efallow 505 536 e 1041 1032E1702BCe 2734E526D1166CDe 1692D2.62BT7:Finger millet etoriaefallow 431 389 e 820 481F839Fe 1320G50G450He 500G1.61FT8:Sorghum (Grain) echickpea (ZT)eFallow544 536 e 1080 1200CD1783Be 2983DE656C1247BCe 1903C2.76BT9:Maize cob epigeon pea (ZT) 721 612 e 1334 2708A2290Ae 4998A1987A1677Ae 3665A3.75AT10:Sorghum (F) emustard eurdbean(ZT)506 535 488 1529 2100E1391E575D4066B1594B856F87D2537B2.66BDifferent letters in continuous column are signi ﬁcantly different at p <0.05 according to Duncan ’s multiple range test (DMRT), COC: Cost of cultivation, SCOC: System cost ofcultivation, SGR: system gross returns, SNR: system net returns, SBCR: system bene ﬁt: cost ratio, ZT: Zero tillage, CT DSR: Conventional-tilled direct seeded rice; F: Fodder.Fig. 9.

Energy 214 (2021) 11886014systems are highly remunerative due to lower investment and atpar economic yields in terms of rice equivalent yield to the cereal-based production system. Therefore, the ef ﬁcient use of the naturalresources (energy, water, labour) with the adoption of the millet-based production system in the diverse agro-ecosystem arefeasible and viable options for improving the productivity, pro ﬁt-ability and provides a cleaner/safer environment to the resource-poor farmers of the region [ 21].Although the millet-based production systems have beenproved to be highly ef ﬁcient in terms of system productivity,proﬁtability, energy ratio, reducing C-footprints and GHG emission;their adoption and substitution for rice-wheat cropping systemwith millets is a dif ﬁcult task in eastern IGP due to the fact that riceand wheat have become a major food staple. However, with theincrease in temperature and rainfall variability, there is a need toidentify and target the areas suitable for the millet-based produc-tion systems. Being rich in nutrients and dietary ﬁbres, milletsneeds to be promoted as nutri-cereals in the diets of rural poor. TheGovernment policies should be changed in favour of millet-basedproduction systems for wider adoption.5. ConclusionThe dominant rice-wheat cropping system is intensively culti-vating in the Indo-Gangetic Plains zone of South Asia, it is an energyand C-intensive zone for rice-based cropping systems, there is anurgent need to deigns more ef ﬁcient production systems, which aremore productive, climate-resilient, C-and energy-ef ﬁcient, andenvironmentally sustainable. This study has designed as a moreproductive, energy-cum-C-ef ﬁcient production system that pro-mote the pro ﬁtability and environmentally safer production systemfor upland rainfed as well as irrigated ecosystems of India andSouth Asia.The major ﬁndings of the study are summarized as follows:1. The adoption of a millet-based production system reduced en-ergy consumption, C-input, C-footprint, and enhance the energyuse ef ﬁciency by 84, 172, 58, and 61%, respectively, in compari-son to cereal-based cropping systems.2. The inclusion of millets in the existing system also improved theenergy productivity, system productivity, and economic ef ﬁ-ciency under the diverse agro-ecological zone of eastern India.3. The fertilizer, a non-renewable energy input, was responsiblefor the major share of the total energy input (42 e55%) followedby diesel used for machinery during agricultural operations(12e21%) for all the diverse cropping systems.4. The nutrient and non-renewable energy use ef ﬁciencies were55.8 and 58.3% higher, respectively, in the millet-based producethan those for the cereal-based cropping systems.Hence, the existing rice-wheat cropping system may be diver-siﬁed with the substitution of climate-resilient millet-based pro-duction systems, which are more productive, resource use-ef ﬁcient,energy-cum-carbon-ef ﬁcient, and low emitter of GHGs. The infor-mation generated from this study would enhance the knowledgeand strengthen the database of policymakers and researchers forpromoting safer, cleaner, sustainable as well as productive climate-resilient cropping systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asiato achieve the ‘Sustainable Development Goals ’.Authorship contribution statementRakesh Kumar: Conceptualization, Methodology.
