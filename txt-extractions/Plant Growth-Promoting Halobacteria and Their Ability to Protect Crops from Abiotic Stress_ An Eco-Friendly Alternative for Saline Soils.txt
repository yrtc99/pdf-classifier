Halobacteria can increase the yield of crops grown under these types of stress.These bacteria thrive across a wide salinity range (1–25% NaCl) and also in the absence of NaCland have direct and indirect mechanisms that promote plant growth. This review summarizesstudies conducted over the past five years that have assessed the effect of halobacteria on plantsand soil fertility. The criteria used in the selection of halobacteria were also reviewed. Fewstudies have assessed the impact of halobacteria on soil fertility. The selection of halobacteriahas been based on a qualitative criterion considering the morphology of colonies grown in mediaenriched with salts, mainly Na+. Not all bacteria growing in salt-enriched media are capableof capturing Na+ions. Therefore, a quantitative criterion should be applied for the selection ofhalobacteria, which could be their ability to capture Na+ions in vitro . This, together with theassessment of the effect of halobacteria on soil fertility, may largely contribute to the recovery ofsaline soils.Keywords: abiotic stress; drought; plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; salinity; soil fertility1. IntroductionAbiotic factors such as salinity, drought, high and low temperatures and heavy metaltoxicity reduce crop productivity [ 1]. Climate change increases the frequency and severityof these abiotic factors. Mainly, high temperatures and low precipitation cause droughts ofincreasing severity [ 2]. Recent estimates report that abiotic stress accounts for the loss of50% of crop production [ 3]. Etesami & Maheshwari [ 2] indicated that salinity has led to a1–2% annual decline in arable land.Arid and semi-arid zones are the areas most affected by drought and salinity, twotypes of abiotic stress closely related to each other. Salinization is the increase in the con-centration of soluble ions such as Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+and K+as a result of low precipitationand high temperatures. Agricultural activities promote the salinization of soils throughirrigation with poor-quality water, inadequate farming systems and excess use of conven-tional mineral fertilizers and pesticides [ 4,5], all of which ultimately reduce soil fertilityand quality.Drought influences crop yields as low water availability adversely affects the photo-synthetic rate, nutrient uptake and metabolic processes in plants [ 6]. Facing these issues,several studies have been carried out through different approaches, including the searchAgronomy 2022 ,12, 804. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12040804 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomyAgronomy 2022 ,12, 804 2 of 22for new techniques in traditional agriculture, new plant varieties, genetic engineeringand the use of biostimulants, with the aim of reducing crop yield losses caused by abioticfactors [ 1]. Efforts made as part of traditional agriculture and genetic engineering todevelop plants resistant to salinity and desiccation are complex because these stressorsaffect several physiological aspects of the plant and require many years of study [ 7]. Bycontrast, biostimulants have shown positive effects on plants to improve tolerance toabiotic stress [8].The increase in the use of fertilizers and pesticides signiﬁcantly reduces microbialbiodiversity in soil and can cause environmental pollution issues; indeed, the use ofsome synthetic plant additives is prohibited due to the absorption and accumulation oftoxic chemicals in plants, which pose a health risk [ 9]. One of the approaches to achievesustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture is the use of inoculants based onbeneﬁcial microorganisms, which stimulate the growth of plants or their protection againstpathogenic agents and abiotic factors [9].A widely accepted eco-friendly biological alternative is the use of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as halobacteria, which have great potential foruse in agriculture as they increase crop production and protect plants against differenttypes of abiotic stress [ 10]. Halobacteria are microorganisms with the ability to growacross a wide salinity range (1–25% NaCl) as well as in the absence of NaCl. Thecombination of this ability with their capacity to promote plant growth has been usedas support to propose the use of halobacteria as a valuable eco-friendly alternative toincrease the productivity of salt-stress-sensitive crops and to remediate salinity-impairedsoils [11].In arid regions, microbial metabolic activity is strongly driven by soil watercontent [ 12]. This is why PGPR adapted to this type of environment survive longdrought periods and exert an improved positive effect on plants when rehydrationoccurs [5,12] . Halobacteria are microorganisms adapted to the natural salinity of arid re-gions; for this reason, their application is considered a suitable alternative in this type ofenvironment [13].This review summarizes some studies conducted over the past ﬁve years addressingthe effect of halobacteria on the mitigation of salinity and drought stress in differentcrops, with the consequent promotion of plant growth; these two types of stress wereconsidered for being the abiotic factors with the greatest inﬂuence in arid and semi-aridregions. Emphasis is made on those studies that have demonstrated the positive effectof halobacteria on soil fertility properties or that have considered this aspect. Finally,this paper highlights the methodological aspects and approaches that, in our view, maycontribute to the potential of halobacteria for use as an eco-friendly strategy to increasecrop yield and contribute to soil remediation in saline soils.2. HalobacteriaDuring prolonged periods of drought in arid and semi-arid regions, high temperaturesand evaporation, as well as high salt content in soil solution, cause physiological stress inmicrobial communities [ 14]. Many microorganisms, such as archaeans, bacteria and fungi,have adapted to the different changes in the extreme climatic conditions of these regions.Saline stress-tolerant bacteria employ a variety of strategies to survive and growin environments across a wide salinity range. According to their ability to survive inthese environments, they are classiﬁed as halotolerant or halophilic bacteria. Halotolerantbacteria can survive in media with up to 25% NaCl and media with no NaCl, whilehalophilic bacteria need salt to grow. The halophilic category includes slightly halophilicbacteria, which show unlimited growth in media within the range of 1–3% NaCl; moderatehalophilic bacteria, within a range of 3–15% NaCl; and extreme halophilic bacteria, between15–25% NaCl [5,15].Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 3 of 22Bacterial phyla most commonly found in different saline and xeric soils include Acti-nobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. Also present,although less dominant, are Deinococcus and Verrucomicrobiae. Besides, dry soils are alsohome to some phyla from Archaea, such as Euryachaeota, Crenarchaeota and Thaumar-chaeota [16].Halobacteria comprise various halophilic and halotolerant species; these bacteriahave been isolated from saline environments in parts of the world with different de-grees of hostility. Roodi et al. [ 17] isolated species of the genera Halobacillus ,Halomonas ,Thalassobacillus ,Brevibacterium and Bacillus from the Karak saline mine soil in Pakistan.Several salt lakes of Romania with salinities above 70 g L 1and electrical conductivitiesup to 168.1 dS m 1hosted bacteria in three phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Acti-nobacteria; within the phylum Firmicutes, the genera Bacillus ,Virgibacillus ,Salinococcus ,Marinococcus ,Halobacillus ,Planococcus ,Thalassobacillus and Salimicrobium were reported;in the phylum Proteobacteria, Halomonas was the most representative genus, with Vib-rio,Idiomarina and Psychrobacter also present; in the phylum Actinobacteria, the mostrepresentative genus was Nocardiopsis [18]. Sharma et al. [ 19] isolated bacteria of thegenera Bacillus ,Corynebacterium ,Acinetobacter ,Aeromonas and Staphylococcus from soil ofthe Thar desert in India.Multiple studies have explored extreme environments to isolate halobacteria; however,these microorganisms are distributed across a broad range of environments, includingfreshwater, as in the case of Micrococcus luteos ,Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcuslentus , which have been isolated from the Ezzu river in Nigeria [20].Several halotolerant bacteria have been isolated from halophyte plants. Thus,these plants may be good sources for the identification of additional halophyticPGPR bacteria, as a potential plant-bacteria relationship has already been estab-lished. Halophytes are plants capable of growing in saline environments and caneven accumulate Na+in plant tissue. The precise hormonal mechanisms by whichhalophyte plant roots perceive salt stress and translate this perception into adaptive,directional growth toward higher salt concentrations are not well understood [ 21].Halotropism is a sodium-specific tropic movement of roots [ 22]. In halotropism, thegravitropic responses of roots should be inhibited, so this mechanism helps roots mod-ify and fine-tune their movement to optimize growth and survive conditions of highsalinity [22].Mukhtar et al. [ 23] isolated bacteria of the genera Bacillus ,Halobacillus and Kocuriafrom the rhizosphere of Salsola stocksii and Atriplex amnicola in Kewra salt mines in Pakistan.Ruppel et al. [ 24] conducted a review of several halotolerant bacterial genera and speciesassociated with different halophytic plants in coastal and arid hypersaline environments.Szyma´ nska et al. [ 25] isolated halotolerant endophytic and rhizosphere bacteria of Astertripolium , a halophytic plant that grows in degraded hypersaline soils. Halophytic plantsof the genus Sauceda also harbor halotolerant bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis ,Zhihengli-uella halotolerans ,Erwinia persicina and some species of the genera Brachybacterium andBrevibacterium [26].To survive in environments with high salt concentrations, halobacteria have devel-oped two key strategies: (1) Maintain high intracellular salt concentrations to match theexternal salt concentration, known as “salt-in” strategy. (2) Maintain low cytoplasmic saltconcentrations by compensating osmotic pressure with the accumulation of compatiblesolutes [27].The salt-in strategy is commonly used by extreme halophilic archaeans and halophilicanaerobic bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales and involves the active uptake of Na+and its accumulation inside the cell [ 27]. However, other studies have found differentlevels of in-vitro Na+uptake in bacteria of different orders, such as Vibrio alginolyticus ,V . metschnikovii ,Flavimonas oryzihabitans and Agrobacterium tumefasciens [28].Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 4 of 22On the other hand, the accumulation of compatible solutes is a common response tosalt and drought stress. These compatible solutes can be synthesized de novo within thecell or incorporated from the exogenous medium and stored in large quantities withoutcompromising cell physiology [ 24]; they increase the ﬂuidity of the cell membrane andstabilize proteins by binding to their surface and preventing stress-related denaturation.The most common compatible solutes in halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms canbe classiﬁed into (1) amino acids and their derivatives such as glycine betaine, glutamine,glutamate, proline and ectoine and (2) polyols such as sucrose, trehalose, mannosylglycerateand diglycerol phosphate [29].Salt-in strategies and the accumulation of compatible solutes participate in osmoreg-ulation along with other physiological strategies, including the balance of intracellularNa+concentration by pumping ions out of the cell by the electrogenic Na+/H+antiportersand K+/Na+ion transporters that achieves the mass accumulation of K+by effectivelyremoving Na+[7,27].Another characteristic of halophilic bacteria is the composition of membrane pro-teins, which include high levels of acid amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate andlow levels of basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine. The negative charge con-ferred to the membrane by glutamate and aspartate maintains its structure in the presenceof salt within the cell and favors water retention for the proper functioning of enzymeactivity [24,27].Many halotolerant bacteria produce exopolysaccharides that form biofilms to im-prove moisture retention and create a more hydrated microenvironment for the cell;biofilms also act as a barrier and limit the ingress of salts into the cell [ 11]. Bacte-rial exopolysaccharides are composed of homo- or heteropolysaccharides formed byglucose, galactose and mannose monomers in combination with neutral sugars (rham-nose and fucose), uronic acids (glucuronic and galacturonic), amino sugars, organicsubstitutes with ester bonds and pyruvate ketals [ 30]. The composition of exopolysac-charides varies among species and their production depends on the growth phase,the relative availability of carbon and nitrogen in the environment and environmentalconditions [30].Several genera of rhizosphere bacteria such as Enterobacter ,Aeromonas ,Bacillus ,Planococcus ,Halomonas ,Burkholderia ,Microbacterium and Paenibacillus produce exopolysac-charides and form biofilms [ 5]. Almost all species of the genus Pseudomonas produce algi-nate (one of the main exopolysaccharides composed of D-mannuronic and L-glucuronicacids) [ 31], however, the proportion of the components of alginate changes understress conditions; for example, Pseudomonas spp. GAP-45 changed the compositionof the exopolysaccharide produced when subjected to high temperatures, salinity anddesiccation [32].3. Plant Growth-Promoting Halobacteria and Protection against Abiotic StressPGPR are bacteria that inhabit the rhizosphere and facilitate plant growth throughvarious direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include biological nitrogenﬁxation, production of phytohormones, production of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACC-deaminase) and solubilization of phosphates and K,as well as the production of siderophores that improve Fe uptake. Indirect mechanismsinclude plant-induced systemic resistance and the production of antimicrobial compoundsthat inhibit pathogen growth [33,34].Halobacteria also possess direct and indirect mechanisms capable of promoting plantgrowth even in highly saline environments [2].The plant growth-promoting effect of halotolerant and halophilic bacteria has beenextensively documented [5,35–37] and occurs through various mechanisms, as follows.Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 5 of 22(1) Activating the antioxidant defense machinery of plants by regulating the activity ofenzymes such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase, which eliminatereactive oxygen species and protect plants from salinity(2) Improving plant nutrition by ﬁxing atmospheric nitrogen, solubilizing nutrients suchas P and K, or by producing siderophores that improve Fe uptake(3) Increasing selective ion uptake to maintain a high K+:Na+ratio, which can reduce theaccumulation of toxic ions such as Na+and Cl (4) Reducing the accumulation of Na+in the plant by excreting exopolysaccharides thatﬁx this cation in roots and prevent its translocation to leaves and the rest of theplant; the exopolysaccharides produced by halobacteria also improve soil structure bypromoting soil aggregation(5) Generating ACC-deaminase activity to reduce ethylene levels in the plant(6) Modifying the structure and morphology of roots, thus facilitating the uptake ofnutrients and water from soil. Szepesi [ 21] established that halotropism helps rootsnavigate and remodel their architecture through cost-effective energy supply to sur-vive high-salinity conditions(7) Accumulating amino acids such as glutamate and proline, amines such as carnitine,glycine and betaine, and sugars such as sucrose and trehalose to reduce intracellularosmotic stress(8) Increasing stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activity(9) Inducing and regulating the expression of stress-response genes in plantsStudies with plant growth-promoting halobacteria have reported increased biomet-ric and physiological parameters, as well as higher yields of many crops of commercialinterest, including Oryza sativa (rice), Triticum aestivum (wheat), Vigna unguiculata (L.)(caupi bean), Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Zea mays (maize), Cuminum cyminum (cumin),Glycine max L. (soybean), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Beta vulgaris L. (sugar beet),among others (Table 1). For instance, in wheat ( T. aestivum )—a crop highly sensitiveto salinity—, the inoculation of different halotolerant bacteria improved plant growthand yield under saline stress [ 38–41]. Peanut plants ( Arachis hypogaea ) inoculated withStenotrophomonas maltophilia BJ01 isolated from saline soil showed improved growthand conservation of photosynthetic pigments and total amino acid content, relative tonon-inoculated plants, in the presence of 100 mM NaCl [ 42]. Under the same salinityconcentrations, this same crop showed higher values of germination percentage andparameters such as root length, stem length, number of leaves and shoot biomass, afterinoculation of Bacillus megaterium (YM13), Enterobacter sp. (YM14), Providencia rettgeri(TPM23) and Ensifer adhaeren (TPMX5), four halotolerant and phosphate-solubilizingbacteria strains [43].Bacillus pumulus improved tolerance to salinity stress and high boron concentrationsin rice, another salt stress-sensitive crop [ 44].Enterobacter sp. P23, which shows ACC-deaminase activity as the primary plant growth-promotion mechanism and is resistant tosalinity, favored the growth of rice seedlings under salt stress [ 45]; the strain PR14, whichshared these same characteristics, showed an increase in the growth of millet seedlings inaddition to rice and sorghum under alkaline conditions [46].Tirry et al. [ 47] reported that Pseudomonas putida ,Alcaligenes sp.,Klebsiella sp. andPseudomonas cedrine increased root growth and chlorophyll content in alfalfa plants undersalt stress. Inoculated alfalfa plants also showed lower hydrogen peroxide, malondialde-hyde and proline contents, which are considered indicators of oxidative damage. Severalstudies have documented the beneﬁcial effect of plant growth-promoting halobacteria onthe oxidative response of the plant [48–52] (Table 1).Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 6 of 22Table 1.

[ 39] demonstrated that Bacillus subtilis ,Oceanobacillus iheyensis andArthrobacter crystallopoietes are halotolerant bacteria that improve the germination andsurvival rate of two lines of Triticum turgidum subsp. durum under water and salinestress simultaneously.The accumulation of proline (a compatible solute) in plants is correlated withtolerance to salinity and drought in plants [ 31], suggesting that plants may sharecommon response mechanisms to these two types of abiotic stress. Many studiesshow decreased proline accumulation in plants in the presence of halobacteria sinceplants show no oxidative damage requiring a response when subjected to saline stress(Table 1).Although studies evaluating the tolerance of halobacteria to various typesof abiotic stress simultaneously are scarce, the wide range of mechanisms avail-able to stimulate growth and protect crops from saline stress are very likely tooffset the harmful effects of other types of stress, such as water deficit. Achro-mobacter piechaudii , for instance, induces resistance against salinity and droughtin tomato and cucumber thanks to ACC-deaminase activity, a very common featurein plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria associated with tolerance to drought andsalinity stress in plants by reducing endogenous ethylene levels that increase withstress [30].Many rhizobacteria that have been tested in drought-stressed crops show ACC-deaminase activity; although this metabolic feature is one of the main factors conferringtolerance to drought and salinity in plants [ 2,65,66], it has also been found as an impor-tant mechanism for the survival of plants under stress from ﬂooding, freezing and heavymetals [2,65].Heavy metal toxicity has also been considered when evaluating the efficiencyof halobacteria in stimulating plant growth and protecting some crops. In fact, Mas-moudi et al. [ 54] reported the efficiency of Bacillus velenzensis and B. subtilis subsp.spizizenii to increase tomato plant growth ( Solanum lycopersicum var. Rio grande ) undersalt stress in the presence of heavy metals (Co, Ni, Cu and Cr).Al-Mailem et al. [ 67] assessed the tolerance to different concentrations of heavy metals(Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu) of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria by adding some biostimulants toboost their resistance in the presence of crude oil. It was found that the addition of prolineand Fe 2SO4signiﬁcantly improved the tolerance to heavy metal toxicity of the halobacteriaArchodomonas aquaeolei ,Marinobacter lacisalsi ,Halomonas axialensis ,Kocuria ﬂava ,Haloferaxelongans and Halobacterium salinarum and it increased their bioremediation potential inhydrocarbon-polluted hypersaline areas.Hassan et al. [ 68] tested the ability of halo-alkaliphilic species Sphingobium sp.,Stenotrophomonas chelatiphaga and Rhizobium borbori to biodegrade tributyltin (TBT)—acompound used as a pesticide in agriculture —, identifying a TBTB-permease geneencoding an ArsB permease responsible for TBT resistance from the gene amplificationofS. chelatiphaga that showed to be more efficient in transforming tributyltin into di-and monobutyltin.The ability of halobacteria to tolerate pollution by heavy metals and organic pollutantsis a feature of interest in assessing their application for rhizoremediation and recovery ofsaline soils [69–71].Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 13 of 224. Effect of Halobacteria on Soil FertilityMost studies on halobacteria have focused on increasing plant growth and cropyield under salinity conditions and, to a lesser extent, under other types of stress such asdrought [ 63] and heavy metal toxicity [ 54,67,70,72]. Therefore, the impact of halobacteriaon soil fertility has not been investigated in depth. Some studies show improved soilstructure and fertility after inoculation with halobacteria [11].Inoculation with this type of microorganisms has been reported to signiﬁcantly im-prove the availability of nutrients such as N, P , K and Fe in soil, generally without af-fecting the structure of the existing microbial community [ 73]. Some genera such asAzospirillum ,Alcaligenes ,Bacillus ,Burkholderia ,Enterobacter ,Flavobacterium ,Pseudomonas andRhizobium , in addition to having shown less negative effects of salinity on different crops,appear to favor organic matter content and the structure and water retention capacity ofsoil [11].Mukhtar et al. [ 23] evaluated the growth of maize plants inoculated with Bacillus safensis ,B. pumilus ,Kucuria rosea ,Enterobacter aerogenes and Aeromonas veronii under saline stress.These bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of halophyte plants and showed theability to solubilize phosphates. These authors reported that inoculation of these halobac-teria, in addition to increasing the growth of maize plants, also increased P availabilityin soil.Pankaj et al. [ 74] determined the efﬁciency of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (KM233646),Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (KM233647), Bacillus ﬂexus (KM233648) and B. safensis (KM233652)to improve the plant growth and crop yield of Bacopa monnieri (L.), a plant that bioaccumu-lates Na+and K+in saline soils. The halobacteria-treated soil showed an increase in theactivity of dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase, as well as highertotal nitrogen, organic carbon and available P , compared to non-inoculated soil. In contrast,the Na+/K+ratio, electrical conductivity, pH, percentage of exchangeable Na+and Na+uptake rate decreased in inoculated soils.Al-Enazy et al. [ 75] demonstrated that the inoculation of maize plants with Azotobacterchroocococcum ,Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens by adding phosphorusplaster to saline soil in Saudi Arabia signiﬁcantly reduced electrical conductivity andsoil pH after inoculation. Hassan et al. [ 76] evaluated the effect of the pulverized rootsof a halophyte plant containing three halotolerant bacteria ( Bacillus cereus ,Pseudomonasmoraviensis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ) on wheat growth and soil fertility properties;they found that electrical conductivity and the Na+uptake rate decreased signiﬁcantly,unlike K, P and NO 3-content, which increased after inoculation.Anees et al. [ 77] evaluated the effect of the co-inoculation of halotolerant bacteria(Pseudomonas sp., Thalassobacillus sp. and Terribacillus sp.) and chitinolytic bacteria(Pseudomonas spp. Fo1, Sanguibacter spp. Ft2, Bacillus spp. Ft4 and Bacillus spp. Fc3) inspinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and found that the electrical conductivity of soil decreasedfrom 6.5 to 2 dS m 1and Na+content decreased from 22–24 to 9–12 meq L 1afterharvest. In addition, the dry weight of roots and shoots increased, while the leaf Na+:K+ratio decreased.Arora [ 78] reported a substantial improvement in soil pH (9.42 to 8.91) and a decreasein exchangeable Na+content (416 to 238 mg kg 1) after 2 years of continuous inoculationin rice and wheat plants with two commercial bioinoculants made from plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria isolated from halophyte plants. In addition, increases in carbonlevels from soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity were observed, comparedwith soil where bioinoculants were not used.Based on the above, the inoculation with halobacteria seems to contribute to therecovery of some soil fertility properties, thus achieving a double beneﬁt that implies anincrease in plant growth and the restoration of the soil (Figure 1).Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 14 of 22Agronomy 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 22    Figure 1. Effect of halotolerant PGPR bacteria on soil  and the plant under high salinity. The exopol-ysaccharide produced by halobacteria plays a key role in Na+ sequestration and the consequent re-duction in soil electrical conductivity (EC). Besides, it favors the formation of aggregates in soil, with macro and micropores that improve water filtration and retention. It also increases cation exchange capacity (CEC), decreases the pH and improves nutr ient availability. Altogether, these contribute to increase soil fertility. On the other side, halobacteria  solubilize nutrients, release osmolytes, antiox-idant enzymes (SOD = Superoxide dismutase, CAT = Catalase, POD = Peroxidase), auxins (IAA = Indol acetic-acid), gibberellins (AG3 = Gibberellic acid), stress signaling and adaptation molecules (ABA = Abscisic acid) that favor plant growth an d protection against salinity, and improve water retention and Na+ extrusion thanks to the exopolysaccharide. 5. Abiotic Characteristics of Arid and Semi-Arid Zones Arid and semi-arid zones stretch across an estimated area of 66.7 million km2 of the Earth, and this area is expected to expand as a result of climate change and human activ-ities [16]. Soils in arid and semi-arid zones have a variable depth with textures ranging from sandy to clayey [79]; the existing sparse  vegetation resulting from low precipitation accounts for the low organic matter content in soil (1–3%) [80]. These soils are character-ized by the accumulation of soluble salts wh ose distribution, quantity and type depend on the composition of water reaching the soil profile and the fluxes that occur within it. The most common salts include combinations of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ with Cl−, SO 42− and HCO 3− [4], although soil salinity is driven primarily by NaCl levels. Many of these arid regions have geomorph ological features characterized by inner basins with no natural outlets, so water evaporation leaves salts in the soil, causing sali-nization problems if they are not dissolved by rain or redistributed [79]. Soils affected by salinity are classified into three types: saline, sodic and saline-sodic [81]. Saline soils contain enough soluble salts to affect plant growth and are characterized by an electrical conductivity higher than 4 dS m−1 and a pH value of less than 8.5. Sodic soils have exchangeable Na+ levels above 15% and electrical conductivity values below 4 dS m−1 since they are not saline an d may or may not have an al kaline pH above 8.5. As a result, these soils show struct ural issues such as dispersion and disaggregation. On the other hand, saline-sodic soils  have high levels of solu ble salts (predominantly Ca2+ chlo-rides or sulfates and, in smaller amounts, nitrates or borates) and Na+ ions, with an elec-trical conductivity greater than 4 dS m−1 and not necessarily alkaline [81–83].  Figure 1. Effect of halotolerant PGPR bacteria on soil and the plant under high salinity.

Abiotic Characteristics of Arid and Semi-Arid ZonesArid and semi-arid zones stretch across an estimated area of 66.7 million km2ofthe Earth, and this area is expected to expand as a result of climate change and humanactivities [ 16]. Soils in arid and semi-arid zones have a variable depth with texturesranging from sandy to clayey [ 79]; the existing sparse vegetation resulting from lowprecipitation accounts for the low organic matter content in soil (1–3%) [ 80]. These soilsare characterized by the accumulation of soluble salts whose distribution, quantity andtype depend on the composition of water reaching the soil proﬁle and the ﬂuxes that occurwithin it.The most common salts include combinations of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+and K+with Cl ,SO42 and HCO 3 [4], although soil salinity is driven primarily by NaCl levels.Many of these arid regions have geomorphological features characterized by innerbasins with no natural outlets, so water evaporation leaves salts in the soil, causing salin-ization problems if they are not dissolved by rain or redistributed [79].Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 15 of 22Soils affected by salinity are classified into three types: saline, sodic and saline-sodic [ 81]. Saline soils contain enough soluble salts to affect plant growth and arecharacterized by an electrical conductivity higher than 4 dS m 1and a pH value of lessthan 8.5. Sodic soils have exchangeable Na+levels above 15% and electrical conductivityvalues below 4 dS m 1since they are not saline and may or may not have an alkalinepH above 8.5. As a result, these soils show structural issues such as dispersion anddisaggregation. On the other hand, saline-sodic soils have high levels of soluble salts(predominantly Ca2+chlorides or sulfates and, in smaller amounts, nitrates or borates)and Na+ions, with an electrical conductivity greater than 4 dS m 1and not necessarilyalkaline [81–83].Various factors can promote salinization in agricultural soils. In areas with shallowwater tables (less than 1.5 m deep), vertical drainage is inadequate and, when ground-water reaches the surface, it recirculates dissolved salts that accumulate on the surface.If the groundwater level is deep but drainage is poor, salts transported by rain, weather-ing and wind deposits accumulate on the surface; these processes commonly occur insodic or alkaline soils. On the other hand, if irrigation water is of poor quality, plantsare unable to completely absorb the salts dissolved in water and they accumulate inroots; this, together with high evaporation conditions, ultimately leads to increased soilsalinity [84].Soil salinity and drought are considered the main abiotic stressors that severely impaircrop growth in arid and semi-arid areas, leading to major negative impacts from theecological, agronomic and economic perspectives [ 2]. It is estimated that about 20% ofirrigated soils in the world have been affected by salinity; these are classiﬁed as arid ordesert soils and comprise 25% of the total soils covering the Earth’s surface [ 85]. Droughtincludes the interaction between water deﬁcit, high temperature and high irradiance.Drought and water deﬁcit are terms used interchangeably in various studies to refer tostress caused by poor water availability and its effect on living organisms.6. Halobacteria Potential in the Recovery of Saline Soils. A Key CharacteristicThe use of halophilic bacteria represents a great potential for the recovery of soilsdegraded by salinity, drought, or even polluted with heavy metals, due to their tolerance tothese stressors; however, the mechanisms through which these bacteria change the originalions that lead to degradation by forming complexes in soil have been little studied [28].It has been proposed that to capture Na+ions from soil, halobacteria should be capableof taking them up to osmotically regulate the intracellular concentration of salt accordingto the salt concentration in soil—a common strategy in moderate and extreme halophilicmicroorganisms that strictly require salt for growth [ 27]. However, it has been reportedthat other strategies of halobacteria, such as the production of exopolysaccharides, accountfor the active sequestration of Na+ions. This not only reduces Na+availability to plantsin saline soils but may also contribute to improving soil structure by forming micro-and macroaggregates, with the consequent increase in soil water retention capacity [ 86].Mukherjee et al. [ 86] identiﬁed through in-vitro assays that the exopolysaccharide producedbyHalomonas sp. is directly related to Na+sequestration.The literature review revealed that most studies involving plant growth-promotinghalobacteria report the selection of this type of microorganisms considering the morpho-logical characteristics of colonies grown in media supplemented with salt, mainly Na+,but they did not focus on the ability of halobacteria to sequester Na+ions in vitro . Studiesaddressing the recovery of saline soil fertility have also not evaluated Na+uptake in vitroby the inoculated halobacteria, as suggested by Sanchez-Leal & Arguello-Arias [ 28]. Theseauthors reported that, although all the isolated bacteria initially displayed a halophilicbehavior, only Vibrio alginolyticus and V . metschnikovii were able to capture Na+ions in vitro .The above showed that not all bacteria grown in salt-enriched media have the ability tocapture Na+from the external medium.Agronomy 2022 ,12, 804 16 of 22We found only two studies that included the quantitative determination of in-vitroNa+uptake in the selection of halotolerant bacteria to assess their effect on the growthof rice plants. Shultana et al. [ 59] reported that Bacillus tequilensis and Bacillus aryabhattaiincreased the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of riceplants, as well as grain yield. Separately, Fatima et al. [ 87] reported that the inoculation ofAlcaligenes sp. supplemented with the exopolysaccharide produced by this halobacteriumin different concentrations led to a signiﬁcant increase in the biometric parameters of riceplants compared to the increase observed with the inoculation of the bacterium alone,thus highlighting the importance of the exopolysaccharide during salt stress. However, inboth studies, only the results of some crop growth parameters were reported, without anin-depth assessment of the effect of the Na+sequestration ability of these halobacteria onsoil fertility.The ability of halotolerant bacteria to actively capture Na+from the soil may be criticalfor reducing the natural salinity of arid and semi-arid soils due to the effect of climaticconditions, as well as of any type of soil affected by salinity.The use of halotolerant PGPR bacteria in arid and semi-arid regions has been proposedby several authors [ 2,13,16], as it potentially represents an important option to recover soilfertility in these regions.The studies mentioned in Section 4 above demonstrated an improvement of soilproperties associated with the inoculation of halobacteria; However, other recent studiesexplored the effect of the combination of halobacteria with organic amendments to recoversoil fertility. Arjumend & Turan [ 88] showed that the inoculation of halotolerant PGPRalone increased the growth and yield of wheat in saline soil in Turkey, noting a decreasein soil parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity and exchangeable Na+after harvest.However, the highest values of all parameters were obtained with the combined applicationof halotolerant bacteria and biochar, a carbon-rich bioproduct, also showing a signiﬁcantincrease in the content of organic matter, total nitrogen and exchangeable cations (Ca2+,Mg2+y K+) in the soil.Other approaches for the recovery of soils involving halobacteria are those that usethe products of bacterial metabolism, mainly exopolysaccharides and biosurfactants [ 89],in combination with amendments [ 90], or with halotolerant microorganisms [ 87]; these ap-proaches have achieved an improvement in soil fertility coupled with increasedcrop growth.Some recent studies are using the potential of halobacteria in various ways, suchas the bioremediation of contaminated saline environments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa(AHV-KH10) biosurfactants to biodegrade diesel in the Persian Gulf [ 91]. Other studieshave focused on the biological treatment of organic compounds in water with halotolerantbacteria for hydrocarbon removal [ 92]. Halobacteria are even applied to crops in coastalareas of northeastern United Arab Emirates that are irrigated with seawater [93].7. ProspectsThis review outlines multiple ways through which halobacteria contribute to thedevelopment and survival of crops subjected to salinity stress and other abiotic stressorssuch as water deﬁcit and heavy metal toxicity. Many studies provide knowledge of theeffect of halobacteria on crop protection and growth enhancement through different growthpromotion mechanisms. However, most studies have focused on crop yield and production.Therefore, further research is needed addressing the effect of plant growth-promotinghalobacteria on the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soil to generateknowledge oriented to the remediation and recovery of the fertility of soils degraded bysalinity through the inoculation of this type of microorganisms.Arid and semi-arid regions are important areas of soils degraded by salinity anddrought whose fertility can be recovered through the combined effect of proper manage-ment practices and the inoculation of halobacteria. The colonization efﬁciency of PGPRbacteria is closely related to the effect on the rhizosphere, plant age and genotype, andAgronomy 2022 ,12, 804 17 of 22the intrinsic abilities of the bacterial species. The type of root exudates varies with plantgenotype and plant age [ 94] and determines the composition of the bacterial communityassociated with the rhizosphere [ 95]. The intrinsic abilities of the bacterial species referto the set of features that make it more competitive against other microorganisms to col-onize the rhizosphere, including nutrient solubilization, bioﬁlm formation to adhere toroots, production of antimicrobial compounds, motility and chemotaxis and evasion of theplant immune system [ 96]. For these reasons, ideally, indigenous plant growth-promotinghalobacteria should be used in the development of bioinoculants, since they can be easilyadapted to local ﬁeld conditions, as suggested by Kumar et al. [97].Practices to reduce soil salinity include irrigation with large amounts of water to washaway Na+ions; however, these methods may require very expensive drainage systems andare difﬁcult to achieve as irrigation water obtained from adjacent areas is commonly alsosaline [ 98]. Practices such as fertilization, the addition of amendments and fertigation arealso accepted and recommended, provided the concentration of nutrients added to soil isproperly controlled; in combination with drip irrigation, these are suitable alternatives forimproving water use efﬁciency and constantly leaching salt away from the root zone ofplants [ 98]. Another technique is the use of halophyte plants that, due to their ability tohyperaccumulate salts and even heavy metals, are suitable models for the phytoremediationof saline soils [99–102].The use of plant growth-promoting halobacteria may have pronounced beneﬁts inall aspects mentioned above, since the tolerance to drought conferred by these bacteriaon plants can improve water retention and absorption in soil, inﬂuencing the efﬁciency ofirrigation water use. Also, the continuous supply of nutrients provided by halobacteriaassociated with the plant decreases the consumption and amount of fertilizers applied,representing a lower economic expense and a lower precipitation rate of those nutrients notabsorbed by the plant that remain in soil, which lead to salinization. Therefore, this typeof bacteria can contribute to reducing soil salinity through their plant growth promotionproperties and their intrinsic characteristics to reduce soil Na+levels.All these characteristics make halobacteria an eco-friendly alternative for recoveringsoil fertility in arid regions and other areas facing similar issues from soil deterioration dueto abiotic factors or as a consequence of salinization arising from conventional agriculturalpractices. New bioinoculants may potentially be developed by utilizing diverse halotolerantbacteria and their metabolites for improving the productivity, fertility and quality of salinesoils (Figure 2).Agronomy 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 22   Practices to reduce soil salinity include irrigation with large amounts of water to wash away Na+ ions; however, these methods may require very expensive drainage systems and are difficult to achieve as irrigation water obtained from adjacent areas is commonly also saline [98].

Figure 2. Application of halobacteria and their metabolites  to recover soil fertility and increase crop yield in soils degraded by salinity and drought. Recently, Kumar et al.

This will  help produce precise data that can be replicated more accurately. In this sense, the literature surveyed reported that halotolerant bacteria have been selected solely consid ering a qualitative criterion based on the morphological characteristics of the colonies grown in media enriched with salts, mainly Na+. A stricter quantitative criterion to be applied in the selection of plant growth-promoting halotolerant bacteria may be the assessment of Na+ uptake in vitro since not all bacteria that grow in salt-enriched media are capable of capturing Na+ ions [28]. This may Figure 2.

ConclusionsHalobacteria are microorganisms adapted to survive under adverse conditions becausethey have physiological mechanisms allowing them to tolerate different concentrations ofsalts in their environment. These microorganisms are distributed across a broad range ofenvironments. The mechanisms for plant growth promotion of this type of bacteria aremultiple and include direct and indirect mechanisms through which they have managed toinduce an increase in the biometric and physiological parameters of plants, as well as in theyield of multiple crops that are sensitive to salt stress. Most studies related to halobacteriahave focused on increasing plant growth and crop yield under saline conditions and, to alesser extent, under other stressors such as drought and heavy metal toxicity. Therefore,the impact of halobacteria on soil fertility has not been investigated in depth. The inclusionof this latter aspect in studies addressing halobacteria and the selection of halobacteriabased on quantitative methods can contribute to a better understanding of the effect ofhalobacteria on soil properties and the possible recovery of arid and semi-arid soils that arecurrently degraded by salinity and drought.Author Contributions: Original idea and conceptualization: J.H.-C. and A.B.-C.; original draft:J.H.-C. and A.B.-C.; revision and editing, S.S.-M., T.A.-B. and P .S.S.-M.
