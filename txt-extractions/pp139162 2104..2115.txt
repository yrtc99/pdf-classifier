More Productive Than Maize in the Midwest: How DoesMiscanthus Do It?1[W][OA]F r a n kG .D o h l e m a na n dS t e p h e nP .L o n g *Department of Plant Biology (F.G.D., S.P.L.), Department of Crop Sciences (S.P.L.), and Institute forGenomic Biology (S.P.L.), University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois 61801In the ﬁrst side-by-side large-scale trials of these two C4crops in the U.S. Corn Belt, Miscanthus ( Miscanthus 3giganteus ) was59% more productive than grain maize ( Zea mays ).Total productivity is the product of the total solar radiation incident per unitland area and the efﬁciencies of light interception ( «i) and its conversion into aboveground biomass ( «ca). Averaged over twogrowing seasons, «cadid not differ, but «iwas 61% higher for Miscanthus, which developed a leaf canopy earlier andmaintained it later. The diurnal course of photosynthesis was measured on sunlit and shaded leaves of each species on 26dates. The daily integral of leaf-level photosynthetic CO2uptake differed slightly when integrated across two growing seasonsbut was up to 60% higher in maize in mid-summer. The average leaf area of Miscanthus was double that of maize, with theresult that calculated canopy photosynthesis was 44% higher in Miscanthus, corresponding closely to the biomass differences.To determine the basis of differences in mid-season leaf photosynthesis, light and CO2responses were analyzed to determine invivo biochemical limitations. Maize had a higher maximum velocity of phospho enolpyruvate carboxylation, velocity ofphospho enolpyruvate regeneration, light saturated rate of photosynthesis, and higher maximum quantum efﬁciency of CO2assimilation. These biochemical differences, however, were more than offset by the larger leaf area and its longer duration inMiscanthus. The results indicate that the full potential of C4photosynthetic productivity is not achieved by modern temperatemaize cultivars.Maize ( Zea mays ) is the most important C4grain cropin the world in terms of global annual tons produced(Food and Agricultural Organization, 2009). However,much of this production is in the temperate zone,where C4photosynthesis and development are limitedby the low temperatures of spring and autumn. Recordmaize yields are achieved on the deep fertile soils ofthe Midwestern U.S. Corn Belt, but could they behigher? It has been widely observed that C4plants,while highly productive under warm sunlit conditionsare adversely affected by chilling conditions ( ,14/C176C;Long et al., 1994). Miscanthus ( Miscanthus 3giganteus ;Hodkinson and Renvoize, 2001), which is closelyrelated to the three major C4crops, sugarcane ( Saccha-rum ofﬁcinarum ), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ), andmaize, has been found to be very productive even at52/C176N latitude in Britain, where summer heat is insuf-ﬁcient for a maize crop to be grown through to grainproduction (Beale and Long, 1995). More recently,Miscanthus has been shown to be exceptionally pro-ductive in small plot trials (0.01 ha) in the MidwesternUnited States, even in comparison with the perennialcold-tolerant prairie C4grass switchgrass ( Panicumvirgatum ; Heaton et al., 2008).However, there have been no side-by-side ﬁeldcomparisons of grain maize and Miscanthus in largeplot trials and, therefore, no ﬁeld analysis of why theproductivity of these two species may differ. Previouscontrolled environment studies have shown that Mis-canthus can develop leaves at lower temperatures thanmaize, is less prone to photoinhibition at chillingtemperatures, and on transfer to lower temperaturesit shows acclimation at the molecular level that allowsphotosynthesis to continue (Farage et al., 2006; Wanget al., 2008). Controlled environment studies have alsosuggested that Miscanthus has a lower temperatureoptimum for light-saturated photosynthesis (Naiduand Long, 2004). It might therefore be expected thatMiscanthus could develop leaves earlier than maizeand maintain them later, but this cold tolerance couldcome at the expense of high rates during mid-summer.In the ﬁeld, signiﬁcant amounts of crop carbon assim-ilation occurs under non-light saturating conditions,i.e. in the shade of other leaves, on overcast days, andat dusk and dawn on all days. Beale et al. (1996)showed surprisingly high light-limited rates of pho-tosynthesis for Miscanthus in the ﬁeld in England, asmeasured by the initial slope of the response of CO2uptake ( A) to incident photon ﬂux and termed themaximum quantum yield of CO2uptake ( FCO2,max ).More recently, Kromdijk et al. (2008) have shown1This work was supported by the Illinois Council on Food andAgriculture Research (C-FAR) and the Dudley Smith Initiative.

Even in the absence ofleaf photosynthetic differences, production could dif-fer simply because Miscanthus may have leaves pres-ent earlier and later in the season, allowing it to takeadvantage of warm weather, outside of the normalmaize growing season. Most importantly, if Miscan-thus does prove to be more productive than maize, inside-by-side trials in the ﬁeld, then understandingwhy will indicate how maize and other temperate C4crops might be improved to achieve yet higher yieldsin temperate climates.Previously, using small plot trials (0.01 ha), weshowed that Miscanthus was more than twice asproductive as another cold-tolerant C4perennial grass,switchgrass. Both crops were similarly efﬁcient inintercepting sunlight, but Miscanthus showed muchhigher rates of photosynthesis and was more efﬁcientin its use of water and nitrogen (Heaton et al., 2008;Dohleman et al., 2009). Boehmel et al. (2008) in side-by-side trials in Germany similarly found a signiﬁcantyield advantage of Miscanthus relative to switchgrass.There have been attempts to project the effects ofwidespread use of maize grain and cellulosic feed-stocks for biofuel production (Farrell et al., 2006;Heaton et al., 2008; Searchinger et al., 2008); however,to date, there have been no direct comparisons of grainmaize, the most productive annual row crop in theworld (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2009),and Miscanthus, the most productive perennial grassspecies in temperate climates (Beale and Long, 1995;Boehmel et al., 2008; Heaton et al., 2008), to validatewhether the assertions made from these projectionsare correct.This study presents the ﬁrst large-plot replicatedﬁeld trials of Miscanthus and grain maize reported inthe peer-reviewed literature to determine their com-parative annual biomass productivity, leaf area, leafarea duration, and leaf and canopy photosynthesis.Crops were grown using recommended agriculturalpractices for each species, with the annual use offertilization for the maize plots and no fertilization ofthe Miscanthus plots.The total productivity of a plant stand per unit landarea is determined by the product of the total amountof solar radiation incident per unit land area and theefﬁciencies of light interception ( «i) and conversioninto biomass ( «c; Monteith, 1977). These efﬁciencieswere measured so that differences in production couldbe partitioned between «iand«c. The annual progres-sions of leaf area were followed to further analyze thebasis of variation in «i, while the diurnal courses of leafphotosynthesis in the upper and lower canopy weremeasured along with analysis of in vivo light and CO2responses with steady-state biochemical models todetermine the basis of variation in «c.This study tested directly the hypothesis that Mis-canthus is even more productive than modern lines ofgrain maize bred for high productivity in the Midwestand examined whether differences can be attributed tomore efﬁcient light capture or more efﬁcient conver-sion of captured light into biomass through photosyn-thetic differences.RESULTSClimate ConditionsWhile the 2007 growing season was about 1 /C176Cwarmer and 24% drier than the 30-year average,2008 was about 1 /C176C cooler and 34% wetter. Growingseason solar radiation receipt was about 6% aboveaverage in 2007 and about 6% less in 2008 (Supple-mental Fig. S1; Table I). The 2 years provided a usefulcontrast of a warmer and drier versus a wetter andcooler growing season, covering the span of growingconditions likely to be encountered across most yearsin the Corn Belt of the Midwestern United States.Biomass Growth and ProductivityOn all dates, standing dry biomass per unit landarea ( Wb) for Miscanthus was higher, reaching a peakof 30.3 t ha21in 2007 and of 29.5 t ha21in 2008. Thiswas signiﬁcantly higher ( P,0.0001) than the peak of19.2 in 2007 and of 18.4 t ha21in 2008 for maize (Fig. 1).Wbthen declined in both crops, with Miscanthusdropping sharply to 13.8 t ha21and maize to 18.1 tha21in 2007, 11.4 t ha21of which was grain. In 2008,the decline in Miscanthus was less pronounced to 22.0th a21, while Wbfor maize declined to 15.7 t ha21,o fwhich 8.7 t ha21was grain (Fig. 1; Table II).Light Interception and Green Leaf Area IndexIn both growing seasons, Miscanthus producedleaves and began intercepting radiation much earlierin the growing season than maize and continuedintercepting radiation much later (Fig. 2A).

By contrast, maize emerged onMay 11, 2007 and was delayed until June 18, 2008 dueto wet ﬁeld conditions that delayed sowing of the crop.Although the emergence dates were similar in 2007,Miscanthus «irose much faster. For example, by thesecond sampling date on May 22, Miscanthus wasintercepting 78% of the incoming radiation comparedto 8% in maize. In Miscanthus, «iexceeded 0.8 by May29, while it did not exceed 0.8 in maize until July 6. Thegrowing season length for Miscanthus was on average59% longer, at 203 d in 2007 and 195 d in 2008compared to 125 d in 2007 and 126 d in 2008 for maize.In the middle of each growing season, maize inter-cepted nearly as much light as Miscanthus, but in the2008 growing season, a mid-season storm led to lodg-ing in maize that caused a drop in light interception(Fig. 2A). Miscanthus had a closed canopy ( «i.0.9)from June 27 to October 4, 2007 and from July 16 toOctober 9, 2008, while the maize canopy was closedfrom July 24 to August 8, 2007 and was only closed onAugust 14 in 2008. As a result, of the 2,693 MJ m22oftotal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in 2007,1,491 MJ m22were intercepted by the Miscanthuscanopy but only 957 MJ m22by the maize canopy, anannual «iof 0.55 and 0.36, respectively (Table II). In2008, of the 2,607 MJ m22of total PAR, 1,318 MJ m22were intercepted by the Miscanthus canopy and 752MJ m22by the maize canopy, an annual «iof 0.51and0.29, respectively. Therefore, Miscanthus interceptedjust over half (53%) of the total PAR across the entire2-year period compared to just under one-third (33%)for maize.Light interception paralleled differences in greenleaf area index (GLAI) with species and time (Fig. 2B).Miscanthus had a GLAI that was 259% of that of maize(P,0.0001) when integrated and averaged over thetwo growing seasons. There were green leaves on theMiscanthus crop for 168 d in 2007 and for 152 d in2008, compared to 98 and 99 d, respectively, in maize.GLAI for Miscanthus reached a peak of 6.1 on July 12,2007 and of 5.9 on July 30, 2008. The peak GLAI formaize was 3.3 on July 12, 2007 and 4.3 on August 13,2008.Conversion Efﬁciency and Diurnal Patterns of A,gs,and ciBased on the peak biomass, «i, and PAR valuespresented here and assuming an energy content of 18MJ kg21for plant biomass (Beale and Long, 1995), theconversion efﬁciency of solar radiation to above-ground biomass ( «c,a) for Miscanthus averaged 0.042or 4.2% over both growing seasons, while maizeaveraged an «c,aof 0.043 or 4.3% ( P= 0.8108; TableII). This lack of difference in «c,abetween species isclear when biomass accumulation is plotted againstcumulative intercepted PAR, since the slope ( «c,a)o fthe best-ﬁt lines for the two species are virtuallyidentical and not signiﬁcantly different ( P= 0.6892;Fig. 3).Of the 26 measurement dates over two seasons inwhich photosynthesis was measured on upper-canopyMiscanthus leaves, maize had green leaves on 16 ofthose dates. Miscanthus had green leaves $1 m belowthe top of the canopy on 20 of the measurement dates,and maize had green leaves $1 m below the top of thecanopy on 12 of the measurement dates (SupplementalFigs. S2 and S3).Averaged across each day and the respective grow-ing seasons, for sunlit leaves photosynthetic photonﬂux density (PPFD) was 923.8 mmol m22s21and leaftemperature 25.9 /C176C for Miscanthus and 992.9 mmolm22s21and 28.6 /C176C for maize. This difference is due tothe presence of Miscanthus leaves during cooler andlower insolation periods of spring and through muchFigure 1.

For shade leaves of Miscanthus, whenpresent at 1 m depth into the canopy, the mean PPFDwas 153.7 mmol m22s21and 26.5 /C176C for Miscanthuscompared to 305.4 mmol m22s21and 27.5 /C176C for maize.The much lower value in Miscanthus was partly dueto the longer season but also due to a much densercanopy, impeding PPFD penetration to this depth.Of the 16 dates on which there were upper canopyand therefore sunlit leaves for both species, sunlitleaves of maize had higher Athan Miscanthus ( P,0.05) on 11 dates, there was no signiﬁcant differencebetween species ( P.0.05) on two measurement dates,and Miscanthus had a higher Athan maize ( P,0.05)on three measurement dates (Supplemental Figs. S2and S3). All cases in which Miscanthus Awas greaterthan or equal to maize, the maize crop was either earlyor late in its growing season, indicating immaturephotosynthetic apparatus or the onset of senescence,or it could indicate chilling impairment. Averagedacross the daylight hours of all measurement dates, Aof Miscanthus sunlit leaves was 17.2 mmol m22s21,70% that of maize sunlit leaves that averaged 24.6mmol m22s21(P= 0.0005). The differences in Abetween species were greatest near midday, whenlight levels and temperatures were highest, with maizeand Miscanthus having an average midday Aof 34.9mmol m22s21and 26.8 mmol m22s21, respectively(Fig. 5A), and midday peak values of 57.7 mmol m22s21for maize and 38.0 mmol m22s21for Miscanthus(Supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). The average Aforshaded maize leaves was 8.65 mmol m22s21comparedto 4.20 mmol m22s21for shaded Miscanthus leaves(P,0.0001), again with the highest differences atmidday. On 11 of the 12 measurement dates in whichboth species had green leaves 1 m below the top of thecanopy, maize leaves had a higher photosynthesis rate(P,0.05), with the exception of the penultimatemeasurement date in 2008 in which there was nodifference between species (Supplemental Figs. S2and S3).The daily total photosynthetic CO2uptake per unitleaf area ( A’) followed a similar pattern to A, withMiscanthus sunlit leaves having an average A’ of 0.74mol m22d21and an average of 1.04 mol m22d21formaize. The average A’ for Miscanthus and maizeshaded leaves was 0.15 and 0.31 mol m22d21, respec-tively (Fig. 4A). The 2-year average seasonal integralsof leaf-level photosynthesis on a mass of carbon basis(Am’’) of sunlit leaves is 15.4 and 12.7 t C ha21year21Figure 2.

Whensummed over both canopy layers, there is a signiﬁcantdifference in Am’’ between species ( P,0.0001), nodifference between years ( P= 0.7691), and there is asigniﬁcant interaction between species and year ( P,0.0001). Pairwise comparisons reveal that there was nodifference in Am’’ between species in 2007 ( P= 0.2734);however, Miscanthus was 25% and signiﬁcantly high-er in 2008 ( P,0.0001). Miscanthus has a much largerGLAI, so how does this affect total annual carbonuptake per unit ground area?When total sunlit and shaded GLAI is taken intoaccount, the average seasonal totals of canopy-levelphotosynthesis could be calculated. The average sea-sonal integrals of canopy-level photosynthesis on amass of carbon basis Acm’’ for Miscanthus was 29.6 t Cha21year21, 44% greater than the 20.6 t C ha21year21for maize ( P,0.0001; Fig. 4C). There was no differ-ence between years or interaction between year andspecies ( P= 0.7069 and 0.1930, respectively). Of the29.6 total t C ha21year21assimilated by the Miscan-thus canopy, 20.8 t C ha21year21was assimilated onthe dates when maize also had green leaves, showingthat nearly all of the 44% difference in canopy carbonassimilation between species occurred due to thelonger growing season in Miscanthus.Averaged across both years at midday on dateswhere both species had green leaves, leaf stomatalconductance to water vapor ( gs) of Miscanthus sunlitleaves was 0.194 mol m22s21, compared to an averageof 0.226 mol m22s21for maize ( P= 0.0437; Fig. 5B). Ofthe 16 dates on which Miscanthus and maize both hadgreen sunlit leaves, maize had signiﬁcantly higher(P,0.05) or marginally signiﬁcantly ( P,0.10) highergson six of the measurement dates, there was nosigniﬁcant difference between species on eight mea-surement dates, and Miscanthus had higher gs(P,0.05) on two of the measurement dates (SupplementalFigs. S4 and S5). The linear regression of all individualpoints of Aversus gswhere A.0 shows that maize hasan 11.6% higher slope (i.e. intrinsic leaf water useefﬁciency) than Miscanthus (Fig. 6; P= 0.0267).When averaged over all days on which there weregreen leaves for both species, the mean midday ratio ofintercellular [CO2] to ambient air [CO2](ci/ca) wassigniﬁcantly higher at 0.35 for Miscanthus comparedto 0.29 for maize (Fig. 5C; P= 0.0064).

By contrast, the con-vexity of the response function ( u) was signiﬁcantlygreater in Miscanthus (Fig. 7A; Table III).Analysis of the responses of Atocifor sunlit leavessampled in mid-summer showed that both the max-imum velocity of phospho enolpyruvate (PEP) carbox-ylation ( Vpmax) and maximum rate of PEP regeneration(Vpr) were signiﬁcantly higher ( P,0.05) in maize, thedifference being most pronounced in Vpmax (Fig. 7B;Table III). VpmaxandVprof both species dropped on theAugust 26 measurement date, possibly due to anabnormally dry August in that year (SupplementalFig. S1); however, maize values were still signiﬁcantlyhigher than those in Miscanthus. Leaf [N] on an areabasis was 19% higher for maize than Miscanthus;however, the much higher Vprof maize causes a pho-tosynthetic nitrogen use efﬁciency (PNUE) that is 41%higher for maize (Table III). Figure 7 shows the re-sponse of a representative leaf from the A/PPFD andA/ciresponse functions, but the means and SEs for allleaves are shown in Table III ( n= 4).DISCUSSIONThis study tested directly the hypothesis that Mis-canthus is even more productive than modern lines ofmaize bred for high productivity in the Corn Belt ofthe Midwestern United States. It further examinedwhether differences may be attributed to more efﬁ-cient light capture or more efﬁcient conversion ofcaptured light into biomass through photosyntheticFigure 6.

The maximum biomass achieved by Mis-canthus was 30.3 t ha21and 29.4 t ha21in 2007 and2008, respectively, compared to 19.2 t ha21and 18.4 tha21for maize, on average 59% greater. The climatewas slightly warmer and drier than the long-termaverage in 2007 and slightly cooler and wetter thanaverage in 2008, suggesting that the differences shownhere are representative of those that would be ex-pected across years at this location. Maize grain yieldin 2007 was 11.4 t ha21and very close to the countyaverage of 11.8 t ha21(U.S. Department of AgricultureNational Agricultural Statistics Service, 2009), suggest-ing that the crop here is the representative of this areain which some of the highest world yields of maize areachieved. The mean peak productivity of Miscanthusover the two growing seasons in the trials describedhere was only 61% of the peak shown in small plot(0.01 ha) trials at the same location in 2004 to 2006(Heaton et al., 2008). The trials used in this study werethe ﬁrst large plot replicated trials in the United Statesand were planted at a lower density than the previ-ously studied small plots. The lower yield may in partreﬂect this, but also the fact that by contrast to maizethere is very little agronomic experience with Miscan-thus. The 59% higher maximum biomass, while large,may therefore underestimate the potential differencebetween these two crops.Was the higher biomass yield of Miscanthus due to ahigher «ior higher «c? The answer is clear in Figure 3.The rate of accumulation of biomass, and energy inbiomass, when plotted against cumulative interceptedPAR is linear and virtually identical between the twospecies; i.e. «cwas not different between the twospecies. The difference is that Miscanthus, with itslonger growing season and greater GLAI, interceptsmore of the available radiation over the year (Fig. 2A).In both years, Miscanthus emerged earlier, senescedlater, and intercepted more radiation throughout thegrowing season than maize. While Miscanthus lightinterception was similar across years, maize lightinterception was shifted toward the end of the grow-ing season in 2008, with the crop not emerging until2 d prior to the summer solstice. Most striking is that inmid-May 2007 when maize was just emerging, «iwasalready 0.80. It took maize another 6 weeks to reachthis level. Similarly, Miscanthus maintained an «i.0.90 for a month longer than maize in the autumn. Thisdifference was even more pronounced in the cooler2008 growing season (Fig. 2A). Interception efﬁciency(«i) is traditionally calculated from the total incidentFigure 7.

All rights reserved.PAR over the growing season (Monteith, 1977; Bealeand Long, 1995; Heaton et al., 2008; Murchie et al.,2009). However, when comparing species with sub-stantially different growing season lengths, this calcu-lation will be misleading as to the total efﬁciency withwhich the annual photosynthetically active solar en-ergy resource of 2,650 MJ m22was used. Annual «iwastherefore calculated as the sum of the daily products of«iand PAR over the entire year. When averaged overboth years, Miscanthus «iwas 0.53 compared to 0.33for maize, a 61% difference between species, while thetraditional calculation, i.e. limited to the growingseason, yielded an average over the 2 years «iof 0.81and 0.65 for Miscanthus and maize, respectively, onlya 25% difference. The resulting amount of interceptedPAR for each species is the same in either calculation;however, the use of annual «ireﬂects more closely thedifferences in crop function. The growing season «iforMiscanthus of 0.81 is remarkably similar to the 0.80recorded in small plot trials at the same site in 2004 to2006 and to the 0.83 for stands, putatively of the samegermplasm, growing in Southern England (Heatonet al., 2008). Throughout the year, total interceptedradiation (PARi) was 1,405 MJ m22for Miscanthus and855 MJ m22for maize (Table II). Since biomass pro-duction is proportional to the product of «iand«ca, andsince peak biomass was 59% higher in Miscanthus,this could be accounted for entirely by «i, which was61% higher. So was there no difference leaf and canopyphotosynthesis?While «cais similar between species, they use differ-ent strategies to achieve their respective «ca.The leaf-level A’ for maize was substantially higher than forMiscanthus during the middle portion of each growingseason. However, the ability of this Miscanthus germ-plasm to produce and maintain photosyntheticallyactive leaves at much lower temperatures (Farageet al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008) allows for substantialcarbon gain during early and late portions of thegrowing season (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Figs. S1 andS2). Not only did Miscanthus show substantial assim-ilation at times of the year when no green maize leaveswere produced or present, but it also showed signiﬁ-cantly higher values at the beginning and end of themaize growing season, which could reﬂect the poorerlow-temperature tolerance of maize (Fryer et al., 1995).A’ values shown here for maize and Miscanthus aresimilar to those shown in separate studies at nearbylocations (Leakey et al., 2004; Dohleman et al., 2009).While Miscanthus is noted for its exceptional coldtolerance, this study shows clearly that maize has asubstantial advantage in leaf-level photosynthesisover Miscanthus under the mid-summer growingconditions that are found in the Midwestern UnitedStates. The ﬁnding is consistent with prior controlledenvironment studies where maize was able to main-tain higher Asatwhen grown at 25 /C176C; however, whengrown at 14 /C176C,Asatmeasured at 25 /C176C for AsatforMiscanthus was substantially higher than maize(Naidu and Long, 2004).In this study under ﬁeld-grown conditions, Mis-canthus was able maintain a substantial amount ofphotosynthetically active leaf area prior to maizeemergence in the spring and subsequent to maizesenescence in the autumn, as evident in Figure 4A.Using these two distinct strategies for carbon assimi-lation, maize and Miscanthus achieved similar totalannual carbon gains in 2007 at the leaf level, althoughMiscanthus was about 25% higher in 2008 (Fig. 4B). Ona canopy level, sunlit leaves account for 77.5% of thetotal carbon assimilation for Miscanthus and 75.6% ofthe total carbon assimilation for maize.Recent work has shown signiﬁcant leakiness of CO2from bundle sheath cells back to mesophyll cells inMiscanthus stands under light-limiting conditions,causing an energetic cost to the plant and therefore adecrease in «ca(Kromdijk et al., 2008). Kromdijk et al.(2008) conducted their study in the much cooler grow-ing conditions of Ireland, where average biomassyields were only about half those found here (Clifton-Brown et al., 2007). Therefore, it is uncertain the extentto which this efﬁciency loss applies to the warmerlocation of this study.On all dates in both years, GLAI was greater inMiscanthus; therefore, total canopy-level carbon as-similation is 44% higher in Miscanthus (Fig. 4C; P,0.0001). This 44% higher total C assimilation fails toaccount in full for the 59% higher in peak abovegroundbiomass of Miscanthus. Two factors could account forthis discrepancy: higher respiratory losses and/or agreater diversion of assimilate into belowground or-gans in maize. For Miscanthus stands growing inSouthern England, about 40% of biomass was parti-tioned below ground compared to 14% to 26% formaize (Beale and Long, 1995; Bonifas and Lindquist,2006). In Miscanthus, this accumulation occurred overa 3-year period, while maize must renew its invest-ment in roots annually. This suggests that more bio-mass could be diverted into belowground organs inmaize on an annual basis. Substantial energy is alsolikely expended in translocation of resources to, andconstruction of, the grain in maize, a cost avoided byMiscanthus, which invests ,2% of accumulated bio-mass into reproductive structures (Heaton et al.,2008).These ﬁndings suggest that there is potential forimprovement in both maize and Miscanthus photo-synthesis. If maize were able to produce photosyn-thetically active leaves under colder temperatures, itcould take advantage of the radiation in the earlyspring and autumn under these growing conditions asMiscanthus does. It is not clear whether a lowerphotosynthetic capacity at high temperatures is apenalty of improved low temperature tolerance.Across terrestrial plants, species capable of high pho-tosynthetic rates at high temperatures typically havelow rates at low temperature and vice versa. The cooltemperate C4grass Spartina angelica showed a temper-ature optimum of Asatof about 10 /C176C less than C4grasses of tropical origin, but in contrast continuedPhotosynthesis and Productivity of Maize and MiscanthusPlant Physiol.

All rights reserved.photosynthesis below 14 /C176C (Long et al., 1975). How-ever, both C3and C4species vary in their ability toacclimate their photosynthetic capacity to temperature(Sage and Kubien, 2007). Therefore, it would be impor-tant to screen Miscanthus germplasm to determinewhether lines may be identiﬁed that can match thephotosynthetic rates of maize in midsummer, whilemaintaining capacity to assimilate CO2at lower tem-peratures.A cost of higher Ain midsummer in maize is ahigher gs(Fig. 5B; Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4);however, the regression of Atogsshows an intrinsicleaf water use efﬁciency ( A/gs) that is 12%, and sig-niﬁcantly, higher than in Miscanthus (Fig. 6; P=0.0267). Coupled with its longer growing season anda higher GLAI throughout (Fig. 2B), this suggests thatMiscanthus may use a great deal more water thanmaize to achieve its 61% higher biomass yield. Bothdirect measurements of soil moisture in the same plotsacross growing seasons (G. McIsaac, unpublished data)and canopy evapotranspiration in the 2007 growingseason (G. Hickman, unpublished data) showed thatMiscanthus uses more water over the full growingseason. The higher intrinsic water use efﬁciency ofmaize is also consistent with its signiﬁcantly lowermidday ci/caduring the summers of both 2007 and 2008(Fig. 5C).While PNUE was signiﬁcantly higher in maize at theleaf level, at the whole crop level, Miscanthus is clearlymore efﬁcient. The high yields obtained here werewithout any nitrogen fertilization for Miscanthus,compared to an annual input of 168 kg [N] ha21formaize. Nitrogen fertilizer is over half the energy inputused in producing a maize crop. Assuming the sameinputs in producing Miscanthus and maize crops, ascalculated by Boehmel et al. (2008), the average annualinput for Miscanthus would have been 6 GJ ha21compared to 24 GJ ha21for maize. This corrects forthe higher N fertilization rate used here, by compar-ison to Boehmel et al. (2008). Therefore, one-quarter ofthe energy input is required to obtain 60% morebiomass.Across the growing seasons, A/JPSIIin maize was24% greater than in Miscanthus (Supplemental Fig. S8;P,0.0001). This suggests that a signiﬁcantly higherproportion of whole chain electron transport is used inCO2assimilation in maize; however, Fv’/Fm’d i dn o tdiffer, suggesting no differences in diversion of absorbedlight energy into nonphotochemical sinks.What biochemical limitations underlie the higher Ain maize during the summer months (SupplementalFigs. S1 and S2)? Both A/ciand A/Qcurves wereconstructed and analyzed to address this question.Values of all leaf photosynthetic parameters (Table III)in maize were similar to those determined previouslyin ﬁeld-grown maize at an adjacent site (Leakey et al.,2006) and for ﬁeld-grown Miscanthus in England(Beale et al., 1996). When compared in controlledenvironments, values for all parameters for Miscan-thus and maize grown at 25 /C176C were similar to thosereported here for ﬁeld-grown Miscanthus, except thatVprand Vpmax were signiﬁcantly higher in maize(Naidu and Long, 2004). Asat,Vpr, and Vpmaxwere allsubstantially higher in the ﬁeld-grown maize. Vprismetabolically controlled by the activity of pyruvate Pidikinase and Rubisco and Vpmaxby the activity of PEPcarboxylase (Furbank et al., 1997). Collectively, theseenzymes account for a large proportion of leaf nitro-gen. The higher activities inferred from in vivo anal-ysis (Table III) might therefore be related to the factthat cultivation of both crops followed standard prac-tice; that is, maize was grown with the addition of 168kg [N] ha21, while Miscanthus was grown without anyaddition of nitrogen. Maize leaf [N] on an area basiswas 19% higher than in Miscanthus, suggesting largeramounts of key photosynthetic enzymes in maize;however, even with this increase in leaf N, the PNUEof maize is 41% higher (Table III), suggesting a muchgreater biochemical efﬁciency of CO2assimilation. ThePNUE values shown here for maize are substantiallyhigher than the range of 200 to 320 mmol mol21s21innaturally occurring C4species (Taub and Lerdau,2000). A signiﬁcantly higher Vpmax and Vprin maizewas also found in controlled environment studies,where equal amounts of nitrogen were applied to bothspecies, supporting the idea of a genetic component tothe difference between species (Naidu and Long, 2004).Analysis of A/Qresponse functions revealed thatFCO2,max was also signiﬁcantly higher in maize, imply-ing a lower maximum efﬁciency of transduction ofabsorbed light energy into CO2assimilation, due to ahigher level of alternative photochemical and/or non-photochemical sinks. Higher AsatandFCO2,max inmaize may be at the expense of increased mitochon-drial respiration, since Rdis signiﬁcantly higher inmaize. The lower AsatandFCO2,max for upper-canopyleaves of Miscanthus must however be offset by otherfactors since «cwas almost identical for the two cropsacross the entire growing season (Fig. 3; Table II). Thismay result both from the lower Rd(Table III) and muchgreater GLAI of Miscanthus (Fig. 2B).Grain maize yields in central Illinois are some of thehighest in the world. Yet in this ﬁrst side-by-sidecomparison to such a crop, it was shown that therelated C4grass, Miscanthus, can achieve a 61% higherbiomass yield. This was not due to higher mid-summerleaf photosynthetic rates in Miscanthus, but due to itsability to produce and maintain photosyntheticallycompetent leaves earlier and later than maize. Impor-tantly, the results show that if a similar capacity couldbe engineered into maize then a 60% biomass increase,and if partitioning efﬁciency of biomass into grainremained constant, a 60% yield increase, even abovethe high yields already obtained in the MidwesternUnited States, may be possible. Furthermore, if higherleaf-level photosynthesis could be engineered intoMiscanthus, then there should be potential for yieldincrease in that species as well.

Soilsare deep Drummer/Flanagan series (ﬁne silty, mixed, mesic Typic Endo-aquoll) with high organic matter typical of the central Illinois Corn Belt. Dailymeteorological data, including total solar radiation, temperature, and precip-itation, were collected within 4 km of the trial location by the long-termmonitoring station of the Illinois Climate Network (Angel, 2008).Miscanthus rhizomes were propagated, as described in establishing othertrials (Heaton et al., 2008), and planted in rows of 1.22 m with plants spaced at1.22 m within a row in 2005. As a rhizomatous perennial, Miscanthusproduces an annual crop of shoots from perennial underground rhizomes;shoots are harvested dead in the winter. As in the case of these plots, it takes 3years for the rhizomes to expand sufﬁciently so that the shoots can ﬁll thespace between the original plantings. Typically the annual dry matter yield ofshoots is low in year one, increases in year two, and reaches a peak in yearthree, which may be maintained for several subsequent years (Clifton-Brownet al., 2001); therefore, when this comparison began in 2007, the Miscanthusstand was assumed to have reached this peak. Maize cv 34H35 (Pioneer Hi-Bred International) was planted at a 0.762 m row spacing, a density ofapproximately 80,000 plants ha21, on May 8, 2007 and emerged on May 11,2007. The same area had been planted to soybean ( Glycine max ) in 2006. Due toan exceptionally wet spring, maize (cv Dekalb 61-69; Monsanto Co.) was notplanted in 2008 until June 12 and emerged on June 17. The change in cultivarwas necessitated by the late spring and by the need to minimize the risk ofpest damage by following one maize crop with a second. Both cultivars ofmaize were recommended as highly productive for central Illinois. In bothyears, 168 kg [N] ha21was applied prior to the planting of the maize crop,following standard recommendations for obtaining high yields in this region.No fertilizer was added to the Miscanthus plots in either year.Biomass Sampling and Leaf Area IndexStanding shoot biomass per unit land area on a dry weight basis ( Wb)w a sdetermined biweekly from subsamples taken throughout the 2007 and 2008growing seasons. For Miscanthus, two subsamples of 10 randomly selectedtillers were taken from randomly selected plants within each plot, and thetotal tiller number of that plant was also recorded. Samples were oven-dried at75/C176C to constant weight. Wbwas then obtained from the product of theestimated whole-plant mass and the planting density. For maize, two sub-samples per plot of 1 m within randomly selected rows were removed anddried as before to determine dry sample mass. Wbwas the ratio of dry samplemass and sample area for the respective crops. No samples of either specieswere taken within 3 m of the edge of a plot to avoid any border effects (Robertset al., 1993). The ﬁnal subsamples were taken immediately prior to the end-of-season whole plot harvest. The ﬁnal harvested yield of the total area for eachspecies fell within the 95% conﬁdence limits of Wbestimated from thesesubsamples, providing validation of the subsampling method.GLAI was determined destructively at each biomass sampling point byexcising green leaves from the freshly cut shoot subsamples used for biomassdetermination. These leaves were passed through a planimetric leaf areameter (LAI-3100; LI-COR) prior to drying. The area meter was calibratedagainst paper standards of known area. Leaves with a laminar area that was,50% green tissue were not used (Morgan et al., 2005). GLAI was then scaledup, as described above in the calculation of Wb, from the biweekly subsam-pling.Light InterceptionCanopy interception of PAR (400–700 nm) was determined biweekly, inparallel with determination of Wband GLAI, above. PPFD was measuredabove (Ia) and below the canopy (Ib) in three randomly selected areas in eachplot between 10:00 and 14:00 on clear-sky days with a line quantum sensor(AccuPAR LP-80; Decagon Devices), which was 0.87 m in length to obtain aspatial average in the heterogeneous light environment of the canopy. A singlemeasurement consisted of ﬁve point observations of Iasimultaneous with ﬁveobservations of Ibacross a 1-m transect below the canopy. Efﬁciency of PARinterception ( «i) is given by the mean (1 2Ib/Ia) for each species (Nobel et al.,1993). To determine PARion a daily basis from the data collected here, a least-squares quadratic equation was ﬁt to the progression of «iacross each year toestimate daily radiation interception for each plot in each year (PROC REGSAS v9.1; SAS Institute). Daily incident PAR was calculated using totalincoming radiation (Angel, 2008) and assuming that 47.3% of that radiationwas PAR (Papaioannou et al., 1993). Summing the daily PARiacross each yeargave the annual PARi. The ratio of PARito total annual PAR was used todetermine annual «i.A n«iof 0 was assumed on all dates prior to cropemergence and subsequent to the completion crop senescence.In Situ Leaf Gas ExchangeOn 26 d, distributed across the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons, leaf CO2and water vapor exchange were measured at approximately 2-h intervalsfrom predawn to postdusk. Upper-canopy sunlit leaves of three separaterandomly selected plants in each plot ( n= 4) were measured on all dates(sunlit leaves). In addition, when canopies had reached sufﬁcient height, aparallel sample of three leaves was measured at 1 m below the canopy top(shaded leaves). In cases where both species were present and at least onespecies had green leaves at 1 m below the canopy top, two gas exchangesystems, calibrated against the same standards, were used. Each measurementcycle took 45 to 75 min to complete.Leaf CO2and water vapor exchange were measured in cuvettes withcontrolled temperature and photon ﬂux within a portable open path gas-exchange system incorporating infrared CO2and water vapor analyzers (LI-COR 6400; LI-COR). Modulated chlorophyll ﬂuorescence was measuredsimultaneously with a ﬂuorometer incorporated into the cuvette lid (LI-6400-40; LI-COR). Dew was often present on leaves in the early morning andoccasionally postdusk. In these cases, leaves were blotted immediately prior toenclosure into the leaf cuvette, and gswas not calculated, since residualsurface moisture could increase apparent water ﬂuxes from the leaf.Immediately prior to the start of a measurement cycle, the red-blue LEDlight source in the cuvette head was set to the incident PPFD, as recorded atthat point in time with a line quantum sensor above the plant canopy (LP-80;Decagon Devices). In the case of lower-canopy leaves, PPFD was measured at1 m below the top of each crop’s canopy ﬁve times across a spatial transectprior to the measurement cycle. Importantly, the sensor is a line quantumsensor that is able to give an average spatial reading of light levels within acanopy since point estimates can be quite heterogeneous. Similarly, the mea-surement temperature of the gas exchange cuvette block was set to the open airtemperature recorded at the start of the measurement cycle using the leafthermocouple junction of the LI-6400. Humidity in the cuvette was that of theoutside air, except during periods when relative humidity was so high thatcondensation could occur. During these periods, which were typically arounddawn and dusk, the air was partially dried but the leaf vapor pressure deﬁcitwas never allowed to exceed 1.0 kPa. The light and temperature conditionswithin the chamber were held constant for the duration of each measurementcycle, regardless of short-term ﬂuctuations in ambient light and air temper-ature. Reference [CO2] in the cuvette was set to the external air concentrationof 380 mmol mol21. Measurements were recorded once CO2uptake andstomatal conductance stabilized after enclosure within the cuvette, typicallywithin 45 to 60 s. Calculations of Aand gsfollowed the equations of vonCaemmerer and Farquhar (1981). Operating PSII efﬁciency ( Fq’/Fm’), max-i m u me f ﬁ c i e n c yo fP S I I( Fv’/Fm’), and the proportion of open PSII centers(Fq’/Fv’) were calculated following Genty et al. (1989) and using the nomen-clature of Baker and Oxborough (2004). The rate of whole-chain electrontransport through PSII ( JPSII) was given by the product of Fq’/Fm’ and absorbedPPFD. A posteriori analysis of data revealed that ﬂuorescence measurementsfrom one of the gas exchange systems did not produce a saturating pulse overthe duration of the experiment; therefore, all ﬂuorescence values presentedwere recorded from the other gas exchange system.Total daily leaf CO2uptake (A ’) was calculated from the instantaneousmeasurements made for each day of the growing season by summing thetrapezoidal area described under each pair of adjacent measurement cycles,over each day (SAS Institute ). Calculations for A’ were only made for the timePhotosynthesis and Productivity of Maize and MiscanthusPlant Physiol.

Canopy-level A’(A’c) was estimated from the following equation:A9c¼ðA9sun/C3LAI sunÞþð A9shade /C3LAI shadeÞwhere A’cis the daily canopy level CO2uptake (m mol m22d21),A’sunis thedaily CO2uptake by sunlit leaves ( mmol m22d21), LAIsunis the sunlit GLAI(m2m22),A’shadeis the daily CO2uptake by shaded leaves ( mmol m22d21), andLAIshade is the shaded GLAI (m2m22).A’sunandA’shadewere determined from leaf-level photosynthesis measure-ments. LAIsunand LAIshade at any given point in time were determined fromthe incident photon ﬂux above the canopy, sun angle, and overlying GLAIusing the equations of Forseth and Norman (1993), as implemented in thesoftware for the mechanistic plant production model, WIMOVAC (www.life.uiuc.edu/plantbio/wimovac; Humphries and Long, 1995). Seasonal inte-grated rates of canopy-level CO2uptake ( Ac’’) were determined by estimatingcanopy-level A’ on each measurement date, then integrating over the growingseason as before.A/ciand A/PPFD ResponsesPredawn on July 28 and August 26 of 2008, two individual plants per plotof each species were cut at their base and then immediately cut under waterand kept immersed. Plants were then transported back to the laboratory andkept in the dark until approximately 20 min prior to measurement, thenilluminated to allow leaves to adapt to light conditions. The objective of thisanalysis was to determine differences between species in photosyntheticcapacity of leaves; therefore, measurement in the controlled conditions of thelaboratory were necessary to avoid short-term biochemical and water stresslimitations that can occur under more variable ﬁeld conditions (Leakey et al.,2006)). The gas exchange system described above was used in the laboratoryto measure A/cicurves at a PPFD of 2,000 mmol m22s21and a blocktemperature setting of 25/C176 C. Following the theory of von Caemmerer (2000),PEP carboxylase efﬁciency ( Vpmax) is given by the initial slope (d A/dci)o ft h eresponse of Atoci, in this case the average of d A/dcivalues at ci,50mmolmol21.Vpr, the maximum rate of regeneration of PEP, was given by theci-saturated value of A, in this case the average of all values of Aabove theinﬂection in the response of Atoci. On July 28, A/PPFD was measured at a[CO2] of 380 mmol mol21and ﬁtted with a nonrectangular hyperbola asdescribed previously to determine both the maximum efﬁciency of light-limited photosynthetic CO2uptake (FCO2,max ), rate of dark respiration ( Rd),and convexity of the response function ( u; Bernacchi et al., 2005). For thepurposes of this study, the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis ( Asat) wasassumed to be the mean Aat a PPFD of 2,000 mmol m22s21.Immediately following gas exchange measurements, leaf discs of ak n o w na r e aw e r ec u t ,o v e nd r i e da t7 5 /C176C to a constant mass, and weighedto determine speciﬁc leaf area. Sam ples were then ground to a ﬁne powderusing a stainless steel pulverizer (Kl eco Pulverizer; Kinetic LaboratoryEquipment Company) and stored under d esiccation, and nitrogen level wasdetermined using a combustive elemental analyzer (Costech AnalyticalTechnologies), calibrated with an acetanilide standard. Nlwas obtainedfrom the quotient of Nmand speciﬁc leaf area multiplied by the atomic massof nitrogen.Statistical AnalysisTo avoid pseudoreplication, in all cases, the individual plot was theexperimental unit, with this value being the mean of the measures made onthe two to three randomly subsampled plants selected at any given time point.The diurnal measurements were analyzed separately for each day of the yearusing a mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA (PROC MIXED, SAS v9.1;SAS Institute), with time of day, treatment, and time of day by treatmentinteraction as ﬁxed effects. For all measures over the 2007 and 2008 growingseasons, a mixed-model ANOVA was used with species, day of year, andspecies by day of year interaction as ﬁxed effects and year as a random effect.A priori determined pairwise comparisons between the species were per-formed for each measure. Where applicable, the best-ﬁt covariance matriceswere chosen for each variable using Akaike’s information criterion to correctfor inequality of variance between the sampling time periods (Keselman et al.,1998; Littell et al., 1998, 2000). This was most often a heterogeneous-autoregressive covariance matrix. F-values and statistical signiﬁcance isreported at a=0.05. Arithmetic means are reported on graphs with 1SEofthe mean represented by the error bars.Supplemental DataThe following materials are available in the online version of this article.Supplemental Figure S1.
