Terrestrial	ecosystems	currently	function	as	a	net	carbon	(C)	sink	for	atmospheric	C	dioxide	(CO2),	but	whether	this	C	sink	can	persist	with	global	climate	change	is	still	uncertain.	Such	uncertainty	largely	comes	from	C	turnover	time	in	an	ecosystem,	which	is	a	critical	parameter	for	modelling	C	cycle	and	evaluating	C	sink	potential.	Our	current	understanding	 of	how	long	C	can	be	stored	in	soils	and	vegetation	and	what	controls	spatial	variations	in	C	turnover	time	on	a	large	scale	is	still	very	limited.2.	We	used	data	on	C	stocks	and	C	influx	from	2,753	plots	in	vegetation	and	1,087	plots	in	soils	and	investigated	the	spatial	patterns	as	well	controlling	factors	of	C	turnover	times	across	forest	ecosystems	in	eastern	China.3.	Our	results	showed	a	clear	latitudinal	pattern	of	C	turnover	times,	with	the	shortest	turnover	times	in	the	low-latitude	zones	and	the	longest	turnover	times	in	the	high-latitude	zones.	Mean	annual	temperature	and	mean	annual	precipitation	were	the	most	important	controlling	factors	on	soil	C	turnover	times,	while	forest	age	ac-counted	for	the	majority	of	variations	in	the	vegetation	C	turnover	times.	Forest	origin	(planted	or	natural	forest)	was	also	responsible	for	the	variations	in	vegeta-tion	C	turnover	times,	while	forest	type	and	soil	properties	were	not	the	dominant	controlling	factors.4.	Our	study	highlights	the	different	dominant	controlling	factors	in	soil	and	vegeta-tion	C	turnover	times	and	different	mechanisms	underlying	above-	and	below-ground	C	turnover.	These	findings	are	essential	to	better	understand	(and	reduce	uncertainty)	in	predictive	models	of	coupled	C–climate	system.KEYWORDScarbon	turnover 	time,	climate,	forest	age,	forest	origin,	forest	type,	soil	property1 |  INTRODUCTIONCarbon	(C)	turnover	time	(τ,	year),	which	equals	residence	time	at	steady	state,	refers	to	the	average	time	elapsed	between	the	input	of	a	C	atom	through	photosynthetic	 fixation	and	its	loss	through	respi-ratory	or	non-	respiratory	pathways	(Barrett,	2002).	It	is	an	important	indicator	for	ecosystem	functions	and	a	key	parameter	in	coupled	C	cycle	models	(e.g.	Earth	System	Models,	ESMs)	for	predicting	global	C	storage	(Chen	et	al.,	2015).	However,	substantial	uncertainty	remains	about	C	turnover	time,	which	prevents	us	from	accurately	assess-ing	the	size	of	the	terrestrial	C	sink	and	predicting	future	climate–C	cycle	feedbacks	(Anav	et	al.,	2013;	Wieder,	Cleveland,	Smith,	&	Todd-	Brown,	2015).	This	uncertainty	is	even	larger	than	that	of	C	input	of	net	primary	productivity	(Friend	et	al.,	2014).	Thus,	it	is	urgently	im-portant	to	have	a	full	understanding	 of	C	turnover	time	and	its	con-trolling	factors.	This	understanding,	 based	on	empirical	observations,	72  |    Functional EcologyWANG et Al.can	help	to	reduce	the	large	degree	of	uncertainty	in	predictive	models	of	the	Earth’s	coupled	C–climate	system	(Friedlingstein	et	al.,	2006).C	turnover	time	at	steady	state	is	commonly	estimated	as	the	ratio	of	C	stock	in	a	reservoir	to	input	or	output	flux	(Raich	&	Schlesinger,	1992).	Soil	is	the	major	C	pool	in	terrestrial	ecosystems	and	has	a	longer	turnover	time	than	vegetation	(Schmidt	et	al.,	2011).	A	cen-tral	topic	in	previous	studies	on	soil	organic	C	(SOC)	dynamics	is	SOC	turnover	time	(τsoil)	and	its	determinants	 (Heckman	et	al.,	2014;	Koven	et	al.,	2015;	Schimel	et	al.,	1994).	It	has	been	documented	that	at	a	small	spatial	scale,	soil	C	turnover	is	mainly	dependent	on	soil	temperature	and	moisture	(Craine,	Fierer,	&	McLauchlan,	2010;	Davidson	&	Janssens,	2006;	Thomsen,	Schjønning,	Jensen,	Kirstensen,	&	Christensen,	1999),	soil	chemical	properties	(Schindlbacher 	et	al.,	2010;	Xu,	He,	&	Yu,	2016;	Xu,	Shi,	et	al.,	2016),	C	quality	(Chen,	Liang,	et	al.,	2016)	or	soil	microbial	community	(Chen,	Li,	Lan,	Hu,	&	Bai,	2016;	Cleveland,	Nemergut,	Schmidt,	&	Townsend,	2007),	while	at		national	and	global	scales,	latitude,	altitude	and	associated	climatic	variables	are	suggested	to	be	responsible	for	the	variability	of	τsoil	(Chen,	Huang,	Zou,	&	Shi,	2013).	Moreover,	soil	C	turnover	is	also	affected	by		natural	(e.g.	fire	and	insects)	and	human	disturbances	 (e.g.	fertilizer,	clear-	cutting	and	land	use)	(Reed,	Ewers,	&	Pendall,	2014;	Zhou,	Zhao,	Liu,	&	Oeding,	2013).	Despite	the	considerable	effort	made	to	quantify	the	variations	of	SOC	turnover	among	soil	types,	climatic	conditions	and	under	different	disturbances	(Garten	&	Hanson,	2006;	Six	&	Jastrow,	2002),	large	controversy	over	soil	C	turnover	and	its	controlling	factors	remains,	due	to	large	spatial	heterogeneity 	(Schmidt	et	al.,	2011)	and	different	experimental	methods	among	case	studies,	making	it	difficult	to	compare	 τsoil	at	a	large	scale	and	to	quantify	the	key	controlling	factors.	Moreover,	the	direct	and	indirect	pathways	of	these	abiotic	and	biotic	factors	impacting	on	τsoil	are	unclear	and	less	quantified	in	previous	studies.In	contrast	to	τsoil,	vegetation	C	turnover	time	(τveg)	has	been	rarely	examined	although	it	is	a	crucial	process	in	regulating	stoichiometry	and	elemental	cycle	in	an	ecosystem	(Erb	et	al.,	2016),	and	also	an	important	parameter	in	the	ESMs	to	predict	biomass	allocation	and	productivity	of	the	ecosystem	(Bloom,	Exbrayat,	van	der	Velde,	Feng,	&	Williams,	2016;	Friend	et	al.,	2014).	 τveg	differs	from	seconds	or	months	in	foliage,	years	in	fine	roots,	to	decades	in	wood,	which	can	subsequently	lead	to	great	variability	of	τveg	(Malhi,	Saatchi,	Girardin,	&	Aragão,	2009;	Trumbore,	2000).	Previous	studies	have	suggested	that	 τveg	is	dependent	on	the	combined	effects	of	vegetation	type,	climate,	soil	and	land	use	(Erb	et	al.,	2016).	However,	our	quantita -tive	understanding	 on	the	controlling	factors	of	τveg	is	still	very	limited.	Moreover,	as	it	is	difficult	to	measure	foliage,	root	and	wood	C	turn-over	times	separately	and	directly	in	the	field,	the	ESMs	provide	an	alternative	measurement	 of	C	turnover	times	for	different	vegetation	compartments	 (e.g.	Negrón-	Juárez,	Koven,	Riley,	Knox,	&	Chambers,	2015).	Models	have	undoubtedly	improved	our	understanding	 of	τveg among	different	compartments,	 but	the	challenge	for	model	studies	lies	in	that	huge	uncertainty	which	still	exists.	For	example,	turnover	time	of	wood	in	tropical	forests	has	been	estimated	to	be	10–30	years	faster	in	ESMs	than	the	observed	value	(Negrón-	Juárez	et	al.,	2015),	and	globally	ecosystem	C	turnover	times	have	been	underestimated	by	36%	in	the	ESMs	(Carvalhais	et	al.,	2014).	Most	importantly,	our	understanding	 of	the	determinant	processes	of	τveg	is	still	under	de-bate	(Friend	et	al.,	2014).	Therefore,	more	observation-	based	empiri -cal	studies	are	needed	to	quantify 	τveg	and	its	controlling	factors.Forests	contain	up	to	80%	of	terrestrial	above-	ground	C	and	40%	of	below-	ground	C,	thus	play	a	critical	role	in	terrestrial	C	cycle	(Dixon	et	al.,	1994).	A	recent	study	reveals	that	forests	now	serve	as	a	net	C	sink	for	atmospheric	CO2	(Pan	et	al.,	2011),	but	whether	this	C	sink	will	persist	as	the	climate	change	remains	largely	uncertain	(Goodale	et	al.,	2002).	Thus,	studying	forest	C	turnover	times	will	greatly	improve	our	fundamental	knowledge	of	terrestrial	C	cycle.	Previous	studies	have	investigated	spatial	variations	of	C	turnover	times	associated	with	forest	type	and	climate,	and	found	that	C	turnover	times	have	a	latitudinal	pattern	and	also	differ	among	forest	types	(Chen	et	al.,	2013;	Trumbore,	2000;	Vesterdal,	Elberling,	Christiansen,	Callesen,	&	Schmidt,	2012).	Unfortunately,	 these	studies	have	seldom	considered	the	impacts	of	forest	age.	In	comparing	to	other	terrestrial	ecosystems,	a	forest	ecosystem	is	more	complex	as	it	is	unevenly	aged.	Numerous	studies	have	suggested	that	forest	age	is	a	critical	factor	determin-ing	ecosystem	C	storage	and	fluxes	(Gray,	Whittier,	&	Harmon,	2016;	Ryan,	Binkley,	&	Fownes,	1997;	Yang,	Luo,	&	Finzi,	2011),	thus	may	af-fect	C	turnover	times.	However,	the	impact	of	forest	age	on	C	turnover	times	over	large	areas	is	largely 	unknown.In	this	study,	we	collected	data	from	2,753	forest	plots	in	vegeta-tion	and	1,087	plots	in	soils	from	tropical	to	boreal	forests	in	eastern	China,	which	covers	most	forest	types	in	the	Northern	Hemisphere	(Fu	et	al.,	2010).	The	main	objectives	of	this	study	were	to:	(1)	quan-tify	τveg and τsoil	and	their	variations	with	climate	zone,	forest	origin,	forest	type	and	forest	age;	(2)	investigate	the	latitudinal	patterns	of	C	turnover	times;	and	(3)	reveal	the	controlling	factors	on	the	spatial	variations	of	τveg and τsoil.2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 | Forest classificationForest	covers	a	wide	latitudinal	span	from	north	to	south	in	China.	Therefore,	the	distribution	of	forest	has	a	wide	climatic	range	ex-tending	from	boreal	to	tropical	zones	(Yu	et	al.,	2006).	Based	on	the	principles	of	Chinese	vegetation	regionalization	 (Hou,	Sun,	Zhang,	&	He,	1982)	and	previous	studies	(He	et	al.,	2017;	Peng	et	al.,	2016),	we	classified	China’s	forests	as	five	forest	type	groups,	including	decidu -ous	broadleaf	forest	(DBF),	deciduous	needleleaf	forest	(DNF),	ever-green	broadleaf	forest	(EBF),	evergreen	needleleaf	forest	(ENF),	and	needleleaf	and	broadleaf	mixed	forest	(NBF).	The	five	groups	were	further	divided	into	19	forest	types	associated	with	climate	zones	and	39	forest	subtypes	(Table	S1).2.2 | Data sources and data compilationVegetation	C	stock	(Cveg)	was	derived	from	the	‘Strategic	Priority	Research	Program’	of	the	Chinese	Academy	of	Sciences	(No.	XDA05050000),	 in	which	3,161	plots	covering	main	forest	types	in	 13652435, 2018, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12914 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The	dimension	of	each	plot	was	0.1	ha	and	each	plot	was	divided	into	ten	10	m	×	10	m	quadrats,	with	tree	height	and	breast-	height	diameter	of	each	tree,	and	total	number	of	trees	recorded	in	each	quadrat.	By	using	allometric	equa-tions	based	on	the	tree	height	and	breast-	height	diameter	for	different	tree	species	(Ecosystem	Carbon	Sequeatration	 Project,	2015),	we	cal-culated	vegetation	biomass	(kg	C	m−2)	for	each	plot.	Among	the	3,161	plots,	we	used	the	data	of	2,753	plots	which	located	in	the	eastern	China	(Figure	1).	Of	these	2,753	plots,	there	were	627	DBF	plots,	149	DNF	plots,	545	EBF	plots,	1,176	ENF	plots	and	256	NBF	plots.	The	forest	origin	(planted	or	natural	forest)	was	recorded	for	each	plot.	Stand	age	of	planted	forests	was	determined	by	the	time	since	the	afforestation,	while	the	age	of	natural	forests	were	determined	by	the	mean	age	of	all	tree	species	by	measuring	tree	rings.	The	Cveg	(kg	C	m−2)	was	converted	from	the	vegetation	biomass	by	a	conversion	factor	of	0.5	(Pregitzer	&	Euskirchen,	2004).Soil	C	stock	(Csoil)	was	derived	from	published	studies	from	2004	to	2014	in	the	China	National	Knowledge	Infrastructure	 (http://www.cnki.net/)	and	in	the	Web	of	Science	(http://www.webofknowledge.com),	including	field-	measured	data	from	1,087	plots	(DBF,	223	plots;	DNF,	87	plots;	EBF,	359	plots;	ENF,	348	plots;	NBF,	70	plots)	from	northern	to	southern	China	(Figure	1).	The	disturbed	forest	plots	(e.g.	fire,	cutting	and	fertilizer)	were	not	included	in	the	soil	dataset.	Data	on	reported	soil	C	stock	(kg	C	m−2),	SOC	or	soil	organic	matter	(SOM)	content	(%),	soil	bulk	density	(BD,	g/cm3)	and	soil	layer	depth	(cm)	were	extracted	from	the	original	studies.	The	SOC	content	was	calcu -lated	by	the	SOM	content	using	the	Bemmelen	index	of	0.58	(Hollis,	Hannam,	&	Bellamy,	2012).	For	better	comparison	with	different	sites,	we	scaled	Csoil	up	to	100	cm	in	soil	depth.	When	soil	depth	was	more	than	100	cm,	we	directly	extracted	the	data	down	to	100	cm.	When	soil	depth	was	less	than	100	cm,	we	used	the	empirical	relationship	between	SOC	content	and	soil	layer	depth,	proposed	by	Chai	et	al.	(2015)	to	fit	Csoil	to	the	100	cm	soil	layer.	This	empirical	relationship	between	SOC	content	and	depth	performed	very	well	in	previous	studies	(e.g.	Xu	et	al.,	2015;	Xu,	He,	et	al.,	2016).	Here,	we	randomly	selected	200	sample	sites	to	evaluate	the	predictive	accuracy	of	the	empirical	relationship	(Figure	S1).	The	results	showed	that	the	pre-dicted	values	of	soil	C	stock	were	almost	identical	to	measured	val-ues	for	the	0–100	cm	soil	layer	(R2	=	.95,	 p < .001)	(Figure	S1).	The	reported	Csoil	in	the	original	studies	was	used	directly,	if	not,	the	Csoil in 0–100	cm	soil	profiles	 was	calculated	using	Equation	(1):where	SOCi,	BDi,	Di	and	Ci	represent	SOC	content,	BD,	soil	depth	and	volume	(%)	of	>2	mm	fraction	in	soil	layer	i,	respectively;	and	 n	is	(1) Csoil=∑ni=1SOCi×BDi×Di×(1−Ci)10FIGURE 1 Distribution	of 	sampling	plots	for 	estimation	of	C	turnover	times	in	vegetation	and	soils	across	forest	ecosystems	in	eastern	China.

If	soil	BD	data	were	not	directly	reported	in	the	published	papers,	the	values	were	calculated	using	the	equation	proposed	by	Adams	(1973).	Furthermore,	we	also	gathered	plot	infor -mation,	such	as	latitude,	longitude,	mean	annual	temperature	(MAT),	mean	annual	precipitation	(MAP),	dominant	tree	species,	forest	origin	and	forest	age.	Any	missing	geographical	coordinates	were	digitized	from	Google	Maps	(http://maps.google.com).Mean	annual	temperature	and	mean	annual	precipitation	for	each	sampling	plot	in	the	vegetation	dataset	and	the	missing	data	in	the	soil	dataset	were	taken	from	the	National	Climate	Center	(http://ncc.cma.gov.cn/cn/)	using	kriging	methods.	The	original	meteorological	 data	were	derived	from	long-	term	observations	of	722	meteorological	 sta-tions	in	China	(Wen	&	He,	2016).	The	kriging	interpolation	analyses	were	performed	using	ArcMap	10.0	(Environmental	 Systems	Research	Institute,	Inc.,	Redlands,	CA).	Soil	pH	and	BD	were	derived	from	the	second	National	Soil	Survey	in	China	(National	Soil	Survey	Office,	1998).	The	contents	of	soil	SOC,	soil	nitrogen	(N,	g/kg),	phosphorus	(P,	‰),	potassium	(K,	‰)	and	clay	(%)	for	each	plot	were	obtained	from	the	China	National	Science	and	Technology	Platform	for	Earth	System	Science	Data	Sharing	(http://www.geodata.cn/).According	to	the	climate	zone	in	which	forest	distributes	across	China,	we	classified	the	climate	zone	as	five	types:	boreal	(>50°N),	temperate	(40°N–50°N),	 warm	temperate	(33°N–40°N),	 subtropi-cal	(23°N–33°N)	 and	tropical	(<23°N).	The	forests	were	divided	into	five	age	groups	based	on	the	Forestry	Standards	for	“Regulation	for	age-	class	and	age-	group	division	of	main	tree-	species”	of	the	People’s	Republic	of	China	(Table	S2).	As	sample	size	for	some	special	age	group	might	be	too	small	to	be	better	analysed,	the	five	age	groups	were		further	integrated	into	three	categories:	young	forests,		middle-	age	forests	(mid-	aged	group	plus	premature	group)	and	mature	forests	(mature	group	plus	overmature	group).2.3 | Calculation of carbon turnover timesAt	steady	state,	forest	C	stock	is	the	balance	between	the	productiv -ity	and	C	losses	(characterized	 by	turnover	times)	(Malhi,	Doughty,	&	Galbraith,	2011),	thus	 τveg and τsoil	can	be	estimated	by	using	Equation	(2)	(Negrón-	 Juárez	et	al.,	2015;	Todd-	 Brown	et	al.,	2013):where	 τ	is	the	C	turnover	time	(year),	C	is	the	C	stock	(kg	C	m−2)	and	 i	is	vegetation	or	soils.	Annual	NPP	(kg	C	m−2 year−1)	on	a	0.008°	×	0.008°	grid,	averaged	over	the	observed	years	2004–2014,	was	extracted	from	MODIS	17A3	(Smith,	Cleveland,	Reed,	&	Running,	2014)	(http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/).2.4 | Data analysisStatistical	analyses	were	performed	using	R	statistical	software	v3.2.4	(R	Development	 Core	Team,	2016).

To	explore	spatial	patterns	of	τveg and τsoil,	we	conducted	an	ordinary	least	squares	(OLS)	regression	to	evaluate	the	(2) τi=Ci∕NPPFIGURE 2 C	turnover 	times	in	vegetation	(a–c)	and	soils	(d–f)	 with	different	climate	zones,	forest	origin	and	forest	types.

The	OLS	regressions	were	also	used	to	investigate	the	relationships	between	C	turnover	times	and	forest	age	(year).	A	pairwise	correla-tion	analysis	was	performed	to	explore	correlations	of	C	turnover	times	with	soil	variables	(pH,	BD,	clay	content,	SOC,	N,	P	and	K).	Second,	we	performed	structural	equation	modelling	(SEM)	to	ana-lyse	direct	and	indirect	pathways	determining	C	turnover	times.	To	facilitate	our	analysis,	we	classified	all	soil	variables	into	two	groups,	including	soil	nutrient	(SOC,	N,	P	and	K)	and	soil	environment	 (pH,	BD	and	clay	content).	Mean	annual	temperature	and	mean	annual	precipitation	 were	expressed	as	climate.	Because	the	variables	of	climate,	soil	nutrient	and	soil	environment	groups	were	closely	cor-related,	a	principal	components	analysis	(PCA)	was	performed	to	create	a	multivariate	index	representing	 each	group	(e.g.	Chen,	Li,	et	al.,	2016;	Chen,	Liang,	et	al.,	2016).	Within	each	group,	only	vari-ables	significantly	correlated	with	C	turnover	times	were	included	in	the	PCA.	The	first	principal	components	(PC1),	which	explained	65%–95%	of	the	total	variance,	were	subsequently	 used	to	the	SEM	analysis	(Table	S3).	In	the	SEM	analysis,	the	data	were	fit	to	the	model	using	the	maximum	likelihood	estimation	method.	The	 χ2	and	associ-ated	 p	value	were	used	to	evaluate	the	fitness	of	the	model	(Grace,	2006).	The	SEM	analysis	was	implemented	 using	Amos	21.0	(Amos	Development	 Corporation,	Chicago,	IL).	Finally,	we	used	general	lin-ear	models	(GLMs)	to	separate	variance	explained	by	climate,	forest	age,	forest	origin,	forest	type,	soil	nutrient	and	soil	environment	on	C	turnover	times.	C	turnover	times	were	natural	logarithm-	transformed	to	meet	the	parametric	assumptions	 of	normality.	The	explained	variables	having	significant	effects	on	C	turnover	times	were	in-cluded	in	the	final	model.3 |  RESULTS3.1 | Carbon turnover times in vegetation and soilsτveg	varied	from	0.12	to	35.5	years,	with	a	median	value	of	7.6	years,	while	 τsoil	ranged	from	0.9	to	152	years,	with	a	median	value	of	17.7	years	(Figure	S2).	C	turnover	times	varied	significantly	(p < .001)	with	forest	origin	and	forest	type	(Figure	2b,c,e,f).	 On	average	 τveg and τsoil	in	natural	forests	were	larger	than	those	in	planted	forests	(p < .001).	Mean	 τveg	for	forest	types	ranged	from	6.4	(EBF),	8.6	(ENF),	9.3	(DBF),	10.8	(NBF)	to	15.1	years	(DNF),	while	mean	 τsoil	ranged	from	15.4	(EBF),	23.5	(DBF),	24.3	(ENF),	37.9	(NBF)	to	53.8	years	(DNF).	Across	all	forest	plots,	C	turnover	times	significantly	increased	with	forest	age	(p < .001,	Figure	3a,b).	There	were	significant	differences	among	forest	age	groups	(p < .001),	with	mature	forests	having	longer	C	turnover	times	than	middle-	 age	and	young	forests	(Figure	3c,d).3.2 | Spatial patterns of carbon turnover timesC	turnover	times	were	positively	correlated	with	latitude	across	all	for-est	plots	(Figure	4a,d).

Overall,	C	turnover	times	exhibited	a	significant	increase	with	increas-ing	SOC,	N	and	P	contents.	Conversely,	C	turnover	times	were	nega-tively	correlated	with	clay	content.The	SEM	analysis	showed	that	the	model	explained	27%	of	the	vari-ance in τveg	(Figure	5a).	Climate	had	direct	negative	effects	on	τveg and presented	indirect	effects	on	τveg	by	negatively	affecting	soil	nutrient,	which	consequently	led	to	shorter	τveg.	Soil	nutrient	showed	direct	pos-itive	effects	on	τveg,	while	soil	environment	had	no	significant	effects	on	τveg.	Forest	age	exerted	a	positive	effect	on	τveg	through	its	direct	effect	on τveg	and	the	indirect	effect	via	its	positive	correlation	with	soil	nutri-ent.	Latitude	had	an	indirect	effect	on	τveg	by	changing	climate.	Taken	together,	forest	age	and	latitude	were	the	most	important	direct	and	indirect	controlling	factors	of 	τveg	variation	respectively 	(Figure	S3a,	c).The	model	explained	44%	of	the	variance	for	τsoil	(Figure	5b).	Climate,	forest	age,	soil	nutrient	and	soil	environment	were	the	direct	predictors	of τsoil.	Among	the	direct	predictors,	climate	was	the	most	important	con-trol	on	τsoil.	Compared	with	the	standardized	path	coefficients	for	τveg,	the	direct	effects	of	climate	increased	from	−0.27	to	−0.55,	while	the	di-rect	impact	of	forest	age	decreased	from	0.30	to	0.28	in	τsoil	(Figure	S3b).	Latitude	also	exerted	a	strong	indirect	effect	on	τsoil,	with	standardized	path	coefficient	increased	from	0.30	in	τveg	to	0.48	in	τsoil	(Figure	S3d).The	GLMs	analysis	presented	that	climate,	forest	age,	forest	origin,	forest	type	and	soil	nutrient	exhibited	a	combined	control	on	C	turnover	times	for	both	vegetation	and	soils	(Table	1).	Specifically,	climatic	variables	accounted	for	9.4%	and	28.8%	of	the	variance	for	τveg and τsoil,	respec -tively,	whereas	forest	age	explained	12.4%	and	8.6%	of	the	corresponding 	variance.	Forest	origin	accounted	for	7.5%	of	the	variance	for	τveg,	while	the	corresponding	 variance	could	be	only	explained	by	0.9%	for	τsoil. Furthermore,	forest	type	explained	an	additional	0.7%	and	1.2%	of	the	variance for τveg and τsoil,	respectively,	while	soil	nutrient	accounted	for	0.5%	and	1.5%	of 	the	corresponding	 variance	in	the	final	model	(Table	1).4 |  DISCUSSION4.1 | Influences of abiotic factors on carbon turnover timesOur	results	demonstrate	a	latitudinal	pattern	of	C	turnover	times	and	climate	controls	(MAT,	MAP)	on	the	spatial	patterns	of	C	turnover	FIGURE 4 Relationships	between	C	turnover 	times	and	latitude	(a,	d),	mean	annual	temperature	(MAT;	b,	e)	and	mean	annual	precipitation	(MAP;	c,	f)	for 	vegetation	(n = 2,753)	and	soils	(n = 1,087).

The	results	agree	with	previous	studies	that	reported	the	shortest	turnover	times	in	the	low-	latitude	zones	and	the	longest	turnover	times	in	the	high-	latitude	zones	(Bird,	Chivas,	&	Head,	1996;	Bloom	et	al.,	2016;	Carvalhais	et	al.,	2014;	Chen	et	al.,	2013).	 τsoil	was	negatively	related	with	MAT	for	all	for-ests	in	this	study	(Figure	4),	which	is	not	consistent	with	Giardina	and	Ryan	(2000)	who	reported	that	there	were	no	significant	trends	of τsoil	with	temperature	 in	global	forests.	Negative	correlations	between	temperature	and	 τsoil	are	widely	observed	in	soil	incuba-tions	(Knorr,	Prentice,	House,	&	Holland,	2005),	field	measurements 	(Sanderman,	Amundson,	&	Baldocchi,	2003;	Trumbore,	2000),	isotope	trace	(Trumbore,	Chadwick,	&	Amundson,	1996)	or	modelling	stud-ies	(Schimel	et	al.,	1994;	Townsend,	Vitousek,	&	Trumbore,	1995;	Xu,	He,	et	al.,	2016;	Xu,	Shi,	et	al.,	2016).	This	negative	relationship	could	be	explained	by	the	fact	that	increasing	MAT	or	soil	temperature	en-hances	soil	C	mineralization	 by	stimulating	soil	microbes	and	enzymes	activities	(Conant	et	al.,	2011;	Leirós,	Trasar-	Cepeda,	Seoane,	&	Gil-	Sotres,	1999),	and	subsequently	 accelerates	 τsoil.	Mean	annual	precipi-tation	also	determines	the	variations	of	τsoil.	Previous	field	or	model	studies	both	indicated	that	increase	in	precipitation	or	increasing	soil	water	content	accelerates	soil	C	decomposition	 (Davidson,	Verchot,	Cattânio,	Ackerman,	&	Carvalho,	2000;	Knapp	et	al.,	2008;	Reichstein	FIGURE 5 Structure	 equation	modelling	examining	the	direct	and	indirect	effects	on	C	turnover 	times	in	vegetation	(a)	(n = 2,753)	and	soils	(b)	(n = 823).

Multiple	mechanisms	have	been	suggested	underlying	the	positive	effect	of	increasing	precipitation	on	the	SOC	turnover,	including	stimulating	microbial	activities,	enhancing	nitrogen	availability	and	increasing	above-		and	below-	ground	C	inputs	(Posada	&	Schuur,	2011;	Schimel	et	al.,	1994).	A	global	synthesis	of	precipitation	manipulation	 experi-ments	indicated	that	the	normalized	increased	precipitation	of	28%	of	the	MAP	increased	soil	respiration	on	average	by	16%	and	decreased	precipitation	reduced	soil	respiration	by	17%	(Liu,	Wang,	et	al.,	2016).	However,	it	is	noticeable	that	MAP	may	not	be	an	accurate	predictor	of	soil	water	content	because	the	MAP	hides	its	temporal	distribution	(Sanderman	et	al.,	2003).	This	is	the	reason	why	MAP	is	not	as	impor-tant	as	the	MAT	in	controlling	 τsoil,	especially	at	large	scales	(Figures	S4	and	S5).Climate	controls	on	the	variations	of	τveg	are	not	as	dominant	as	that	for	soils	(Table	1,	Figures	4	and	5).	In	fact,	at	the	plot	scale,	the	determinant	of	climate	on	τveg	is	likely	to	be	confounded	by	forest	age,	tree	density	and	other	factors.	At	larger	scales,	e.g.	within	2°	lati-tude	interval	(Figure	S4)	or	5°	latitude	interval	(Figure	S5),	the	impact	of	climate	on	τveg	becomes	more	evident.	The	negative	correlations	between	 τveg	and	climate	may	also	be	related	to	biomass	allocations.	Luo,	Wang,	Zhang,	Booth,	and	Lu	(2012)	and	Reich	et	al.	(2014)	both	indicated	that	more	biomass	is	allocated	into	roots	at	the	expense	of	foliage	in	cold	and	relative	dry	climates,	as	roots,	especially	coarse	roots,	have	slower	turnover	rates	than	foliage	and	are	more	likely	to	contribute	to	the	latitudinal	 variations	of	τveg.Compared	with	previous	studies,	this	study	advances	our	un-derstanding	on	the	controlling	mechanisms	 of	C	turnover	times	by	revealing	the	direct	and	indirect	pathways	of	abiotic	factors	(Figure	5).	On	the	one	hand,	the	direct	impacts	of	climate	factors	explained	more	variations	of	τsoil and τveg	than	those	of	soil	environ-ment	and	nutrients.	On	the	other	hand,	climate	factors	indirectly	impacted	 τsoil and τveg	by	substantially	changing	soil	environment	and	nutrients.	These	findings	emphasize	the	need	to	incorporate	climate	impacts	into	biogeochemical	 model	development	 and	evaluation.4.2 | Influences of biotic factors on carbon turnover timesWe	discovered	that	forest	age	is	a	dominant	biotic	factor	that	modu -lates	C	turnover	times,	especially	for	vegetation	(Table	1,	Figures	3	and	5).	On	the	one	hand,	C	stock	in	the	vegetation	increases	with	stand	development,	 (Cheng	et	al.,	2015;	Fonseca,	Benayas,	&	Alice,	2011).	For	instance,	in	a	natural	vegetation	succession,	C	storage	in	bi-omass	increased	from	1.70	(grasslands),	4.15	(shrublands),	22.3	(shrub	forests),	70.3	(secondary	forests)	to	142.2	Mg	C	ha−1	(primary	forest)	in	karst	regions	(Liu,	Liu,	et	al.,	2016).	On	the	other	hand,	with	forest	growth,	stand	NPP	declines	as	trees	age	(Gray	et	al.,	2016),	which	may	result	from	nutrient	limitation,	stomatal	constraint,	declines	in	pho-tosynthesis	during	stand	development	 (Gower,	McMurtrie,	&	Murty,	1996;	McDowell,	Phillips,	Lunch,	Bond,	&	Ryan,	2002;	Tang,	Luyssaert,	Richardson,	Kutsch,	&	Janssens,	2014).	Moreover,	it	has	been	dem-onstrated	that	increases	in	heterotropical	 respiration	(Rh)	in	early	succession	following	disturbances	are	commonly	evident	(McKinley	et	al.	2011).	In	global	temperate	forests,	 Rh	has	been	reported	decline	from	9.7	Mg	C	ha−1 year−1	in	young	forests	(0–10	years)	to	2.8	Mg	C	ha−1 year−1	in	old	forests	(121–200	years)	 (Pregitzer	&	Euskirchen,	2004).	The	combination	of	increasing	vegetation	C	pool	size	and	de-creasing	NPP	or	Rh	results	in	the	increment	of	τveg	with	stand	devel-opment.	Therefore,	forest	age	is	a	main	determinant	of	τveg	across	all	forests	(Figures	3	and	5).	For	 τsoil,	forest	age	plays	a	less	important	role	than	climate	factors	in	determining	the	variations	of	τsoil.	This	is	likely	because	soils	consist	of	both	newly	fixed	and	old	C,	with	C	age	ranging	from	months	to	decades,	and	even	over	several	hundred	years	(Parton,	Schimel,	Cole,	&	Ojima,	1987).Our	findings	also	show	that	forest	origin,	to	some	extent,	shapes	τveg	(Table	1).	This	could	be	due	to	planted	forests	having	higher	rel-ative	growth	rates	and	photosynthetic	 rates	than	natural	forests,	re-sulting	in	a	relative	higher	NPP.	The	reason	might	also	be	that	planted	forests	and	natural	forests	have	different	biomass	allocation	patters.	Plants	usually	allocate	more	biomass	to	roots	than	to	foliage	with	plant	growth	(Shipley	&	Meziane,	2002).

Natural	forests	are	generally	old	for-ests	that	allocate	more	biomass	to	roots	and	stem	to	support	their	standing	(Peichl	&	Arain,	2007).	The	slower	turnover	rates	in	roots	and	stem	than	foliage	(Negrón-	Juárez	et	al.,	2015)	leads	to	a	relative	longer	τveg	in	natural	forests.	Such	differences	in	biomass	allocation	between	planted	forests	and	natural	forests	also	highlight	the	impor -tance	of	the	impact	of	forest	age.	Our	results	about	C	turnover	times	in	different	forest	types	were	similar	to	the	model	study	in	Zhou,	Shi,	Jia,	Li,	and	Luo	(2010),	where	there	were	shorter	C	residence	times	in	broadleaved	forests	than	in	needleleaf	forests,	and	shorter	residence	times	in	evergreen	forest	than	in	deciduous	forests.	However,	forest	type	was	not	a	key	factor	determining	C	turnover	times	in	the	final	model	in	this	study	(Table	1).	This	may	be	because	climate,	forest	age	and	forest	origin	in	combination	offsets	the	impact	of	forest	type	on	C	turnover	times.In	summary,	biotic	factors	(forest	age,	forest	origin	and	forest	type)	accounted	for	21%	of	the	variations	in	the	τveg,	thus	acted	as	the	dominant	determinants	 of	vegetation	C	turnover,	while	for	τsoil,	biotic	factors	accounted	for	11%	of	the	variations,	thus	played	a	rela-tive	weaker	role	than	climate	factors	(Table	1).	The	various	dominant	controlling	factors	for	τveg and τsoil	imply	different	mechanisms	un-derlying	above-		and	below-	ground	C	turnover,	which	needs	further	investigation	to	improve	our	fundamental	knowledge	of	C	cycling	in	forest	ecosystems.4.3 | Implications and sources of uncertaintiesBy	using	C	stock/NPP	method,	the	τsoil	in	this	study	was	24.3	years	on	average	(Figure	S2).	This	estimate	is	in	agreement	with	the	reported	value	of	24	years	for	the	globally	mean	 τsoil	estimated	by	the	same	method	(Todd-	Brown	et	al.,	2013).	Carvalhais	et	al.	(2014)	reported	a	mean	ecosystem	C	turnover	time	of	22.5	years	for	different	biomes	of	the	world	using	C	stock/influx	 method.	The	present	result	of	τsoil	is	also	comparable	to	the	reported	range	of	21.0–23.2	years	 (Chen	et	al.,	2013),	and	32	years	(Raich	&	Schlesinger,	1992)	in	the	studies	using	the	ratio	of	C	stock	over	C	efflux	( Rh).Besides	the	experimental	 methods	mentioned	above,	modelling	approaches	have	been	also	performed	to	estimate	C	turnover	times.	For	instance,	Negrón-	Juárez	et	al.	(2015)	conducted	the	work	on	τveg in	tropical	forests	based	on	22	ESMs,	which	demonstrated	 various	C	turnover	times	for	different	compartments	 (e.g.	 τleaf,	0.30–3.3	years;	τwood,	11–54	years;	 τroot,	3–23	years).	Although	modelling	is	an	im-portant	tool	in	studying	C	turnover	times,	the	performance	of	models	is	always	unsatisfactory.	 A	recent	analysis	of	11	ESMs	showed	that	large	uncertainties	 still	existed	among	different	models	(Todd-	Brown	et	al.,	2013),	which	subsequently	constrains	their	ability	to	predict	C	storage	capacity	in	terrestrial	ecosystems	(Chen	et	al.,	2015).	Thus,	the	empirical	results	in	this	study	could	provide	a	useful	benchmark	for	model	parameterization.We	also	acknowledge	that	our	estimates	of	C	turnover	times	in	the	present	work	may	have	the	following	uncertainties.	 The	first	uncer -tainty	is	that	we	estimated	C	turnover	times	based	on	the	steady-	state	assumption	that	rarely	happens	in	reality.	In	fact,	C	turnover	times	are	constantly	affected	by	environmental	 conditions	and	C	input	fluxes	for	the	C	cycling.	Thus,	C	turnover	times	are	always	time-	dependent,	except	at	longer	time-	scales	where	the	effects	of	environmental	 con-ditions	and	C	input	fluxes	can	be	ignored,	considering	the	ecosystem	is	at	or	near	steady	state	(Sierra,	Müller,	Metzler,	Manzoni,	&	Trumbore,	2017).	Moreover,	C	turnover	times	and	other	metrics	of	C	cycling	rates	are	always	model-	dependent,	and	it	is	difficult	to	obtain	them	from	observations	 alone	without	steady-	state	assumption	(Sierra	et	al.,	2017).	Nevertheless,	 C	turnover	times	at	steady	state	could	be	useful	to	inform	and	parameterize	 the	C	cycle	models.	As	discussed	here,	 τ means	the	apparent	turnover	times,	like	that	in	the	study	of	Carvalhais	et	al.	(2014).	In	addition,	we	also	assumed	that	soils	are	a	homoge-neous	pool,	which	disregards	the	reality	that	soils	consist	of	C	that	turns	over	with	different	rates	ranging	from	single	years	to	centuries	(Davidson	et	al.,	2000).	So	far,	it	has	been	a	big	challenge	to	separate	soils	into	different	pools	and	quantify	each	pool’s	turnover	time	in	em-pirical	study.	With	those	inevitable	uncertainties,	 however,	this	study	provides	empirical	evidences	and	dataset	on	the	variations	of	τveg and τsoil	at	a	large	scale	(Figure	1),	which	is	invaluable	for	model	evaluation	and	benchmark	analysis.	Furthermore,	the	controlling	factors	for	turn-over	times	revealed	in	this	study	will	provide	insight	into	the	sensitivity	and	potential	response	of 	forest	C	cycling	to	future	climate	change.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis	work	was	financially	supported	by	the	National	Natural	Science	Foundation	of	China	(31625006,	31420103917,	 31290220),	and	the	“Thousand	Youth	Talents	Plan.”	We	also	thank	the	three	anonymous	reviewers	for	their	constructive	comments	on	the	original	version	of	the	manuscript.
