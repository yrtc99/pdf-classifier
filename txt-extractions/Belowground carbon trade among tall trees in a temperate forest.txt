Siegwolf,2Christian Körner1Forest trees compete for light and soil resources, but photoassimilates, once produced inthe foliage, are not considered to be exchanged between individuals. Applying stablecarbon isotope labeling at the canopy scale, we show that carbon assimilated by 40-meter-tall spruce is traded over to neighboring beech, larch, and pine via overlapping rootspheres. Isotope mixing signals indicate that the interspecific, bidirectional transfer,assisted by common ectomycorrhiza networks, accounted for 40% of the fine root carbon(about 280 kilograms per hectare per year tree-to-tree transfer). Although competition forresources is commonly considered as the dominant tree-to-tree interaction in forests,trees may interact in more complex ways, including substantial carbon exchange.Stable carbon isotope labeling at the canopyscale is a powerful tool for tracing carbonallocation in forest ecosystems ( 1,2). In adense forest, large quantities of photo-assimilates may be exported to mycorrhizaand rhizosphere microbes ( 3–11), and hyphaeof mycorrhizal fungi can form “undergroundhighways ”for carbon and nutrient exchangewith and between plants ( 9). It has been sug-gested that because of the unpredictability ofdisturbance events and the divergence of re-sponses among plant communities, mycorrhi-zal fungi and their host plant species are underselective pressure to evolve generality ( 9,10).T h eg r o u p so fp l a n t st h a ta r ei n t e r l i n k e dt h r o u g ha common mycorrhizal network are hence termed“guilds ”(10). The identity and ensemble of fungalspecies may affect plant community structureand ecosystem productivity ( 12,13), with mycor-rhiza improving plant fitness by increasing phos-phorus and nitrogen uptake ( 14). As a result,mycorrhizal networks are considered an integralpart of the autotrophic system ( 15,16) and areessential components in ecosystem resilienceto change. Yet, these benefits have traditionallybeen studied from a nutrient supply perspective,and the mycorrhiza “pipeline ”was never shownto transfer considerable amounts (>1 g) of mobilecarbon compounds among trees ( 4–10). In addi-tion to mycorrhizal networks, carbon can be trans-ferred through natural root grafts, which areanatomical fusions between two or more roots.Growth of interconnected trees in situ can be af-fected directly by the presence of root grafts —forexample, by translocation of water and carbohy-drates ( 17). Transport across root grafts has beendemonstrated in numerous field studies usingvarious methods, from dye injection to the use ofradioactive tracers ( 18,19), but these grafts arerestricted to trees of the same species or, at most,of phylogenetically closely related species ( 17–20).Using a tall canopy crane ( 1,2), we continu-ously labeled five 40-m-tall Norway spruce trees(Picea abies ) as part of a 5-year free-air CO2en-richment experiment (FACE) in a mixed forest innorthwest Switzerland ( 3,21,22)( f i g s .S 1t oS 7 ) .Five unlabeled Picea trees served as controls (fig.S8). We then measured d13C from “tip to toe, ”including canopy twigs, stems, and fine roots oflabeled and unlabeled individuals of Picea and ofneighboring trees belonging to different taxa ( Fagussylvatica ,Pinus sylvestris , and Larix decidua ).Except for the five labeled Picea ,n o n eo ft h et r e e swere exposed to CO 2labeling. Using industrial,13C-depleted CO 2gas, our canopy labeling madethed13C signal of labeled trees more negative by5.3 per mil ( ‰) compared to unlabeled controltrees: Twig d13Cw a s –31.4‰in labeled and –26.1‰in unlabeled Picea (Fig. 1). New fine roots of labeledPicea , isolated from 90 ingrowth cores (figs. S9and S10) had 2.6 ‰lower d13C values than thecontrol trees growing in ambient air (no13Cl a b e l )(Fig. 1). Almost the same isotopic signal was foundamong fine roots of similarly tall nonconspecifictrees in the neighborhood that were unlabeledand contributed about half of the fine roots re-covered from ingrowth cores (Fig. 2A). To validatethat fine roots of the other taxa were not confusedwith those of Picea , we excavated roots from Picea(control and labeled) and neighboring tree speciesand traced them to the trunk of origin (figs. S12 toS14). Again, fine roots of these non- Picea taxashowed a13C signal similar to that of their neigh-boring Picea (either control or labeled) but joint-ly at a 2.6 ‰less negative level when13C-labeledPicea w a sp r e s e n t( F i g .2 B ) .H e n c e ,b o t ht h er o o t -ingrowth-core data (with multiple individuals ’input) and the data for intact root systems fromthree individuals belong ing to three different treegenera yielded the same signals. Sapwood d13Co fthe 2010 to 2014 annual rings in stem cores takenat breast height from neighboring and nonneighbor-ing non- Picea trees was –27.8 ± 0.1 ‰and–26.9 ±0.1‰,r e s p e c t i v e l y —still a significant difference(P=0 . 0 1 9 ) .Because our FACE system operated in the can-opy only (20 to 40 m aboveground), tank CO2,and thus the13C label, were not present in theunderstory. This was ascertained first by13Csignals in understory plants, which are exclusivelyvesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal: Paris quadri-folia,Mercurialis perennis ,a n d Rubus frutico-sus.d13C values in rhizomes/root stocks fromthese three species growing under both unlabeledand labeled Picea showed the typical, very nega-tive signals for deep shade plants (from –30.2 to–34.5‰) (fig.

Noinfluence of the13C label could be found. d13Cin twig xylem of Picea was–26.1 ± 0.1 ‰and–31.4 ±1.1‰in unlabeled and labeled trees, respectively.In twig xylems of the three neighboring tree spe-cies ( Fagus ,Pinus ,a n d Larix ),d13Cw a s –25.1 ±0.9,–26.2 ± 0.5, and –25.9 ± 0.6 ‰, respectively,as previously observed in these trees ( 23). Only intwigs sampled in the small crown fraction imme-diately next to the crowns of the labeled Picea(<20% of the crown circumference), d13Cw a ss l i g h t -ly lowered compared with the aforementionedvalues ( –28.1, –29.2, and –28.8 in twigs of Fagus ,Pinus ,a n d Larix , respectively). The remainder ofthe crown periphery and the crown center showedno label, and hence the overall crown volumethat was slightly influenced by the isotope labelwas <10%. Moreover, the d13Cv a l u e si nt h o s ep r o x -imal twigs were still 2.2 to 3.3 ‰above those inthe labeled Picea twigs.The tree-to-tree transfer of labeled carbon wasso strong in this study that roots of different treetaxa (of which only Picea was labeled) shared analmost similar isotopic signature: –30.0‰and–29.1‰in labeled and neighbor trees, respectively(Fig. 1). The decrease in d13C of unlabeled neigh-bor roots, and the parallel increase in d13Co flabeled roots relative to their source tissues (Fig.1), indicate a bidirectional carbon exchange. Toestimate the direction and magnitude of the car-bon exchange, we compared the aforementionedd13C values with those prevailing without anylabeled carbon transfer ( “baseline ”signatures).We then applied a simple carbon isotope mixingcalculation between roots of labeled and neigh-bor trees using the equation a×n+( 1 0 0 –a)×m=p,w h e r e ais the contribution of one of two sourcesto a mixture (in %), nis its isotopic signature, mis the isotopic signature of the other source, andpthat of the mixed product. In the neighborroots, the d13Cv a l u eo f –29.1‰reflects a decreaseby 1.7 ‰from a mean baseline value of –27.4‰observed in roots of the same tree species growingaround unlabeled Picea (Fig. 1). However, a base-line signature in the labeled Picea r o o t si sh a r d e rto estimate, because we had no reference obser-vation of labeled Picea that did not exchangecarbon with non- Picea neighbors. To this mixing,one must add an intrinsic dilution by the con-tribution of older, unlabeled carbon to currentfine root growth ( 3,24). We do know that incontrol Picea ,d13Co fr o o t sw a s1 . 3 ‰more nega-tive than that of the canopy twigs (Fig. 1) (acommon observation), and hence a premixed base-line for the labeled Picea root would be –32.7‰(–31.4 minus 1.3 ‰). Thus, our isotope mixingcalculation had to solve for a mixing ratio thatwould satisfy (i) a 2.7 ‰increase in the labeledPicea root signal ( –30.0 minus –32.7‰); (ii) a1.7‰decrease in the neighbor root signal; andaccount for (iii) the intrinsic dilution ratio witho l ds t o r e dc a r b o n .W ef o u n dt h a ta2 0 %c o n t r i -bution of older, unlabeled carbon to current fine-root growth of labeled Picea , and an isotope-mixingratio of 60% self and 40% exchanged carbon be-tween fine roots of labeled and unlabeled trees,satisfied the13C signal changes at both sides ofthe transfer (Fig. 3).T h em a g n i t u d eo ft h ee x c h a n g ec a nb ee s t i -mated: Picea fine-root biomass production esti-mated from our ingrowth cores ( 11)w a s6 0gm−2a−1SCIENCE sciencemag.org 15 APRIL 2016 VOL 352 ISSUE 6283 343TwigsStemFine rootsFungi -24.5 ± 0.3 -31.0 ± 0.4-24-32-28-26-30δ13C (‰)Saprophytic MycorrhizalInterspecific root carbon transfer Control (unlabeled)-25.2 ± 0.2-24.5 ± 0.3 -25.5 ± 0.4Saprophytic MycorrhizalPiceaabiesFagus sylvaticaLarixdeciduaPinussylvestrisPiceaabiesFagus sylvaticaLarixdeciduaPinussylvestris5-yr CO2labeling-26.1 ± 0.1 -27.3 ± 0.3 -26.9 ± 0.2 -26.7 ± 0.1-26.1 ± 0.1-30.4 ± 0.5 -28.3 ± 0.1 -27.1 ± 0.6 -27.8 ± 0.3-25.9 ± 0.6 -31.4 ± 0.2 -25.1 ± 0.9-30.0 ± 0.5 -29.6 ± 0.3 -29.4 ± 0.8 -28.3 ± 0.2 -27.0 ± 0.2 -27.4 ± 0.3 -27.9 ± 0.5-26.6 ± 0.2 -25.8 ± 0.2 -26.2 ± 0.5N.

Assuming anaverage root carbon concentration of 46%, thiscorresponds to a fine-root production of 69 gcarbon m−2a−1. If 40% of this fine-root carboncame from an exchange via mycorrhiza, this car-bon transfer flux equals 28 g carbon m−2a−1—i.e.,280 kg ha−1a−1, which is equivalent to 4% of theforest net carbon uptake (net primary production).The carbon transfer that we observed mostlikely occurred through common ectomycorrhizanetworks, which are very abundant at this site(table S1), and also exhibited the labeled carbonin their “fruit”bodies near labeled Picea (3)a n dare a substantial carbon sink in Norway spruceforests ( 16). Host specificity is a known traitamong ectomycorrhiza taxa, yet common networksand the formation of trophic guilds play a crucialrole in forest dynamics ( 25). For example, in amixed Central European forest, 75 ectomycor-rhiza taxa were identified on Fagus sylvaticaroots ( 26); 29% and 10% of the ectomycorrhizaspecies were shared with one or two other treespecies, respectively; however, it is noteworthythat the 61% host-specific ectomycorrhiza speciescolonized only 20% of the root tips ( 24). Theectomycorrhiza species Russula ochroleuca (Pers.)has been previously identified on roots of all fourtree species studied here ( 27), and a Russula spe-cies was identified in our forest site (table S1). Ataxonomic search in the ectomycorrhiza database(www.deemy.de) ( 28) revealed three other generafound at our site that are common symbionts toour four study tree species —namely, Cortinarius ,Lactarius ,a n d Tricholoma .Our earlier study on this site ( 3)a l s os h o w e dzero d13C labeling in saprophytic fungi (Fig. 1)and decreasing mycorrhizal d13C with decreasingdistance from the labeled Picea .O u rr e s u l t si n -dicate a bidirectional carbon exchange (Fig. 3)rather than a one-way transfer ( 17), which is notalong a demand-supply gradient as previouslyreported ( 10,17). Considering that all studiedtrees were dominant, healthy, and tall individu-als, growing without obvious carbon limitation,no a priori source-sink gr adients might be expectedhere ( 29). It has been suggested that carbontransfer between trees via mycorrhiza is ratherregulated to satisfy the needs of the mycorrhizaitself ( 7). In our case, it is still possible that labeledPicea transferred excess carbon belowground ( 3)and, in turn, enhanced mycorrhizal activity andproliferation.The mild, yet significant increase in sapwoodd13C at the base of trees neighboring the labeledPicea (Fig. 1) indicates slight aboveground allo-cation of imported carbon. So far, root carbonuptake was shown in “green-to-ground ”cornand in willow cuttings using labeled carbonate(NaH14CO3and H13CO3–)(31), as well as in pineseedlings ( 30), but not in mature trees in the field.Finally, the observed interspecific carbon trans-fer among tall trees in our study can become in-creasingly important for forests under stressconditions (e.g., drought or spring frost) or afterdisturbance such as wildf ire, when divergence inspecies ’r e s p o n s e sc o m ei n t op l a y( 5–10,14,20,23).The magnitude, direction, and control of thesetransfer fluxes and their importance are yet to beresolved, and they add a new dimension and levelof complexity to known ecosystem processes.REFERENCES AND NOTES1.
