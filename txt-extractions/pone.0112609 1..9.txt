However, theirability to perform important biogeochemical processes remains uncharacterized. Here, we identified important functionalgenes that characterize the rhizosphere microbial community to understand metabolic capabilities in the maize rhizosphereusing the GeoChip-based functional gene array method. Significant differences in functional gene structure were apparentbetween rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities. Approximately half of the detected gene families weresignificantly (p ,0.05) increased in the rhizosphere. Based on the detected gyrB genes, Gammaproteobacteria,Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria were most enriched in the rhizosphere compared tothose in the bulk soil. The rhizosphere niche also supported greater functional diversity in catabolic pathways. The maizerhizosphere had significantly enriched genes involved in carbon fixation and degradation (especially for hemicelluloses,aromatics and lignin), nitrogen fixation, ammonification, denitrification, polyphosphate biosynthesis and degradation, sulfurreduction and oxidation. This research demonstrates that the maize rhizosphere is a hotspot of genes, mostly originatingfrom dominant soil microbial groups such as Proteobacteria, providing functional capacity for the transformation of labileand recalcitrant organic C, N, P and S compounds.Citation: Li X, Rui J, Xiong J, Li J, He Z, et al.

Organic substances released from roots may support highmicrobial biomass and metabolic activity and thus the assembly ofmore active and distinct microbial communities in the rhizosphereas compared to those in the bulk soil. Interactions between plantsand microorganisms in the rhizosphere control important biogeo-chemical processes, such as nutrient cycling and greenhouse gasemissions. While some pathogenic microbes undermine planthealth, many beneficial microbes in the rhizosphere provide plantswith mineral nutrients, phytohormones, and also help to protectthe plant against phytopathogens [1,3]. Thus, characterization ofthe functional potential of rhizosphere microbial communities isimportant in order to link soil community activity to plant growthand health.Previous studies show that the activities of many enzymes arehigher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil [4], due to highermicrobial activity and enzymes secreted from roots and microor-ganisms. Biochemical measurements of soil enzyme activitiesprovide general information, but little is known about the origin ofvarious types of enzyme. With high throughput pyrosequencing-based approaches [5] and microarray-based metagenomic tech-nologies, e.g., GeoChip [6,7], the composition, structure, andmetabolic potential of microbial communities can be rapidlyanalyzed. For example, GeoChip 3.0 covers ca. 57,000 genePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112609sequences in .292 gene families, allowing quantification ofhundreds and thousands of functional genes from known microbesin each sample [7]. Thus, the phylogenetic nature of the dataacquisition enables the assignment of metabolic capabilities tospecific microbial groups in each niche. Such studies bridge thegap between microbial diversity and potential enzyme activities,which have both been previously investigated separately in therhizosphere [1–3].Since maize ( Zea mays ) is an important crop, comprehensivephylogenetic investigations of its rhizosphere microbiome havebeen conducted using high throughput pyrosequencing techniques[5,8] and other methods [9,10]. Previous research shows that therhizosphere of maize is preferentially colonized by Proteobacteria,Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria [5], and these organisms may beactive in utilizing plant exudates and organic polymers. However,it is important to determine which microorganisms are active inthe rhizosphere and what functional genes and pathways arepresent.The objective of this study, was to identify important functionalgenes characterizing the rhizosphere microbial community using aGeoChip-based functional gene array to understand metaboliccapabilities in the maize rhizosphere. We hypothesize that therhizosphere of maize is a hotspot of genes, mostly originating fromdominant microbial groups, and providing functional capacity forthe transformation of labile and recalcitrant organic C, N, P and Scompounds.Materials and MethodsField description and samplingMaize ( Zea mays ) was grown near the University of Illinois(Champaign, IL, USA, 40 u039N, 88 u12W, 230 m elevation) in asoil classified as a fine-silty, mesic Typic Endoaquoll formed fromloess and silt parent material. The field site is a typical arable soilin the U.S. Corn Belt, and it has been in continuous cultivation forover 100 years. The Z. mays cultivar cv 34B43 (Pioneer Hi-BredInternational, Des Moines, IA, USA) was planted in Mayfollowing standard agricultural practices in this region with annualapplications of 20 g m22of mixed urea, ammonia, and nitratefertilizer at planting. No specific permissions were required forresearch activities in this location, and the field studies did notinvolve endangered or protected species.Samples were collected in August 4, 2009, which represents theearly reproductive (R) growth stages (the R1–R2 or blister growthstage defined by Hanway [11]). Our rationale for sampling at thistime is that it allows us to assess the cumulative growing seasoninfluence of the plant on its rhizosphere community at animportant early stage in the development of the cereal cornkernels. Thus, this growth period should provide the clearest linkbetween rhizosphere community composition/activity and yield-relevant plant health. However, it should be remembered that themicrobial communities are dynamic over the growing season, andthis sampling only provides a snapshot view of rhizospherecommunities at this important growth stage.To collect rhizosphere samples, plants were carefully excavatedusing a shovel, and the soil loosely attached to the root wasremoved. Fresh roots were collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube,rinsed in phosphate buffer solution, shaken by hand andcentrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Bulk soil cores of 0–30 cmdepth were also collected between sampled plants for pairedcomparison to the rhizosphere samples. Triplicate samples weretaken for both rhizosphere and bulk soil, in which each individualsample was a pool of four plants or soil cores, and each plant orsoil core was on average 1 m apart. All the samples weretransferred to the lab on dry ice, pre-processed and stored at 280uC for downstream applications. Soil total organic carbon andnitrogen were measured using an element analyzer.GeoChip analysisSoil DNA was extracted by freeze-grinding mechanical lysis asdescribed previously [12]. To determine the abundance offunctional genes in the rhizosphere and bulk soils, GeoChip 3.0was used. This gene array covers ca. 57,000 gene sequences in .292 gene families [7]. For GeoChip analysis, genomic DNA wasfirst amplified using the Templiphi kit (GE Healthcare, NJ) with100 ng community DNA as the template. Three micrograms ofamplified DNA were used for each hybridization. Three technicalreplicates of each rhizosphere and bulk soil sample were used formicroarray hybridization, for a total of 18 hybridizations. Detailsfor template amplification, labeling and hybridization, imageprocessing is described in detail by He et al. [7].Microarray data were analyzed using the data analysis pipelinedeveloped at the University of Oklahoma (http://ieg.ou.edu/microarray/). Briefly, signal intensity of good quality microarrayspots was extracted. Normalized intensity of each gene wascalculated by dividing the signal intensity by the mean intensity ofthe microarray. The matrices of microarray data resulting fromour pipeline were considered as ‘species’ abundance in statisticalanalyses. Microbial diversity indices were analyzed with theDiversity Index Calculator (http://www.reading.ac.uk/ssc/software/diversity/diversity.html). Differences in signal intensitybetween bulk soil and rhizosphere were tested with two-tailedpaired t-tests. All of the original microarray signal data weredeposited at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) underaccession number GSE61338.ResultsOverall differences of microbial communities betweenrhizosphere and bulk soilA total of 6201 genes were detected by GeoChip in all samples,with 5777 genes (93.2% of total 6201 genes) enumerated in therhizosphere and 1983 genes (32.0%) enumerated in the bulk soils.In the rhizosphere, 5390 genes were from bacteria, 103 fromarchaea and 246 from fungi. In the bulk soil, 1849 genes werefrom bacteria, 38 from archaea and 84 from fungi. The detectedgenes were distributed across 248 gene families, of which 53 genefamilies were only detected in the rhizosphere. Among them, 38gene families were related to organic compound utilization anddegradation. In addition, two gene families were only detected inthe bulk soil, and both were related to organic transformation.Gene abundances of 140 gene families were significantly (p ,0.05)increased in the rhizosphere (Table S1).GeoChip 3.0 includes the DNA gyrase subunit B gene ( gyrB) [7]as a phylogenetic marker to characterize the diversity, compositionand structure of microbial communities. A total of 164 gyrBprobes showed positive signals in both bulk soil and rhizospheresamples. These gyrB probes detected were primarily related toGammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroi-detes and Cyanobacterial phyla (Fig. 1). Signal intensities werehigher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Also, the diversityof functional genes calculated from GeoChip data was significantlyhigher in the rhizosphere (p ,0.05) (Table 1). This is in contrast tothe microbial species diversity based on pyrosequencing of the 16SrRNA gene, which was lower in the rhizosphere than that in thebulk soil [5].Even though the GeoChip array may have some bias in probeselection, the above results showed the maize rhizosphereFunctional Potential in Maize RhizospherePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112609Table 1.

Though manydifferent types of genes were detected, we were especiallyinterested in microbial genes important to nutrient cycling andmicrobial interactions, such as antibiotic genes and theirphylogenetic origins, which were further examined below.Autotrophic CO 2fixationGeoChip 3.0 contains probes for detecting genes encoding keyenzymes involved in autotrophic carbon fixation pathways:ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) forCalvin cycle, propionyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Pcc/Acc)for 3-hydroxypropionate/malyl-CoA cycle, carbon monoxidedehydrogenase (CODH) for reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, andATP citrate lyase (AclB) for reductive acetyl-CoA pathway [7].The Pcc/Acc, Rubisco and CODH pathways were identified to bedominant in both the bulk soil and rhizosphere samples (Fig. 2),and their relative intensity was higher (p ,0.05) in the rhizospherethan that in bulk soil, suggesting higher capacity in CO 2fixation inthe rhizosphere. The AclB pathway was not detected in any of thesamples. The CODH genes were mainly distributed in Alphapro-teobacteria phylum in both rhizosphere and bulk soil, especiallythe genera Rhodopseudomonas and Stappia (Table S2). Also,Rubisco genes were mainly found in Proteobacteria in bothrhizosphere and bulk soil, especially the genera Burkholderia andMagnetospirillum . The pcc/accgenes for autotrophic carbonfixation were identified mainly in Proteobacteria and Actinobac-teria in both rhizosphere and bulk soil, especially the generaVerminephrobacter , and Mycobacterium , respectively. In contrast,the pcc/acc genes related to genera Bradyrhizobium andCaulobacter were only detected in the rhizosphere (Table S3).Carbon degradationRhizosphere soil had more organic C than bulk soil (Table 1).Among 248 detected gene families, 176 gene families wereinvolved in C degradation and organic matter remediation. Thesegenes included those for the degradation of labile C, e.g., starch(alpha-amylase), hemicelluloses (arabinofuranosidase and xyla-nase), cellulose (cellobiase, cellobiose dehydrogenase and endoglu-canase, mainly in Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and fungi),aromatics (limonene epoxide hydrolase, vanillate monooxygenaseand vanillin dehydrogenase, mainly in Proteobacteria, e.g.Sphingomonas ,Bradyrhizobium andPseudomonas ), chitin (endo-chitinase, mainly in fungi and Bacteroidetes), and lignin (manga-nese peroxidase and glyoxal oxidase, mainly in fungi, especially theclass Basidiomycetes) (Fig. 2).Nitrogen cyclingTotal soil N levels were similar in the maize rhizosphere and inthe bulk soil (Table 1). GeoChip detected genes critical to all themajor pathways in the N cycle. Most of genes were more abundantin the rhizosphere than bulk soil (Fig. 3).Firstly, nifH for N fixation was significantly (p ,0.05) enrichedin the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (Table S2 and S3).The most abundant nifH genes detected in all samples were fromuncultured microorganisms (80–87% of total nifH hybridizationsignal intensities), which suggests that many N 2-fixing microor-ganisms are still unknown. Among four defined clusters of nifHgenes, cluster I genes were most represented (6% of total nifHsignal in rhizosphere and 12% in bulk soil), especially those fromRhodobacter andRhodopseudomonas .Secondly, two genes encoding key enzymes (glutamate dehy-drogenase/ gdhand urease/ ureC ) for ammonification (N mineral-ization) were significantly (p ,0.05) enriched in the maizerhizosphere compared to bulk soil (Table S2 and S3). Gdh geneswere only detected in the rhizosphere, mainly distributed in thebacterial phylum Actinobacteria and archaeal genus Thermo-plasma , while ureC genes were mainly distributed in the bacterialphyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.Thirdly, two genes encoding key enzymes (ammonia monoox-ygenase/ amoA and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase/ hao) for nitri-fication were detected. Both of the bacterial and archaeal amoAgenes were dominant in the rhizosphere. The haogenes were onlydetected in the rhizosphere and largely derived from Rhodobac-teraceae.Fourthly, two key genes (nitrate reductase/ napA and c-typecytochrome nitrite reductase/ nrfA) for dissimilatory N reductionto ammonium (DNRA) were significantly (p ,0.05) overrepresent-ed in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil, mainly derived fromDesulfitobacterium andSyntrophobacter . Also, three genes ( nasA,nirA andnirB) for assimilatory N reduction to ammonium weresignificantly (p ,0.05) enriched in the rhizosphere compared tobulk soil. The nasA gene was mainly found in the unculturedbacteria, the nirA gene in uncultured archaea, and the nirB genein Verrucomicrobiae, Actinomycetales, and genus Pseudomonas .In addition, the abundances of five key genes ( narG ,nirS/nirK,norB and nosZ) involved in the denitrification process weresignificantly higher (p ,0.05) in the rhizosphere than in the bulksoil. Most of these genes were found in uncultured bacteria. SomeofnarG genes detected in the maize rhizosphere were indicated inActinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which is consistent with aprevious report [13].Phosphorus utilizationGeoChip 3.0 contains probes targeting phosphorus utilization,exopolyphosphatase (Ppx) for inorganic polyphosphate degrada-tion, polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) for polyphosphate biosynthesis inprokaryotes, and phytase for phytate degradation [7]. The totalsignal intensity of ppxand ppkgenes was significantly (p ,0.05)increased in the rhizosphere (Fig. 4), suggesting a possibleenhancement of polyphosphate transformation and the availabilityof inorganic P in the maize rhizosphere. These genes were mainlydistributed in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The abundanceof phytase genes, mainly derived from fungi Ceriporia sp. in therhizosphere and Obesumbacterium proteus in bulk soil, was notsignificantly different between rhizosphere and bulk soil, indicatingthat organic P degradation capability may be not significantlydifferent.Sulfur cyclingFour enzymes involved in the sulfur cycling of microbialcommunities are included in GeoChip 3.0: sulfite reductase(DsrA/DsrB) for sulfur reduction, sulfite oxidase (Sox) for sulfuroxidation, dissimilatory adenosine-5 9-phosphosulfate reductase(AprA) for both microbial sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidationprocesses [7]. The total signal intensity of dsrA andsoxgenes wassignificantly (p ,0.05) increased in the rhizosphere (Fig. 4),suggesting a possible increase in the sulfur transformation rate.sox genes were mainly derived from Alphaproteobacteria,especially the order Rhizobiales, while the other three genes weremainly affiliated with Deltaproteobacteria.Antibiotic resistanceEleven genes for antibiotic resistance are included in GeoChip3.0: five for transporters, four for b-lactamase genes, and two fortetracycline and vancomycin resistance [7]. We found most ofthese genes to be significantly more abundant in the rhizospherethan in bulk soil (Fig. 5; p ,0.05). The small multidrug resistanceFunctional Potential in Maize RhizospherePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112609gene family (SMR) showed the highest signal intensity amongthese five transporter genes, which were mainly affiliated withgenera Mycobacterium ,Bacillus andYersinia in both rhizosphereand bulk soil. Major facilitator super gene family (MFS) alsoshowed high signal intensity after SMR, and they were mainlyderived from the genus Burkholderia . The ABC antibiotictransporter was only detected in the rhizosphere.DiscussionGeoChip-based analysis in this study reveals the assemblage ofdominant microbiomes from an explicitly functional perspectiverather than from taxonomic classification only. Our previous studyshowed that the maize rhizosphere had significantly reducedbacterial species diversity in comparison to bulk soil [5]. Incontrast, GeoChip analysis revealed that functional diversityincreased in the rhizosphere (Table 1). Root exudates are drivingforces to determine the assemblage of rhizosphere microbialcommunity [14,15]. There are a wide variety of compounds, suchas organic acids, sugars, amino acids, lipids, enzymes andaromatics, in the root exudates [1]. Half of the detected genefamilies were significantly more abundant in the rhizosphere thanthose in the bulk soil, suggesting that a broad diversity of metabolicactivities is enhanced in the rhizosphere. Rhizosecretion (exudate)may activate the growth of previously dormant microbes and theirmetabolic potentials, including fast-growing r-strategist microbes[14]. The r-strategists may respond rapidly to the freshly inputFigure 2. Normalized signal intensity of genes involved in (a) carbon fixation, (b) carbon degradation pathways in the rhizosphereand bulk soil. All data are presented as means 6standard errors (n = 3). *p ,0.05, and **p ,0.01.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112609.g002Functional Potential in Maize RhizospherePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112609organic matter by increasing their growth, functional geneexpression and decomposition rates [16].Enzyme activities involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling areinfluenced by plant-microorganism-fauna interactions [17]. Geo-chip data in this study showed that the changes in the structureand metabolic potential of rhizosphere microbial communitieswere reflected in a significant increase in the abundance of manyfunctional genes compared to the bulk soil. The higherabundances of functional genes (e.g., CODH, xylanase, glyoxaloxidase and vanilate demethylase) in the rhizosphere suggests thatplants select functional groups with a strong capacity for C sourceutilization. We speculate that the rhizosphere may favor thosedecomposers for labile C compounds and plant polymers since thegene abundances responsible for the degradation of these organicsubstrates were significantly over-represented in the rhizosphere.The ability to carry out both simple and complex carbohydratecatabolism was mainly detected in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,Firmicutes, and fungi (Table S3), whereas the ability to catabolizecomplex aromatic compounds was indicated mainly by Proteo-bacteria and fungi. The increased potential to transform lignin-likecompounds and other naturally occurring polyaromatics in therhizosphere might be related to manganese peroxidase found inBasidiomycetes [18].A previous study showed that increased microbial activity andnitrogen mineralization were coupled to the changes in microbialcommunity structure in the rhizosphere of Bt corn [19]. Thestimulatory effect of maize roots on denitrification was observed atboth high and low soil nitrate levels [20]. Our GeoChip resultssuggested that N fixation, ammonification, denitrification, and Nreduction were significantly higher in the maize rhizospherecompared to the bulk soil, especially by members of Proteobacteria(Table S3), possibly leading to more active microbially mediated Ntransformation in the rhizosphere. GeoChip analysis furthershowed that the genes involved in C, N, P, S cycling stimulatedby the maize rhizosphere were mainly found in organismsbelonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Thisis also supported by the finding that the maize rhizosphere waspreferentially colonized by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria [5].Within these phyla, the genera Bradyrhizobium ,Pseudomonas ,Rhodopseudomonas and Mycobacterium were overrepresented inthe rhizosphere, and these genera harbored diverse functionalgenes for nutrient transformation. GeoChip data showed thatBradyrhizobium played important roles in autotrophic carbonfixation and aromatic degradation; Pseudomonas involved inaromatics degradation and assimilatory N reduction to ammoni-um; Rhodopseudomonas involved in autotrophic carbon fixationand N fixation; Mycobacterium involved in autotrophic carbonfixation and antibiotic resistance. A metaproteomics study alsorevealed that bacterial proteins were mostly linked to theProteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the rhizosphere of rice[21], suggesting that these two bacterial phyla constitute importantparts of ‘core rhizosphere microbiome’ that maintains variousFigure 3. Differences in the abundance of N cycling genes in the rhizosphere and bulk soil. The numbers in brackets indicate thepercentage difference of a functional gene signal intensity between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples relative to the normalized signal intensity i nthe bulk soil sample.

GeoChip data supported the hypothesis thatmicrobial competition in the rhizosphere might be greater thanthat found in bulk soil, as indicated by the higher abundance ofantibiotic resistance genes in the rhizosphere. Some microorgan-isms produce unique antimicrobial metabolites toxic to othermicroorganisms, allowing them to colonize and proliferate onplant surfaces in the presence of other microbial communities. Thegenera Burkholderia, Mycobacterium ,Bacillus andYersinia werefound to be important antibiotic producers in this study,corroborating their abundant distributions in the rhizosphere ofmany crops, such as maize [1,5]. The higher occurrence ofFigure 4. Normalized signal intensity of genes involved in (a) phosphorus utilization, (b) sulfur cycling in the rhizosphere and bulksoil.

Microbesthat can degrade or detoxify these metabolites via specificfunctional genes gain a competitive advantage [1].With GeoChip-based functional gene arrays, we have been ableto identify functional potentials with the most relevant focus onfunctional ecology in the rhizosphere of maize. The data supportsthe concept that the rhizosphere of maize is a hotspot of genes forthe transformation of labile and recalcitrant organic C, N, P and Scompounds. These functional genes mostly originate fromdominant microbial groups, such as Proteobacteria. This studyprovides comprehensive baseline information on functionalcapacity in the maize rhizosphere. Specific plant-microbe inter-actions should be further defined by linking the plant Cmetabolism by microbial species with a particular functional rolein the rhizosphere [2].Supporting InformationTable S1 Normalized signal intensity of gene familiessignificantly different in the rhizosphere and bulk soil(p,0.05).(XLSX)Table S2 The dominant genes affiliated to differentgenera.(XLSX)Table S3 Log 10values of normalized signal intensity ofdominant gene categories affiliated to each phylum.(XLSX)Author ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: XL RIM.
