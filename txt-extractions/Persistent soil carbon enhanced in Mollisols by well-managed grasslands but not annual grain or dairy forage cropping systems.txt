Whetherminimizing soil disturbance, diversifying crop rotations, orre-establishing perennial grasslands and integrating livestock canslow or reverse this trend remains highly uncertain. We investi-gated how these management practices affected soil organic car-bon (SOC) accrual and distribution between particulate (POM) andmineral-associated (MAOM) organic matter in a 29-y-old ﬁeldexperiment in the North Central United States and assessed howsoil microbial traits were related to these changes. Compared toconventional continuous maize monocropping with annual tillage,systems with reduced tillage, diversi ﬁed crop rotations with covercrops and legumes, or manure addition did not increase total SOCstorage or MAOM-C, whereas perennial pastures managed withrotational grazing accumulated more SOC and MAOM-C (18 to29% higher) than all annual cropping systems after 29 y of man-agement. These results align with a meta-analysis of data frompublished studies comparing the ef ﬁcacy of soil health manage-ment practices in annual cropping systems on Mollisols worldwide.Incorporating legumes and manure into annual cropping systemsenhanced POM-C, microbial biomass, and microbial C-use ef ﬁ-ciency but did not signi ﬁcantly increase microbial necromass accu-mulation, MAOM-C, or total SOC storage. Diverse, rotationallygrazed pasture management has the potential to increase persis-tent soil C on Mollisols, highlighting the key role of well-managedgrasslands in climate-smart agriculture.soil organic carbon jagricultural practices jMollisols jsoil microbes jmanaged grasslandsModern agriculture depleted soil organic carbon (SOC)from much of the world’s arable lands over the past 150y (1). Building soil organic matter (SOM) in agricultural soils iscrucial to our ability to counteract this trend and provide forour wants and needs (2). Grassland-derived Mollisols cover∼916 million ha of Earth’s surface and are now the agriculturalheartlands of North America, South America, and Eurasia.Intensive agriculture on these Mollisols has liberated ∼2P gCsince cultivation began (3, 4). Enhancing SOM in Mollisolswould not only offset a portion of global greenhouse gas emis-sions but also improve soil health that underpins vital ecosys-tems services including food sovereignty, clean water, ﬂoodreduction, and biodiversity, and therefore contribute to achiev-ing sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda of theUnited Nations (5).Simulation and conceptual modeling indicate a large poten-tial for SOM accumulation on Mollisols (6, 7), but uncertaintyremains about whether intensive agricultural use of these soilscan accrue carbon (C) and maintain it for relatively long peri-ods (8, 9). SOM is comprised of fractions that differ in forma-tion, persistence, and function (10). Reducing tillage, diversifyingcrop rotations, and adding legumes and manure are touted aspromising strategies to regenerate SOM in croplands ( 11–13).Whereas they appear to increase the relatively undecomposedparticulate organic matter (POM) fraction (14, 15), which isdirectly associated with improved soil health, their ability to buildmore persistent mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) andenhance total C stock and persistence in Mollisols has beendebated (16–19).Growing evidence suggests MAOM is formed mainly whenmicrobial products associate with mineral surfaces (20–22), sopractices that promote efﬁcient microbial growth and necro-mass production should drive persistent C accrual in soils withhigh mineral capacity for organomineral associations (23–25).In the North Central United States, an important dairy-producing region, agricultural operations in past decades haveincorporated more forage legumes such as alfalfa into croprotations (26), which may result in MAOM accumulation fromenhanced soil microbial growth and necromass accumulationbecause of more low C:nitrogen (N) plant inputs and periodicmanure additions (27). The ﬁne texture of Mollisols shouldSigniﬁcanceSoil organic carbon (C) responses to agricultural manage-ment are highly uncertain, hindering our ability to assessthe C sequestration potential of croplands and developsound policies to mitigate climate change while enhancingother ecosystem services. Combining experimental evidencefrom a long-term ﬁeld experiment and a meta-analysis ofpublished literature, we show that the accrual of mineral-associated soil C in intensively managed Mollisols was onlyachieved by managing ruminant grazing on perennial grass-lands. Although modifying dominant grain-based systemswith reduced tillage, diversi ﬁed rotations, and legumes andmanure additions improve soil health metrics —which is criti-cal to soil, nutrient, and water conservation —they areunlikely to enhance persistent forms of soil C in Mollisols tohelp drawdown atmospheric C and stabilize climate.Author contributions: Y.R., R.D.J., M.F.C., C.L., and M.D.R. designed research; Y.R.performed research; Y.R., L.D., and S.W.C. contributed new reagents/analytic tools;Y.R., G.R.S., B.J.S., and L.D. analyzed data; and Y.R., R.D.J., M.F.C., G.R.S., B.J.S., L.D.,S.W.C., C.L., and M.D.R. wrote the paper.The authors declare no competing interest.This article is a PNAS Direct Submission.This article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License 4.0 (CC BY-NC-ND) .Seeonline for related content such as Commentaries.1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

However, the expected C accrual has notbeen observed consistently in ﬁeld studies (15, 29).T o investigate how agricultural management geared towardimproving soil health affect soil C accrual on Mollisols, weexplored soils from the Wisconsin Integrated Cropping SystemsT r i a l( W I C S T ) ,al o n g - t e r mﬁ e l de x p e r i m e n ti nt h eN o r t hC e n t r a lUnited States. The WICST was established in 1989 on land thatwas tallgrass prairie until late 19th century, when it was plowedand converted to annual grain and forage production throughmost of the 20th century. The WICST consists of six side-by-sideconventional and alternative cropping systems, including threecash-grain systems: 1) continuous monoculture maize (Maize) sys-tem with annual tillage, 2) no-till maize-soybean (MS) rotation,and 3) organically managed maize-soybean-wheat (MSW) rota-tion that has a legume cover crop after wheat, and three dairy for-age systems: 4) maize-alfalfa-alfalfa-alfalfa (MAAA) rotation, 5)organic maize-oats/alfalfa/alfalfa (MOA) rotation, and 6) diverse,rotationally grazed cool-season pasture (Pasture) with mixedlegumes and grasses ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1a n dT a b l eS 1 ) (30). Weexpected that systems with reduced tillage or inclusion of cover orforage crops (i.e., increased presence of living roots) wouldincrease POM-C. We also expected that systems with the incorpo-ration of low C:N legumes and livestock excreta would lead toincreased MAOM-C as a result of the higher microbial C-use efﬁ-ciency (CUE) and microbial necromass production (23, 27, 31).T o test these hypotheses, we studied the quantity and compositionof SOM and their relationships with soil microbial traits after 29 yof management. We also compiled data from published literatureaddressing the effects of various agricultural practices on the SOCcontent and distribution between POM and MAOM in Mollisolsworldwide to explore the generality of our ﬁndings at WICST .Results and DiscussionTotal and Mineral-Associated Soil C Highest under Well-ManagedPastures. Our results suggest that reducing tillage, diversifyingcrop rotations, or adding legumes or manure on these Mollisolsis unlikely to build MAOM-C and SOC, whereas managing theland as rotationally grazed, diverse pastures has the capacity todo so. SOC stocks (0 to 30 cm) were 15 to 28% greater in Pas-ture than Maize, MS, MSW , and MAAA (Fig. 1 A), similar tothe 20-y SOC change ﬁndings at WICST of Sanford et al. (29).There was no difference in POM-C, MAOM-C, or SOCbetween Maize and no-till MS. There were also no signiﬁcantdifferences in MAOM-C and N among all systems except Pas-ture, which showed 18 to 29% greater MAOM-C than all othersystems ( SI Appendix , T able S2 and Fig. 1 B). On the contrary,POM-C and N were signiﬁcantly higher in the alfalfa-based sys-tems (MOA and MAAA) compared to Maize and MS andwere greatest in Pasture (Fig. 1 Cand SI Appendix , T able S2 ),aligning with previous results of Cates et al. (14). The C:N ratioof POM was signiﬁcantly lower in the alfalfa-based systemsthan Maize and MS. Notably, the organic grain system (MSW),which had a legume cover crop and manure addition but lesstotal and belowground C input, also had greater POM-C and Nand a lower POM C:N ratio than Maize and MS (Fig. 1 CandSI Appendix , T able S2 ). The meta-analysis we conducted basedon data from 17 published articles on Mollisols of the world ( SIAppendix , T able S3 ) aligned with the results from WICST . Outof 28 paired comparisons of 1) reduced or no tillage and con-ventional tillage, 2) diversiﬁed crop rotations with legumes andmonocultures, 3) manure and synthetic fertilizers, or 4) covercrops and no cover crops, only two comparisons showed higherMAOM-C under soil health practices, whereas 26 reported nodifferences ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 and T able S3 ). Althoughtrends at deeper depths might differ from the surface layers(32), these results suggest that effects of these soil health man-agement practices on MAOM-C and total SOC on Mollisolsare typically small in intensive annual cropping systems.Incorporating Legumes and Manure in Annual Cropping SystemsEnhanced Microbial Growth But Not Microbial Necromass orMAOM.We observed no differences between Maize and no-tillMS in CUE, microbial biomass C (MBC), or the content ofamino sugars (biomarkers of microbial necromass). Alfalfa-based systems had higher microbial CUE and MBC, but nothigher microbial necromass accumulation relative to grain-based systems (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix , T able S4 ). The negativerelationship between CUE and POM C:N ( SI Appendix , T ableS5) suggested that microbial physiological potential in using Csubstrate was regulated by the C:N ratio of inputs. Low C:Nlegume and manure inputs can enhance soil microbial growthand necromass production (33). POM is largely comprised ofpartially decomposed plant polymers after initial depolymeriza-tion and serves as the major energy source for heterotrophicmicrobes in the soil (10). Our results indicate that by incorpo-rating legumes and/or manure the alfalfa-based systems canlower the C:N ratio of POM therefore stimulate microbialCUE by meeting the microbial stoichiometric demand (33).However, similar to the trend of MAOM-C, the content ofmicrobial necromass biomarkers (amino sugars) was highest inPasture, but not signiﬁcantly different across other systems(Fig. 2 C). The positive correlation between MAOM-C and thealiphatic C content of MAOM ( SI Appendix , T ables S5 and S6 )and between MAOM-C and microbial necromass ( SI Appendix ,Fig. S3 and T able S5 ) indicated that microbially derived C isthe main contributor to MAOM (21, 34). Piecewise structuralequation modeling (SEM) showed that MAOM-C was directlyrelated to the amount of microbial necromass accumulated inthe soil, but not microbial biomass or CUE ( SI Appendix , Fig.S3), indicating that adding low C:N legumes and manure toFig. 1.

SOC stor-age is the balance between formation and mineralization. WhileMAOM-C is protected through association with soil minerals, afraction of it may decompose quickly. We measured the activitiesof polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (PER), which wereproduced by soil microbes to catalyze SOM decomposition andnutrient provision (35). Higher PPO activity in MSW and MOAand higher PER activity in MOA ( SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 7 and Fig.3Aand B) indicated faster SOM decomposition in these lowfertilizer-input systems than high fertilizer-input systems and Pas-ture, suggesting that microbial necromass or MAOM may be sub-ject to quick mineralization in these systems (36, 37). Similar tomost cropped soils, these soils have very little POM, indicatingthat MAOM might be an important source of nutrients (38).MAOM is more N-enriched than POM and therefore a bettermatch for microbial stoichiometric needs (39). Once liberated afterdesorption from mineral associations, microbially derived organicmatter may be quickly mineralized to meet crop nutrient demands(40), which may be especially true for maize growing on Mollisolswhere the N demand in the peak growing season is high (41).High C:N maize residues are also more likely to induce the prim-i n go fe x t a n tS O Mb e c a u s eo fi n c r e a s e dm i c r o b i a ln u t r i e n tdemand, especially when maize is in rotation with N-rich soybeanor alfalfa which would enhance microbial growth, leading toincreased microbial population size and substrate demand in themaize phase (42). On the other hand, when tillage is used to con-trol weeds in these organically managed systems, newly formedMAOM can be exposed to microbial degradation because of soildisturbance. Although unlikely to increase SOC stock on Mollisols,incorporating legume cover and forage crops in maize/soybeandominated systems do have meaningful agronomic and environ-mental beneﬁts, including reduced synthetic fertilizer needs,improved soil health, and greater yield stability (43).Although the precise mechanisms for greater MAOM-C in Pas-ture require further research, the enhanced formation and reducedmineralization of MAOM may have contributed to the SOCaccrual under well-managed pastures relative to annual croppingsystems (Fig. 4). In diverse, rotationally grazed pastures that moreclosely resemble the structure and function of the bison-grazed tall-grass prairie compared to annual grain and dairy forage croppingsystems, continuous low C:N plant and animal inputs can promotemicrobial CUE, microbial necromass production, and MAOM for-mation (31). Lower oxidative enzyme activities in Pasture also indi-cated a slower rate of SOM decomposition in the peak growingseason when temperature and precipitation favor microbial activity.In addition to greater microbial necromass accumulation (24), thecombination of abundant, diverse root architecture, phenology, pro-duction, turnover, and exudation rates and compounds (44, 45)may be conspiring to support soil C building under diverse, peren-nial grasslands than annual crops (46). Future research shouldfocus on unraveling the plant–microbe–soil associations and associ-ated changes in root architectures and soil microstructures relatedto enhanced SOC and MAOM-C accumulation in perennial grass-lands under a range of grazing management.Fig. 2.

Incorporating lowC:N inputs may enhance POM and microbial C cycling but notlead to increases in microbial necromass and MAOM-C, possi-bly because of higher SOM mineralization. In addition toreducing erosion and nutrient loss, increasing inﬁltration andwater storage, and enhancing biodiversity (47, 48), well-managed grazed perennial grasslands have the potential tobuild persistent soil C in Mollisols making them a critical partof climate-smart agriculture.Materials and MethodsSite Description and Sampling. Established in 1990, the WICST is located atthe University of Wisconsin –Madison Agricultural Research Station(43°1704500N, 89 °2204800W, 315 m above sea level) in Arlington, WI. The soil isPlano silt loam ( ﬁne-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudoll, USDepartment of Agriculture [USDA] Soil Taxonomy) with 6% sand, 72% silt,and 22% clay. The mean annual temperature at Arlington is 6.9 °Ca n dm e a nannual precipitation is 898 mm (1981 to 2010, National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration).WICST is a randomized complete block design with four blocks, with allphases of the six cropping systems represented each year (details are shown inSI Appendix ,T a b l eS 1 ). A complete site and study description can be found inPosner et al. (30). Plots are 0.3 ha, and commercial farm-scale equipment isused for all ﬁeld work. The six cropping systems represent grain (Maize, MS,and MSW) and forage (MOA, MAAA, and Pasture) enterprises. Pastures arecomprised of cool-season grasses Timothy ( Phleum pratense L.), Kentuckybluegrass ( Poa pratensis L.), orchardgrass ( Dactylis glomerata L.), ryegrass(Lolium perenne L.), and festulolium ( ×Festulolium Asch. & Graebn.), dande-lion ( Taraxacum of ﬁcinale F.H. Wigg.), and clover ( Trifolium pratense L. and T.repens L.). Pastures are rotationally grazed by six heifers each year between 1May and 10 October for a stocking rate of ∼14 A.U. ha/C01y/C01.Maize in Maize, MS, and MAAA receives commercial fertilizer at recom-mended rates. In MSW, pelletized composted poultry manure is applied priorto maize (2.2 Mg ha/C01) and wheat (1.6 Mg ha/C01) crops, and a green manurecover crop of oats and clover is sown after wheat harvest. Dairy slurry isapplied in the fall prior to maize and ﬁrst year alfalfa seeding in MAAA andMOA systems. The Maize, MSW, MAAA, and MOA systems are chisel-plowedin the fall prior to maize planting, and MS is strip-tilled in the fall prior tomaize planting. A ﬁeld cultivator is used in the spring just prior to plantingmaize and soybeans in Maize, MSW, MAAA, and MOA. Soybeans in MS areplanted using a no-till drill. A chisel plow is also used prior to soybean plantingin MSW and alfalfa seeding in MAAA and MOA. Additional cultivation, includ-ing use of a tine weeder, a rotary hoe, and Danish tine and/or disk hiller rowcultivator for weed control, is performed as needed in maize, soybean, andwheat of MSW and MOA systems, whereas in Maize, MS, MAAA, and Pastureweeds are chemically controlled.Soil sampling was conducted in July 2018, during the peak growing seasonin the maize phase of each rotation except the rotationally grazed Pasture sys-tem. Soil samples (0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm) were collected from eight locationsin each plot using a zigzag sampling pattern (to equally sample across themaize row). A soil probe (diameter, 3.5 cm) was used to take three in-row andthree between-row soil samples at each location. Soil samples collected fromall locations ( n=48) were composited into one soil sample per plot. Sampleswere transported to the laboratory immediately, passed through a 2-mmsieve, and subsampled into two portions. One subsample was kept at 4 °Cf o rsoil microbial and enzyme assays within 1 wk, the other subsample was air-dried for physical fractionation, C and N, and spectroscopy analyses.SOM Fractionation. All soils were separated after aggregate dispersion intotwo size fractions: POM ( >53μm) and MAOM ( <53μm) by wet sieving (49).Sodium hexametaphosphate solution (80 mL) was added to 10 g of air-dried,2-mm-sieved soil and shaken for 18 h to disperse soil aggregates. MilliQ waterwas used to wash the contents through a 53- μm sieve. The two fractions thatwere separated by the sieve were dried to constant mass at 70 °C. All POM andMAOM fractions were ground to homogeneity by hand with a coffee grinder.A subsample of all homogenized samples was analyzed for C and N contenton an elemental analyzer (PDZ-Europa ANCA-GSL).MAOM Composition. We used diffuse re ﬂectance infrared Fourier transformspectroscopy analysis in the midinfrared range to characterize functionalgroups of MAOM samples (50, 51). Spectra were obtained using an X,Y Auto-sampler (Pike Technologies Inc.) coupled with a Nicolet iS50 spectrometerequipped with a diffuse re ﬂectance accessory (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁcI n c . ) .Four spectral readings were performed for each subsample using the randomoversampling motion function of the X,Y Autosampler (within a 3-mm diame-t e ro ft h es a m p l ec u p ’sc e n t r o i d )c o n ﬁgured in AutoProTM software (PikeTechnologies Inc.).

However, the oxidative loss of MAOM inducedby tillage or nutrient requirement (mostly from maize) results in a faster mineralization of MAOM. As a result, only the rotationally grazed pasture s ys-tems led to meaningful C accrual.4o f6 jPNAS Rui et al.https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2118931119 Persistent soil carbon enhanced in Mollisols by well-managed grasslands butnot annual grain or dairy forage cropping systemsDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 18, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.sample cups (5.5-mL volume and 10-mm top opening diameter), each loadedwith a subsample, dried for >48 h at 40 °C and 12 to 14% relative humidity. Allmeasurements were conducted from 4,000 to 400 cm/C01at 4 cm/C01wavenumberresolution using 24 coadded scans (52). Spectra absorbance peaks were inte-grated using the local baseline technique, as described by Demyan et al. (50)and Deiss et al. (52), and local peak areas were determined using the trianglemethod available in the “geometry ”package in R. We evaluated relative peakareas, or proportion of a speci ﬁc peak area relative to the total peak areas forthe following organic functional groups: aliphatic C-H functional group ofmethyl and methylene groups (wavenumber 3,010 to 2,800 cm/C01), aromaticC=C stretch and/or asymmetric -COO- stretch (wavenumber 1,660 to 1,580cm/C01), aromatic C =C stretch (wavenumber 1,546 to 1,520 cm/C01), and C-O inboth poly-alcoholic and ether functional groups (wavenumber 1,170 to 1,148cm/C01) (50). Our analysis focused on the aliphatic functional groups (peak 2,930cm/C01; from microbial cell components and plant wax layers) and aromatic func-tional groups (peaks 1,530 and 1,620 cm/C01; from lignin-derived products).Microbial Biomass and CUE Characterization. We estimated microbial CUE bythe13C glutamic acid tracing method. Because glutamic acid is taken up directlyinto microbial cells, this approach allows us to directly compare CUE acrosstreatments since substrate-C allocation toward enzyme pr oduction is minimized(21). Fresh soil samples (20 g dry weight) were amended in the laboratory with50μgCg/C01dry soil of 25 atom% labeled13Cg l u t a m i ca c i d( <1% total soil C)and incubated at 45% water holding capacity for 22 h at 25 °C (27). An addi-tional set of soils received only deionized H 2O to serve as controls. After incuba-tion, a 12-mL CO 2sample was collected using airtight plastic syringes for deter-mining13CO2-C respiration on a gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard Model6890)-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (PDZ-Europa Model 20-20) and MBC wasdetermined by the fumigation-extraction method with a Shimadzu TOC Ana-lyzer (Shimadzu Corp.) (53).13C incorporation in MBC was determined by an iso-tope ratio mass spectrometer (PDZ-Europa Model 20-20) after aliquots of K 2SO4extracts from both fumigated and unfumigated soils were dried at 60 °Ci nt i ncapsules. Microbial CUE was calculated as [MB13C/(MB13C+13CO2-C)×100],where MB13Ca n d13CO2-C are determined using a standard isotope mixingmodel equation and represent the amount of substrate incorporated into MBCand the substrate-C respired as CO2, respectively (27). Geyer et al. (54) demon-strated that a signi ﬁcant amount ( ∼1/3) of glutamic acid C can be released bymicrobes into the soil as microbial residues within 6 h of addition, which wouldresult in underestimation of CUE with this method, but there is no evidencethat this bias would be different across plant communities.Microbial Necromass Assay. We assayed four amino sugars by gas chromatog-raphy after their conversion to aldonitrile acetates (55) using a proceduremodiﬁed from Liang et al. (56). The procedure was based on the extraction ofsignature amino sugar biomarkers from the cell wall of microorganisms.Approximately 1 g ﬁnely ground air-dried soil samples were hydrolyzed with6 M HCl at 105 °C for 8 h to release the amino sugar monomers. After puri ﬁca-tion and derivatization, we analyzed extracts with an Agilent 6890 GC (Agi-lent Technologies) equipped with a J&W Scienti ﬁc Ultra-2 column (25 m ×0.2mm×0.33 μm) and ﬂame ionization detector. The individual amino sugarderivatives were identi ﬁed by comparing their retention time with those ofauthentic standards. Quanti ﬁcation from peak areas to mass per mass of soil(μg/g) was gained relative to the internal standard myo-inositol, which wasadded to the samples prior to puri ﬁcation. We also used the recovery standardN-methylglucamine, added before derivatization to assess the ef ﬁciency ofthe derivatization step. Muramic acid (MurA) is found in the bacterial cell wallpeptidoglycan and is not produced by eukaryotic cells (57). Equal amounts ofMurA and glucosamine (GluN) are found in bacterial peptidoglycan, but insoils GluN predominantly originates from fungal chitin rather than bacterialpeptidoglycan (57). The origin of galactosamine or mannosamine is currentlydebated (58, 59).Soil Extracellular Enzyme Assays. The hydrolytic enzymes, α-glucosidase, acidphosphatase, β-1,4-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and N-acetyl- β-D-glucosaminidase of fresh soil samples were measured ﬂuorometrically usingmethylumbelliferone-labeled substrates (60, 61). Speci ﬁcally, each equivalent of1.0 g dry mass of fresh soil was added into a 100-mL centrifuge tube, homoge-nized with 50 mL of 50-mM acetate buffer using a polytron homogenizer, thenthe mixture was poured into a round wide-mouth beaker. An additional 50 mLof acetate buffer was used to wash the centrifuge tube and poured into thesame beaker. A magnetic stirrer was used to maintain a uniform suspension. Thebuffer, sample suspension, 10- μM references and 200- μM substrates were dis-pensed into the wells of a black 96-well microplate in the volume and orderdescribed by DeForest (60). The microplates were covered and incubated in thedark at 25 °Cf o r4ha n dt h e ﬂuorescence quanti ﬁed using a microplate ﬂuo-rometer with 365-nm excitation and 450-nm emission ﬁlters (61).The non ﬂuorometric enzymes, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase (break-down of lignin and other aromatic compounds), were measured spectrophoto-metrically in the clear 96-well microplate using the substrate ofL-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine ( L-DOPA). The dispensed volume and the order of buffer, samplesuspension, 25-mM L-DOPA, and 0.3% H 2O2were the same as for the ﬂuoromet-ric enzymes (60). The microplates were covered and incubated in the dark at25°C for 20 h, and the activities were assayed by measuring the absorbance at450 nm using the microplate reader and expressed in units of μmol h/C01g/C01.Literature Data. We used the Web of Science to search for papers containingwords such as “Mollisols ”(or Chernozem, Kastanozem, and Phaeozem, basedon the World Reference Base classi ﬁcation), “soil organic matter fractions, ”“particulate organic matter, ”or“mineral-associated organic matter ”pub-lished. We selected the ﬁeld-based studies that have compared at least one“alternative practice ”with conventional practices. We chose studies that haveused aggregate dispersion and wet sieving methods to separate POM andMAOM by using the 53- μm sieve. In total, we found 17 research articles thatstudied the response of either POM or MAOM fractions of the world ’s Molli-sols. The alternative practices used in these studies include reduce or no tillagevs. conventional tillage, crop rotation vs. monoculture, adding manure vs syn-thetic fertilizers, cover crops vs. no cover crops, or a combination of these prac-tices. The experiment length lasted from 4 to 60 y. Several studies have investi-gated deeper depths, but to be able to compare with data from WICST, weextracted data only from soils within 0 to 30 cm deep. We selected the naturallog of the response ratio (alternative/conventional) as our meta-analytic effectsize as commonly used in agroecological meta-analysis.Statistical Analysis. Data including soil total organic C stock and POM-C andMAOM-C (0 to 30 cm), C and N content and their ratios of bulk soil, POM andMAOM (0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm), microbial CUE, MBC, activities of extracellu-lar enzymes, total and individual amino sugar concentrations, and C func-tional groups of MAOM were analyzed with linear mixed-effects ANOVAmodels to compare the effects of different cropping systems and depths. Weused cropping system and depth as ﬁxed effects and replicate blocks as ran-dom effect. Univariate responses including SOM fractions, microbial traits(CUE, MBC, and amino sugars), enzyme activities, and the relative stability ofMAOM were analyzed with linear mixed-effects ANOVA models to comparesystem and depth effects. The relationship between microbial traits and soilproperties was analyzed by Pearson ’s correlation analysis. All ANOVA and cor-relation analyses were performed in SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute) using PROCMIXED and PROC CORR. Signi ﬁcance for all analyses was determined atP<0.05.We also used piecewise SEM (62) to examine the direct and indirect rela-tionships between POM C, POM C:N ratio, the microbial traits, and MAOM-C.Piecewise SEM takes a local estimation approach and analyzes the compo-n e n t so ft h ep a t hd i a g r a mi n d i v i d u a l l ya sas e to fl i n e a re q u a t i o n s( 6 2 )r a t h e rthan a global estimation of parameters that best capture the observedvariance-covariance matrix (63). This allows for smaller sample sizes than aretypically required by traditional SEM. Each endogenous variable was exam-ined using a generalized linear model, specifying a Gaussian distribution. Wehypothesized that POM C and POM C:N ratio both had direct effects on micro-bial biomass, CUE, and MAOM-C. Microbial biomass and CUE, in turn haddirect effects on microbial necromass, which directly affected MAOM-C. Wealso speci ﬁed a correlation between POM C and POM C:N ratio based on aninitial correlation analysis. Analyses were conducted using the R packagepiecewiseSEM v2.1.0 (62).Data Availability.
