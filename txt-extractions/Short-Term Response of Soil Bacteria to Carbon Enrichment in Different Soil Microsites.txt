VandenkoornhuyseCNRS/Universite ´ de Rennes 1, UMR 6553 EcoBio, IFR2116/FR90 CAREN, Campus de Beaulieu,263 Avenue du Ge ´ne´ral Leclerc, 35042 Rennes Cedex, FranceReceived 8 February 2008/Accepted 5 July 2008The response of bacteria in bulk soil and earthworm casts to carbon enrichment was studied by an RNAstable-isotope probing/terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy with13C-labeled glucoseand acetate. Both the soil microsite status and the carbon enrichment selected rapidly for different activebacterial communities, which resulted in different degradation kinetics. Our study clearly illustrates the biasesthat are generated by adding C substrates to detect metabolically active bacteria in soil.Soil comprises a variety of discontinuous microhabitats withdifferent physicochemical characteristics (22). It thus sustainsan immense diversity of microorganisms (18), but less than 5%of the overall available space in soil is occupied by activemicroorganisms (17). However, zones of increased biologicalactivities deﬁned as “hot spots” are present in soils (17). Earth-worms, by subjecting the soil to bioturbation, are providers ofsuch “hot spots” (4). Whereas most soil bacteria are in a stateof dormancy (17, 20), soil bioturbation by earthworms has beenshown to increase soil bacterial activity (1) by changing thepore space as well as the soil moisture and nutrient contents (9,13, 14).Although soil is a major reservoir of organic carbon (27), theavailable carbon concentrations are low and certainly amongthe major factors limiting bacterial growth (6) and structuringthe bacterial community in soil (3). Thus, carbon amendments,generally with glucose and acetate, which are known to bemetabolized through different metabolic pathways (26), havebeen used as a tool to (i) measure the size of the microbialbiomass and its active and dormant fractions (20) or (ii) max-imize soil bacterial diversity (25). However, to date, the activemicrobial fraction that directly consumes the added C sub-strate, i.e., the primary users, has rarely been investigated.The aims of the present work were to examine the responsesof soil bacteria to glucose and acetate enrichments by discrim-inating the primary users from the total active soil bacteria byusing the RNA stable-isotope probing (SIP) strategy with13C-labeled substrates. We hypothesized that (i) different C sub-strates initiate different short-term responses of the active soilbacterial communities but (ii) the short-term response to car-bon enrichment depends also on the “hot spot” status of thesoil microsite (i.e., bulk soil or earthworm casts).Soil microcosms were (i) prepared as described previously(2, 15) with a clay-loam agricultural soil (19), (ii) inoculatedwith earthworms ( Lumbricus terrestris ), and (iii) incubated at12°C for 26 days. Earthworm casts and bulk-soil samples (thesoil not burrowed by earthworms) were sampled from soilmicrocosms (more details are given by Kersante ´ et al. [12] andMonard et al. [15]) and then stored at /H1100220°C until used.The kinetics of glucose and acetate degradation in bulk soiland casts were ﬁrst measured ( n/H110053). Five grams of soil wassuspended in 50 ml of a mineral salt medium (21) and placedat 30°C and 150 revolutions min/H110021in the presence of glucoseor sodium acetate (2.4 g of C per g of dry soil) as the sole Csubstrate. Glucose degradation was followed spectrophoto-metrically (EnzyPlus kit; Diffchamb AB), and acetate degra-dation was measured by ionic chromatography (Dionex DX120). Both substrates were rapidly consumed (Fig. 1). Glucosedegradation was faster in casts than in bulk soil (Fig. 1A).* Corresponding author.

Three milliliters of soil solution was sampledregularly after 5 to 24 h of incubation ( n/H110053) and centrifugedfor 10 min at 10,000 /H11003g, and RNA was extracted from soilpellets according to Courty et al. (P. E. Courty, M. Poletto, F.Duchaussoy, M. Bue ´e, J. Garbaye, and F. Martin, submittedfor publication). Control experiments were performed with12C-labeled substrates to check for the absence of13C-RNA.12C-RNA and13C-RNA were separated by isopycnic ultracen -trifugation and sampled as described previously (24). AfterRNA precipitation and puriﬁcation, terminal restriction frag-ment polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses were twice performedfor each soil sample: reverse transcription-PCR was carriedout using the Titan one-tube reverse transcription-PCR kit(Roche Applied Science) with the Eub_519f and Eub_1390rprimers labeled with the 6-carboxyﬂuorescein and hexa-chloroderivatives, respectively (24). Labeled PCR products were in-dependently digested with the restriction enzyme StyI or HinfI(Promega). The T-RFs were separated and accurately sizedusing an automated sequencer (model ABI3130xl; AppliedBiosystems). The T-RF sizing and diversity signature analyseswere performed using the Peak Scanner 1.0 software (AppliedBiosystems). Only the lengths of the T-RFs were taken intoaccount for data analysis, and each T-RF was coded as adiscrete variable (0 for its absence or 1 for its presence) (11).By using the RNA SIP/T-RFLP strategy, like others recently(16), we clearly showed a rapid differentiation within the activesoil bacterial communities and distinguished two selective fac-tors that interacted together.First, the active bacteria were selected differently in earth-worm casts and bulk soil with both enrichments (Fig. 2), indi-cating that soil heterogeneity sustains bacterial diversity. Thespeciﬁc richness ( S) and diversity (Shannon’s information mea-sure [ H0]) of the total active bacteria (12C-RNA) were higherin bulk soil than in casts after the addition of glucose but notafter the addition of acetate (Table 1). From the time ofingestion to the time of excretion by earthworms, ingested soilis subjected to different modiﬁcations which likely help tochange the structures of active bacterial communities; (i)earthworms feed selectively on material rich in organic matterand bacteria (7); (ii) the earthworm gut contains large quan-tities of available acid organic compounds, such as acetate,which make it an ideal habitat for the anaerobic metabolismand fermentative processes of ingested soil microorganisms (7,10); and (iii) passage through earthworm guts increases theculturability of certain microorganisms in ingested soil (7, 10).Despite the biases that might have been generated by our soilsuspension enrichment methodology (destructured soil micro-sites), differences between active bacteria in bulk soil and thosein casts were still observed, indicating that this selection factormight be even stronger than the one observed.

Parsimony analysis performed on13C-RNA demon -strated solely that the composition of the primary users wasspeciﬁc to the added C substrate (Fig. 4). Both substrate en-richments, in addition to removing trophic limitation, creatednovel environments which selected divergent bacterial commu-nities. Glucose and acetate carbon are not assimilated by thesame metabolic pathways. Glucose can be used in the glycolysispathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (26). Although glycolysis is the main path-way, some bacteria rely completely on the pentose phosphatepathway and others only on the Entner-Doudoroff pathway(26). Regarding acetate, only soil bacteria that harbor the keyenzyme isocitrate lyase involved in the glyoxylate cycle cangrow with acetate as the sole carbon source (5), although newalternative pathways of acetate assimilation have recently beendescribed (8). While glucose and acetate are readily metabo-lized, the different catabolic pathways lead to different degra-dation kinetics and involve different primary users (Fig. 1 and4). Furthermore, the highest SandH0values found in the totalactive bacteria of glucose-enriched samples indicated thatmore-diverse soil bacteria consumed glucose rather than ace-tate (Table 1).Comparison of SandH0values in12C-RNA and13C-RNArevealed differences between the acetate and glucose enrich-ments in the two soil microsites (Table 1). The glucose-con-suming bacteria were observed to be a fraction of the totalactive soil bacteria in both soil microsites. However, in theacetate-enriched casts, both the Sand the H0of the activeconsuming bacteria were higher than those of the total activesoil bacteria (Table 1) and the kinetics of acetate degradationwere also enhanced (Fig. 1B). Thus, acetate enrichment asso-ciated with the speciﬁc physicochemical properties of caststogether with the enhanced culturability of bacteria generatedby their passage through earthworm guts (7, 10) might haveactivated dormant bacteria ( Kstate, i.e., nongrowing bacteria)and/or increased poorly represented bacteria.

RNA SIP gave direct access to the ecologicalopportunistic bacteria ( rstate, i.e., growing bacteria) whichgrew immediately after substrate addition, in response to theremoval of trophic limitations. It is very clear from this studythat the carbon addition strategy is not fully adequate to studymicrobial activity or diversity.This work was supported by funding from the CNRS-INSU insti-tute to F.B. and a by grant from the council of Re ´gion Bretagne toC.M. and F.B.We thank D.
