In this topical review,we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each ofthese sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector© 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdEnviron. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alfrom 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline acrossten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHGemissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying driverswith few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low andzero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems inEurope and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables.By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuouslyexpanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floorarea, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings andtransport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion ofagriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissionsin Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the mostpersistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research andpolicy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene.1.IntroductionGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuelsand land use have continuously grown since the 19thcentury, reaching their highest ever level in 2019. TheParis Agreement in 2015 set out an ambition to limitthe global temperature increase to 1.5◦C and 2◦Cabove pre-industrial levels. Yet, on the basis of cur-rent trends in emissions, planned infrastructure, andnational policy commitments, the Paris targets are injeopardy (Höhne et al 2020 ). The time window is nar-rowing to counter these trends across all sectors andglobal regions.Global GHG emissions sources are usuallyattributed to five broad sectors, characterised bythe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Working Group III (WG3) as energy sys-tems, industry, buildings, transport, and AFOLU(agriculture, forestry and other land uses). Together,these sectors cover aspects of energy supply (energysystems), energy demand (industry, buildings andtransport), non-energy related process emissions(industry), and land-based emissions and removals(AFOLU).Each sector encounters its own challenges interms of climate change mitigation. GHG emissionsfrom energy systems are dominated by coal-poweredelectricity generation, often from a limited number ofhighly polluting units that are long-lived and polit-ically challenging to retire (Jakob et al 2020 ). Trans-port and building emissions are more diffuse andspread across many actors; they are linked to urbanform, physical infrastructures and everyday beha-viour, thus involving non-trivial technological andsocial challenges to mitigation (Creutzig et al 2015 ).Industry emissions are associated with the produc-tion of metals, chemicals, cement and other basicmaterials demanded by our economies. Many of theseprocesses are inefficient and offer a large scope forrapid emissions cuts, although some are difficult tofully mitigate (Davis et al 2018 , Rissman et al 2020 ).AFOLU emissions and removals are linked to theproduction of food, feed and timber production—aparticularly difficult sector as these are essential ser-vices, carried out by millions of actors, on a glob-ally limited area of land with multiple competingdemands (IPCC 2019 ).There have been few attempts to describe globaland regional emissions trends and drivers on a con-sistent and comprehensive sectoral basis. There isa substantive literature that compiles global emis-sions inventories for carbon dioxide (CO 2) (Grassiet al 2018 , Quéré Le et al 2018 , Friedlingstein et al2019 ), methane (CH 4) (Kirschke et al 2013 , Saunoiset al 2020 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions(Janssens-Maenhout et al 2019 , Tian et al 2020 ).There are also dedicated IPCC chapters and reportsanalysing the contributions of each sector, includ-ing energy systems (Bruckner et al 2014 ), build-ings (Lucon et al 2014 ), transport (Sims et al 2014 ),industry (Fischedick et al 2014 ) and AFOLU (Smithet al 2014 , IPCC 2019 ). And it is commonplace fornational and regional studies to analyse sectoral emis-sions trends and drivers, such as for China (Guanet al 2018 ), the US (Feng et al 2015 ), or the EU(Spencer et al 2017 ). In this study, we aim to updateand synthesise these literatures, comprehensively andconsistently covering all sources of GHG emissions,for all world regions and across all sectors, drawingfrom expertise in each area to explain key trends anddrivers. The core research questions of this review areas follows:(a)What are the recent trends in global, regional andsectoral greenhouse gas emissions?(b)What are the driving factors underlying thesetrends?In addressing these questions, we combine sev-eral elements of analysis. First, we draw from a com-prehensive GHG emissions dataset to describe recentglobal and regional trends in sector emissions. This2Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alprovides the context for an in-depth review of themain drivers underpinning sector emissions trends.We further support this review with sector specificKaya decompositions, and other relevant descriptivedata. Our aim is to provide a summary of the maintrends and challenges, sector by sector, which collect-ively shape our prospects for a rapid and deep trans-ition to avoid dangerous climate change.2.MethodsandmaterialsThis article is a literature review supported by severalelements of empirical analysis. Here we briefly sum-marise our approach to literature identification, datasources and analysis, with further details providedin the supplementary materials (available online atstacks.iop.org/ERL/16/073005/mmedia ).2.1.LiteraturesearchandinclusionThis topical review provides a targeted review ofthe literature on emission trends and their underly-ing drivers across different sectors of the economy(energy systems, industry, buildings, transport andAFOLU). Due to the broad scope and a potentiallyvery expansive literature base, we inform and focusour review in each sector with a supplementary dataanalysis on global and regional emissions trends. Thisanalysis (described in the following section) bringsforward the main and fastest growing sources ofGHG emissions in each sector, as well as the regionalprofiles of these emissions. It further identifies ongoing trends in key driving forces, elaborated in Kayadecompositions.Based on these analyses, teams of sector expertsdetermined the scope of their review, structured intocommon components across sectors. These includedrivers of global and regional demand, and factorsthat influence emissions intensity and efficiency. Werely on the deep sectoral knowledge of our sectorteams for the identification of the relevant literat-ure. We also conducted targeted keyword searcheson the Web of Science and Google Scholar platformsto inform our selection of literature. These include,for example, relevant activity data underlying sectortrends (such as trends in ‘building floor space’ percapita, ‘motorisation’ , or ‘renewable energy deploy-ment’). This focus on relevant key drivers in oursearches ensures tractability given the scope of ourreview, but we search more exhaustively with a struc-tured keyword query for Kaya literature in particular(the search string is provided in the supplementarymaterials).2.2.GlobalandregionalGHGemissionstrendsWe use the EDGAR v5.0 database to track global,regional and sectoral GHG emissions from 1990to 2018 (Crippa et al 2019 ). EDGAR includes CO 2emissions from fossil fuel combustion derived fromInternational Energy Agency data (IEA 2020c ), sup-plemented with CH 4and N 2O emissions fromsavannah burning sourced from the Food and Agri-cultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO2019 ), and CH 4and N 2O from forest and peatfires taken from the Global Fire Emissions Database(GFED v4.1s; van der Werf et al 2017 ).EDGAR does not include land-use change andmanagement CO 2emissions and removals (here-after ‘land-use CO 2’ emissions). We therefore sourcethese separately, using the average of three globalbookkeeping models (Hansis et al 2015 , Houghtonand Nassikas 2017 , Gasser et al 2020 ) in a con-vention established by the Global Carbon Project(Friedlingstein et al 2019 ). These include CO 2emis-sions from peat burning and draining from FAO andGFED.Land-use CO 2estimates follow the approachof the global modelling community, which attrib-utes anthropogenic CO 2fluxes based on underly-ing drivers, not where they occur (Friedlingsteinet al 2019 ). In other words, fluxes caused by directland-use change and land management processes areaccounted for, while fluxes driven by, e.g. indirectanthropogenic effects of changes in environmentalconditions on land not subject to modelled manage-ment activities, are excluded (Grassi et al 2018 , Jiaet al 2019 ). (Note that the latter would be includedin the AFOLU flux under UNFCCC reporting, if theyoccurred on what countries define as ‘managed land’for reporting, which is a larger area of forests thanconsidered as subject to management by the mod-els. Thus National Greenhouse gas Inventories sumto larger CO 2removals (and thus smaller net globalCO 2emissions) than the global models because of thenet effects of CO 2-fertilisation, N fertilisation and cli-mate change on the larger areas of ‘managed forests’(Grassi et al 2018 )).We use 100 year global warming potentials asupdated for the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (AR6)to facilitate comparability between the different gasesin this data set (CO 2, CH 4, N 2O and fluorinated(F-)gases). Emissions are presented as global andregional totals; the latter using a ten region splitalso developed for IPCC AR6. A list of countrieswithin each region is available in the supplementarymaterials.Consistency in the allocation of emissions andenergy use to sectors is important for our analysis.We follow the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) inallocating emissions sources from the EDGAR data-base exclusively to five overarching sectors: EnergySystems, Industry, Buildings, Transport and AFOLU.Within each sector we construct a second levelcategorisation (‘sub-sectors’) comprising groups ofstructurally similar emissions sources. An explana-tion of these categories and the detailed sector alloc-ation is available as a supplementary data file.3Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et al2.3.DirectversusindirectemissionsOur emissions estimates distinguish between twoaccounting methods: scope 1 or ‘direct’ emissions,comprising the emissions produced by owned or con-trolled sources; and scope 2, or ‘indirect’ emissions,where the emissions associated with the generation ofelectricity and heat in the energy systems sector areallocated to sectors where this energy is consumed. Ascope 2 reallocation of indirect emissions is particu-larly consequential for the buildings and industry sec-tors, where some consumed energy is produced on-site (e.g. in gas boilers), but a large fraction is alsosourced upstream from power plants via electricityconsumption.To allocate emissions from the electricity and heatsector to final sectors as indirect emissions, we useestimates provided in the CO 2emissions dataset ofthe IEA ( 2020a ). These estimates are based on indi-vidual electricity and heat specific emission factors,and assumea fixed efficiency of 90% for heat plants(in order to calculate the share of emissions associ-ated with heat versus electricity in combined heat andpower plants). Since the total emissions of the elec-tricity and heat sector in IEA differs to EDGAR, wecalculate the proportion of indirect emissions in eachfinal sector in IEA, then multiply these values usingthe EDGAR electricity and heat total.We do not consider ‘consumption-based’ emis-sions, which comprise all embodied emissionsassociated with the consumption of a product orservice. This is relevant for tracking upstream anddownstream emissions related to regional and globalsupply chain networks (Hubacek et al 2014 , Liet al2020 ), but is beyond the limits of our work.2.4.DecompositionofglobalandsectoralemissionsdriversTo support our analysis and review of the main driv-ing forces and regional differences underlying emis-sions trends, we perform a Kaya decomposition ana-lysis for each sector (Kaya 1990 ). Kaya analysis is acommon method applied across the climate mitiga-tion literature, which expresses emissions (tCO 2) asa function of population (persons), GDP (2010 US$,PPP) and energy (joules), with the respective terms F,P , G and E:F=P(G/P)(E/G)(F/E)where G/P is GDP per capita, E/G is the energyintensity of GDP and F/E is the carbon intensity ofenergy. To apply the analysis at a sector level, we usethe IEA World Energy Balances (IEA 2020c ) to isol-ate the primary energy supply for the energy sys-tems sector, and total final energy consumption forthe industry, transport, and buildings sectors. Wethen match these sectors with CO 2emissions (F)sourced from the IEA ( 2020a ). To ensure consistencyin our sector definitions—between the prior emis-sions trends analysis (which uses EDGAR data) andthis Kaya analysis (IEA data)—we rely on a detailedmapping of IEA energy sectors to EDGAR emissionssources, available in the supplementary materials.The Kaya decomposition for these four sectors isnarrower in scope than our overall estimates of GHGemissions, as it focuses only on the CO 2emissionsassociated with energy use, i.e. fossil fuel combustion.It does not include GHG emissions from cement,ceramics, landfill, land-use change and agriculture, asthese are not directly related to energy use, and thuscould not be evaluated in the same decomposition.Nor do we include indirect emissions in the decom-position. Finally, since there is no meaningful wayto allocate population and GDP data for sectors, wesimply use regional and global totals in every decom-position, using population estimates from the UnitedNations (UNDESA 2019 ) and GDP in purchasing-power parity terms from the IEA ( 2020a ), extendedwith growth rates from the IMF ( 2020 ) for the mostrecent years.The Kaya decomposition is conceptually straight-forward in the case of energy systems, industry, build-ings, and transport sectors. However, it is less appro-priate for AFOLU, where underlying activities areindirectly driven by energy use and GDP . Instead,area of land under different uses and agricultural out-put are closer proxy drivers of AFOLU emissions.We therefore substitute the terms for an AFOLUspecific decomposition, as established by Hong et al(2021 ), where AFOLU GHG emissions (tCO 2eq) isthe function of population (persons), agriculturaloutput (kcals), and agricultural land area (hectares),with the respective symbols H, P , A and L:H=P(A/P)(L/A)(H/L).A/P is agricultural output per capita, L/A is the landrequired for a unit of agricultural output, and H/Lis GHG emissions per unit of land. In this decom-position H is composed of agricultural CH 4and N 2Oemissions from EDGAR supplemented with land-useCO 2emissions from the bookkeeping models (Hansiset al 2015 , Houghton and Nassikas 2017 , Gasser et al2020 ). Due to land data constraints, this decomposi-tion misses a single year (1990–2017) relative to othersectors (1990–2018).2.5.UncertaintiesandgrowthratecalculationThere are different uncertainties associated with his-torical GHG emissions estimates. These can be tracedto uncertainties in (and a lack of) underlying activ-ity and inventory data (particularly in non-OECDcountries), the use of average emissions factors acrosscountries and fuel types, different interpretations ofoxidisation and combustion, and other assumptions(Andrew 2020 ).4Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFossil fuel combustion emissions are generallyregarded to have comparatively small uncertaintiesdue to the sophistication and standardisation of his-torical energy data reporting. By contrast, uncer-tainties are much higher for AFOLU CO 2emissionsand all other greenhouse gases. Following IPCC AR5(Blanco et al 2014 ) we assume uncertainties of ±8%for global emissions of CO 2from fossil fuel combus-tion,±20% for CH 4emissions and Fgases, ±50%for AFOLU CO 2emissions, and ±60% for N 2Oemissions.Two particular subsectors are noteworthy for hav-ing both high emissions and high uncertainties: fugit-ive CH 4emissions and land-use CO 2emissions.Regarding the former, recent studies have foundsubstantial discrepancies between nationally repor-ted GHG inventories for oil and gas fugitive emis-sions versus observational evidence of anthropogenicCH 4emissions (Alvarez et al 2018 , Weller et al 2020 ).Notably, Hmiel et al (2020 ) concluded from pre-industrial ice core14CH 4measurements that nat-ural geological sources of methane emissions are amuch smaller fraction of total atmospheric methanethan previously estimated, with a potential under-estimate of global anthropogenic CH 4emissions of25%–40%. The likely source is oil and gas infrastruc-ture leaks, which occur across the supply chain, fromextraction, processing and up to gas distribution andfinal use (Christian et al 2016 , Alvarez et al 2018 ,Weller et al 2020 ).Uncertainties around AFOLU CO 2emissionsin the latest Global Carbon Budget are around46% over 2009–2018, based on the mean and onestandard deviation of three bookkeeping models(Friedlingstein et al 2019 ). BLUE emission estim-ates (Hansis et al 2015 ) are globally higher thanthe Houghton and Nassikas (HN) ( 2017 ) model,in part driven by the explicit representation ofland-use transitions at the sub-grid scale in BLUEand the preferential allocation of pasture on nat-ural grassland in HN (Hansis et al 2015 ). Further,trends of individual datasets differ over recent years,e.g. with an upward trend in BLUE vs a down-ward trend in HN since the 2000s for land-useCO 2emissions. These different trends are at leastpartly attributable to the underlying land-use forcing(Gasser et al 2020 ). The third model, OSCAR (Gasseret al 2020 ), follows the approximate mean of BLUEand HN.We derive the growth rates of emissions trendsand Kaya factors over periods greater than one year,as follows:r=(EFF(t+n)EFF(t))1/n−1where EFFis the emissions value or Kaya factor in agiven year ( t).3.Resultsanddiscussion3.1.AllsectorsGlobal GHG emissions continued to rise between2010 and 2018, although the rate of emissions growthhas slowed since 2014 (figure 1). GHG emissionswere the highest in human history in 2018, reach-ing 58 GtCO 2eq. The largest share of emissions in2018 came from the energy systems sector (34%; 20GtCO 2eq), followed by industry (24%; 14 GtCO 2eq),AFOLU (21%; 12 GtCO 2eq), transport (14%; 8.3GtCO 2eq) and the operation of buildings (6%; 3.3Gt CO 2eq). These estimates are based on direct emis-sions produced in each sector. As we discuss below,the industry and buildings sectors further contributedto emission growth indirectly, by drawing on electri-city and heat production in the energy systems sector.GHG emissions in 2018 were about 11% (5.8GtCO 2eq) higher than GHG emission levels in2010 (52 GtCO 2eq). One third of this increase inGHG emissions between 2010 and 2018 was fromenergy systems (1.9 GtCO 2eq), followed by industry(1.8 GtCO 2eq, 30% of the increase), transport (1.2GtCO 2eq, 20%), AFOLU (0.72 GtCO 2eq, 12%) andbuildings (0.22 GtCO 2eq, 4%).In terms of regions, East Asia and North Amer-ica together accounted for 40% of global GHG emis-sions in 2018, within which emissions are dominatedby China and the United States. The highest abso-lute increase between 2010 and 2018 was in EasternAsia (2.6 GtCO 2eq), more than double the growth ofthe next highest region, Southern Asia (1.1 GtCO 2eq).Four regions—the Middle East, Africa, Eurasia andSouth-East Asia—accounted for the rest of the globalemissions increase with approximately 0.5 GtCO 2eqeach. The most rapid relative growth in emissionssince 2010 occurred in Southern Asia at 3.6% peryear, followed by the Middle East (2.6%/yr), East-ern Asia (2.4%/yr) and Eurasia (1.9%/yr). The onlyregion with a decline in emissions since 2010 has beenEurope ( −0.3 GtCO 2eq,−0.8%/yr). North Amer-ica, Latin America, and developed countries in theAsia Pacific saw only minimal growth over this period(+0.1%/yr, +0.1%/yr and +0.4%/yr, respectively).Trends by sector differ widely across regions.Developed countries in Asia Pacific, Europe andNorth America tend to have higher shares of emis-sions from energy systems, industry and transport,and lower shares from AFOLU. Overall emissionsin these regions are relatively stable, apart from theenergy systems sector in Europe and North Amer-ica, which have seen gradual reductions since 2010(−1.8%/yr and −1.5%/yr, respectively). This generalpattern is reversed in the case of Africa, Latin Amer-ica and South-East Asia. In these regions AFOLU isthe largest emitting sector (specifically: CO 2emis-sions from deforestation), yet much of the recentgrowth comes from the energy systems, industry and5Environ. Res.

Panel (b) shows regional emission trends in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018. This figure showsthe direct (scope 1) allocation of emissions to sectors.transportation sectors. Similarly, fast growing emis-sions in Eastern and Southern Asia are mainly associ-ated with the industry, energy systems and transportsectors, some at rates exceeding 4%/yr.The largest individual sub-sector contributing toglobal GHG emissions in 2018 was electricity and heatgeneration at 13.9 GtCO 2eq (24%). This subsectorcan be reallocated to consuming sectors as indirect(scope 2) emissions, thus highlighting the importanceof energy demand as a driver of global climate change(de la Rue du Can et al 2015 , Creutzig et al 2016 ,2018 ). From this perspective, the relative importanceof the industry and buildings sectors jump dramatic-ally, from 25% to 35%, and 6% to 17%, respectively(figure 2).The highest emitting subsectors after electricityand heat are ‘other industry’30, land-use change andmanagement, road transport, residential buildings,metals, chemicals, enteric fermentation (i.e. livestockrearing), non-residential buildings, oil and gas fugit-ive emissions, and the waste sector. Indirect emis-sions account for a large proportion of emissionsin some of these sectors, particularly the residen-tial and non-residential buildings subsectors (more30This broad category includes the paper and pulp sector, foodand tobacco processing, industrial sources of fluorinated gases, andother generic industries.than 50% of emissions), and the other industry,metals and chemicals subsectors (more than 20%of emissions). Among the largest sub-sectors, thefastest growing from 2010 to 2018 have been oiland gas fugitive emissions ( +2.1%), road transport(+2%), coal mining fugitive emissions ( +2%), andmetals ( +2%) (figure 3). Some of these emissionstrends, however, are marked by significant uncer-tainty (see section 2.5).Our data runs to 2018 and therefore missesthe most recent break in emissions trends resultingfrom COVID-19 induced lockdowns in 2020. Sev-eral studies have observed sharp reductions in globaldaily emissions over the course of 2020 (Le Quéréet al 2020 , Lenzen et al 2020 , Liu et al 2020c ). Thelockdowns impacted emissions in the transport sec-tor most heavily, particularly aviation, followed byelectricity and industry emissions (Le Quéré et al2020 ). Most of these reductions will be temporary,but COVID-19 may shape the driving forces of sec-toral emissions in the long run, depending on thenature of stimulus packages and associated invest-ments that are rolled out in the wake of the pandemic(Shan et al 2020 ).We now turn our attention to the underlyingfactors of emissions growth. For this purpose, wedecomposed the trends of CO 2emissions from fuelcombustion (excluding other GHGs) into several6Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure2.

Globally, affluence remained by far thestrongest upward driver, increasing almost in tandem7Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure4.

This figure is for fossil fuel CO 2emissions only, in order to ensure compatibility with underlying energy data.with energy consumption and CO 2emissions up until2015, after which some modest relative decouplingoccurred (figure 4).The main counteracting, yet insufficient, factorthat led to emissions reductions was decreased energyuse per unit of GDP in almost all regions ( −2.1%globally). These reductions in energy intensity are aresult of technological innovation, regulation, struc-tural change and increased economic efficiency (Yaoet al 2015 , Sanchez and Stern 2016 , Chang et al 2019 ,Dong et al 2019 , Liu et al 2019 , Marin and Mazzanti2019 , Mohmmed et al 2019 , Stern 2019 , Wang et al2019b , Goldemberg 2020 ). The decades-long trendthat efficiency gains were outpaced by an increase inworldwide affluence continued unabated in the last10 years (Haberl et al 2020 , Wiedenhofer et al 2020 ,Wiedmann et al 2020 ). Therefore, GHG emissionsonly show relative, not absolute, decoupling fromGDP at the global level (Deutch 2017 , Wood et al2018 ). In addition, the emissions-reducing effects ofenergy efficiency improvements are diminished bythe energy rebound effect, which has been found inseveral studies to significantly offset some energy sav-ings (Rausch and Schwerin 2018 , Bruns et al 2019 ,Stern 2020 ).A significant decarbonisation of the energy sys-tem was only noticeable in North America, Europeand Eurasia. Globally, the amount of CO 2per unit ofenergy used has remained practically unchanged overthe last three decades, as the rapid growth of renew-able energy in some regions has been matched bynew fossil plants in others (Chang et al 2019 , Jacksonet al 2019 , Peters et al 2020 ). Population growth hasalso remained a persistent upward driver in almost allregions (figure 4).Global economic growth as the main driverof GHG emissions plays out particularly strong inChina and India (Liu et al 2019 , Ortega-Ruiz et al2020 , Yang et al 2020 , Zheng et al 2020 , Wang et al2020b ), although both countries show signs of relative8Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure5. Global and regional GHG emissions trends for the energy sector. Panel (a) shows total global energy systems GHGemissions divided into major subsectors. Panel (b) shows regional emission trends in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018. Thisfigure shows the direct (scope 1) allocation of emissions to sectors. Note that emissions from the electricity and heat subsector areallocated as indirect (scope 2) emissions to the buildings, industry and transport sectors in the following sections (thus doublecounting between these respective sector figures).decoupling because of structural changes (Marin andMazzanti 2019 ). A change in China’s productionstructure and consumption patterns (i.e. the type ofgoods and services consumed) have become the mainmoderating factors of emissions after 2010, while eco-nomic growth, consumption levels and investmentremain the dominating factors driving up emissions(Jiborn et al 2020 , Zheng et al 2020 ). In India lowemission efficiency and expansion of production andtrade caused the growth of emissions (Wang andZhou 2020 ).There are pronounced differences both in recentchanges in the absolute levels and drivers of GHGemissions when differentiating countries by incomelevels (Dong et al 2019 ) or by regions (Changet al 2019 ). In high-income countries, significantimprovements in energy intensity led to declin-ing CO 2emissions between 2010 and 2015, despiteincreasing income levels and populations (Dong et al2019 ). In upper middle-income and lower middle-income countries, rising income more than offsetany energy structural or intensity gains, leading toincreased emissions. And CO 2emissions increasedthe most in low-income countries, due to signific-ant increases in carbon intensities, income levels andpopulation (Dong et al 2019 ). Importantly, some ofthese trends are partially related to shifts in globalsupply chains, where some production emissionscould also be allocated to final consumers under aso-called consumption-based perspective, mostly inhigh- and middle-income countries (an issue we donot address in this article) (Peters et al 2011 ).3.2.EnergysystemsOverall, energy systems make up the largest share ofthe five sectors, with 34% of total global GHG emis-sions (although electricity and heat emissions can alsobe reallocated to demand sectors, particularly build-ings and industry). GHG emissions in the energy sec-tor grew to 20 GtCO 2eq in 2018, with the strongestgrowth occurring between 2000 and 2010 (2.9% peryear) and slowing down to 1.3% growth per yearbetween 2010 and 2018 (figure 5).Most energy systems emissions are associatedwith the power sector, i.e. coal, gas and other plantsthat produce electricity and heat. These accountedfor 71% of the total (14 GtCO 2eq) in 2018. Fugitiveemissions from oil and gas production (2.5 GtCO 2eq)and coal mining (1.3 GtCO 2eq) account for thesecond and third largest contributions. The overallgrowth of the energy systems sector between 2010 and2018 ( +1.9 GtCO 2eq) can be mainly attributed to9Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure6. Kaya decomposition of CO 2emissions drivers for the energy systems sector. The indicated growth rates are averagedacross the years 2010–2018. Note that the energy term by itself is not part of the decomposition, but is depicted here forcomparison with the Kaya factors. This figure is for fossil fuel CO 2emissions only, in order to ensure compatibility withunderlying energy data.electricity and heat ( +1.2 GtCO 2eq, 62% of growth),followed by oil and gas ( +0.37 GtCO 2eq, 19% ofgrowth) and coal mining (0.18 GtCO 2eq, 9% ofgrowth) fugitive emissions.On a regional basis, East Asia stands out as thelargest contributor to energy systems emissions in2018 (6.3 GtCO 2eq) and with the largest absolutegrowth from 2010 to 2018 ( +1.2 GtCO 2eq), aver-aging 2.6% per year. North America (2.8 GtCO 2eq)is the second highest emitter, followed by Eurasia(1.8 GtCO 2eq) and Europe (1.7 GtCO 2eq). Of these,only Eurasia has grown in emissions ( +0.1 GtCO 2eq,0.6%/yr), while Europe and North America have seenslight declines over the last decade ( −1.8%/yr and−1.5%/yr, respectively, leading to −0.27 GtCO 2eqand−0.35 GtCO 2eq reductions). Southern Asia,South-East Asia and the Middle East are not amongstthe largest absolute contributors, but they exhibitthe largest annual growth rates of 4.9%, 4.3% and3.3% respectively between 2010 and 2018. Africa,Asia-Pacific Developed and Latin America have seenonly modest growth at or below 1% per year. Elec-tricity and heat is currently the dominant sourceof GHG emissions from energy systems in variousregions of the world, representing more than 50%of emissions in most and reaching as high as 80%in Southern Asia and East Asia. However, in somecountries and regions fugitive emissions from oil andgas and coal production figure more prominently,such as in the Middle East (39% of energy systemsemissions), Africa (31%), Latin America (25%) andEurasia (24%).At the global level, growth in CO 2emissionsfrom energy systems have closely tracked rising GDPper capita (figure 6), affirming the substantial lit-erature describing the mutual relationships betweenenergy, electricity demand, exergy and economicgrowth (Khanna and Rao 2009 , Stern 2011 , Haberl10Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure7. The fossil share of electricity and heat production by region in selected years. Regional shares of fossil fuels in theelectricity and heat sector are weighted by total electricity and heat output. Data from the IEA World Energy Balances (IEA 2020c ).et al 2020 , Wiedenhofer et al 2020 ). This relationshiphas played out strongly in developing regions, partic-ularly in Asia, where a massive scale up of energy sup-ply has accompanied economic growth—with aver-age annual increases of energy demand between 3.5%and 4.8% in the past decade (figure 6). (We coverthese drivers of electricity demand in the industryand building sectors). The key downward driver hasbeen declining energy intensities in almost all regions,associated with ongoing improvements in genera-tion and transmission efficiency. Carbon intensitiesof energy supply have had a neutral effect, remain-ing globally stable since the 1990s, albeit with regionalvariations.On the energy production side, almost all regionshave seen steady decreases in energy intensities, at aglobal average of −2.1% per year since 2010, and at asimilar steady pace in most individual regions albeitat varying rates. Technology benchmarking studiesshow that power generation efficiencies vary widelybetween (and also within) regions—generally higherin Europe, Japan and the United states, and lowerin Russia, China, India and Australia (Maruyamaand Eckelman 2009 , Oda et al 2012 ). In the caseof coal these differences are mainly driven by fuelqualities (e.g. lignite vs black coal) and the level ofplant thermal efficiency (subcritical vs supercriticalvs combined heat and power plants). Since newlydeployed plants have higher efficiencies and olderinefficient plants are steadily retired or retrofitted—particularly following concerted policy efforts, as isthe case in China—the electricity output for a givenquantity of fuel tends to improve over time, henceleading to an aggregate energy intensity improvement(Liet al 2020 ).Improvements in carbon intensity can be decom-posed into two distinct drivers: fossil intensity (theemissions intensity of fossil fuels) and fossil share (thesubstitution of fossil fuels by renewables) (Peters et al2017 ). In the United States fossil intensity improve-ments have had a larger overall effect since 2006,due to a widespread coal to gas switch driven bylow gas prices following a shale gas boom, and fed-eral tax credit incentives (Peters et al 2017 ,2020 ,Feng 2019 , Mohlin et al 2019 ). Nonetheless, the over-all share of fossil fuels in electricity production hasalso recently declined in North America (from 66%in 2010 to 59% in 2018; figure 7), with renewablecapacity expanding rapidly in Texas, California andacross the Midwest (Mohlin et al 2019 ). Decliningfossil intensities associated with a coal to gas switchalso drove down emissions in Europe in the early2000s (Rodrigues et al 2020 ). But since 2007, Europe’scarbon intensity improvements have instead beendriven the steady expansion of renewables in theshare of electricity generation (Peters et al 2017 ,2020 ,Le Quéré et al 2019 , Rodrigues et al 2020 ), with afossil share decrease of 57% in 2010 to 47% in 2018(figure 7). Some studies attribute these effects to cli-mate policies, such as the carbon floor price in theUK, the EU emissions trading scheme, and gener-ous renewable energy subsidies across the continent(Dyrstad et al 2019 , Wang et al 2020a ). Asia-PacificDeveloped stands out in contrast to other developedregions, with a dramatic increase of regional carbonintensity and fossil share since 2010. This was dueto the ramp up of coal and gas capacity in Japanfollowing the Fukushima nuclear accident (Khare-cha and Sato 2019 ). Generally, the use of naturalgas for electricity production is growing strongly in11Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et almost countries and gas has contributed to the largestincrease in global fossil CO 2emissions in recent years(Jackson et al 2019 , Peters et al 2020 ).Steady or increasing carbon intensities can beobserved in most other regions, indicating fur-ther deepening of fossil fuel based energy systemsworldwide (figure 6). A major driver of these trendsis the global ‘renaissance of coal’ that started inthe 1990s, primarily driven by a huge increase ofcoal generation capacity in China (Steckel et al 2015 ,Jiang and Guan 2016 ). The growth of coal emis-sions slowed after 2010, primarily due to a slow-down of economic growth and fewer coal capacityadditions in China, and even declined between 2011and 2018 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 , Peters et al 2020 ).Discussions of a global ‘peak coal’ , however, maybe premature, as further growth was observed in2019 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 , Peters et al 2020 ). Inaddition, the renaissance has not been limited toChina alone, with large ongoing and planned capacityincreases in India, Turkey, Indonesia, Vietnam, SouthAfrica and others (UNEP 2017 , Edenhofer et al 2018 ,Steckel et al 2020 ).The declining competitiveness of coal-based gen-eration relative to alternatives, particularly solar PV,as well as its short-term health and environmentalimpacts, begs the question why many countries havecontinued to invest in coal capacity (Creutzig et al2017 , Lelieveld et al 2019 , Rauner et al 2020 ). His-torically, coal powered generation has been perceivedas a relatively low-cost, stable, and technologicallyaccessible option to expand grid electricity and meetgrowing consumption demands. As private and pub-lic utilities have invested in these technologies theylocked-in technological pathways and shaped institu-tional environments (e.g. supportive financial, legaland political structures) that increase the costs oftransitioning to alternatives. Recent studies show thatincumbent energy utilities have only in rare excep-tions transitioned a sizable share of their portfoliostowards renewable energy (Alova 2020 , Green et al2020 ). It is rather new actors and interests drivingthese investments, often against considerable opposi-tion and backlash from interest groups, particularlyif implemented policies do succeed in scaling uprenewable technologies (Moe 2015 , Stokes and Breetz2018 ). Fossil-based development pathways may alsobe chosen to meet the narrow goals of national andinternational interest groups, such as rent extractionor energy independence, and are shaped by issuessuch as lobbying, political ideology, and corruption(Dorband et al 2020 , Jakob et al 2020 , Lamb andMinx 2020 , Roy and Schaffartzik 2021 ).Overall, global energy system emissions growthhas slowed in recent years, due to a reduction offossil capacity additions in China, a structural shiftto gas and renewables in the United States (Feng et al2016 ), and the increasing penetration of renewablesin Europe. The worldwide share of fossil fuels shrankslowly, down from 73% in 1990 to 68% in 2018. Des-pite this, global oil and gas use is still growing (Jacksonet al 2019 ). The switch of coal to gas brings the riskof increased CH 4emissions from fugitive sources, aswell as large cumulative emissions over the lifetime ofthe new plants that may erase early carbon intensityreductions (Shearer et al 2020 ). The focus of decar-bonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needsto be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources andactively phasing out all fossil fuels, rather than relyingon the short-lived effects of fuel switching (Jacksonet al 2019 , Peters et al 2020 ).3.3.IndustryDirect and indirect GHG emissions in the industrysector steadily increased to 20.1 GtCO 2eq in 2018.Based on direct emissions alone, the industry sec-tor is the second largest contributor to total emis-sions in 2018 (25%), following energy systems. Whenindirect emissions from electricity and heat pro-duction are included, industry becomes the singlehighest emitting sector (35%). In addition, industryhas a steadily increasing share of all direct emis-sions since 1990 and faces non-trivial technolo-gical bottlenecks to mitigation, particularly in steeland cement process emissions, making it a keysector that will shape global mitigation prospectsgoing forward (Davis et al 2018 , Crippa et al 2019 ,Rissman et al 2020 ).Apart from indirect emissions from the powersector (5.9 GtCO 2eq, 30% of total), industry emis-sions in 2018 are largely driven by ‘other industry’(4.5 GtCO 2eq, 23% of total). ‘Other industry’ com-prises a multitude of emissions sources associatedwith the manufacture of pulp and paper, food andtobacco, glass and ceramics, and other generic man-ufacturing. It also includes the production and use offluorinated gases for solvents, refrigerants and elec-trical equipment. Three further subsectors accountfor basic materials production: metals (3.1 GtCO 2eq,15% of total), chemicals (2.8 GtCO 2eq, 14% of total)and cement (1.6 GtCO 2eq, 8% of total). Finally, waste(2.1 GtCO 2eq, 11% of total) includes the emissionsfrom incineration and waste disposal on land, as wellas industrial, domestic and commercial wastewaterprocessing.The main period of industry emissions growthoccurred between 2000 and 2010, which saw a totalincrease of 5.5 GtCO 2eq (+3.8%/yr). Growth hassubsequently slowed down to 1.6% per year sincethen, with an approximately proportionate contribu-tion from each subsector. At a regional level, EasternAsia stands out as the main source of global industryemissions (8.7 GtCO 2eq in 2018, 43% of total), aswell as the primary driver of growth since 2010 ( +1.3GtCO 2eq, 2%/yr). At the same time, industry emis-sions remained high in Europe (2 GtCO 2eq in 2018),but have slowly declined at a rate of −0.7%/yr. NorthAmerica, Asia-Pacific Developed and Latin America12Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure8. Global and regional GHG emissions trends for the industry sector. Panel (a) shows total global industry GHG emissionsdivided into major subsectors. Panel (b) shows regional emission trends in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018. Indirectemissions from the electricity and heat subsector are shown here in grey.have had stable industry emissions since 2010 (at1.9, 0.8 and 1.1 GtCO 2eq each). In all other regionsthey are growing—most rapidly in Southern Asia(+4.3%/yr to 1.8 GtCO 2eq in 2018), South-East Asia(+3.4%/yr to 0.9 GtCO 2eq) and Eurasia ( +2.5%/yrto 1.3 GtCO 2eq).Regions differ somewhat in their composition ofdifferent subsectors, with waste and cement featur-ing more heavily in developing regions like Africa,Southern Asia and Latin America, while chemic-als and other industry play a larger role in Europeand North America. Emissions from metal produc-tion take place primarily in East Asia (1.8 GtCO 2eq),followed by Southern Asia (0.33 GtCO 2eq), Eurasia(0.28 GtCO 2eq) and Europe (0.22 GtCO 2eq).The main global driver of industry emissions hasbeen the massive rise in demand for basic materials,construction minerals and manufactured products.These are in turn driven by rising affluence andconsumption, as well as an increase in urban pop-ulations and associated infrastructure development(Krausmann et al 2017 ,2018 ). Similar to the energysector, the industry sector generates products that areindirectly used in final sectors—namely the mater-ials that make up the manufactured capital of thephysical economy, such as cement, chemicals, steel,aluminium, wood, paper, plastics, lubricants, fertil-isers, and so on. These materials are used to build andmaintain stocks of manufactured capital, includingbuildings, roads, vehicles, electronics, and machinery(also known as ‘material stocks’; Krausmann et al2017 ). Material stocks, which will remain in useover decadal time periods, reached 928 Gt in 2014,with a growth of 3.9% per year since 2010 and a26-fold increase since 1900 (Wiedenhofer et al 2019 ).Alone, their production and use accounted for 11GtCO 2eq of global emissions in 2011, according toHertwich ( 2021 ).There is strong evidence that the growth of con-crete, steel and other construction material use istightly coupled to economic growth, urbanisation,and associated infrastructure development (Pauliuket al 2013 , Cao et al 2017 , Krausmann et al 2017 ,Plank et al 2018 , Haberl et al 2020 ). Per-capita stocksof cement and steel show a typical pattern ofrapid take-off as countries urbanise and industrial-ise, before slowing down to low growth at high levelsof GDP . Selected wealthy countries even seem to sta-bilise at high per-capita levels of stocks, although itis unclear if these stabilisations persist and if theyresult in significant absolute reductions of mater-ial use (Liu et al 2013 , Pauliuk et al 2013 , Fishmanet al 2016 , Cao et al 2017 ). Hence, in countries thatare recently industrialising and urbanising—i.e. East-ern, Southern and South-Eastern Asia—we observe aparticularly strong increase of emissions from these13Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alsubsectors (figure 8) and a strong overall relationshipbetween GDP growth and industrial CO 2emissions(figure 9).Once buildings, roads, ports, vehicles and otherphysical stocks have been constructed, a continu-ous throughput of material flows is still requiredto maintain, renovate, replace and operate them(Wiedenhofer et al 2015 , Krausmann et al 2017 ).Material consumption in wealthier countries there-fore has shown only limited rates of decrease, eventhough their large existing and only slowly growingstocks open up (as yet unexploited) opportunities forprolonging lifetimes and improving end of life recyc-ling, so as to achieve absolute reductions in extrac-tion activities (Krausmann et al 2017 , Zink and Geyer2017 ). For a given level of economic development,material stock levels and associated material use alsovaries due a variety of contextual factors, such asdifferences in prevailing construction methods andbuilding codes (e.g. steel vs timber framing), patternsof urbanisation and infrastructure development (e.g.compact cities vs sprawl), trends in dwelling spaceand cars per capita, and the overall lifetimes of build-ings and infrastructure (Lin et al 2016 , Hertwich et al2019 , Lanau et al 2019 ).As with the AFOLU sector, industrial emis-sions are strongly linked to international trade.Materials, especially metals, chemicals, plastics andwood products, are routinely transported betweendifferent stages of extraction, refining and pro-duction along global supply chains (Schaffartziket al 2016 , Plank et al 2018 ). Owing to a seriesof socio-economic conditions including low pricedlabour, state-led industrial policy and agglomera-tion effects, China currently dominates global indus-trial production, particularly in the manufacture ofsteel and other basic materials (Reck et al 2010 ,Wang et al 2019a ). The global shift of energy-intensive industries away from historical centres inthe United States and Europe to developing regionsexplains, to some extent, reductions of industryGHG emissions in the former—even though theycontinue to consume manufactured products viatrade.On the production side, improvements in theenergy efficiency of material extraction, processingand manufacturing have reduced industrial energyuse per unit of output (Wang et al 2019a ; figure 9).These measures, alongside improved material substi-tution, light-weight designs, extended product andservicing lifetimes, improved service efficiency andincreased reuse and recycling could enable substan-tial emissions reductions in the future (Hertwich et al2019 ). Switching to lower or zero carbon feedstocksand power further leads to industry sector decarbon-isation. Indeed, figure 9shows that the ratio of indus-trial energy use to GDP has steadily declined since2010 in all regions. Absent these improvements inenergy intensity, growth of population and GDP percapita would have driven industrial CO 2emissionsto rise by more than 100% by 2017 compared with1990s, instead of 56%. Nonetheless, many studiespoint to deep regional differences in efficiency levelsand large globally unexploited potentials to improveindustrial energy efficiency by adopting best avail-able technologies and practices for metal, cement andchemical production (Gutowski et al 2013 , Schulzeet al 2016 , Gonzalez Hernandez et al 2018 , Talaei et al2018 ). Yet, decarbonising process emissions by tech-nological improvements alone is unlikely to outweighgrowing demand, calling for additional demand-side mitigation options to curb emissions from theindustry sector (Creutzig et al 2016 ).Overall, demand for services driven by globalaffluence and population growth have led to anescalation of material use and associated industryGHG emissions. Recent growth has been driven byemerging economies, but also high-income coun-tries where direct and indirect consumption remainshigh. The growing complexity of international supplychains makes governance hard and problem-shiftinglikely. Historically, energy efficiency provided thelargest mitigation wedge, but still failed to preventGHG emissions from increasing. Furthermore, effi-ciency potentials will decrease in the coming dec-ades as technological options are exhausted. This putsincreasing focus on historically weak drivers of decar-bonisation, such as demand management in end-use sectors (i.e. more efficient delivery of services),material efficiency (product lightweighting, longerlifetimes, use of secondary materials), fuel switchingand electrification, and the decarbonisation of powerand feedstocks (IRP 2020 ).3.4.BuildingsGlobal GHG emissions from the buildings sectorreached 9.8 GtCO 2eq in 2018, of which 66% (6.5GtCO 2eq) were upstream emissions from powergeneration and commercial heat (figure 10). Theremaining 34% (3.4 GtCO 2eq) of emissions were dir-ectly produced in buildings, for instance by gas andcoal boilers, and cooking and lighting devices thatburn kerosene, biomass and other fuels. Residen-tial buildings accounted for the majority of this sec-tor’s emissions (64%, 6.3 GtCO 2eq, including bothdirect and indirect emissions), followed by non-residential buildings (35%, 3.5 GtCO 2eq). Some non-CO 2sources (CH 4and N 2O) also contribute to build-ing emissions, but these are almost negligible (0.03GtCO 2eq) compared to other subsectors.The buildings sector accounts for almost 6% ofall direct GHG emissions and 17% when indirect‘scope 2’ emissions are included. Yet further emis-sions components could also be attributed to thissector under alternative accounting schemes, suchas consumption-based emissions footprints. Embod-ied GHG emissions associated with building mater-ials and components, as well as the construction,14Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure9.

This figure is for fossil fuel CO 2emissions only (indirect CO 2emissions and process-relatedand waste emissions are excluded) in order to ensure compatibility with underlying energy data.assembly and maintenance of buildings, make upan estimated additional 11% of global energy andprocess-related CO 2emissions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al2020 ). Adding these to the building sector wouldfurther increase emissions by approximately 2.21GtCO 2eq in 2018 (IEA 2020d ).The buildings sector contributed 0.7 GtCO 2eqto global emissions growth between 2010 and 2018,an increase of 0.9% per year, which was relativelylower than prior decades where growth rates aver-aged between 1.7%/yr and 2.1%/yr (figure 10). Amore than proportional amount of growth camefrom the residential (direct and indirect) subsector(+0.5 GtCO 2eq, 76% of growth), compared to non-residential buildings.The developed regions of North America, Europe,and Asia-Pacific Developed together accounted for41% (4 GtCO 2eq) of global building emissions in2018. In all three regions emissions declined over theperiod 2010–2018, at rates of −2.2%/yr, −2.5%/yrand−0.4%/yr, respectively. In the case of NorthAmerica, almost all of the reduction (99%) was fromindirect emissions (i.e. the energy systems sector);while in Europe at least one-third (35%) also camefrom decarbonisation in direct residential buildingemissions.The regions of the global South and Eurasiatogether accounted for 59% (5.9 GtCO 2eq) of globalbuildings emissions in 2018. Starting from a muchlower base, buildings emissions increased signific-antly in these regions between 2010 and 2018, at ratesof 4.9%/yr in Eastern Asia, 4.8%/yr in Southern Asia,4.3%/yr South-East Asia, 3.1%/yr in Africa, 1.7%/yrin the Middle East, 1.2%/yr in Latin America and0.5%/yr in Eurasia. Indirect emissions tended to growfaster than direct emissions, accounting for 80% ofgrowth in Eastern Asia, 75% in Southern Asia and92% SE Asia. This again underlines the close link15Environ. Res.

Panel (b) shows regional emission trends in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018.Indirect emissions from the electricity and heat subsector are shown here in grey.between the buildings sector and energy systems—which over the past decades has tended towards theexpansion of fossil-based electricity generation inthese regions (section 3.2).Population and GDP per capita growth are broaddrivers of building emissions trends (figure 11),which manifest more specifically in a growingdemand for building stock, floor space per capita,and building energy services as countries developand urbanise (Ürge-Vorsatz et al 2015 ). At the sametime, declines in carbon and energy intensities can beobserved both globally and regionally over the pastdecades (figure 11), hinting at the impact of steadilyimproving efficiencies and shifts in the compositionof fuels used in buildings (Ürge-Vorsatz et al 2020 ).Changes in the upstream power sector also figurestrongly as drivers of indirect building emissions (butare not included in figure 11).The global stock of residential and non-residentialbuildings has been steadily growing over the past dec-ades, driving a huge demand for building energy useand construction materials (Deetman et al 2020 ).Global building stock was estimated at almost200 billion m2of floor space in 2018, more thandouble of what it was in 1990 (IEA 2020d ). Chinacurrently dominates total new additions to build-ing stock, with urban residential buildings almosttripling since 1990 (Huo et al 2019 , Marinova et al2020 , IEA 2020d ). The same occurred in SouthernAsia, South-East Asia and developing pacific while ithas doubled in the developed world, Eurasia, LatinAmerica and Caribbean as well as Africa and theMiddle East (IEA 2020d ).As countries increase in wealth, developerstend to construct larger properties and more floorspace is required to service growing demand in theretail, office and hotel sectors (Daioglou et al 2012 ,Deetman et al 2020 ). At the same time, patterns ofurbanisation and sprawl further shape the densityand overall scale of a country’s building stock. In theUnited States, the stock of floor space in single andmulti-family homes has continuously grown over the21st century, increasing tenfold between 1890 and2010 (Moura et al 2015 ).Beyond population and wealth, demographic andsocial factors drive a cross-national trend of increas-ing floor space per capita. As populations age anddecrease in fertility, and as individuals seek greaterprivacy and autonomy, households decline in size(Ellsworth-Krebs 2020 ). At the same time, a lack of1–2 bed dwellings and the tendency for developersto construct larger family-sized properties may leadto over occupancy (Huebner and Shipworth 2017 ).Together these factors lead to increased floor spaceper capita, even as populations stabilise (figure 12).Overall, there remains a stark but converging divide in16Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure11. Kaya decomposition of CO 2emissions drivers for the buildings sector (direct emissions only). The indicated growthrates are averaged across the years 2010–2018. Note that the energy term by itself is not part of the decomposition, but is depictedhere for comparison with the Kaya factors. This figure is for fossil fuel CO 2emissions only (indirect CO 2emissions are excluded)in order to ensure compatibility with underlying energy data.global residential floor space, driven by differences inhousehold and dwelling size—from an upper range of40–60 m2per person in Western European and NorthAmerican countries, to approximately 32 m2in Chinaand 20 m2in Mexico (Nie and Kemp 2014 ; figure 12).Increasing floor space per capita is a key driver forbuilding sector emissions, because building charac-teristics such as size and type, rather than occupantbehaviour, tend to explain the majority of energy usewithin dwellings (Guerra Santin et al 2009 , Huebnerand Shipworth 2017 ). Smaller household sizes res-ult in increased per-capita appliance and equipmentownership (i.e. fewer people share appliances such asfridges and cookers), while larger homes increase thesurface area to be illuminated and maintained at com-fortable temperatures (Ürge-Vorsatz et al 2015 ).Energy activity levels further drive regionaldifferences. In Eurasia, Europe and North Amer-ica, thermal demands for space heating dominatebuilding energy use, at 66%, 62% and 48% of res-idential energy demand, respectively (IEA 2020d ).In contrast, cooking has a much higher share ofbuilding energy use in regions of the Global South,including China (Cao et al 2016 , Serrano et al 2017 ).And despite temperatures being on average warmerin the Global South, electricity use for cooling is amore prominent factor in the Global North (Waiteet al 2017 ). This situation is changing, however, asrapid income growth and demographic changes inthe global South enable households to heat and cooltheir homes (Ürge-Vorsatz et al 2015 ,2020 ). Cool-ing energy demand represented 8% out of total res-idential energy demand in North America and theMiddle East in 2018 (IEA 2020d ). It was 3%–4%in Eastern Asia, Latin America and the rest of Asia(growing from less than 1% in 2010) and remainedbelow 1% in Europe, Eurasia and Africa in 2018(IEA 2020d ). Annual variations in temperatures and17Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure12. Residential floor space per capita versus income. Data from the IEA Energy Efficiency Indicators database (IEA 2020d ).All countries trend from the left (2000) to the right (2017).extreme weather are also important drivers of overalldemand (Idahosa et al 2017 , Eggimann et al 2020 ).Energy demand for small and connected devicesand appliances is one of the emerging trends in resid-ential buildings. The highest shares of energy demandfor small and connected devices were observed indeveloped Asia-Pacific, with 24% out of total energydemand in residential buildings, followed by 15% inNorth America, and 13% in Middle East countries(IEA 2020d ).Steady improvements in building energy intens-ities across regions can be attributed to policies andbaseline improvements in building fabrics, appli-ance efficiencies, and fuel shifts. Many countrieshave adopted a mix of relevant policies, such asenergy labelling, building energy codes and mandat-ory energy performance requirements (Nie and Kemp2014 , Nejat et al 2015 ). Efforts towards buildingsrefurbishments and retrofits have also been pursuedin several nations, especially for historical buildingsin Europe, but evidence suggests that the recent ratesof retrofits have not made a significant dent on emis-sions (Corrado and Ballarini 2016 , Kerr and Winskel2020 ). Green building retrofit policies in China toohave been relatively ineffective to date (Liu et al 2020a ,2020b ). Still, one major global factor driving downenergy intensities has been the global transition frominefficient coal and biomass use in buildings for heat-ing and cooking, towards natural gas and electricity,in part led by concerted policy action in Asian coun-tries (Ürge-Vorsatz et al 2015 , Kerimray et al 2017 ,Thoday et al 2018 ).Overall, emissions from the building sector areexpected to continue rising, especially in much ofthe Global South as housing gaps are filled anddemand for floor area increases. As developing coun-tries construct new buildings, there is much poten-tial to reduce and use less carbon-intensive buildingmaterials, and to adopt building designs and stand-ards that lower life cycle buildings energy use andallow for passive comfort. A significant shift from theuse of solid heating and cooking fuels to gas and elec-tricity in recent years is a trend that will continue andhelp reduce emissions. However, increasing appliancepenetration in regions just gaining access to electri-city will increase electricity related emissions fromthe building sector, unless accompanied by improvedstandards, labelling, and the decarbonisation of theelectricity sector. Within the Global North, signific-ant untapped potential for increasing heating, build-ing fabric and material efficiency exists, as do behavi-oural shifts towards low-carbon lifestyles.3.5.TransportGlobal transport GHG emissions reached 8.5GtCO 2eq in 2018 and accounted for 14% of all dir-ect and indirect emissions. Road transport passengerand freight emissions represent by far the largest com-ponent and source of this growth (6.1 GtCO 2eq, 73%of total sector emissions), followed by internationalshipping (0.7 GtCO 2eq, 8%) and international avi-ation (0.6 GtCO 2eq, 7%). National plus internationalshipping and aviation emissions together account for1.8 GtCO 2eq or 21% of the sector total. Emissionsfrom rail, indirect N 2O emissions, and indirect CO 2emissions from electricity and heat (e.g. from theelectrification of rail and bus transport) are relativelysmall, totalling 0.5 GtCO 2eq or 6% of the currenttransport total.18Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure13. Global and regional GHG emissions trends for the transport sector. Panel (b) shows emissions at the years 1990, 2000,2010, and 2018. Indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumed in transport are shown here, but are not added to thetransport sector totals in figure 1(total emissions for all sectors). International aviation and shipping is included in panel(a), but excluded from panel (b).Since 1990, global transport emissions havegrown at a constant rate of about 2% per year.The road subsector accounted for most growthsince 2010 ( +0.9 GtCO 2eq, at 1.9% per year), butinland shipping, domestic aviation and internationalaviation were the fastest growing subsectors at+3.2%/yr, +2.8%/yr and +2.7%/yr, respectively.North America, Europe and Eastern Asia stand outas the main regional contributors to global transportemissions and together account for 60% of the total.Latin America (in 4th place) is also notable for itshigh transport emissions, since in all other sectorsapart from AFOLU it tends to be one of the lowestregional contributors.Three regions managed to hold transport emis-sions relatively stable since 2010—Asia PacificDeveloped ( +0%/yr), Europe ( +0.4%/yr) andEurasia ( +0.4%/yr)—but all others continued togrow. Fastest growth since 2010 occurred in East-ern Asia ( +5.6%/yr, +0.4 GtCO 2eq), SouthernAsia ( +4.9%/yr, +0.1 GtCO 2eq), South-East Asia(+4.5%/yr, +0.1 GtCO 2eq) and Africa ( +3.3%/yr,+0.08 GtCO 2eq). The proportion of total final energyused in transport (28%) and its fast expansion overtime weighs heavily on climate mitigation efforts as92% of transport energy comes from oil based-fuels(IEA 2020c ). These trends situate transport as oneof the most challenging sectors for climate changemitigation—even wealthier countries have so far beenunable to realise significant emissions reductions inthe sector.More so than any other sector, transport energyuse has closely tracked GDP per capita growth(figure 14). Transport facilitates the movement ofpeople and goods, enabling access to essential servicesand social interactions, and driving local and globaleconomies. Developments since 1990 continue a his-torical trend of increasing travel distances and a shiftfrom low- to high-speed transport modes that goesalong with GDP growth (Schäfer et al 2009 , Gotaet al 2019 ). Only modest improvements in energyefficiency have been realised, averaging 1.3% peryear globally, while carbon intensities have remainedstable (figure 14). Overall, global increases in pas-senger and freight travel activity levels have out-paced energy efficiency and fuel economy improve-ments, continuing a long-term trend for the trans-port sector (Gucwa and Schäfer 2013 , Grübler 2015 ,McKinnon 2016 ).While global passenger activity has expandedin all world regions, great disparities exist betweenlow and high income regions, and within coun-tries between urban and rural areas (ITF 2019 ).These disparities are visible comparing regional levels19Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure14. Kaya decomposition of CO 2emissions drivers for the transport sector. The indicated growth rates are averaged acrossthe years 2010–2018. Note that the energy term by itself is not part of the decomposition, but is depicted here for comparisonwith the Kaya factors. This figure is for fossil fuel CO 2emissions only (indirect CO 2emissions are excluded) in order to ensurecompatibility with underlying energy data.of transport emissions (figure 13), and are largelydue to differences in modal split and motor vehicleuse. Europe and North America underwent a rapidincrease in private car use in the 20th century, whichhas come to dominate most passenger travel activ-ity and emissions, accounting in 2017 for 70.9% ofpassenger-km by motorised transport in the EU-28, and 81.1% in the US (EC 2019 ). However, thegrowth of passenger-km in the OECD has con-siderably slowed, down to an increase of just 1%between 2000 and 2017 (SLoCaT 2018 ). It is notclear whether the so-called ‘peak car’ in developedeconomies is simply the result of economic stag-nation and rising fuel prices or whether it reflectsdeeper lifestyle and demographic change (Goodwinand van Dender 2013 , Kuhnimhof et al 2013 , Bastianet al 2016 ). Meanwhile, emerging countries in theglobal South are becoming more car dependent, withrapidly growing motorisation and urban sprawl, andthe emergence of local automotive production, whilepublic transport struggles to provide adequate service(Dargay et al 2007 , Hansen and Nielsen 2017 , Pojaniand Stead 2017 ). Between 2000 and 2017 global pas-senger travel increased in non-OECD countries by169%, starting from a low baseline (SLoCaT 2018 ).Passenger and freight mobility services have seenfar reaching advances, aided by information andcommunication technologies tools that have fosterede-commerce and mobility sharing platforms. The eas-ing of traveling and the lowering of cost conditionsattained through use of innovative business mod-els and information technology have contributed asdrivers of increasing transport demand and haveshaped the way people and goods travel around theglobe (Smidfelt Rosqvist and Hiselius 2016 ). Freighttravel activity grew across the globe by 68% in the lasttwo decades driven by global GDP increases, togetherwith the proliferation of online commerce and rapid20Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et al(i.e. same-day and next-day) delivery (SLoCaT 2018 ).Growth has been particularly rapid in heavy-dutyroad freight transport.The transport sector global energy intensitydropped by an average of 1.3% per year between 2010and 2018, primarily driven by wealthier regions, butwas relatively level or increasing in all other regions(figure 14). Some countries have mobilised policiesto increase vehicle energy efficiency, stimulating tech-nological improvements that steadily reduced therequired energy use per passenger-km and per tonne-km of goods delivery for all vehicle applications (lightduty, heavy duty and rail) (IEA 2019a ). Yet progressin another key policy area, fuel price reform, hasbeen more mixed: fuel taxes increased in 83 countries,but fell in 46 between 2003 and 2015, despite theirimportance in encouraging the purchase of more effi-cient vehicles and in limiting travel demand (Bastianet al 2016 , Ross et al 2017 ).The energy matrix of the global transport sys-tem remains to the present deeply rooted in fossilfuels, with powertrains depending on gasoline anddiesel fuels accounting for 92% of final energy use inthe light duty vehicle segment (Figueroa et al 2014 ,IEA 2019a ). The carbon intensity of the transportsector has remained unchanged between 2010 and2018 in all world regions (figure 14). In part thisis due to the increasing adoption of larger, heaviercombustion-based vehicles (‘sports utility vehicles’or SUVs), which have tended to far outpace elec-tric and hybrid vehicle sales. Historically this hastaken place in the North American car market,but is increasingly the case in Europe and interna-tional markets, with 39% of vehicles sold globallyin 2018 in the category of SUVs (IEA 2020d ). Interms of car size and weight, stringent material effi-ciency and light-weight design of passenger vehiclesalone could cumulatively reduce global GHG emis-sions until 2060 by 16–39 GtCO 2eq (Pauliuk et al2020 ). Since 2011, there has also been a steady andincreasingly steep decline in the market share ofmore carbon-efficient diesel vehicles in EU-28 coun-tries; starting in 2017 these developments reversedthe previously downward trend of average fuel con-sumption for newly registered vehicles in Europe(IEA 2020b ).While accounting for a small share of total GHGemissions, national and international aviation andshipping play a fast-growing role, with annual growthrates of +4.2% and 3.1% respectively between 1990and 2018. Energy efficiency improvements in avi-ation were considerably larger than in road trans-port, but were outpaced by even larger increasesin activity levels (SLoCaT 2018 , Lee et al 2021 ). In2016, aviation accounted for 31% of tourist arrivalsglobally (up from 17% in 2005), and for 50%of transport-related CO 2emissions from tourism(UNWTO 2019 ). The long term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is uncertain but it has severely impactedglobal passenger aviation in 2020, and to differentextent the movement of goods and freight modes (LeQuéré et al 2020 , Newman AO 2020 ).Overall, transport trends reveal a steady increaseof emissions, overwhelmingly driven by growingmotorisation and road transport activity. This globaltrend is opposite to what is needed, with a shiftfrom lower to higher-carbon modes only minim-ally offset by efficiency gains. In recent years, hybridelectric and fully battery electric vehicles however,are becoming increasingly popular (IEA 2019b ) andelectrification has progressed faster than previouslyexpected just a few years ago, especially in scooters,buses and a variety of micromobility and light urbanfreight modes such as e-bikes and e-autorickshaws(Taiebat and Xu 2019 ). Yet while the electrificationof road transport holds much promise, its impacthas been hardly visible in the period up to 2018,and looking forward it is in danger of being off-set by growing levels of travel activity and coun-tervailing trends such as increasing vehicle size andweight. This suggests a key role for more stringentpolicies and efforts to tackle car dependence, includ-ing demand management policies alongside techno-logical innovation (Creutzig et al 2018 , Mattioli et al2020 , Milovanoff et al 2020 ). Demand management iseven more crucial for subsectors like aviation wheretechnological options for decarbonisation are cur-rently very limited.3.6.AFOLUAFOLU sector emissions and removals reached 11.6GtCO 2eq globally in 2018, or approximately 21% ofglobal GHG emissions. Reporting in the AFOLU sec-tor is split into two major components: CO 2emis-sions and removals from land-use change and man-agement (also known as LULUCF—land use, land usechange and forestry); and emissions from agriculture,which are predominantly CH 4and N 2O.Land use change and management CO 2emissionsand removals account for 47% of net emissions inthe AFOLU sector and are one of the largest globalsubsectors at 5.4 Gt CO 2eq. A variety of land-basedcarbon fluxes make up these emissions, including:(a) deforestation (e.g. the clearing of natural vegeta-tion for agricultural purposes); (b) transformationsbetween croplands and pasture; (c) peat drainageand burning; (d) wood harvesting; (e) the regrowthof forest and other natural vegetation after agricul-tural abandonment and harvest; and (f) soil CO 2fluxdue to grassland and cropland management (Hansiset al 2015 , Houghton and Nassikas 2017 , Gasser et al2020 ).Emissions from agriculture are mainly com-prised of CH 4emissions from enteric fermentation(e.g. cattle and sheep digestion), at 2.8 GtCO 2eq in2018, or 25% of the sector total. Smaller emissionscomponents include managed soils and pasture (1.3GtCO 2eq, 11% of total), rice cultivation (1 GtCO 2eq,21Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure15. Global and regional GHG emissions trends for the AFOLU sector. Panel (b) shows emissions at the years 1990, 2000,2010, and 2018.9% of total), and manure management, biomassburning, and synthetic fertiliser application (together1 GtCO 2eq). These agricultural sources are mainlyCH 4and N 2O emissions. Like land-use and manage-ment CO 2emissions, they are subject to considerableuncertainty (section 2.5).There has been a gradual upward trend of AFOLUemissions since 2000, at rates of 0.8%/yr. Region-ally, this growth has played out via differing patternsof land use and ongoing agricultural transitions.Unlike all other sectors, AFOLU emissions are typ-ically higher in developing compared to developedregions. In Africa, Latin America and South East Asia,CO 2emissions associated with land-use change andmanagement predominate, dwarfing other AFOLUand non-AFOLU sources, and making AFOLU thesingle largest sector at more than 50% of emissionsin these regions. Land-use and management emis-sions here is associated with the expansion of agri-culture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas, wherevast quantities of CO 2emissions are released due tothe removal and burning of biomass, and drainingof carbon rich soils (Pearson et al 2017 , IPCC 2019 ,Hong et al 2021 ).By contrast, in Europe and North America, thehighest rates of land clearing occurred well before the20th century, such that legacy land use CO 2emissionsare now negligible (Pongratz and Caldeira 2012 ). InEurope, recent forest regrowth and regeneration onabandoned agricultural land has led to an increaseof carbon stocks and CO 2removals since at least2010 (figure 15). Agricultural N 2O and CH 4emis-sions therefore have a substantially larger share ofoverall AFOLU emissions in these regions comparedto tropical countries (Hong et al 2021 ).Livestock rearing takes place on vast tracts of pas-ture land worldwide, contributing to large quantitiesof CH 4emissions from enteric fermentation in LatinAmerica (0.7 Gt CO 2eq in 2018), Southern Asia (0.5GtCO 2eq) and Africa (0.5 GtCO 2eq), while also play-ing a sizable role in the total AFOLU emissions ofmost other regions. Other emissions components aremore specific to regions, such as rice cultivation inEast, Southern, and South East Asia; biomass burn-ing in Africa and Asia-Pacific Developed; and manuremanagement in Europe and North America.Trends in AFOLU emissions from 2010 to 2017have been driven by increases in population, in par-ticular in Africa, the Middle East, Southern Asia andSouth East Asia and Developing Pacific, increases inagricultural production per capita in all regions butthe Middle East, and increases in emissions per unit ofland area. The main downward driver was reductionsin the amount of land required per unit of agriculturaland forestry production in all regions ( −2.7%/yrglobally), reflecting agricultural intensification and22Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure16. Area and trend of land-uses in the world and selected regions. Data from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 database(Hurtt et al 2020 , Chini et al 2021 ).technological progress. Notable features since the1990s are the collapse of the Soviet Union, temporar-ily increasing land intensity and reducing per-capitaproduction (Schierhorn et al 2019 ), and the increasein the emissions intensity of land use where largeareas of pristine rainforest were cleared (in partic-ular Africa, Latin America and Caribbean). Overall,AFOLU emissions are either relatively stable or areincreasing steadily across most regions.Land is the central, limiting resource for the pro-duction of food, feed, timber, bioenergy and otherbiocrops, mediated by growing population numbers,dietary patterns, and production efficiency (Kastneret al 2012 ). Large and on-going land-use and manage-ment CO 2emissions are consistent with a significantglobal expansion of anthropogenic land-use between1990 and 2018 (Hurtt et al 2020 ). Humans haveexpanded cropland areas ( +1.38 million km2, a 9.1%increase), secondary forests ( +5.73 million km2,22.5%), and urban land ( +0.24 million km2,64.3%), and have simultaneously shrunk primaryforest areas ( −7.25 million km2,−12.9%) (figure16). These land-use changes have been led espe-cially by Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia(Hurtt et al 2020 ).The AFOLU sector and its emissions impactsare closely tied to global supply chains. Countrieslike Brazil and Argentina use about half or moreof their cropland for products exported to othercountries, mainly the EU and China (Yu et al 2013 ).Of the soybeans produced in Brazil—the numbertwo country-product combination with respect toGHG emissions in the global AFOLU sector afterIndonesian rice (Hong et al 2021 )—more than halfwas exported to China in 2017 (zu Ermgassenet al 2020 ). Difficulties in tracking supply chainsand limited corporate accountability result in suchexports often being associated with illegal deforest-ation (Vasconcelos et al 2020 ). In South-East Asia,particularly Indonesia, expansions of cropland by0.18 million km2(28%) was largely driven by inter-national demand for palm oil, rubber, and plant-ation products (Austin et al 2019 , Xin et al 2021 ).Here, expansion often occurs on peatlands, leadingto high emissions through peat draining (Concheddaand Tubiello 2020 ) and peat burning (van der Werfet al 2017 ). The strong increases in production percapita and associated GHG emissions seen in LatinAmerica and South-East Asia (figure 17) are thus atleast partly attributable to growing exports and notnational dietary changes.At the same time, efforts to promote environ-mental sustainability in regions like the EU andthe US (but also fast-growing emerging econom-ies such as China) can take place at the cost ofincreasing land displacement elsewhere to meet theirown demand (Meyfroidt et al 2010 , Yu et al 2013 ).Creutzig et al (2019 ) emphasise these global connec-tions via different country ‘archetypes’ that explainco-occurring land use changes: ‘Consumers’ such as23Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alFigure17. Kaya decomposition of GHG emissions drivers for the AFOLU sector. Reproduced from Hong et al (2021 ).Theindicated growth rates are averaged across the years 2010–2017. In contrast to other Kaya figures, here we show total GHGemissions for the AFOLU sector.Europe feature stagnating population, agriculturalintensification, and a high reliance on imports. ‘Pro-ducers’ are regions with high biocapacity and lowinstitutional capacity such as South America, Russia,Indonesia. In these countries, exports play a large rolefor land-use trends. Other regions of Asia and Africabelong to the ‘movers’ , where high population growthis rather the main driver.GHG emissions per unit of land also increasedrecently in tropical regions, as a portion of defor-estation activities moved into carbon-dense rain-forests. In Latin America, land-use and managementCO 2emissions grew from 1990 to 2010 (figure 15)due to high continuous Amazon deforestation ratesuntil the mid-2000s alongside accumulating leg-acy emissions (INPE 2020 ). However, deforestationrates subsequently decreased until 2018 followinggovernment initiatives and international moratoria(Nepstad et al 2014 ). This trend in emissions is likelyto reverse past our time period of analysis, as the2019 and 2020 seasons saw the highest Amazon defor-estation rates since 2008 (Silva Junior et al 2021 ). Inother regions, emission intensity increases are oftendue to an overall increase in agricultural intensifica-tion, such as fertiliser application. The higher emis-sion intensity for both land use CO 2and agriculturalemissions is the cost for requiring less land per unitof production, which becomes evident in almost allregions.Global diets are a key driver of production percapita, and thus land pressure and AFOLU emis-sions. As per capita incomes rise and populationsurbanise, traditional diets that emphasise starchyfoods, legumes and vegetables transition towardsenergy-intensive products such as refined sugars andfats, oils and meat (Tilman and Clark 2014 ). At acertain point in national development, diets thusoverride population growth as the main driver of24Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et alAFOLU emissions (Kastner et al 2012 ). Over the lastfew decades, low- and middle-income countries suchas India, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico and South Africahave experienced such a rapid dietary ‘westernisa-tion’ (Pathak et al 2010 , Vermeulen et al 2012 , DeCarvalho et al 2013 , Popkin 2015 ). Another driver ofhigher food requirements per capita is food waste,the amounts of which increased more or less con-tinuously since the 1960s in all regions but Europe(Porter and Reay 2016 ). Globally, 25%–30% of foodproduced is lost, in particular at the consumer stage indeveloped countries, and in the production, harvest-ing and distribution stages in less developed countries(Porter and Reay 2016 , IPCC 2019 ). In other words, asignificant fraction of the world’s agricultural area isused annually to produce food that is wasted.Overall, the AFOLU sector contributes to onequarter of global GHG emissions and the Paris Agree-ment must include mitigation efforts from this sec-tor. AFOLU emissions were rather constant between1990 and the early 2000s, despite continuous popu-lation growth and higher agricultural production percapita in most regions. The key counteracting processwas less land required per unit of agricultural pro-duction due to agricultural intensification. Starting in2001, however, AFOLU emissions increased again dueto the clearing of pristine, carbon-dense forests. Trop-ical regions across all continents cause the majority ofAFOLU emissions, with increasing emissions in LatinAmerica and Southeast Asia clearly linked to globalsupply chains. These trends do not appear to be sta-bilising, underlining the urgency of interventions atall scales. Per capita emissions have also not fallenbelow 0.5 tCO 2eq in any region (Hong et al 2021 ),suggesting a current frontier of mitigation efforts. Ifthere is a residual of AFOLU emissions that cannotbe eliminated, carbon dioxide removal methods suchas re/afforestation and biomass plantations with car-bon capture and storage would be required to meetstringent climate targets, further putting pressure onglobal land resources (Allen et al 2018 ).4.ConclusionsGlobal GHG emissions have continued their steadyrise, following over a century and a half of growth.Emissions have risen across sectors and subsectors, inelectricity production, from industrial sources, land-use and management, and transport, through to com-paratively small sources such as fugitive emissions,waste burning and aviation. Among the major emit-ting regions, recent trends show a picture of stableemissions in North America and modest declines inEurope, as fuel switching from coal to gas and theramp up of renewables start to take hold. The hugeemissions growth in Eastern Asia (China) is now alsoslowing due to fewer coal power additions in recentyears. Together these trends led to a dampening ofgrowth in 2010–2018, compared to previous decades.As emerging regions—Africa, Southern Asia, andSouth East Asia—are now poised to accelerate eco-nomic growth and establish high emitting infrastruc-tures, it remains unclear whether a global peak ingreenhouse gases will be reached soon. Regardless,recent growth has locked in a large body of infra-structure that will continue driving emissions into thefuture, in the absence of stringent climate policy orearly retirement.Across sectors, there is a growing demand for theproducts and services that underpin global emissions.In part this is due to the physical expansion ofeconomies worldwide, with more infrastructures,vehicles, buildings, supply chains and other mater-ial stocks being put into place that demand energyfor their production and use. Unfortunately, prevail-ing consumption patterns have also tended to aggrav-ate energy use and emissions, with the long-termtrend led by developed regions. Residential build-ings have grown larger, have fewer inhabitants, andare heated and cooled to higher comfort standards.Motor vehicles, too, have grown in size and are drivenover greater distances. Diets rich in meat and refinedproducts, internationally sourced, are globalising andreplacing traditional and seasonal produce. Regionaland local contexts account for much variation, andthere remains a chasm between the consumptionlevels of the global North and the South, the poorand the rich (Hubacek et al 2017 , Oswald et al 2020 ,Wiedmann et al 2020 ). Nonetheless, the overall trendtracks towards westernised and highly unsustainablenorms and patterns of consumption, for a small butgrowing global population.Decarbonisation gains from improvements inenergy efficiency and switching towards lower-carbonservices across different sectors have been largelywiped out by increases in demand (or in some cases atrend towards higher carbon intensities). One excep-tion is energy systems emissions in Europe, wherea combination of stable demand, energy efficiencyimprovements, fuel switching and a scale up of renew-ables has led to an absolute decline in emissions.Other regions and sectors have deepened their reli-ance on inefficient, carbon-intensive infrastructuresand production patterns. The continued failure todecarbonise transport, and the recent expansion ofanthropogenic land-use into tropical rainforests, aretwo notable examples. There are huge unexploitedmitigation potentials to be gained from avoiding theseand other highly carbon-intensive activities, includ-ing by adopting the best available technologies andpractices across sectors.The energy systems, industry, buildings, trans-port and AFOLU sectors are deeply interconnec-ted. Important linkages are electrification andheating, which ties emissions in the building andindustry sectors upstream to energy systems, andmaterial use, which ties embodied emissions inbuildings to the industry sector. Following the25Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 073005 W F Lamb et algeneral trend of electrification, which has yet tooccur at scale in the transport sector, energy sys-tem decarbonisation will further increase in import-ance. Yet if the industry sector lags behind inelectrification and the decarbonisation of processemissions (Davis et al 2018 ), it may become theprimary source of indirect emissions embodied inthe capital stocks of other sectors. Indeed, GHGemissions embodied in buildings and infrastruc-ture, machinery and transport equipment alreadyexceed 50% of their present carbon footprint (Chenet al 2018 ). Multi-sector and integrated policiesare therefore crucial for meeting the mitigationchallenge.Overall, sectoral trends reveal limited progresstowards decarbonisation. The prominent global pat-tern is a continuation of underlying drivers with fewsigns of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deepshift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon ser-vices across sectors. The main gap in knowledge ishow rapid technological transitions, demand man-agement and alternative economic models could beimplemented to mitigate these persistent and power-ful upward drivers. Linked to this is the question ofhow the physical material throughput of econom-ies can be reduced without jeopardising economicand social well-being. Above all, there is a neglectof research on transitions towards even more unsus-tainable technologies and practices (Antal et al 2020 ).Climate mitigation cannot be achieved if status-quotrends continue, nor if low-carbon technologies andpractices are left to gradually phase-in on an unevenplaying field. Meeting the Paris Agreement goals of1.5◦C and 2◦C requires policies that ensure sustain-able land-use practices, limit excessive demand, andactively phase out fossil fuels.DataavailabilitystatementAll data that support the findings of this study areincluded within the article (and any supplementaryfiles).AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the Bundesministeriumfür Bildung und Forschung of Germany (IPCC-AR6-III- 2, Grant No. 01LG1910A & ARIADNE, Grant No.03SFK5J0); the European Research Council (ERC)under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 researchand innovation program (MAT_STOCKS, Grant No.741950); the Natural Environment Research Council(NERC) of the United Kingdom (OPTIMISM, GrantNo. NE/S012834/1); the US National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA) InterdisciplinaryResearch in Earth Science (IDS) program (GrantNo. 80NSSC17K0348); the US National ScienceFoundation and US Department of Agriculture(INFEWS Grant No. EAR 1639318); the NationalNatural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.72073003); and the China Ministry of Science andTechnology and National Climate Center (GrantNo: 2018YFC1509008 & E003931901).
