Microbial activity in forest soil reﬂects the changes inecosystem properties between summer and winterLucia Žifc ˇáková,1Tomáš Ve ˇtrovský,1Adina Howe2and Petr Baldrian1*1Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology, Institute ofMicrobiology of the ASCR, v.v.i., Víden ˇská 1083, Praha4 14220, Czech Republic.2Department of Agricultural and BiosystemsEngineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011,USA.SummaryUnderstanding the ecology of coniferous forests isvery important because these environments representglobally largest carbon sinks. Metatranscriptomics,microbial community and enzyme analyses were com-bined to describe the detailed role of microbial taxa inthe functioning of the Picea abies -dominated conifer-ous forest soil in two contrasting seasons. Theseseasons were the summer, representing the peak ofplant photosynthetic activity, and late winter, after anextended period with no photosynthate input. Theresults show that microbial communities were charac-terized by a high activity of fungi especially in litterwhere their contribution to microbial transcription wasover 50%. Differences in abundance between summerand winter were recorded for 26–33% of bacterialgenera and <15% of fungal genera, but the transcriptproﬁles of fungi, archaea and most bacterial phylawere signiﬁcantly different among seasons. Further,the seasonal differences were larger in soil than inlitter. Most importantly, fungal contribution to totalmicrobial transcription in soil decreased from 33% insummer to 16% in winter. In particular, the activity ofthe abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi was reduced inwinter, which indicates that plant photosynthetic pro-duction was likely one of the major drivers of changesin the functioning of microbial communities in thisconiferous forest.IntroductionConiferous forest ecosystems represent signiﬁcant globalcarbon sinks, especially in the boreal and temperatezones of the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, under-standing their ecology is essential for predicting and man-aging C-cycling processes and their impacts on climatechange. We currently lack fundamental knowledge onhow microorganisms function as key mediators ofC-cycling processes in these ecosystems as well as theidentiﬁcation of the speciﬁc roles of individual taxa. Pre-viously, litter and soil activity in forest ecosystems hasbeen shown to be largely shaped by the activity of trees,which are the dominant primary producers. Trees affectthe inﬂow and quality of complex organic compounds inthe form of leaf and root litter, and provide root exudates(Prescott and Grayston, 2013). Additionally, trees contrib-ute signiﬁcantly to soil respiration (Högberg et al., 2010)and deposition of carbon (Clemmensen et al., 2013)either directly or indirectly through their fungal symbionts.The concomitant production of aboveground litterand root exudates results in vertical stratiﬁcation offorest soils. The accumulation of recalcitrant litter, as wellas the absence or low abundance of roots on the soilsurface, results in the formation of the litter horizon.This litter is characterized by a high activity ofextracellular enzymes produced by fungal and bacterialdecomposers, high heterotrophic respiration and highdecomposition rates (Šnajdr et al., 2008; Baldrian et al.,2012). Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM; the plant rootsymbionts belonging to Dikarya) grows on the soil surfaceand are sustained at the cost of C that is allocated viaplant roots to deeper soil and transported by their mycelia(Lindahl et al., 2007; Vor ˇíšková et al., 2014). In contrast,in deeper organic layers of coniferous forest soils, most ofthe C originates from rhizodeposition (Clemmensen et al.,2013), and the microbial community is generally richer inECM fungi and bacteria (O’Brien et al., 2005; Lindahlet al., 2007; Baldrian et al., 2012).Seasonally, temperate and boreal zone forests arecharacterized by the photosynthetic activity of treesduring a vegetation period (with favourable temperatureand light conditions) and during winter (with little light andtemperatures below the freezing point) (Vor ˇíšková et al.,2014). The seasonality of photosynthetic production andits resulting carbon allocation can dramatically affect theavailability of C to soil biota (Högberg et al., 2010; Kaiseret al., 2010), with belowground carbon allocation via plantroots limited to the vegetation period (Högberg et al.,2010).

Although bacterial biomass is quantitativelydominant, fungi have been shown to be more important indecomposition processes and link soil and plant interac-tions (Baldrian et al., 2012; Štursová et al., 2012). Giventhat the bulk of microbial community members have notyet been cultured, direct analysis of microbial processesis necessary to link community structure to speciﬁc func-tions and to provide insight into the contribution of indi-vidual microbial taxa to biogeochemical processes. Thedevelopment of metatranscriptomic approaches and high-throughput sequencing offers the tools to address thesequestions. Metatranscriptomics has proven to be wellsuited for the identiﬁcation of functional traits ofvarious microbial taxa, especially in the oceans (Gilbertet al., 2010; Shi et al., 2011; Gifford et al., 2013)where it has successfully been used to demonstrateseasonal changes in microbial activity (Gilbert et al.,2010; Hewson et al., 2014; Hollibaugh et al., 2014). Com-pared with marine environments, the development of soilmetatranscriptomics is much less advanced, mainly dueto the difficulty of obtaining RNA in sufficient amounts andquality. These limitations, however, have recently beenovercome (Urich et al., 2008), and extracted RNA hasbeen shown to identify the activity of various microbialtaxa as well as speciﬁc genes (Baldrian et al., 2012).Currently, however, there exist only few publishedmetatranscriptomic studies on soils (Tveit et al., 2013;2014; Nacke et al., 2014), and the understanding of soilfunctioning based on these studies is still fragmentary.This work combines metatranscriptomics, microbialcommunity analysis and enzyme activity measurementsto investigate the inﬂuence of seasonality on forest topsoil microbial activity. We investigate two seasons: thesummer peak of plant photosynthetic activity and latewinter with no photosynthate input in soil where we havepreviously observed high microbial activity, especially offungi (Baldrian et al., 2012). We also explore the extent ofseasonal differences in ecosystem functioning and indi-cate whether these changes are due to differences inmicrobial community composition among seasons, differ-ential transcription of the microbes, or both. Our over-arching hypothesis is that observed seasonal differencesin soil microbial activity are driven by changes in theavailability of plant photosynthesis products and conse-quently that seasonality is soil horizon-speciﬁc. In winter,as decreases in the nutrient supply to root-symbiotic ECMfungi occur due to absent photosyntate allocation, weexpect that ECM fungi abundance and activity willdecrease. Moreover, because previous studies haveshown that ECM fungi decrease the rates of organicmatter decomposition (Gadgil and Gadgil, 1975; Ekbladet al., 2013), it can be assumed that winter will be char-acterized by a relative increase of abundance and activityof decomposer microorganisms. Further, it was demon-strated that both fungi and selected bacteria are involvedin decomposition in coniferous forests (Štursová et al.,2012), and we will speciﬁcally investigate the relative con-tribution of the members of these two groups.ResultsSite and soil propertiesMean annual temperature in the year of sampling was4.8°C and was the same for air on the soil surface and inlitter and soil. The warmest month was August, with an airtemperature of 13.4°C, litter temperature of 12.3°C andsoil temperature of 12.2°C; the coldest month was Feb-ruary, with temperatures of −1.1°C, −0.4°C and −0.3°C inair, litter and soil, respectively (Fig. S1). The temperaturesin litter and soil during the 14 days before sampling were9.7°C in summer and −0.3 to −0.4°C in winter. Additionally,the summer sampling time was representative of the peakof the vegetative season, whereas the soil in winter wascovered by 50 cm of snow for longer than 3 months(Fig. S1). Despite temperatures being slightly below 0°Cin the winter, the water in litter and soil was never frozen.Soils were characterized by high content of organicmatter and low pH. The chemical properties of litter andsoil differed dramatically, with the litter horizon containingsigniﬁcantly more organic matter, as well as nutrients (C,N and P) and exhibiting slightly but signiﬁcantly higher pHand moisture content (Table 1). Litter also containedapproximately twice as much bacterial biomass andapproximately fourfold more fungal biomass than soil. Theactivity of all extracellular enzymes was higher in litterthan in soil, with the exception of Mn-peroxidase andβ-xylosidase. Seasonal differences within horizons weremost apparent in the bacterial/fungal rDNA ratio, whichwas higher in winter than in summer in both horizons. Inlitter, the activity of the endocellulase and ergosterolcontent was higher in summer, whereas Mn-peroxidaseactivity was higher in winter. In soil, endocellulase activitywas higher in summer, whereas endoxylanase activitywas higher in winter (Table 1).Composition and activity of the microbial communityGene-targeted sequencing was performed to characterizethe composition of the soil microbial community (16SrRNA gene amplicons, DNA) and activity (16S rRNASeasonal dynamics of a soil microbial community 289© 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Environmental Microbiology ,18, 288–301 14622920, 2016, 1, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13026 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

We detected a total of 27 164 bacterialoperational taxonomic units (OTU) with best hits to 1005genera. Soil biodiversity was observed to be between4.54 and 5.21 (Shannon index) and evenness between0.80 and 0.87. DNA and RNA communities from litter weresigniﬁcantly more diverse than those from soil ( P<0.001),and RNA-derived communities exhibited higher values ofbiodiversity (Shannon index) than those of DNA commu-nities ( P<0.02; Table S1).In both DNA- and RNA-derived communities, bacterialcommunities were dominated by Proteobacteria , followedby Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria . AlthoughAcidobacteria were more abundant in soil, several bacte-rial taxa, including Actinobacteria ,Bacteroidetes ,Betaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia , were moreabundant in litter. Bacterial OTUs were more horizon-speciﬁc than fungi, with 83% of the top 42 OTU showingpreferential localization in one horizon. The most abun-dant bacterial genera in litter were Pseudomonas (7.5% ofall sequences), Beijerinckia (7.2%) and Acidiphila (7.0%).The soil was especially rich in candidatus Koribacter(24%), Beijerinckia (6.3%) and Rhodoplanes (6.2%)(Table S2). Seasonal differences in abundance withineach horizon were limited to a small number of taxa in theDNA community. Seasonal differences in rRNA contentwere more pronounced than in fungi, with 26% and 31%of genera showing seasonal differences in the litter andsoil respectively (Table S2). Genome count estimates(based on the total number of associated rRNAamplicons), ribosome content (rRNA), ribosome produc-tion (mRNA reads of ribosomal proteins) and total activity(all mRNA reads) were used as proxies of bacterial com-munity composition and activity. For example, althoughAcidobacteria -associated DNA was common, this bacte-rial taxon exhibited lower proportions of associated rRNAcontent and transcripts. In contrast, Actinobacteria wereassociated with a higher share of mRNA reads than ofgenomes or ribosomes, whereas Verrucomicrobia wereabundant in DNA and RNA, but mRNA reads assigned tothis phylum were rare (Fig. 1).Amplicon sequencing of fungal internal transcribedspacer (ITS) sequences resulted in the identiﬁcation of atotal of 3942 fungal OTUs, with best hits to 424 genera.No signiﬁcant differences were found in fungal OTU diver-sity between DNA and RNA samples, horizons andseasons. The species richness was 132–175, the biodi-versity was 3.29–3.53 (Shannon index) and the evennesswas 0.68–0.70 (Table S1). In both litter and soil, the fungalcommunity was dominated by the Basidiomycota andAscomycota, which represented 87–97% of sequences.The remaining sequences belonged primarily to theMortierellomycotina (2% in litter, 12% in soil). The com-position of fungal communities in litter and soil differedsubstantially, with 20 of 32 of the most abundant fungalOTU (63%) showing preferential localization in onehorizon. The most abundant fungal genera in litter wereMycena (18%), Tylospora (16%) and Cladophialophora(9%), whereas in soil, Russula (17%), Tylospora (13%),Mortierella (12%) and Piloderma (11%) were the mostabundant (Table S3). Seasonal differences in abundancewithin each horizon were limited to a small number of taxain both DNA and RNA communities (Table S3). ModerateTable 1.

TheBray–Curtis similarity values of community compositionamong the six study sites were similar in litter and soil,ranging from 0.48 to 0.60 in fungi and from 0.80 to 0.87 inbacteria. The difference in activity of bacterial and fungalgenera between summer and winter were analysed bycomparing the abundance ratios of RNA/DNA. Generally,for both bacteria and fungi, soil showed substantiallyhigher differences in activity among seasons than didlitter. Contrary to our hypothesis, ECM fungi did not showRNA enrichment in summer. Interestingly, all abundantsoil Actinobacteria showed higher RNA/DNA ratios inwinter (Fig. S2).Microbial mRNA transcription in litter and soilMetatranscriptomes were also obtained from the studysite, providing broader insights for comparisons ofexpressed functions between horizons and seasons.Features identiﬁed as microbial (i.e., those assigned toeither bacteria, fungi or archaea) represented a vastmajority (83.4%) of annotated contigs. Of the othercontigs, most had hits to the Streptophyta (4.2%),Arthropoda (3.7%), Nematoda (0.8%) and Chlorophyta(0.4%), whereas contigs identiﬁed as viral represented0.2%. Overall, a total of 17 552 species were identiﬁed inassembled contigs. The contribution of microbial taxa totranscription differed widely between horizons. In litter,69.9% of microbial transcripts were assigned to fungi,28.9% to bacteria and 1.1% to archaea. However, in thesoil, bacterial transcripts dominated at 74.1%, whereasfungal transcripts made up 24.6% and archaeal 1.3% ofthe total (Fig. 2A). The fraction of reads with functionalclassiﬁcation associated with bacteria was high (72%)compared with those of archaea (26%) and fungi (only19%).The transcription proﬁles of selected microbial groups(Archaea, Fungi, Acidobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Bacteroi-detes ,Cyanobacteria ,Firmicutes andProteobacteria )a tlevel 3 of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) classiﬁcation database were taxon-speciﬁc anddiffered signiﬁcantly between all pairs of taxa ( P<0.003,analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) on Bray–Curtis distanceswith 9999 permutations). Fungal and archaeal transcrip-tion proﬁles also clearly separated from the bacterial tran-scription proﬁles (non-metric multidimensional scaling(NMDS); Fig. 2B). There were processes strongly domi-nated by bacteria (e.g., metabolism of terpenoids andpolyketides), as well as those with a strong involvement offungi, such as glycan biosynthesis and lipid metabolism(Fig. 2C). To evaluate phyla-speciﬁc processes (e.g., con-tribution of Cyanobacteria to photosynthesis), the totaltranscripts involved in a speciﬁc process (e.g.,Cyanobacteria -associated photosynthesis transcripts)was compared with total transcripts associated with aspeciﬁc phyla (e.g., all Cyanobacteria -associated tran-scripts). Broadly, speciﬁc taxa were observed to be highlyenriched for group-speciﬁc processes (Table 2).Comparing the transcripts between horizons, there wasa signiﬁcant difference between litter and soil in the rela-tive abundance of observed functional assignments(P=0.0003, ANOSIM on Bray–Curtis distances with 9999permutations on KEGG level 3). Reads belonging to 132out of 178 functional KEGG categories (74.1%) wereobserved to be signiﬁcantly different in abundancesbetween litter and soil (Table S4). The most highlyexpressed KEGG categories in litter relative to soil wereribosome ( +45% compared with soil), fatty acidbiosynthesis ( +277%), starch and sucrose metabolism(+105%), protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum(+145%), RNA transport ( +135%) and proteasome(+201%). In soil, signiﬁcantly higher expression wasrecorded for oxidative phosphorylation ( +57%), ATP-binding casette (ABC) transporters ( +97%), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ( +29%), aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis(+76%), purine metabolism ( +67%) and pentose phos-phate pathway ( +67%) (Tables S5 and S6). Transcriptabundances associated with all microbial phyla, with theexception of Archaea, were also signiﬁcantly differentbetween litter and soil ( P<0.0011, ANOSIM on Bray–Curtis distances with 9999 permutations). Together, theobserved contrasting transcription abundance proﬁlesbetween these two horizons suggest differences in theirmetabolism.Seasonality of microbial transcriptionIn addition to the differences in transcription proﬁlesamong horizons, signiﬁcant differences among transcrip-tion across seasons were also observed at this study site.Considering the taxonomic classiﬁcation of reads, sea-sonality was much more pronounced in the soil, where theshare of fungal transcripts was 33.4% in summer andonly 15.7% in winter. Additionally, transcripts fromActinobacteria ,Planctomycetes andProteobacteria weresigniﬁcantly more frequent in summer, whereas those oftheBacteroidetes andChlorobi were more than twofoldhigher in winter. In litter, only Proteobacteria andChlorobishowed signiﬁcantly different transcript abundancesbetween summer and winter (Fig. 2A; Table S4).292 L. Žifc ˇáková, T. Ve ˇtrovský, A. Howe and P.

The share of KEGGcategories responding to seasonality was 2–10% in litterand 10–29% in soil. In Acidobacteria ,Proteobacteria andFungi, more than 20% of KEGG groups in soil showedsigniﬁcant seasonal trends.We also identiﬁed representative assembled contigsfrom the transcriptome that were broadly present in ourstudy area. This core metatranscriptome, deﬁned asthose contigs that represented >0.001% of total transcrip-tion in each microbial domain (Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi)and that were observed in at least ﬁve samples from litteror from soil, had contrasting expressions in between hori-zons and seasons. The difference in relative transcriptionamong seasons was at least 3-fold for 28–50% of the corecontigs and at least 10-fold for 5–21% of the core contigs.More season-responding transcripts were found in soilthan in litter for all domains (Fig. 3).As root photosynthate allocation only occurs during thegrowing season, we expected that the abundance andactivity of mycorrhizal fungi, depending on photosynthesis-derived carbon, will decrease between summer and winter.Based on the relative abundance of fungal ITS sequencesbelonging to mycorrhizal taxa in litter, we observed that thisgroup was slightly but not signiﬁcantly smaller in winterthan in summer (46% and 51%), and the same was foundfor ITS transcripts (46% and 53%). In soil, the DNA andRNA abundance of mycorrhizal ITS sequences was notsigniﬁcantly different between seasons and was approxi-mately 78–80%. Individual ECM, however, showed distinctseasonal patterns of abundance and activity that in somecases largely increased ( Russula ) and in other casesdecreased ( Xerocomus ,Amanita ) in winter in both hori-zons. Further, signiﬁcant decrease in β-tubulin transcriptsof Basidiomycota relative to those assigned to other fungiwas observed from summer to winter; they represented73.5 ±3.6% in litter in summer, 57.1 ±6.3% in winter,Table 2.

This may be due to the relative decrease in thetranscription of the plant root-symbiotic ECM taxa becausemost of them belonged to the Basidiomycota.To assess the seasonality of transcription of genesspeciﬁc to mycorrhizal fungi, transcripts with high simi-larity to those induced during mycorrhizal symbiosis ofLaccaria laccata with a plant host were identiﬁed. Froma total of 19 969 of such putative ECM transcripts,27.9% did not show difference in relative expressionbetween seasons, whereas 51.4% showed expressionexclusively in summer and another 7.2% showed a morethan threefold increase in relative expression in summer.In contrast, only 1.5% and 12.0% of contigs wereexclusively transcribed or increased in winter (Fig. 3)respectively.Oxygen limitation has previously been reported as amajor driver of soil activity in soils under snowpack(Robinson, 2001). In order to explore whether such anoxicconditions developed in our study area, we compared therelative summer and winter abundance of transcriptsassigned to enzyme classes in anaerobic respiration, fer-mentation and fermentative pathways. These pathwaysincluded nitrate reduction, nitric and nitrous oxidereduction, sulphate reduction, homoacetogenesis,methanogenesis and synthesis of fermentation products.We observed no signiﬁcant differences in transcriptsassociated with these functions between seasons, sug-gesting that seasonal oxygen limitation does not takeplace. Between soil and litter, however, we did observehigher abundance of anaerobic pathways in the soil com-pared with litter, suggesting that anaerobic niches may bepresent and inﬂuence microbial activity.DiscussionMicrobial transcription in forest litter and soilUnlike many other soils, the soils of coniferous forestsare unique in that they contain a high amount of fungalbiomass in the soil, where root-symbiotic fungi prolifer-ate because of their access to plant-produced C (Lindahlet al., 2007; Clemmensen et al., 2013). The litter ofthese soils also contains recalcitrant organic polymersthat can be efficiently decomposed primarily bysaprotrophic fungi (de Boer et al., 2005; Štursová et al.,2012). In this study, we show that not only are thesesoils characterized by high diversity of both fungi andbacteria, consistent with previous results (Baldrian et al.,2012), but also high metabolic diversity. The soilmetatranscriptome identiﬁed over 4.6 million uniqueprotein predictions in its assembled contigs. Assumingthat a thousand expressed proteins are present in asingle bacterial genome, this result suggests that thou-sands of microbial species are transcriptionally active atthe same time.Within these soils, a high proportion of assigned readsbelonged to fungi, especially in the litter (Fig. 2). Thisresult is much higher than previous estimates in bothgrassland and forest soils, where more than 90%sequences were assigned to bacteria and only 4% and0.5% were fungal or archaeal respectively (Nacke et al.,2014). The values observed here provide evidence tothe importance of fungi in the functioning of the conifer-ous forest ecosystems (Fig. 2) and are consistent withother forest soil eukaryotic metatranscriptomes (Baillyet al., 2007; Damon et al., 2012; Takasaki et al., 2013),where fungal reads were found to dominate amongthose of the eukaryota. In general, it is more challengingto reliably annotate fungal sequences relative to those ofbacterial origin because of the lack of available refer-ence genomes and performance of annotation tools(Meyer et al., 2008). For example, it is challenging evento distinguish the genes of the Ascomycota and theBasidiomycota, the two most abundant fungal divisions.Despite these challenges, this study demonstrates thatmetatranscriptomics can provide insight into contrastingfungal and bacterial dynamics between soil horizons andseasons.Forest topsoils have been previously demonstrated toexhibit vertical stratiﬁcation of composition resulting fromthe different processes in litter and soil, as well as thestratiﬁcation of organic matter in soil. This study conﬁrmsthe differences in enzyme activities, microbial biomassand community composition previously observed withthe decreasing content of bacterial and fungal biomassand increasing content of ECM with depth (Lindahl et al.,2007; Baldrian et al., 2012; Clemmensen et al., 2013;Vorˇíšková et al., 2014). Metabolic potential has alsobeen observed with metagenomics in the soil horizonsof a Picea abies forest (Uroz et al., 2013). This studyextends these observations beyond microbial structureand gene potential to the functional level. We found thatas many as 74% of functions were differentiallyexpressed between horizons. In litter, this activity wasdominated by fungi, whereas in soil, bacteria dominated.Increased synthesis of ribosomal proteins in litter sug-gests more active metabolism in this horizon, along withincreased share of starch and sucrose metabolism(+105% compared with soil) suggesting higher produc-tion of decomposition-related enzymes. Differences inmicrobial transcription among soils from various depthshas also been previously observed in Svalbard peatsoils, but this environment is quite different and is alsocharacterized by low fungal biomass and oxygen limita-tion (Tveit et al., 2013; 2014), which our soils did nothave.Seasonal dynamics of a soil microbial community 295© 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Environmental Microbiology ,18, 288–301 14622920, 2016, 1, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13026 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseSeasonal changes of microbial activityMicrobial communities in forest ecosystems were alsodemonstrated to change across seasons, likely due toseasonality of photosynthesis. In a deciduous temperateforest, the fungal community in litter exhibits profoundseasonal changes: saprotrophic taxa reach their seasonalmaxima on freshly fallen litter in autumn, whereassummer typically is characterized by the highest abun-dance of ectomycorrhizal taxa (Baldrian et al., 2013;Vorˇíšková et al., 2014). In deeper soils, less change infungal community composition is likely, but trends forminimum biomass in winter and peaks in summer aremost likely due to rhizodeposition (Vor ˇíšková et al., 2014).Consistent with previous results (Baldrian et al., 2013),our soils did not exhibit differences in the fungal/bacterialbiomass across seasons. Within the bacteria domain,only Actinobacteria exhibited seasonal changes in abun-dance in a forest soil while other groups did not (Kuffneret al., 2012). Broadly, community proﬁles of both soil DNAand RNA were largely consistent across seasons (Fig. 1).The seasonal changes in the activity of individual micro-bial species (RNA/DNA of OTUs) were much more pro-nounced in soil compared with litter (Fig. S2), with soilalso exhibiting a higher share of functional categories withseasonal differences in expression (Figs 2 and 3). Theincrease of RNA degradation, proteasome and lysosome-related transcripts suggest reduced microbial biomassand activity in winter. Interestingly, we observed no reduc-tion in the amount of bacterial biomass (16S) or that offungal biomass (ergosterol) during the winter. Seasonaldifferences in soil dynamics could be the result of bothchanges in the abundance of microbial taxa as well asexpression of transcribed functions. We also observedsigniﬁcant differences in genes expressed betweenseasons that exhibited very high sequence similarity(E<10−100) to the genome of Solibacter usitatus , support-ing the idea that even individual microbial species changethe repertoire of their transcribed genes among seasons.Seasonal differences in the contribution of microbialgroups to transcription were most markedly demonstratedin the soil relative to litter, where the share of fungaltranscripts was 33.4% in summer but only 15.7% in winter.This corresponded to an observed increase in bacterial/fungal rRNA ratios in winter. No difference in total fungalbiomass (ergosterol) was recorded between seasons, sug-gesting that possibly only the active part of fungal mycelialstructures may be reduced during the winter. Becausefungi are reported to be more abundant in the rhizospherethan in bulk soils (Turner et al., 2013), the seasonality ofroot processes that take place in soil and not in litter, suchas the rhizodeposition of photosynthetically ﬁxed C, mayplausibly explain the decrease of fungal activity in winterwhere the system is dominated by ECM fungi. This resultwould be consistent with our observations that there is nosigniﬁcant difference in the relative amount of mycorrhizalfungi, but their activity in winter is reduced signiﬁcantly.In the summer, we observed increases in the activity ofgenes associated with Ectomycorrhiza-speciﬁc transcripts(>50% genes exclusively transcribed in that season;Fig. 3) as well as increased activity of Basidiomycota(which are mostly ECM), espsecially its housekeepinggene for β-tubulin. The higher ECM activity in summer wasalso accompanied by the increase of abundance ofPlanctomycetes , which were previously reported in asso-ciation with functioning ECM hyphal networks (Lindahlet al., 2010), and higher activity of selected bacterial taxathat harbour mycorrhiza-helper bacteria such asBurkholderia spp., Streptomyces spp. or Sphingomonaswittichii (Churchland and Grayston, 2014).The observed reduction of ECM activity in winter shouldtheoretically decrease their inhibitory effects on decompo-sition of organic matter (Ekblad et al., 2013) and conse-quently lead to increased abundance of extracellularenzymes. Contrary to this expectation, enzymes in our soildid not show differences in activity between seasons.Reports from other deciduous forests are so far inconclu-sive, with some studies showing seasonality of enzymaticprocesses (Kaiser et al., 2010; Vor ˇíšková et al., 2014) andothers observing no signiﬁcance between seasons(Baldrian et al., 2013). Considering the temperaturedependence of activity (Baldrian et al., 2013), the rates ofenzymatic processes are likely to be higher in summer,supported by results from a recent study from anotherPicea abies forest where enzyme activity decreased withthe reduction of C allocation by tree roots belowground(Štursová et al., 2014). Our results suggest that activity ofenzymes involved in decomposition is promoted by theavailability of simple C compounds, which is higher insummer. Our study has also excluded the possible oxygenlimitation in unfrozen soil below deep snowpack in winter.This paper provides the ﬁrst comprehensive analysis ofthe seasonality of soil transcription that indicates contrast-ing dynamics in soil function both between litter and soilsas well as between seasons. We ﬁnd that the microbialcommunity composition in soil of a coniferous forest, par-ticularly on the DNA level, is quite stable, but that thereare profound changes in microbial transcription acrossseasons. Most importantly, fungal contribution to totalmicrobial transcription decreases in winter, especially insoil. Plant photosynthetic production seems to be themajor driver of seasonality in the studied ecosystembecause the activity of ECM fungi that are dependent onthis process is highly affected. The results also indicatethat the widely used DNA-based community surveys ormetagenome analyses may represent less dynamicpicture of studied ecosystems and to be thus inferior tothe metatranscriptomic approaches in describing the296 L.

Despite the potential ofmetatranscriptomics to reveal the dynamics of soil func-tioning, the results of this method should be in the futureveriﬁed by complementary approaches, such as, forexample, metaproteomics, metabolomics or direct iso-topic labelling.Experimental proceduresStudy area, sample collection and characterizationThe study area was located at high altitudes (1170–1200 m)of the Bohemian Forest mountain range (Central Europe;49°02 N, 13°37 E) and was covered by an unmanagedNorway spruce ( Picea abies ) forest. The mean annual tem-perature was 5°C, and the mean annual precipitation was1000 mm. The understory was either missing or composed ofgrasses ( Avenella ,Calamagrostis ), bilberries ( Vaccinium ),mosses and ferns. The same study area was explored pre-viously to identify the total and active microbial communities(Baldrian et al., 2012). Samples were collected on 24 July2012 (summer, the peak of the vegetation period) and on 27March 2013 (late winter, under a 50 cm snowpack after a longperiod of constant environmental conditions with uniformtemperature and lack of daylight due to snow cover; Fig. S1).At six sites, located approximately 250 m from each other,eight soil cores (4.5 cm diameter) were collected from aroundthe circumference of a 3 m diameter circle. Litter horizon (L,2–4 cm) and organic soil horizon (S, 3–6 cm) materials wereseparately pooled within each site. After removal of roots, Lmaterial was cut into 0.5 cm pieces and mixed, whereas Smaterial was passed through a 5 mm sterile mesh and mixed.A total of 24 samples were collected (6 sites ×twoseasons ×2 horizons). Soil and litter samples were immedi-ately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored on dry ice. Samplesfor nucleic acid extraction were stored at −80°C, samples forergosterol quantiﬁcation, chemical analysis and enzymeactivity measurements were freeze-dried and stored at−45°C. Enzyme assays were performed in soil homogenates(Štursová and Baldrian, 2011).Dry mass content was measured as a loss of mass duringfreeze-drying, organic matter content was measured aftercombustion at 650°C and pH was measured in distilled water(1:10). Soil C, N and extractable P content was measured inan external laboratory. Total ergosterol was extracted with10% KOH in methanol and analysed by high-performanceliquid chromatography (Šnajdr et al., 2008). Air temperatureand soil temperatures at 2 cm and 5 cm depths wererecorded hourly from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2013 at allsampling sites.Extraction and analysis of environmental RNA and DNAFor the metatranscriptome analysis, RNA was extracted usingthe RNA PowerSoil Total RNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laborato-ries) combined with the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit(ZymoResearch). Three aliquots (3 ×1 g of material) wereextracted per sample. Triplicate RNA extracts were pooled,and RNA was puriﬁed using the RNA Clean and ConcentratorKit (ZymoResearch) on a column treated with DNase I(Fermentas) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Thisproduct was checked for quality (RNA integrity number) andlength distribution on an Agilent 2100 Bionalyser (AgilentTechnologies).Approximately 1 μg of RNAwas treated with anequimolar mixture of RiboZero rRNA Removal Kits Human-Mouse-Rat and Bacteria (Epicentre) to remove bothprokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNA. rRNA removal was checkedon an Agilent 2100 Bionalyser. A total of 50 ng of treated RNAserved as the input for the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq LibraryPreparation Kit (Epicentre), and the library size-distributionwas re-checked on an Agilent 2100 Bionalyser (Agilent Tech-nologies). Libraries were sequenced on an ILLUMINAHISEQ2000 at the Argonne National Laboratory, USA, to gen-erate 150-base paired-end reads.To analyse microbial community composition, 1 μg of totalRNA was reverse transcribed using S UPER SCRIPT III R EVERSETRANSCRIPTASE (Life Technologies) using random hexamerprimers. Total DNA was extracted in triplicate from allsamples using a modiﬁed Miller method (Sagova-Mareckovaet al., 2008) and cleaned with a Geneclean Turbo Kit (MPBiomedicals). Bacterial and fungal rDNAs were quantiﬁed byquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the1108f and 1132r primers for bacteria (Wilmotte et al., 1993;Amann et al., 1995) and the FR1/FF390 primers for fungi(Prévost-Bouré et al., 2011).For the microbial community analysis, PCR ampliﬁcation ofthe fungal ITS2 region from DNA and cDNA was performedusing barcoded gITS7 and ITS4 (Ihrmark et al., 2012) in threePCR reactions per sample. PCR reactions contained 2.5 μlo f10×buffer for DyNAzyme DNA Polymerase, 0.75 μlo fB S A(20 mg ml−1), 1μl of each primer (0.01 mM), 0.5 μlo fP C RNucleotide Mix (10 mM each), 0.75 μl polymerase (2 U μl−1DyNAZyme II DNA polymerase 1: 24 Pfu DNA polymerase)and 1 μl of template DNA or cDNA. Cycling conditions were94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 62°C for 1 min,and 72°C for 1 min, and a ﬁnal extension at 72°C for 10 min.The V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was ampliﬁed using thebarcoded primers 515F and 806R (Argonne National Labo-ratory) as described previously (Caporaso et al., 2012).Sequencing of fungal and bacterial amplicons was performedon ILLUMINA MISEQ.Sequence data processing and analysisThe amplicon sequencing data were processed using thepipelineSEED 1.2.1 (Ve ˇtrovský and Baldrian, 2013a). Brieﬂy,pair-end reads were merged using FASTQ -join (Aronesty,2013). Whole amplicons were processed for bacterial 16S,whereas the ITS2 region was extracted usingITSEXTRACTOR1.0.8 (Nilsson et al., 2010) before processing. Chimericsequences were detected using U SEARCH 7.0.1090 (Edgar,2010) and deleted, and sequences were clustered usingUPARSE implemented within U SEARCH (Edgar, 2013) at a 97%similarity level. Consensus Sequences were constructed foreach cluster, and the closest hits at a genus or species levelwere identiﬁed usingBLAST n against the Ribosomal DatabaseProject (Cole et al., 2014) and Genbank databases (for bac-teria) or UNITE (Koljalg et al., 2013) and GenBank for fungi.Sequences identiﬁed as nonbacterial or nonfungal were dis-carded. From 16S rRNA in DNA, bacterial genome countestimates were calculated based on the 16S copy numbers inSeasonal dynamics of a soil microbial community 297© 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Environmental Microbiology ,18, 288–301 14622920, 2016, 1, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.13026 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensethe closest available sequenced genome as described pre-viously (Ve ˇtrovský and Baldrian, 2013b). Sequence datahave been deposited in the metagenomics Rapid Annotationusing Subsystem Technology (MG RAST) public database(Meyer et al., 2008), data set number 4603354.3 for bacteriaand 4603355.3for fungi). Shannon–Wiener Index, speciesrichness and evenness were calculated for 1250 randomlychosen sequences per sample. The pipelineSEED 1.2.1(Veˇtrovský and Baldrian, 2013a) was used for data pre-processing and diversity calculations.Metatranscriptome reads were quality trimmed by remov-ing adapters with Trimmomatic (v 0.27) using I LLUMINATRUSEQ2-PEadapters with a seed mismatch threshold, pal-indrome clip threshold, and simple clip threshold set at 2, 30,and 10 respectively (Bolger et al., 2014). Furthermore,sequencing reads were ﬁltered by base call quality usingtheFASTX -TOOLKIT (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html), speciﬁcally fastq_quality_ﬁlter, with the followingparameters: −Q33 −q3 0 −p 50. Resulting sequences werenormalized using methods previously described in (Pell et al.,2012; Howe et al., 2014) and Khmer (v 0.7.1) and commandnormalise-by-median.py with the following parameters: −k2 0−C2 0 −N4−x 50e9. Next, errors were trimmed by removinglow abundance fragments of high coverage reads with Khmerand command ﬁlter-abund.py −V. The paired-end assemblyof the remaining reads was performed with the VELVET ASSEM -BLER (v 1.2.10, -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff auto -scaffoldingno; Zerbino and Birney, 2008) using odd k-mer lengthsranging from 33 to 63. Resulting assembled contigs weremerged usingCD-HITv4.6 (Li and Godzik, 2006; Fu et al.,2012) and MINIMUS 2A MOS v3.1.0 (Sommer et al., 2007).Broadly, protocols for this metatranscriptome assemblycan be found at https://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mrnaseq/index.html. Sequence data of all contigsequences have been deposited in the MG RAST data setnumber 4544233.3).Contig annotation was performed in MG RAST with an Evalue threshold of 10−4while also considering the representa-tive hit option (i.e., single best annotation for each feature).For contigs where multiple KEGG categories were assigned(<2%), all categories were counted as additional hits.Anoxia-induced reads were classiﬁed as those belonging tocorresponding functions deﬁned by Tveit and colleagues(2013). Transcripts of the putative mycorrhiza-related geneswere identiﬁed as those contigs givingTBLASTX hits with Evalues of <10−50to those genes of Laccaria bicolor , prefer-entially expressed in mycorrhizal symbiosis compared withfree mycelial growth (Larsen et al., 2010; Kohler et al., 2015).Because reliable assignment of most fungal transcripts todivisions (such as Ascomycota or Basidiomycota) was notpossible, the relative contribution of fungal divisions to tran-scription was quantiﬁed based on the abundance of tran-scripts of β-tubulin, a housekeeping gene whose sequencescan be reliably assigned thanks to sufficient coverage inGenBank (Begerow et al., 2010).For the metatranscriptomic data, individual sequence readsfrom each sample were mapped onto contigs usingBOWTIE 2.2.1(Langmead et al., 2009) with the default settings of: end-to-endalignment – sensitive. The mapping was used to calculatetranscript abundance, and data were expressed as: per basecoverage =read count ×read length / contig length. Abun-dances were always reported as normalized values, i.e., sharesof all transcripts in given sample, or, where indicated, shares ofall transcripts of a selected microbial taxon. For the analysis offunctional features, such as the KEGG categories (cf. Table S6),only those contigs belonging to archaea, bacteria and fungi andbelonging to cellular processes, environmental information pro-cessing, genetic information processing and metabolism at theKEGG level 1 were considered.Sequencing yielded 674 ×106reads (28 ×106±3×106reads per sample) that were assembled into 4 522 875contigs over 200 bases, including 645 342 contigs over 500bases and 98 246 over 1000 bases (mean length was 362bases). The longest contig had a length of 33 888 bases.Protein prediction yielded a total of 4 662 356 predictedcoding regions, of which 1 859 087 (39.9%) have beenassigned an annotation. A total of 1 311 357 features (70.5%of annotated features, 28.1% of all features) were assigned tofunctional categories. In terms of reads, 327 ×106reads(48.5%) mapped to contigs. Of the mapped reads, 24% hadhits to contigs annotated with taxonomy, and 13.4% to contigsannotated with both taxonomy and function.Statistical analysisSTATISTICA 7 (Statsoft, USA) or PAST 3.03 (http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/) were used for statistical analysis. Bray–Curtis distance was used as a metric of similarity betweensamples. Differences in soil variables were tested usingANOVA, and differences in relative abundances of individualfeatures (transcripts or microbial taxa) were tested using theMann–Whitney U-test, which assumes the measurements ona rank-order scale but does not assume normality of data.ANOSIM on Bray–Curtis distances was used for the analysisof differences among communities or transcript pools. Differ-ences at P<0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁ-cant. NMDS on Bray–Curtis distances was used to visualizedifferences among the transcription proﬁles of microbial taxa.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation(P504/12/0709, 13-06763S), the Ministry of Education, Youthand Sports of the Czech Republic (LD12048, LD12050) andthe research concept of the Institute of Microbiology of theASCR (RVO61388971).
