The emergence of portable and ﬂexible spectrometers couldprovide the large amount of spatial data needed. In particular, the ability of airborne imaging spectroscopy tocover large surfaces in a single campaign and to study the spatial distribution of soil properties with a highspatial resolution represents an opportunity for improving the monitoring of soil characteristics and soilthreats such as the decline of soil organic matter in the topsoil. However, airborne imaging spectroscopy hasbeen generally applied over small areas with homogeneous soil types and surface conditions. Here, ﬁvehyperspectral images acquired with the AHS-160 sensor (430 nm –2540 nm) were analysed with theobjective to map soil organic carbon (SOC) at a regional scale. The study area, covering a surface of ∼420 km2and located in Luxembourg, is characterized by different soil types and a high variation in SOC contents.Reﬂectance data were related to surface SOC contents of bare croplands by means of 3 different multivariatecalibration techniques: partial least square regression (PLSR), penalized-spline signal regression (PSR) andsupport vector machine regression (SVMR). The performance of these statistical tools was tested underdifferent combinations of calibration/validation sets (global and local calibrations strati ﬁed according toagro-geological zones, soil type and image number). Under global calibration, the Root Mean Square Error inthe Predictions reached 5.3 –6.2 g C kg−1. Under local calibrations, this error was reduced by a factor up to1.9. SOC maps of bare agricultural ﬁelds were produced using the best calibration model. Two map excerptswere shown, which display intra- and inter- ﬁeld variability of SOC contents possibly related to topographyand land management.© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionThe concern about the role of soil in the global carbon budget and theeffects of soil organic carbon (SOC) decline on soil quality stimulatedresearch on the development of ef ﬁcient and accurate methods to assessSOC stocks and ﬂuxes (e.g. Smith, 2004 ). SOC stocks are characterized bya slow temporal dynamic and a high spatial variability, whichcomplicates the detection of changes due to environmental or humanfactors. This can be overcome by using a high sampling density. Sincesuch strategy is labor-intensive, this has been done only in a limited setof well-documented areas or long-term SOC experiments, which arewidely used to calibrate models (see e.g. Powlson et al., 1998 ).Obviously, the monitoring of key soil properties (SOC, organic N,electrical conductivity, etc.) for modeling soil processes or survey soilconditions suffers from the lack of techniques able to provide data with ahigh spatial and temporal resolution.Comparatively faster than traditional measuring techniques,spectroscopy can exploit the information carried by re ﬂectance inthe visible and near-infrared (VNIR: 400 –1100 nm) and shortwaveinfrared (SWIR: 1100 –2500 nm) part of the electro-magnetic spec-trum to measure soil properties. The emergence of portable andﬂexible spectrometers that can either be used directly in the ﬁeld ormounted on aircrafts could be the solution to provide the largeamount of spatial data required by soil monitoring. Spectra can nowbe recorded either in the laboratory or in the ﬁeld (e.g. Stevens et al.,2008 ). They can be collected one point at a time (point spectrometry),as an array of measurements (on-line spectrometry; e.g. a sensor ismounted on a tractor and its position recorded by a GPS receiver) or asa two dimensional array of measurements (imaging spectrometry;e.g. the sensor records the surface aboard a plane or satellite).Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address: antoine.stevens@uclouvain.be (A.

All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.geoderma.2009.11.032Contents lists available at ScienceDirectGeodermajournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/geodermaWhile the ﬁrst studies on the relationship between soil propertiesand soil spectra were qualitative in nature (eg. Stoner and Baumgardner,1981 ), further investigations adopted with success a quantitativeapproach using multivariate statistic tools (e.g. Dalal and Henry, 1986;Ben-Dor and Banin, 1995 ). Nowadays, the potential of soil quantitativespectral analysis has been repeatedly demonstrated in the laboratory(e.g. Malley et al., 2004; Rossel et al., 2006 ). Laboratory spectroscopy isoften called upon as a viable alternative for several routine agronomicsoil analyses (e.g. Cohen et al., 2007 ). Due to its capacity to determineseveral soil properties simultaneously, VNIR –SWIR spectroscopy hasbeen applied successfully to build soil quality indicators ( Idowu et al.,2008 ) and assess other soil functions or threats ( Cécillon et al., 2008 ).SOC is one of the main soil chromophores ( Ben-Dor et al., 1999 )a n di scorrelated with other chromophores such as clays and iron oxide.Hence, SOC concentration can be generally determined with a goodaccuracy compared to other soil properties (see Table 1 in Rossel et al.,2006 ).Early experiments such as the works of Henderson et al. (1989)and Clark et al. (1990) opened the way to the quantitative mapping ofrocks, mineral and soil properties by means of airborne or satellite-borne imaging spectrometers. Ben-Dor et al. (2002) were the ﬁrst touse multivariate calibration statistics to map soil characteristics fromremotely-sensed data. Since then, several authors adopted the sameapproach to map soil properties such as C, N and clay content, pH orCation Exchange Capacity (e.g. Selige et al., 2006; De Tar et al., 2008;Lagacherie et al., 2008 ). SOC content, in particular, has been oftenrelated to re ﬂectance data acquired by airborne spectrometers. Forinstance, Ben-Dor et al. (2002) obtained a R2of 0.83 betweenpredicted and observed values of soil organic matter (SOM) in claysoils from Israel using DAIS-7915 airborne data (400 –2500 nm).Testing the performance of the CASI airborne hyperspectral sensor(400 –950 nm) to map SOC contents of agricultural ﬁelds, Uno et al.(2005) and Stevens et al. (2006) obtained a R2of respectively 0.74 and0.85. Selige et al. (2006) achieved slightly better results ( R2=0.9)with the HyMap sensor (420 –2480 nm) while Patzold et al. (2008)obtained a R2of 0.74 with the same sensor and a very limited set ofcomposite soil samples. Less satisfactory prediction models of SOMwere obtained by Bajwa and Tian (2005) with the RDACS/H-3 sensor(471 –828 nm; R2=0.66) and De Tar et al. (2008) with the AVNIRsensor (429 –1010 nm; R2=0.48). SOC predictions based on space-borne sensors are probably also less accurate due to lower signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, as showed by Gomez et al. (2008)with Hyperion images ( R2=0.51).A review of the use of imaging spectroscopy for soil scienceapplication is given by Ben-Dor et al. (2008) . Three major constraintsto the widespread use of remote sensing for soil applications can beindenti ﬁed ( Ben-Dor et al., 2008 ): (i) atmospheric absorptionsinterfering with the spectral measure, (ii) low signal-to-noise ratiodue to a short integration time over the target area and (iii) spatialvariation in surface soil properties (e.g. soil roughness, crusting,vegetation residue, moisture) which induces a spectral variability notdirectly related to the property studied. These disturbing factorschallenge the achievement of robust calibrations and repeatableresults ( Lagacherie et al., 2008; Stevens et al., 2008 ).Due to the constraints mentioned above, airborne imagingspectroscopy was thus far applied over small areas ( Uno et al.,2005; Stevens et al., 2006 ), homogeneous soil types ( Ben-Dor et al.,2002 ) and a relatively small set of agricultural ﬁelds ( Bajwa and Tian,2005; De Tar et al., 2008 ) or soil samples ( Selige et al., 2006; Patzoldet al., 2008 ). We propose in this paper to test the ability of imagingspectroscopy to predict SOC over a large area ( ∼420 km2) withdifferent soil types and a gradient in SOC contents. Hyperspectralairborne data were related to surface SOC contents of bare croplandsoils by means of 3 different multivariate calibration techniques:Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Penalized-spline SignalRegression (PSR) and least square Support Vector Machine Regression(SVMR). To the best of our knowledge, the two latter multivariatecalibration techniques were not yet used to analyse a soil property inthe remote sensing domain. As shown by Marx and Eilers (2003) , PSRmay give more stable predictions under changing environmentalconditions than PLSR. At large scales, this technique may thereforehold an advantage over classical PLSR calibration of which predictionsmay be very sensitive to uncontrollable factors affecting soil re ﬂec-tance such as moisture content or roughness ( Stevens et al., 2008 ).SVMR is a machine learning method has recently gained widespreadacceptance in data-driven non-linear modelling applications. Themethod has several desirable characteristics, including good gener-alization abilities and robustness of the regression function, and theability to deal with sparse data ( Venkoba Rao and Gopalakrishna,2009 ). Calibrations were run either on all samples collected in thestudy area (referred later to as “global calibration ”) or separately ondifferent sets of samples grouped according to soil class, agro-geological regions or image number (referred later to as “localcalibrations ”). Then, the best multivariate model was chosen toproduce SOC maps of bare agricultural ﬁelds.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study areaThe study area consisted of a north-south transect of ∼7 km widthand∼60 km length (NW corner: 50°03 ′N 6°03 ′E; SE corner: 49°33 ′N6°12 ′E), crossing 4 of the 5 agro-geological regions of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg ( Fig. 1 ). The country has a temperate semi-oceanic climate with mean temperatures (Luxembourg city) rangingfrom 0.7 °C in January to 17 °C in July. In the Oesling region in thenorth both extremes are slightly lower. The mean annual rainfall isapproximately 750 mm. Dominant soil types belong to the WorldReference Base groups Cambisols, Luvisols, Arenosols, and Calcisols(FAO, 1998 ). Although of a small area (2586 km2), Luxembourg ischaracterized by a remarkably diverse physiogeography. The Oeslingregion, covering one third of the country and with a mean altitude of450 m, is part of the Ardennes massif. This is a rather homogeneousarea on a substrate of Devonian slate with predominantly shallowsandy and sandy-loam soils (Dystric Regosols and Dystric Cambisols).The most common crop rotation in the Oesling area is a 6 to 8 year-rotation with cultivation of cereals for 3 or 4 years, followed by ﬁeldforage for another 3 or 4 years. The southern part of Luxembourg, theGutland, includes (i) the Minette basin in the south characterized byred loamy/clay soils (Haplic and Gleyic Luvisols), formed by marls andsandstones covered with ferruginous sediments; (ii) central part ofthe Gutland (Central zone) with a substratum of Secondary sandstoneand sandy soils (mostly Haplic Luvisols); (iii) the Redange-Diekircharea with soils of the loam-loess type on red sandstone and sandstone(Dystric Cambisols). This region has a more varied topography and anaverage elevation of 244 m. The most common crop rotation in theGutland is a three years rotation with winter wheat, winter barley andsilage maize.2.2. Data collection and soil analysisGround sampling was realized on 4 –9th October 2007. This timeperiod was selected to ensure a high proportion of bare soils withinthe study area after harvest and ploughing of most of maize ﬁelds.Fifteen ﬁelds were retained (3 –4 by agro-geological region) forintensive soil sampling (6 to 23 samples per ﬁeld). Moreover, 83additional samples were collected in 36 scattered ﬁelds (2 –3 samplesperﬁeld) to include, as much as possible, soil and spectral variabilityin the calibration models. The total amount of rainfall during theprevious seven-day period before the over ﬂight was 23.2 mm with anaverage air temperature of 10.3 °C (Luxembourg city). There had beenno rain during at least three days before the over ﬂight.33 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45A total of 325 soil samples were taken (49 –97 samples in eachagro-geological zone) for SOC analyses. These samples were com-posed of 10 sub-samples collected to a depth of 5 cm at randomlocations within a 7.5 m wide square centered on the geographicalposition of a sampling plot (recorded by a GPS receiver in differentialmode). Soil organic carbon of air-dried and sieved (2 mm) sampleswas analyzed by dry-combustion with a LECO CN analyzer. Threesamples containing carbonates (detected using effervescence to 1 MHCl) were removed from the dataset. For moisture analyses, 159arbitrarily-selected soil samples were taken the day of the over ﬂightwithin the sampling plot in the very ﬁrst millimeters (up to 1 cm) ofthe soil surface and put in hermetic plastic bag. Soil moisture wasdetermined gravimetrically. Ferrous oxide concentrations weremeasured on a subset of 21 samples (3 –4 in each soil type) usingdithionite extraction.For each of the 325 sample plots, the corresponding soil types wereextracted from a 1/100,000 soil map of the Grand Duchy ofLuxembourg containing 27 soil classes. Sampling plots belong to 11soil classes, which can be reduced to 6 main textural classes (clay,loamy-clay, loam, sandy-loam, sand, colluvium and alluvium) and onemarginal class containing only 2 samples (this unit contains soilslocated in the valley bottom where springs occur).2.3. Imaging spectroscopyThe Airborne Hyperspectral Sensor 160 (AHS) onboard of a CASA212-200 aircraft recorded, under a cloudless sky, ﬁve hyperspectralimages with a swath of 1.96 km ( ∼30% of across track overlapping),length of ∼60 km and spatial resolution of 2.6×2.6 m. The AHS is awhiskbroom point scanner with an Instantaneous Field Of View of2.5 mrad, Field Of View of 90° (750 pixels with 16% overlap) and 63spectral bands covering the range between 430 and 2540 nm. TheAHS is con ﬁgured to provide 20 bands with a Full Width at HalfMaximum (FWHM) of 30 nm between 430 and 1030 nm (Visible andNear Infrared; VNIR), 42 bands with a FWHM of 18 nm between 1994and 2540 nm (Short Wave Infrared; hereafter SWIR2), complementedby an isolated band centered at 1600 nm with a FHWM of 90 nm(hereafter, SWIR1).At-sensor radiance data with corresponding geographical posi-tions were processed by the Central Data Processing Center of theFig. 1. Map of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, with sampling points (dots), ﬂight line (bold rectangle), and limits of agro-geological zones (dotted lines). The two stars are locationsfor which SOC content of bare ﬁelds was mapped (see Fig. 8 ).34 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologische Onderzoek (CDPC-VITO) atMol (Belgium), which provided geometrically and atmosphericallycorrected at-surface re ﬂectance values. The geometric correction wasperformed by means of direct georeferencing (i.e. direct measure-ment of the position and orientation of a sensor using GPS indifferential mode and Inertial Navigation System measurement data)over a digital elevation model. The output grid contained positionsand viewing geometry parameters needed for the atmosphericcorrection. Atmospheric in ﬂuences on radiances were then removedwith the MODTRAN4 radiative transfer code ( Berk et al., 1999 ).Visibility and water vapor parameters of MODTRAN4 were estimatedfrom the image itself using methods of Richter et al. (2006) andRodger and Lynch (2001) . The ﬁnal step consisted in the resampling ofatmospherically-corrected data.Images were manipulated using IDL language and ENVI software(ITT VIS, Boulder, CO). First, a mask was applied to the data cube tokeep pixels of bare soil surface only. The soil mask was created asfollows: in a ﬁrst step soils were separated from green vegetation(crops and forest) and urban/concrete structures using maximumlikelihood classi ﬁcation, following a post classi ﬁcation step to removeisolated pixels from the mask using a median ﬁlter (3 by 3 pixelwindow). A manual control of the classi ﬁcation results was accom-plished to remove residual small roads from the soil mask. In a furtherstep bare soil pixel were separated from soils with yellow cropresidues or minor green vegetation cover using k-means clustering.Then, a ﬁlter of 3 by 3 pixel window (corresponding to the size ofsampling plots) was passed through each masked image. Spectral dataof the sampling sites were extracted from their correspondingpositions in each masked image. Some sampling sites were coveredwith residual vegetation or affected by shadow from surroundingtrees and were excluded from the database (19 out of 325). A total of413 spectra were acquired. However, some plots appeared twice inthe dataset due to images overlapping. Therefore, a second datasetwas created by comparing the position of redundant spectra andkeeping those with the lowest view zenith angle. This ﬁnal datasetcontained 306 spectra. A Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each spectralband was estimated from the imagery by dividing the averagereﬂectance values of homogeneous (black-, gray- and white-colored)targets by their standard deviation, according to the method of Ben-Dor and Levin (2000) .2.4. Statistical analyses2.4.1. Signal preprocessingSeveral mathematical preprocessing steps were applied to the rawreﬂectance values. These pre-treatments included: (i) absorbance(−logR), (ii) 1st and 2nd derivatives, (ii) 1st and 2nd gap derivatives(Norris and Williams, 1984 ), (iii) Savitzky –Golay smoothing andderivatives ( Savitzky and Golay. 1964 ), (iv) Whittaker smoothing(Eilers, 2003 ), (v) standard normal variate transformation anddetrending ( Barnes et al., 1989 ) or (vii) a combination of the previous.These transformations aim to decrease the noise and enhance possiblespectral features linked to the property studied. For instance, Vasqueset al. (2008) found that Savitzky –Golay algorithm consistentlyimproved the ability of their models to predict soil carbon. Eachpre-treatment was then calibrated to SOC with a multivariate model.2.4.2. Calibration and validation setsAs a general rule, two thirds of the dataset have been chosen byrandom strati ﬁed sampling and used in the calibration set. The rest wasused for validation purposes. This validation set cannot be considered tobe completely independent from the calibration set due to the spatialautocorrelation in spectral data or SOC content arising between samplessituated in close proximity or belonging to the same ﬁeld. Asdemonstrated by Brown et al. (2005) , a random selection of non-independent validation samples may overestimate the true accuracy incomparison with independent samples. Such problem is likely to put indoubt the reliability of validation results if the calibration set is notsufﬁciently diverse in terms of SOC contents or spectral characteristics torepresent their actual variation within the study area. However, thesampling of 83 locations (out of 325) in 36 scattered ﬁelds may havedecreased this problem of non-independence.Several combinations of calibration/validation sets were compared.First, a “global ”calibration set containing spectral data of the entirestudy area was created. Sampling strata were the principal soil type(clay, silty-clay, silt, sandy-loam, sand) and agro-geological region(“Oesling ”,“Minette ”,“Central ”,“Redange-Diekirch ”). Secondly, a seriesof“local ”calibration/validation sets regrouped by soil type, agro-geological region and image number were constructed in order toproduce a statistical model for each group separately. Sampling stratawere soil types, agro-geological regions and image number. Thisstrategy has been adopted because using spectral data from heteroge-neous areas in terms of geology or soil type is known to diminish theFig. 2. Box -and-whisker plots of (a) OC content in g C kg−1as a function of soil type andagro-geological region, (b) gravimetric moisture content in % as a function of soil typeand (c) ferrous oxides content in g Fe kg−1as a function of agro-geological regions.Number of samples is mentioned within brackets.35 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45predictive ability of VNIR –SWIR spectroscopy (e.g. Udelhoven et al.,2003 ). The rationale behind the use of calibration based on each image isto estimate whether small differences in light or atmospheric conditionsbetween images may in ﬂuence the quality of the prediction. Thesevariations cannot be perfectly modeled by atmospheric corrections(Ben-Dor et al., 2004 ), resulting possibly in non-comparable spectrabetween images. Each image crossed the 4 agro-geological regions(Fig. 1 ) and covered a large range of SOC content and soil types. Samplesfeaturing within the overlap of neighboring images (i.e. redundantspectra) were included in these image-based calibrations.2.4.3. Multivariate techniquesSpectral data were analyzed with 3 different multivariate tech-niques: (i) Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), (ii) Penalized-spineSignal Regression (PSR) and (iii) Support Vector Machine Regression(SVMR). Statistical manipulations were carried out with the R software(R Development Core Team, 2007 ) and, in particular, with the PLSpackage of Wehrens and Mevik (2007) and PSR S-plus functionsproposed in Marx and Eilers (2002) . For the SVMR analysis, the SVM-KMMatlab Toolbox of Canu et al. (2005) was used.2.4.3.1. Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). PLSR projects predictors(Xvariables) and response ( Yvariable) into a low-dimensional space (i.e.a set of orthogonal variables called Latent Variables, maximizing thecovariance between X-a n d Y-scores). A detailed description of the PLSalgorithm is given by Wold et al. (2001) . PLS regressions were ﬁtted withthe classical orthogonal scores algorithm ( Wehrens and Mevik, 2007 ). APrincipal Component Analysis was run prior to the PLSR to calculate foreach spectrum the standardized Mahalanobis distance ( H) to the averagespectrum ( Shenk and Westerhaus, 1991 ). Spectra with H>3( X-outliers)were removed. In order to avoid the problem of over ﬁtting, a critical stepin the algorithm is the determination of the appropriate number ofLatent Variables. This is usually determined by minimizing the value ofthe Predictive Residual Sum of Square (PRESS) by leave-one-out cross-validation. Among other drawbacks, PRESS values do not present a clearglobal minimum, which compels to resort to subjective decision ruleslike ‘theﬁrst local minimum ’or‘the start of the plateau ’(Faber andRajko, 2007 ). Therefore, we implemented in R the randomization-testdescribed by Faber and Rajko (2007) , which allows to check thestatistical signi ﬁcance of each component entering the model. Thecritical value αof the test was set to 0.1. Y-outliers were detected afterthe PLSR based on the ratio between residuals and the Root Mean SquareError in the Calibration set (RMSEC), also called t-statistic. Samples withat-statistic (in absolute value) greater than 2.5 were considered asoutliers. Then, similarly to the algorithm proposed by Koshoubu et al.(2001) , calibrations were run in a loop until the number of outliersreaches zero. The best pre-treatment was considered to be the one withthe highest Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD). RPD is the ratiobetween Standard Deviation (SD) of the validation set divided by theRMSEP (RMSE in the validation set). Chang et al. (2001) deﬁned 3categories of models according to their RPD values: (i) models incategory A (RPD >2) are considered to accurately predict a givenFig. 3. Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the AHS-160 sensor (dimensionless) as a function of wavelength (band number within brackets), image number and target colo r (black, gray, white).Fig. 4. Reﬂectance (in %) of mean spectrum as a function of (a) soil type and (b) OCclass. The grey box in ﬁgure (b) highlights a small absorption feature (see text forexplanations).36 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45property, (ii) models in category B (1.4<RPD <2) belong to anintermediate class and (iii) models in category C (RPD <1.4) have noprediction ability.2.4.3.2. Penalized-spline Signal Regression (PSR). Developed by Marx andEilers (1999) , PSR is able –like PLSR –to solve a multivariate calibrationproblem in which the predictors are highly correlated and their numberis exceeding the number of observations. However, while in PLSR theorder of predictors (i.e. wavelengths in spectroscopy) has no in ﬂuenceon the model, PSR forces the coef ﬁcient of the regression to varysmoothly across the wavelengths. This is done by projecting thecoefﬁcients onto a set of smooth functions (B-splines). Marx and Eilers(1999) used several published or publicly available spectral data todemonstrate that this rather simple solution to a multivariatecalibration problem offers comparable performance relative to PrincipalComponents Regression (PCR) and PLSR. Furthermore, regressioncoefﬁcients are easier to interpret due to the absence of noisy features.Marx and Eilers (2002) compared the stability of PLSR, PCR and PSR indetermining the composition of a mixture of water, ethanol andisopropanol measured under several temperature conditions, whichcaused a shifting of spectra across temperature. Their results suggeststhat PSR tends to be less sensitive to changing temperature (i.e.predictions are less biased) than PCR and PLSR, especially in the case ofderivative spectra. In the remote sensing domain, this clearly representsan advantage since the spectral information in an hyperspectral imagemay not be fully consistent due either to variations in the measuringenvironment (atmospheric attenuation) during the recording processor spatial variability in surface properties (e.g. roughness, moisturecontent) within a large study area. The smoothness is controlled byimposing a penalty on the difference between adjacent B-splinecoefﬁcients (i.e. using Penalized-splines, see Eilers and Marx, 1996 ).Several PSR parameters must be ﬁxed, of which (i) d, the order ofpenalty difference (usually between 0 and 3), (ii) the degree ofB-splines and (iii) the number of intervals between knots (the pointwhere B-splines join). After several tests, it was found that betterresults were obtained with d=3, degree=4, and intervals=5.Performance indicators as well as outlier detection algorithms wereequivalent to the ones used in PLSR.2.4.3.3. Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR). SVMR represent adifferent model class compared with the previous techniques since itis based on statistical learning theory ( Vapnik, 1995 ). The mostvaluable properties of SVMs are their ability to handle large inputspaces ef ﬁciently, to deal with noisy patterns and multi-modal classdistributions, and their restriction on only a subset of training data inorder to ﬁt a (non-linear) function. The SVMR methodology isdescribed in detail in Schölkopf and Smola (2002) . In principle, aninput vector Xis mapped from the input domain into a higherdimensional feature space via a kernel function, where data are spreadout in a way that facilitates the ﬁnding of an interpolation function(Vapnik 1995 ). The kernel function allows mapping the dataimplicitly into the feature space, where the SVMR is trained withoutneeding to represent the feature vectors explicitly ( Cristianini andShawe-Taylor, 2003 ). The goal is to identify an interpolation functionthat is has at the same time at most deviation εfrom the observationsin the training data set and that is at the same time as ﬂat as possible.This means that errors less than εare neglected while largerdeviations are not accepted. This corresponds to ﬁtting a tube withradius εto the training data using boundary samples, the so-calledsupport vectors (SV). A trade-off has to be found between modelcomplexity and points lying outside of the tube, which is solved usingQuadratic Programming (QP) techniques ( Schölkopf and Smola,2002 ). The optimization requires ﬁxing a free regularization param-eter Cbeforehand that con ﬁnes the in ﬂuence of critical trainingpatterns.

For Y-outlier detection, a con ﬁdence level of threestandard deviations of the mean was considered. This outlierdetection procedure is different from the one used in PLSR and PSRdue to the higher computing time compared to other multivariatetechniques. For the same reason, it was not possible to test every pre-treatments, so that calibrations were run only on raw re ﬂectance. Thismay introduce inconsistencies when comparing calibrations from thedifferent techniques. However, validation results (RMSEP, RPD) arecomparable because potential outliers are not removed.3. Results and discussion3.1. Soil samples descriptive statisticsSOC contents varied from 7 to 61 g C kg−1and differed markedlybetween soil types and agro-geological regions ( Fig. 2 a). For instance,soils of the Oesling area (North) contained, on average, more thantwice the SOC content observed in the Minette area (South). Exceptfor the Minette area, SOC contents showed also a high variabilitywithin the same region, emphasizing the need for techniques able tomeasure SOC with a high spatial resolution. Large disparities couldalso be noticed when looking at SOC content as a function of soil type.Sand, sandy-loam and clay-loam soils exhibited a relatively lowvariation and contained less than 25 g C kg−1while clay, colluvial –alluvial and loam soils may contain up to 40 g C kg−1and present alarge range of SOC contents.Moisture content, as measured during the ﬁeld campaign, wasrelatively low (median: 5.9%, range: 0.9 –19.1%) and varied greatlyaccording to soil type ( Fig. 2 b). Higher moisture contents were foundin clay and colluvial –alluvial soils than in sand, sandy-loam and loamsoils. While this relationship between texture and moisture content islikely to be valid, this can also partly result from the samplingprotocol. Theoretically, only the ﬁrst few mm of the soil should havebeen sampled. However, this protocol is particularly dif ﬁcult to followfor clay soils due to the higher degree of aggregate cohesion.Therefore, since water content increases rapidly with soil depth, thistextural class may exhibit higher moisture than expected.A strong variation in ferrous oxides was also found between agro-geological regions, with soils of the Minette and Oesling areas havingmuch higher contents than the ones in Central and Redange –Diekirchareas ( Fig. 2 c). No correlation between Fe and SOC content wasobserved ( R=−0.17).3.2. Spectral data quality and analysisThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of AHS images varied from 10:1 to70:1 in the VNIR –SWIR1 part of the spectrum, depending on the targetarea (white, gray or black surfaces, Fig. 3 ) while a SNR lower than 20:1was observed for the SWIR2 part of the spectrum (bands from 22 to 63).Such pattern was also observed by Stevens et al (2008) with the samesensor. Bands from 22 to 25 and 56 to 63 showed even lower SNR due towater absorption and low atmospheric transmission and were furtherremoved before the statistical analysis. Although the SWIR2 is charac-terized generally by low SNR, it was decided to keep spectral informationat these wavelengths to investigate to which extent PLSR, PSR and SVMRa r ea b l et od e a lw i t hn o i s yf e a t u r e s .T h e refore, multivariate calibrationswere applied either only over the VNIR –SWIR1 part of the spectrum(430 –1600 nm) or over the entire spectral range of the sensor (VNIR –SWIR1 –SWIR2 430 –2411 nm) for comparison.Visual analysis of spectral data revealed that re ﬂectance variedwith soil type ( Fig. 4 a). Average re ﬂectance decreased from sand,sandy-loam and loam soils to clay, clay-loam and colluvial –alluvialsoils. Most of the variation occurred in the SWIR part of the spectrumrather than in the VNIR. This was also mentioned by Ben-Dor et al.(1999) after analyzing 6 representative Israeli soil samples. Theobserved decrease of re ﬂectance may be partly related to mineralogybut also to differences in SOC or soil moisture content. In general, soilreﬂectance decreases with organic matter concentration ( Stoner andBaumgardner, 1981 ). There is also a strong negative exponentialrelationship between moisture content and soil re ﬂectance ( Lobelland Asner, 2002 ). The in ﬂuence of SOC content is highlighted inFig. 4 b showing mean re ﬂectance according to four SOC classes. Asmall absorption can be distinguished at 600 –750 nm as SOC contentincreases. Such feature is dif ﬁcult to assign to any speci ﬁc soilcomponent related to SOC. However, the visible part of the spectrum(400 –700 nm) is known to be a spectral region showing high absolutecorrelations with organic matter. For instance, based on 40 soilsamples originating from several climatic zones, Bartholomeus et al.(2008) found the highest correlation between inverse of re ﬂectanceand SOC at wavelengths between 640 nm and 690 nm.3.3. Model calibration and validationBest pre-treatments of spectral data for each multivariatecalibration technique were identi ﬁed based on highest RPD values.Model performance stat istics are gathered in Table 1 .W h e nconsidering global calibrations, RPD values oscillated between ∼1.5and∼2 depending on multivariate technique and spectral range. PLSRgave better results when restricted to the VNIR –SWIR1 spectral rangewhile the reverse was true with PSR. No differences were observedbetween SVMR models using the VNIR –SWIR1 region or the entirespectral range available. According to the classi ﬁcation of Chang et al.(2001) , the performance of the models fall in an intermediatecategory (1.4<RPD<2). This was con ﬁrmed by R2values in thevalidation set reaching 0.53 –0.74 with a relatively low bias in thevalidation set (0.01 –0.7 g C kg−1in absolute value). PSR performedclearly better in global mode than PLSR, regardless the spectral rangeconsidered. The increase in model accuracy was not spectacular(difference of 0.72 –1.02 g C kg−1for RMSECs and 0.33 –0.65 g C kg−1for RMSEPs). However, the analysis of predicted vs. observed values(Figs. 5a –b and 6a –b) showed that PLSR tends to strongly underes-timate high SOC values (>30 g C kg−1) while this phenomenon is lesssevere for PSR, resulting in a lower bias ( Table 1 ). This increasedprediction error at higher SOC content was also observed by Ben-Dorand Banin (1995) and Sorensen and Dalsgaard (2005) . Since PLSR andPSR are both linear techniques, this indicates that the relationshipbetween SOC and re ﬂectance is probably non-linear and therefore agood global calibration is dif ﬁcult to obtain. Such problem can beovercome by SVMR models, which are able to approximate non-linearfunction mappings between multidimensional spaces ( Schölkopf andSmola, 2002 ). While SVMR models yielded the highest RPD values inglobal mode (RPD=1.97), a substantial spread in observed vspredicted SOC values above 30 g C kg−1in the validation set indicatesthat the problem has not been entirely ﬁxed ( Fig. 7 b). Thisphenomenon does not appear in the calibration set ( Fig. 7 a), whichsuggests an over ﬁtting problem and emphasizes the need to validateﬂexible tools such as SVMR.These latter observations strengthened the approach consisting ofsubsetting the spectral data based on auxiliary information (soil type,region and image number) and run local calibrations over each subsetseparately. This strategy allowed, depending on the multivariatecalibration type, spectral range and attribute used to split the dataset,to improve considerably the accuracy of the models. The same kind ofFig. 5. Plots of predicted versus observedOC (g C kg−1) in the calibration (left column) and the validation (right column) sets as obtained byPLSR using only VNIR –SWIR1 spectral data after(a–b) global calibration, (c –d) local calibrations based on agro-geological regions, (e –f) local calibrations based on soil type and (g –h) local calibrations based on image number.39 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –4540 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45results was obtained by Van Waes et al. (2005) under laboratoryconditions. They showed that dividing samples into groups accordingto agricultural practices or texture improved the prediction of soilorganic carbon in grassland soils by 7 –16%. In our case, localcalibrations were able to grow RPD values by a factor 1.01 –1.9,increase R2up to 0.7 –0.89 and decrease RMSEC by 2.6 –6.5 g C kg−1and RMSEP by 0.8 –2.9 g C kg−1(Table 1 ). Biases in the validation setswere equivalent to the ﬁgures observed under global calibrations.Calibrations based on soil type and agro-geological regions had RPDvalues above 2, indicating very good predictive models. For PLSR and PSRmodels, calibrations based on regions ( Figs. 5c –da n d6 c –d) performed alittle less than those based on soil type ( Figs. 5e –fa n d6 e –f). Thesedifferences were mainly due to the relatively poor predictions onsamples located in the Central region compared to other regions(Figs. 5c –da n d6 c –d). A good local calibration seems rather dif ﬁcult toachieve in this area where both sandy and clayey soils –which may havevery different spectral characteristics as shown in Fig. 4 a–are present.On the other hand, local calibrations are of little bene ﬁt when the rangein SOC content is small within a given group (e.g. Minette area or sandysoils, see Figs. 2a and 5 –6). Indeed, RMSEC/RMSEP were often very largein comparison with variability in SOC content, resulting in a poorpredictive power (low RPD, Figs. 5c –da n d6 c –d). On the other hand,locally calibrated SVMR models were less accurate compared to PLSR/PSR models ( Fig. 7 c–da n de –f). In particular, Fig. 7 e–f illustrate thatloamy soils could not be satisfactorily modeled using soil related models.This is due to the fact that the SVMR is local in nature and requires, apartfrom a reliable choice of the free model parameters, a suf ﬁcient numberof trainings data to achieve good generalization properties. The linearstructures visible in all calibration data set in Fig. 7 and the associatedvery high coef ﬁcients of determination in Table 1 can be attributed to theconcept of support vectors that uses a subset of training samples todeﬁne the interpolation function in a high dimensional feature space.The improvement of local calibrations compared to global calibra-tions is less signi ﬁcant when image number was used (RPD<2). Thequality of the models is clearly degraded due to poor predictions inimages numbers 4 –5 for PLSR/PSR models ( Figs. 5g –ha n d6 g –h)a n dimage number 3 for SVMR models ( Fig. 7 g–h). Moreover, the totalnumber of outliers under image-based calibrations was much largerthan in other calibration types ( Table 1 ). The number of ﬁeld samplesper image (56 –116 per image) may have been not suf ﬁcient to producerobust calibrations considering the large variation in SOC content andsoil types. This may be also explained by the positions of the plots inrelation to the nadir of the sensor. Most of the outliers were found at theedges of the image with high view zenith angles, which are affected bystrong back-scattering or forward-scattering effects due to the largeﬁe l do fv i e wo ft h eA H S( 9 0 ° ) .One can also notice that the problem of non-linearity of PLSR andPSR models at high SOC content no longer occurs when applying localcalibrations ( Figs. 5 –6). This improvement cannot be attributed to therestricted range of SOC content within each soil type or region. Forinstance, clay soils as well as the Central and Oesling area showed avariability in SOC comparable to the one found in the entire data set(Fig. 2 a). Nevertheless, local PLSR and PSR calibrations were both ableto correctly predict high SOC content within these groups of samples(Figs. 5 –6). It appears therefore that non-linearity may be related toindirect correlations of SOC with other soil physical or chemicalconstituents. Fig. 2 b–c indicate that a relationship exists betweenmoisture content and soil type and between ferrous oxide content andagro-geological region. Water and iron oxides are considered, alongwith organic matter, as the main soil chromophores ( Ben-Dor et al.,1999 ). Moreover, absorption bands of ferrous oxides are located atabout 450 –700 nm ( Ben-Dor et al., 1999 ), which may interact withthe absorption feature observed at 600 –750 nm in Fig. 4 b, possiblyrelated to SOC content. Thus, the spectral variability induced by thesetwo constituents is likely to be reduced when considering thedifferent soil types and regions separately. Palacios-Orueta andUstin (1999) have for instance shown that the detection of ironcontent and SOM with AVIRIS data depends on the relative proportionof one property to the other and on the sand fraction. Underlaboratory conditions, Chang et al. (2005) produced better predictionswhen analyzing air-dried samples rather than moist samples.When comparing regression coef ﬁcients after processing of rawreﬂectance values by PLSR and PSR in global mode, it is evident thatPSR computes much smoother regression coef ﬁcients than PLSR(Fig. 8 ). This is likely to result in a greater stability and accuracy in thepredictions at locations which were under different environmentalconditions as the ones represented in the existing calibration/validation set. The divergence between coef ﬁcients is minor in theVNIR region, both techniques using high coef ﬁcients (in absolutevalues) near 600 –750 nm, suggesting that the absorption featureobserved in Fig. 4b is actually related to SOC. The difference in theregression coef ﬁcient is much more pronounced in the SWIR2 part ofthe spectrum (2080 –2411 nm). Coef ﬁcients of PLSR at these wave-lengths display chaotic features indicating that noisy componentshave been included in the prediction model ( Fig. 8 ). This explainswhy, unlike for PSR, PLSR calibrations based on the VNIR –SWIR1region only were generally more accurate in predicting the validationset than those based on the entire spectral range. Also, despite a lowSNR ( Fig. 3 ), PSR seemed able to exploit the information hidden in theSWIR2 region to predict SOC, which may explain higher RPD valuescompared to the ones obtained by PLSR ( Table 1 ).Henderson et al.(1992) found indeed that SWIR bands (1955 –1965, 2215, 2265, 2285 –2295, and 2315 –2495 nm) gave high correlation with SOC content(R2>0.96). These bands have the advantage to be uncorrelated withFe content and therefore may demonstrate a higher predictive powerfor different parent materials ( Henderson et al., 1992 ).The accuracy of SOC predictions in terms of RMSEP ( ∼3–6gCk g−1)was in the same range as those found in the literature ( Uno et al., 2005;Selige et al., 2006; Stevens et al., 2006, 2008 ). However, RPD values wereoften higher in our study due to the large variation in SOC contentsmeasured (see Fig. 2 ).Uno et al. (2005) obtained a RMSEP of 4.9 –5.92 gOM kg−1(i.e. ±2.8 –3.4 g OC kg−1). Using the AHS sensor, over an areain Belgian Lorraine (geologically similar to the Central area), Stevenset al. (2008) reached a RMSEP as low as 1.7 g C kg−1.H o w e v e r ,b o t hstudies were conducted within areas of small SOC variability, resultingﬁnally in relatively low RPD values ( Uno et al., 2005 :1 . 3 –1.57; Stevenset al., 2008 : 1.47). Stevens et al. (2006) achieved a RMSEP of 5.1 g C kg−1and RPD of 1.86 in a contrasted environment similar to the Oesling(Ardennes massif) and Central area (Belgian Lorraine). Our best modelsfor the Oesling and Central areas gave better results, with a RMSEP of4.5–4.7 g C kg−1and RPD of 1.8 –2.8 (results not shown). Selige et al.(2006) were able to produce models with RMSEPs of 2.2 –2.9 g C kg−1(no RPD values mentioned).3.4. Soil mappingThe local calibrations developed here demonstrated suf ﬁcientaccuracy to be applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis over the image's soilmask. However, for illustration purposes, only two agricultural ﬁeldswith spatial patterns of SOC are shown ( Fig. 9 ). Their location withinthe study area is represented by a star symbol in Fig. 1 . The SOCcontent in a single ﬁeld of∼2.5 ha varied by a factor two (22 g C kg−1to 46 g C kg−1) and was found to correspond more or less withtopography ( Fig. 9 a). High SOC content was mainly found in theFig. 6. Plots of predicted versus observed OC (g C kg−1) in the calibration (left column) and the validation (right column) sets as obtained by PSR using the entire spectral rangeavailable (VNIR –SWIR1 –SWIR2) after (a –b) global calibration, (c –d) local calibrations based on agro-geological regions, (e –f) local calibrations based on soil type and (g –h) localcalibrations based on image number.41 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –4542 A. Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45concavities and lower SOC content on the shoulder and the plateau.Such patterns have been studied by De Gryze et al. (2008) , whoestablished a strong relationship between SOC content and transportof sediments induced by erosional processes under conventionaltillage (deposition in concavities, erosion on convexities). Fig. 8 bshows large differences in SOC content between two adjacentagricultural ﬁelds (up to 5 –10 g C kg−1). No information was availableto explain this inter- ﬁeld variability in SOC. However, the patternsmay be related to differences in land management or land use history.The same kind of spatial pattern was detected by Stevens et al. (2006)and attributed to previous land use (former grassland). A possible effectof parcel limits can also be observed in Fig. 9 b. Higher SOC contents wereindeed found uphill of the ﬁeld borders (south-west of Fig. 9 b). This mayagain be controlled by soil erosion, which favours deposition ofsediments at uphill position of parcel limits. Follain et al. (2006)mapped the soil thickness in a landscape dominated by croplands inNormandy (France). They showed a signi ﬁcantly deeper soil upslopefrom hedgerows that had been removed during land consolidationseveral decades before. Van Wesemael et al. (2006) studied a smallcatchment in south-east Spain that had been converted to almondgroves in the 1970 s. Field borders and access roads across the slopeshad created lynchets in the landscape resulting in a sedimentation rateupslope of these ﬁeld borders of 21 tons ha−1y−1.As a matter of fact, these two small examples show that airborneimaging spectroscopy can represent a tool to improve regional SOCinventory assessments. As shown also by Odlare et al. (2005) , spatialvariability of SOC is often at a scale too detailed to be captured by acoarse sampling grid. This is true at the ﬁeld level, but it becomes evenmore critical at a landscape/regional scale. At these scales, SOCvariability induced by local transfer processes (e.g. erosion) interactswith variability related to broader pedogenetic factors (climate, soil)and generates often high uncertainties in regional SOC assessments(Goidts and van Wesemael, 2007 ). RMSEP observed in this study(∼3g C k g−1) seem still unsatisfactory in the context of SOCmonitoring relative to traditional method of analysis (standard errorof replicates < 1 g C kg−1; Genot, pers. comm.). The accuracy still hasto be improved before the technique can be exploited for SOCmonitoring. Nevertheless, imaging spectroscopy allows to unravel thespatial structure of SOC at the ﬁeld and regional scales and thereforewill be very useful for the design of ef ﬁcient sampling strategies (i.e.by avoiding pseudo-replication and selecting truly representativelocations). Hence, relatively few soil cores should be taken toaccurately measure SOC stocks and detect changes.4. ConclusionConsidering the large variation in SOC content and soil typesencountered in our study area, the results presented here showed thatairborne imaging spectroscopy can be an alternative to conventionalanalytical techniques. In general, a lack of ﬁt at high SOC content wasobserved under global calibrations. PSR showed a greater ability tohandle noisy spectral features, resulting in more robust calibrationsthan PLSR. Local calibrations based on soil types and agro-geologicalregions appeared to be more ef ﬁcient than global calibrations, due tothe correlation of the strata with important chromophores like soilmoisture or ferrous oxide content. The main difference between theSVMR models and the PLSR/PSR related approaches is that the formerperform better for the global data set. On the other hand, SVMRvalidation results are of minor quality for the soil and region relatedFig. 8.

Stevens et al. / Geoderma 158 (2010) 32 –45sub-models compared to the PLSR/PSR models. The analysis of ﬁeld-scale SOC maps revealed spatial patterns of SOC related to topographicand management variables, which con ﬁrmed the importance of bothinter- and intra- ﬁeld variability in the assessment of SOC contents atlarger scale.Despite these encouraging results, the exploitation for monitoringpurposes of SOC maps produced by airborne imaging spectroscopyshould still be considered with caution. In particular, a post-validationover ﬁelds not covered by the existing calibration/validation setswould be necessary to assess the actual predictive ability of airborneimaging spectroscopy for SOC determination at large scales. Anothercritical issue is the representativeness of the models and whether agiven pixel can be predicted by our models or not due e.g. todifferences in surface conditions. The results of this study suggest thatfurther research is needed on how to classify pixels according togeneral soil surface conditions to facilitate the development ofmeaningful local calibrations.AcknowledgmentsThe research in this paper is funded by the Belgian Science PolicyOfﬁce and the National Research Fund of Luxembourg in theframework of the STEREO II program —Project “Monitoring soilorganic carbon in croplands using imaging spectroscopy ”(SR/00/110).
