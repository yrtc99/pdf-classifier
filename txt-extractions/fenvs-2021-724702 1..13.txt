These activities were shown to deplete soil organic matterstocks, resulting in a decrease in microbial activity and soil organic carbon (SOC)content. Moreover, even with minimal use of organic sources in cultivated land, soilcarbon status deteriorated, particularly in subtropical climates. Integrated nutrientmanagement (INM), a modi ﬁed farming method, has the potential to effectively utilizeorganic and inorganic resources, to improve the quality of soils and crops, and makingfarming more economically viable and sustainable. The aim of this study was to use meta-analysis to quantify the effects of INM on crop production, soil carbon, and microbialactivity in Indian soils. During the years 1989 –2018, data from various research studies inIndia, mainly on nutrient management in rice and wheat crops, were collected. Meta-Win2.1 software was used to analyze the results, and signi ﬁcance was determined at p<0.05.The results showed that the yield of rice and wheat was 1.4 and 4.9% more in INM thanthat in 100% NPK (N: nitrogen, P: phosphorous, and K: potassium), and that respectiveyields were comparatively higher in loamy soils (2.8%) and clayey soils (1.0%). The INMtreatment increased SOC and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), resulting in improvedoverall soil quality. The SOC stock was increased by 23.8% in rice, 15.1% in wheat, 25.3%in loamy soils, and 14.4% in clayey soils in INM over 100% NPK. Microbial quotient (MQ)data showed signi ﬁcant trends between different management systems in both soil types,for example, INM >100% NPK >No NPK. Due to more soil cracking and reducedaggregate stability in the rice ﬁeld (greater short-term soil structural changes), the SOCstock loss in rice was higher than that in wheat. The CO2equivalent emissions were7.9 Mg ha−1higher in no NPK (control) than in 100% NPK, and 16.4 Mg ha−1higherin control than in INM. In other words, INM increased soil carbon sequestration byEdited by:Rosa Francaviglia,Council for Agricultural andEconomics Research (CREA), ItalyReviewed by:Sangeeta Lenka,Indian Institute of Soil Science (ICAR),IndiaDr. Bhabesh Gogoi,Assam Agricultural University, IndiaEsmaeil Bakhshandeh,Sari Agricultural Sciences and NaturalResources University, Iran*Correspondence:Sheetal Sharmasheetal.sharma@irri.orgRajeev Padbhushanrajpd01@gmail.comUpendra Kumarukumarmb@gmail.comSpecialty section:This article was submitted toSoil Processes,a section of the journalFrontiers in Environmental ScienceReceived: 14 June 2021Accepted: 31 August 2021Published: 13 October 2021Citation:Padbhushan R, Sharma S, Kumar U,Rana DS, Kohli A, Kaviraj M, Parmar B,Kumar R, Annapurna K, Sinha AK andGupta VVSR (2021) Meta-AnalysisApproach to Measure the Effect ofIntegrated Nutrient Management onCrop Performance, Microbial Activity,and Carbon Stocks in Indian Soils.Front.

Overall, the ﬁndings of this study show thatINM could be a viable farming system mode in India for improving crop production,increasing soil carbon sequestration, and improving microbial activity while remainingeconomically and environmentally sustainable.Keywords: Integrated nutrient management, Rice-wheat system, Soil texture, MBC, SOC, Microbial Quotient, CO 2equivalent emissionINTRODUCTIONSoil organic matter (SOM) is an essential determinant ofagricultural productivity, accounting for less than 5% of theoverall soil weight ( Banerjee et al., 2006 ), and it functions as asoil conditioner, source of nutrients, substrate for microbialactivity, and protector of the environment ( Schnitzer, 1991 ).Soil health status can be harmed from the continued adoptionof intensive cultivation practices and the continued use ofchemical fertilizers ( Anwar et al., 2005 ;Kumar et al., 2017 ;Kumar et al., 2018 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ), often leading todeclined soil organic carbon (SOC) ( Singh et al., 1999 ) andunsustainable crop production systems. There is a growingscienti ﬁc understanding that supports the use of organicfertilizer sources for soil sustainability and quality production,but the following issue remains, “Is this system sustainable forfood security? ”Furthermore, there is a scarcity of large quantitiesof high-quality organic materials for long-term use in croppingﬁelds ( Padbhushan et al., 2015 ;Padbhushan et al., 2016a ,b;Kumar et al., 2018 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ).The SOC has a signi ﬁcant effect on the physico-chemicaland biological properties of soil ( Kumar et al., 2018 ). Therefore,maintaining SOC in cropland is critical for improvingagricultural productivity while also lowering carbonemissions ( Rajan et al., 2012 ). Microbial biomass carbon(MBC), the mass of living components of soil organicmatter, is both a source and sink of biologically mediatednutrients. Changes in MBC and microbial turnover frommanagement practices including fertilizer application, tillage,and rotation can signi ﬁcantly impact on net N mineralizationand microbial immobilization ( Gupta et al., 2019 ). Since MBCis the dynamic component of SOC, it has been recommended asthe most sensitive measure of a change in the SOC status(Powlson et al., 1987 ;Friedel et al., 1996 ;Padbhushan et al.,2016a ,b). The MBC usually comprised 1 –5% of the TOC andcan detect a shift in the rate of organic matter turnover within1–2y e a r s( Gupta et al., 1994 ;Gonz alez-Quinones et al., 2011 ).The microbial quotient (MQ) is the ratio of MBC to SOC (%),and has been observed to adjust in a consistent manner as aresult of good management practices, and it is a useful indicatorto measure soil health ( Sparling, 1997 ).The processes by which SOC is lost or stabilized in the soil areaffected by nutrient management activities, impacting carboninputs and lability. In addition, wide carbon to nutrient (N, P, S)stoichiometric ratios of crop residues can also in ﬂuence theefﬁciency of conversion of residue C through microbialturnover into SOM pool ( Richardson et al., 2014 ). All thesefactors could in ﬂuence the net result in changes in the soilorganic carbon stock (SOC stock) in cropping soils ( Ghimireet al., 2017 ). In various climatic conditions (temperate totropical), SOC stock was lost by 60 –75% from native lands(Lal et al., 2007;Ghimire et al., 2015 ) due to intensivecultivation and inadequate management practices.The carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalent emission is also one ofthe most critical soil measures for determining the nature oforganic matter turnover and depletion of SOC stock(Padbhushan et al., 2020 ). By using proper managementmethods, SOC can be sequestered in the soil system ( Ghimireet al., 2017 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ). Some of the best soilmanagement practices for improving SOC and controllinglosses from the soil to the environment are the addition oforganic sources (e.g., manures), crop residue retention, andconservation tillage ( Bronson et al., 1998 ;Lal et al., 2007 ;Ghimire et al., 2015 ;Rakshit et al., 2018 ;Kumar et al., 2019 ).Integrated nutrient management (INM) has beendemonstrated to enhance SOC when compared to other soilmanagement approaches ( Majumder et al., 2008 ;Bhardwaj et al.,2019 ). This practice aids in the effective use of chemical fertilizersin conjunction with renewable nutrient sources. Chemicalfertilizers can meet the crop ’s immediate nutritional needs,while organic manures control nutrient absorption, boost soilquality, and have synergistic effects on crop growth ( Yadav andKumar, 2000 ;Bihari et al., 2018 ). Such integrated managementpractices are generally developed with an understanding of theinteractions among crop, soil, and climate ( Mahajan and Sharma,2005 ;Mahajan et al., 2008 ). They generally include theapplication of organic manures, and crop residue retentionthat bridges the gap in C to nutrient stoichiometric ratios, andthereby improve the ef ﬁciency of conversion of crop residue Cinto SOC which generates a new and stabilized SOM. Moreover,INM practice generally combines the traditional and advancedpractices of nutrient management into an ecologically sound andcost-effective farming system to nourish the crop for qualityproduce ( Janssen, 1993 ;Wu and Ma, 2015 ). Overall, it can be oneof the alternative approaches to promote soil sustainability as wellas to ensure food security for overgrowing population.Rice ( Oryza sativa ) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) are themain cereal crops in India, and they play an important role inensuring food security and increasing income for ruralpopulations. The rice –wheat system is widely used in theworld, occupying 12.3 million hectares of the total land areaand accounting for 77% of total food grain production (USDA,2020 –21). Our previous study on meta-analysis reported that theadoption of proper nutrient management practices can increasethe crop productivity, pro ﬁtability, and sustainability of riceand wheat crops in the Indian subcontinent ( Sharma et al.,Frontiers in Environmental Science | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 724702 2Padbhushan et al. Meta-Analysis Approach to Measure the Effect of INM2019 ). So, while the rice –wheat cropping system has long beenrecognized as an important contributor to food security, thechallenges associated with its long-term viability are the causefor concern ( Pittelkow et al., 2015 ). The system ’s long-termviability is threatened by decreasing SOM and nutrient statusdue to a lack of or injudicious use of organic sources, as well as animbalanced and injudicious use of inorganic fertilizers ( Sharmaet al., 1994 ;Ladha et al., 2009 ;Erenstein et al., 2012 ;Gathala et al.,2014 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ). It was reported that using inorganicsources only retains SOC levels, while using both organic andinorganic sources in a rice –wheat cropping system increases SOCnutrient levels ( Majumdar et al., 2008 ;Bhardwaj et al., 2019 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ).In the recent years, meta-analysis has gained importanceas a statistical approach to analyze the signi ﬁcant responsesof treatments from diverse individual studies to evolve anoverall general trend ( Miguez and Bollero, 2005 ;Gardnerand Drinkwater, 2009 ;Kallenbach and Grandy, 2011 ;Geisseler and Scow, 2014 ;McDaniel et al., 2014 ;Sharmaet al., 2019 ). The impact of nutrient management activitieson SOC has been well established globally through meta-analysis studies ( West and Post, 2002 ;Anderson-Teixeiraet al., 2009 ;Chivenge et al., 2011 ;Liu et al., 2014 ;Han et al.,2016 ;Qin et al., 2016 ;Haddaway et al., 2017 ). However,there has been little effort made to interrogate thequantitative evidence of effects of land use and nutrientmanagement systems, in relation to Indian soils throughmeta-analysis, to derive th e nature and magnitude of theeffects on SOC stocks and drivers of its turnover.

The speci ﬁc objectives were to determine theeffect of INM compared to other nutrient managementpractices in terms of the following: 1) rice and wheat cropperformance, 2) MBC and SOC levels, 3) microbial quotientand SOC stocks, and 4) estimates of SOC loss and CO2equivalent emissions.FIGURE 1 | (A) Location map showing major study sites of India; (B)different soil types predominant in India.

Meta-Analysis Approach to Measure the Effect of INMMATERIALS AND METHODSData Collection, Compilation, and SoilParameters Used in the Meta-Analysis StudyWe searched the relevant online available literatures by using the terms“soil, ”“rice and wheat crops, ”“nutrient management, ”“carbon, ”“microbial biomass carbon , ”and “India. ”The search was limitedto literatures from Indian studi es reported between 1989 and 2018. Tounderstand the impact of INM on crop performance, microbial activity,and soil carbon stocks in rice and wheat crops grown in Indian soils, atotal of 285 paired datasets from different published studies were sortedout according to a set of criteria for the meta-analysis study. All the dataused in this analysis came from on-station trials performed in India atv a r i o u ss i t e s( Figure 1A ). The selected study sites are the mostimportant in India since they re ﬂect the primary agroclimatic zonesand seasons in which rice and wheat crops are cultivated, as well ashaving common soil types. Moreover, India ’s most common soiltypes, which include sandy, loamy, sandy loam, clay loam, clayey,and clayey loam soils, were also included in this study ( Figure 1B ).Criteria Used for Data Collection1) Selected crops for this study were available in a rice –wheatcropping system as these crops were grown as main croppingsequence in India.2) The following treatments implemented for multiple seasons wereused for this study as follows: without fertilization (control or noNPK); balanced chemical fertilizer only, that is, recommendednitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) throughinorganic fertilizers (NPK); and integrated nutrient management(INM, integration of organic m anures like farmyard manure,vermicompost, green manures, biofertilizers, and other organicmaterials along with inorganic fertilizers).3) Soil textures used in this study were categorized as loamy(moderately coarse to medium ﬁne) and clayey (moderatelyﬁne to ﬁne).4) The broad climate categories of the major study areas weresubtropical arid, moist to humid climatic conditions in ﬂuencedby monsoonal seasonal variations. The areas were with threeprominent seasons: summer, rainy, and winter, and were underirrigated conditions.5) Selected parameters for this study were rice and wheat yield (kgha−1), soil pH, bulk density (BD, Mg m−3), soil organic carbon(SOC, %), available N (kg ha−1), available P (kg ha−1), available K(kg ha−1), and microbial biomass carbon MBC, (mg kg−1).Calculations for Soil Parameters Used inMeta-Analysis StudySoil organic carbon stocks (SOC stocks, Mg ha−1), microbialquotient (MQ, %), relative SOC stock loss (%), and carbondioxide equivalent emission (CO 2equivalent emission, Mgha−1) were derived from the primary data.SOC stock was calculated by using Equation 1 (Datta et al., 2015 ).SOC stock /parenleftbigMg ha−1/parenrightbig/equalsSOC /parenleftbiggk g−1/parenrightbigxB D /parenleftbigMg m−3/parenrightbigx soil depth (m)x1 0 .(1)TABLE 2 | Physico-chemical and biological properties of studied sites in Indian soils.Soil parameters Unit ofmeasurementWithout NPK 100% NPK INMSoil pH No (soil: water- 1:2 or 1:2.5) Minimum 6.00 5.70 6.05Maximum 8.66 8.72 8.72Average 7.70 7.78 7.78Bulk density (BD) Mg m−3Minimum 1.19 1.19 1.08Maximum 1.82 1.77 1.74Average 1.56 1.51 1.45Soil organic carbon (SOC) % Minimum 0.26 0.40 0.49Maximum 0.98 1.04 1.57Average 0.55 0.66 0.80Available nitrogen (av.

Forrice and wheat crops, as well as loamy and clayey soil textures, bothvariables were independently subjected to meta-analysis. NPK andINM treatments were compared over control treatment from thedifferent datasets and to determine the trends on the effect of INM onmicrobial activity and carbon stock. The meta-analysis was carriedout in two parts, with the ﬁrst examining the database collected fromvarious studies and the second understanding the comparativechanges between the different treatments. In the ﬁrst stage, theeffect size (ES) was computed for individual factor by Equation 5(Rosenberg et al., 2000 )a sf o l l o w s :ES/equalslnV/equalsln/bracketleftBiggYTYC/bracketrightBigg, (5)where V is the ratio between response variables Y Tand Y c,YTisthe mean of response variables (soil parameters) of the treatments(INM, 100% NPK), and YCis the mean of those variables withoutfertilization (control) as contro l. Datasets from various studiesobtained from variable conditions act as multiplicationreplications, and common standard deviation was being used inthe analysis through a number of observations applying a simplestatistical approach. The obtained ES from the individual studies waspooled using a mixed-effect model to measure the cumulative ES andconﬁdence intervals at 95 percent through bootstrapping with 4,999iterations ( Adams et al., 1997 ). The mixed-effect model is a random-effect meta-analytic model for categorical data ( Rosenberg et al.,2000;Sharma et al., 2019 ), assuming random variation amongstudies within a group and ﬁxed variation between groups.Elucidation of OutcomeFindings were back-transformed and shown as mean effect changein percent caused by treatments in relation to those withoutfertilization either in the table or bar graph. The signi ﬁcantdifferences were measured only at p<0.05. All the results fromthe meta-analysis are shown in either a table or bar graph to presentthe signi ﬁcant effect of compared nutrient managements.RESULTSImpact of INM on Crop Performance of Riceand Wheat Crops in IndiaThe meta-analysis data showed that INM had positive effect onrice and wheat crops over control and recommended dose offertilizers through chemicals only or 100% NPK ( Table 1 ). Theoverall grain yield irrespective of soil types was signi ﬁcantlyincreased in INM than in control in rice and wheat crops by80.5% ( n/equals190) and 91.1% ( n/equals95), respectively, whereas theyield for rice and wheat in INM was higher by 1.4% ( n/equals186) and4.9% ( n/equals77), respectively, over 100% NPK ( Table 1 ). Based onsoil textural groups (loamy and clayey), INM also had a positiveeffect over other nutrient management options irrespective ofcrops. The grain yield of rice and wheat was signi ﬁcantlyincreased in INM than in control treatment by 80.4% ( n/equals228) and 84.2% ( n/equals57), whereas the yield for rice and wheatin INM was higher by 2.8% ( n/equals206) and 1.0% ( n/equals57),respectively, over 100% NPK ( Table 1 ).Soil Characteristics Under DifferentNutrient Management PracticesSoil pH ranged from slightly acidic to alkaline with average valuesof 7.70, 7.78, and 7.78 in control, NPK, and INM treatments,respectively ( Table 2 ). Soil BD was lower in INM treatment than inNPK and control ( Table 2 ). The average values of BD in control,NPK, and INM were 1.56, 1.51, and 1.45 Mg m−3, respectively(Table 2 ). The minimum BD was observed in INM (1.08 Mg m−3),while the maximum BD was in control (1.82 Mg m−3)(Table 2 ).The trend of SOC was found in the order of INM >NPK>control.The average SOC was 0.55, 0.66, and 0.80% in control, NPK, andINM, respectively ( Table 2 ). A similar trend was also observed forAvailable N (av. N), Available P (av. P), and Available K (av. K).The average av. N, av. P, and av. K in control were 145.8, 16.0, and150.3 kg ha−1, respectively; for NPK, the values were 228.6, 21.2,and 178.7 kg ha−1; and for INM, the values were 209.1, 22.9, and184.9 kg ha−1, respectively ( Table 2 ). The average MBC was thehighest in INM (223 mg kg−1) followed by NPK (181 mg kg−1)a n dthe lowest in control (149 mg kg−1)(Table 2 ). The SOC stocks were4.6–26.6, 7.1 –27.6, and 7.9 –41.0 Mg ha−1in control, NPK, andINM treatments, respectively ( Table 2 ).

CO2equivalent emission was estimated tobe higher (7.9 Mg ha−1over NPK and 16.4 Mg ha−1over INM) incontrol than NPK and INM treatments ( Figure 3 ).DISCUSSIONMeta-analysis aided to extract general conclusions from a largeamount of data to determine how soil properties respond to INMin comparison to other nutrient management practices, as well as croptype and soil texture can in ﬂuence the results. This study presents asummary of results from experiments in India on crop performance,soil carbon, and microbial activity under various nutrient managementpractices in rice-wheat cropping systems ( Supplementary Table 1 ).FIGURE 3 | Loss in relative soil organic carbon stocks (relative SOC stocks loss) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalent emission in the treatment without NPK overthe 100% NPK and integrated nutrient management (INM) (Note: Metadata has been represented as mean ±S.E).FIGURE 4 | Graphical illustration depicts the performance of INM over no NPK and NPK in crops (rice and wheat) and soil types (loamy and clayey).Frontiers in Environmental Science | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 724702 7Padbhushan et al. Meta-Analysis Approach to Measure the Effect of INMOur ﬁndings revealed that crop production using INMpractice has shown a positive impact on rice and wheat cropsin Indian production systems. Results from this broad surveysuggest that increased yield from a combination of organic andinorganic fertilizers in rice and wheat crops in India could be aviable and sustainable nutrient management option ( Figure 4 ).Similarly, research from other countries also reported a positiveimpact of INM practices on crop production ( Kramer et al., 2002 ;Mtambanengwe and Mapfumo, 2006 ;Kimani et al., 2007 ;Chivenge et al., 2011 ). The yield bene ﬁts are generally higherwhen organic and inorganic fertilizers were used together, due tothe positive interactions between the two sources of nutrients,which increased nutrient supply and synchrony ( Myers et al.,1994 ;Palm et al., 2001a ,b;Vanlauwe et al., 2001a ,b,c). Thesynchronization would have increased the ef ﬁciency with whichthe nutrients from the two sources were used, resulting in positiveinteraction effects on crop production compared to noapplication (control) or single application (NPK). Additionally,improved availability of major macronutrients, as well asmicronutrients, would have contributed to the positive effectsobserved in the INM treatment ( Palm et al., 1997 ;Zingore et al.,2007 ).The present study also showed that INM application wasmore sustainable in loamy textured soils than in clayey soilsbased on yield response in rice and wheat crops. This could bebecause loamy soils generally have better drainage andaeration than those in clayey soils, thereby better soilporosity and increased plant-available water content,providing a favorable soil habitat for crop growth anddevelopment. Loamy soils also show higher yields partlydue to less cracking, that is, better soil structure during theearly stages of crop growth and development. Plant growth canbe hampered by soil cracking, which is more common in clayeysoils ( Chakraborty et al., 2017 ).Previous research in India has shown that adoption of INMpractices signi ﬁcantly enhanced yields in rice and wheat cropscompared to chemical fertilizers alone ( Bhattacharyya et al., 2003 ;Sharma et al., 2019 ). For a similar yield level, the use of INM savedNb y2 5 –50% under optimum economy return in wheat(Raguwanshi and Umat, 1994 ). The adoption of INM practicesimproved the soil nutrient status and bioavailability of severalnutrients in the soil. Yadav (2001) found the enhanced soilavailable nutrient status by the use of INM over the othernutrient management practices. Sharma and Sharma (2002)found that application of INM increased av. N, av. P, and av.Kb y6 –24, 7 –8, and 7 –32 kg ha−1in the soil, which corroboratedwith our study.The use of organic materials such as manures, composts, greenmanures, and biogas slurry either alone or in combination withchemical fertilizers was shown to increase crop productivity in anumber of crops, including rice and wheat ( Janssen, 1993 ;Braret al., 1999 ;Swarup and Yaduvanshi, 2000 ;Yadav and Kumar,2000 ;Yaduvanshi, 2001 ;Paikaray et al., 2002 ;Prasad et al., 2002 ;Kumar et al., 2003 ;Kharub et al., 2004 ;Bhoite, 2005 ;Bajpai et al.,2006 ;Mishra et al., 2006 ;Singh et al., 2006 ;Surekha and Rao,2009 ;Kumar and Singh, 2010 ;Zhang et al., 2012 ;Parkinson,2013 ;Kumar et al., 2014 ;Kumari et al., 2017 ;Sah et al., 2018 ).This meta-analysis study indicates that improvements in cropproductivity from the use of organic materials are widespreadacross different soils and many agroclimatic regions of India.Such improvements in crop productivity are generally seencompared to different types of chemical fertilizer use or nofertilizer application. Also, their use has shown to improvemany soil ’s physical, chemical, and biological properties,thereby facilitating better nutrient availability and overall soilfertility. However, it is evident that the magnitude of effect canvary depending upon the soil type, environment, and croppingsystems.Studies from the long-term intensive rice –wheat croppingsystem had widely reported that without fertilization, orimbalanced and injudicious chemical fertilization, there was ameasurable loss of organic C from soils, and hence, alternativeagricultural management practices were required to control theSOC loss to the environment ( Rasool et al., 2007 ;Lenka et al.,2014 ;Hossain et al., 2016 ). Our ﬁndings revealed that in both riceand wheat crops, SOC was accumulated by 16 –23% on additionof organic materials in INM over the 100% NPK. Similar resultswere observed on the increased accumulation of SOC (18 –62%)in a rice –wheat system from nutrient addition through organicsources (farm yard manure, straw and green manure) supplementwith reduced NPK compared to 100% NPK ( Gami et al., 2001 ;Majumder et al., 2008 ;Kukal et al., 2009 ).Irrespective of crops and soil textures, our meta-analysis studyalso showed the sequestration of SOC in INM treatmentcompared to control and 100% NPK. Our meta-data revealedthat loss of SOC stock was more in control followed by 100% NPKand INM treatments. The loss in SOC stock translated into CO2equivalent emissions and release into the atmosphere contributesto global warming ( Lal et al., 2007 ). Several studies also reportedthat due to intensive cropping systems of rice and wheat caused asigniﬁcant amount of SOC stock loss from agriculture soils ( Daweal., 2000 ;Regmi et al., 2002 ;Ladha et al., 2003 ;Lal et al., 2007 ;Hobbs et al., 2008 ;Ghimire et al., 2015 ).The present study showed that loss of SOC stocks wasobserved more in rice than in wheat in Indian soil, especiallywith 100% NPK fertilizers compared to INM. In the puddled ricesoils, severe soil cracking and reduced aggregate stability lowersthe SOC content and its stock ( Hobbs et al., 2008 ), which mightbe one of the reasons for the lower SOC content under paddy-cultivated Indian soil. It was also reported that the ﬂoodwatersystem in ﬂuenced the SOC dynamic because of limited supply ofoxygen affecting chemical processes ( Bronson et al., 1997 ),causing changes in soil pH, redox potential, and reduction ofnutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) ( Fageria et al., 2011 ).Higher redox potential could also cause signi ﬁcant loss in SOC asCO2emissions which add on global warming continuous frompuddled ﬁelds ( Masscheleyn et al., 1993 ).The MBC content is considered as an eco-physiological index,which is an integrated measure of microbiological activity in soil.It is the living component of soil which is the active form ofcarbon pool. It links soil nutrients to energy (C) dynamics and hasbeen identi ﬁed as one of the sensitive indicators that respond toeven short-term environmental and available nutrient variationsin the soil from crop and soil management practices ( Sparling,Frontiers in Environmental Science | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 724702 8Padbhushan et al. Meta-Analysis Approach to Measure the Effect of INM1992 ;Haynes, 2008 ;Rajput et al., 2019 ). The decomposition andmineralization of organic substrates and the release of nutrients isregulated by microbial activity and turnover; the size andresponse of MBC to management practices can have asigniﬁcant impact on nutrient availability and nutrient useefﬁciency by crops ( Gupta et al., 2019 ). In this meta-analysis study, changes in MBC showed a similar trend tothat of SOC but indicated greater responses than SOC. Soilsunder INM practices for both crops and soil textures generallyshowed higher MBC compared to without fertilization and100% NPK treatments. Similarly, several studies reported thatorganic amendments would have a signi ﬁcant effect on theamount of MBC from the wide range of macro- and micro-nutrients added through the organic amendments ( Hu et al.,2011 ;Chinnadurai et al., 2014 ;Tamilselvi et al., 2015 ;Liu et al.,2017 ;Rajput et al., 2019 ) but effectiveness of the organicsources depends on their quality. Green manure and theaddition of crop residues had lower effectiveness thancompost and biochar ( Z a v a l l o n ie ta l . ,2 0 1 1 ;Liu et al., 2017 ).The microbial quotient (MQ) denotes the importance ofmicrobial biomass in increasing the SOC content in the soil(Sparling, 1992 ;Yang et al., 2010 ). The MQ is a soil indicator usedfor expressing changes in soil characteristics due to organicmatter ( Sparling, 1992 ).Novak et al. (2017) found the rangeof the MQ was 4.0 –5.1% in Entisols and 1.0 –1.9% in Inceptisols.A lower value of the MQ in Inceptisols was due to lowerconversion of organic carbon into microbial biomass due toless microbial growth. In this study, the MQ was foundpositively affected by addition of organic matter in the INMcompared to 100% NPK and without fertilization. The trend ofthe MQ in the decreasing order was INM followed by 100% NPKand without fertilization. MQ values were found to be more inrice than in wheat crop, and loamy soil than clayey soil,suggesting that habitat and crop type can in ﬂuence microbialbiomass levels within a system ( Sparling, 1997 ). A higher MQvalue suggests more availability of nutrients for microbial growth,and potential for the conversion of C inputs to microbial biomassfor better soil quality and microbial functions ( Richardson et al.,2014 ;Novak et al., 2017 ;Tresch et al., 2018 ). Availability ofnutrients such as N, P, and S can limit microbial growth andconsequently soil organic matter formation, especially in thenutrient-limited cropping soils in India. It is suggested thatprovision of adequate supply of nutrients can signi ﬁcantlyincrease the microbial humi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency, that is, theproportion of crop residue C converted into soil organicmatter ( Richardson et al., 2014 ). Therefore, organicamendments providing carbon and nutrients such as thoseseen under INM practices together would support higherlevels of MBC, MQ, and microbial turnover resulting ingreater ef ﬁciency of conversion of carbon into SOC andconsequently increased SOC stocks.CONCLUSIONResults from this meta-analysis study show that the INM treatmentcan increase rice and wheat yield, SOC content, and microbialbiomass compared to the application of inorganic fertilizers alone,for example, 100% NPK chemical fert ilizer treatment. This study alsoshows that crop yields, SOC, and MBC were higher in the loamy soilsthan in clayey soils in rice –wheat cropping systems. Additionally, thehigher microbial quotient and concomitant increase of SOC in theINM treatment suggest that the nutrient addition most likelyincreased microbial humi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and the observedincrease in SOC stocks. Overall, ﬁndings from this study indicatethe INM treatment as one of the better crop management strategiesfor Indian soils, in order to improve soil quality, soil biological health,and crop production, thereby improving food security for India ’srapidly growing population.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSSS framed the notion and was overall in charge of this manuscriptpreparation.
