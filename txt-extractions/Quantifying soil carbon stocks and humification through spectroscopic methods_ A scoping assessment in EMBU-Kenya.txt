The aim was to determine di ﬀerences in soil carbon stocks and carbon recalcitranceand relate these to soil textural class, altitude, climatic parameters and land use. Soils from main agriculturalsystems as tea, co ﬀee and maize-based intercropping, as well as from natural vegetation cover were sampled intriplicates, in ﬁve layers from 0 to 30 cm in depth and processed for total carbon analysis. The whole soil sampleswere also analysed using Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) to assess carbon humi ﬁcation.Prototype portable equipment intended for future in situ analysis was used in the lab to ascertain the structure ofthe most recalcitrant and stable carbon present in di ﬀerent agro-ecosystems. In addition, Near InfraredSpectroscopy (NIRS) was tested for the quantitative analysis of soil carbon, showing that it is a reproducible andlow-cost method that provided satisfactory results under the processing conditions of the samples. Resultsshowed wide variation in the level and quality of carbon stored in the soils, depending on soil texture, land use,elevation, climate, agricultural practices and land use history. Considering the heterogeneous nature of sampledsoils and the performance of NIRS and LIFS, these results can be used as a basis for the development of fullyportable systems able to provide rapid, clean and potentially cost-eﬀ ective relevant information for soil man-agement.1. IntroductionThe global carbon cycle, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration,and the role of di ﬀerent World biomes as potential sources and sinks ofcarbon are receiving increasing attention ( Feller and Bernoux, 2008 )a scarbon sequestration in plant and soil systems o ﬀers an opportunity formitigating the greenhouse e ﬀect (Lal, 2004). This is particularly im-portant as carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels in the atmosphere contribute toclimate change. Notwithstanding, emphasis has been placed on mea-surements of carbon ﬁxation by forests or measurements of carbonemissions following land-use changes ( Guo and Gi ﬀord, 2002 ;Ontl andSchulte, 2012 ).Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the poorest regions on Earth ( Gilbert,2012 ), with 62% of its rural population depending on agriculture as themain source of income ( UNFPA, 2007; Henry et al., 2011). Agriculturealso represents one of the major land use systems, thus there is a closerelationship between the allocation of land for agriculture and soilcarbon capture and emissions. While Africa contributes less than 4% tothe global balance of CO2emissions ( Canadell et al., 2009 ), it accountsfor 20% of the global net CO 2emissions from land-use, mainly fromforest degradation and deforestation, and for approximately 40% ofemissions from forest ﬁres ( Henry et al., 2009). Many managementpractices can increase soil carbon stocks as well as above-ground carbonin biomass, including soil conservation practices (e.g., no-tillage, re-duced tillage, terracing), incorporation of crop residues, increases incropping intensity and fertilization, and conversion of cropland tohttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.108Received 16 August 2018; Received in revised form 22 December 2018; Accepted 27 December 2018Abbreviations: CNH, carbon-nitrogen-hydrogen technique; DRIFTS, Di ﬀuse reﬂectance Fourier Transform mid-infrared (Mid-IR) spectroscopy; H LIF, Humi ﬁcationindex of soil organic matter; LIFS, Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy; MIR, mid-infrared; NIRS, Near Infrared Spectroscopy∗Corresponding author.E-mail address: alinesegnini@hotmail.com (A.

Spectroscopic techniques areprobably the best option for the analyses of whole soils, physical soilfractions and humic substances. Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectro-scopy (LIFS) analyzes recalcitrance of SOM by measuring rigid con-densed aromatic structures and the magnitude of its molecular re-calcitrance, which can be extremely useful in studies on carbonsequestration by soils and mitigation of CO2emissions ( Milori et al.,2011 ).Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has shown promising results forcarbon quanti ﬁcation. Near infrared radiation (780 –2500 nm) interactswith a soil sample, generating vibrational states in the chemicalstructures, detecting overtones and combinations of fundamental vi-brations ( Martin-Neto et al., 2009 ;Milori et al., 2011 ). This spectralregion contains useful information on organic and inorganic materialsin the soil. Soil organic matter can also have broad absorption bands inthe visible region that are dominated by chromophores and the dark-ness of organic matter. Absorptions in the NIR region (780 –2500 nm)result from the overtones of hydroxyl (OH), sulfate (SO4) and carbonate(CO 3) groups, as well as combinations of fundamental features of H 2Oand CO 2(Stenberg et al., 2010). Although near infrared is not useful forchemical structure analysis, the detection of much simpler overtonesthat heavily overlap to give a characteristic broad absorption band,facilitates the use of NIRS for soil analyses ( Milori et al., 2011;Shepherd and Walsh, 2007). Applications of this technique to estimatesoil carbon contents indicate that NIRS is a reproducible and low-costmethod for quantitative analysis with high potential for ﬁeld applica-tion ( Madari et al., 2006 ;Milori et al., 2011 ;Shepherd and Walsh,2007 ;Dinakaran et al., 2016 ), including the use of portable visible-NIRS equipment ( Shepherd and Walsh, 2007 ;Li et al., 2015). In addi-tion, NIRS has the potential to be a suitable method for soil organiccarbon ( Li et al., 2015) mapping for monitoring carbon sequestration(Martin et al., 2002 ;Kusumo et al., 2018).Soil carbon stocks and soil carbon humi ﬁcation data are required formonitoring sustainable land use in intensively cropped areas. Also, theassessment and comparison of di ﬀerent analytical techniques is neces-sary in order to further develop fully portable equipment that could beused for large in situ carbon determinations. Thus, the aim of the pre-sent study was to: a) assess soil carbon stocks along a sampling transectspanning di ﬀerent agro-ecologies on the eastern foot slopes of MountKenya; b) estimate the humi ﬁcation of the SOM as quality indicatorusing LIFS; c) quantify soil carbon using NIRS instrumentation in orderto evaluate a soil quanti ﬁcation technique and d) determine di ﬀerencesin soil carbon stocks and SOM recalcitrance and relate these to soiltextural class, altitude, climatic parameters and land use. Our hypoth-esis was that the spectroscopic instruments in soil analyses could beable to improve and enlarge soil carbon assessments. This is due to thespectroscopic instruments which have portability features and low-costadvantages, LIFS and NIRS, and could be used as well in association tosoil carbon sequestration studies in research ﬁelds.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study areaThe study area was located in Embu county in the Kenyan highlands(Fig. 1). Embu is situated on the eastern footslopes of Mount Kenya(5199 m), with altitudes ranging from 1080 m to over 4700 m above sealevel. The area of the county is around 700 km2. About two thirds of thisarea is agricultural land and one third, mainly on the higher elevations,is covered by forest. The climate is controlled by the inter-tropicalconvergence zone. The mean annual temperature is 25 °C and isstrongly related to elevation. It decreases from about 17 °C in Nairobi inthe central highlands. The average annual rainfall rages from 1000 to2500 mm in humid areas in the central highlands ( Batjes, 2004 ). Embuhas a bimodal rainfall pattern, with the ﬁrst cropping season fromMarch to June and the second one from October to December. Themaximum monthly precipitation is 300 mm, in April. The di ﬀerent soilsacross the district are associated to the variations in rainfall, tempera-ture and geology. Andosols, ando-humic nitisols and humic nitisolspredominate in the upper midland and higher zones. These soils are ofvolcanic origin. Lower on the slopes, in the lower midland zones, soilsbased on metamorphic basement rocks with volcanic inﬂ uence(Veldkamp and Visser, 1992 ;Jaetzold et al., 2007 ) that show moderateto low fertility levels are prevalent. Cambisols and Luvisols are types ofsoils for lower on the slopes.2.2. Farming systemsSmallholder farms dominate the landscape and characterize most ofthe current land use. Most of cultivated land in the area is rain-fed,although in some areas farmers have access to small-scale irrigation.The average farm size is 1.2 ha with an average household size of 5members ( Munyua et al., 2010). Mixed farms predominate, with avariety of staple crops and livestock. Maize and beans are the mainstaple crops of the region. Banana and co ﬀee are the cash crops inlowlands and slopes whereas tea is produced in higher grounds. Vege-tables and macadamia nuts have been recently added as cash crops(Lekasi et al., 2001 ). Additionally, farmers grow potatoes (highlands),sweet potatoes, cassava, kale, tomato and other vegetables in placeswhere irrigation is available. Most farmers manage a highly diversi ﬁedfarming system with more than 30 di ﬀerent crops ( Olson, 2004).In addition to crops, about 95% of Embu farmers have livestock(Mutsotso and Chirchir, 2005 ). A typical farm has one dairy cow, somegoats and chickens. The livestock is usually held in a zero-grazingsystem. Napier grass ( Pennisetum purpureum ) is the main feed for thecows, goats and sheep, but also banana leaves and stems, maize stover,sweet potato vines, Calliandra ( Calliandra calothyrsus ) and other greenleaves that are available (e.g. weeds from the farm and tree leaves) areused as feedstu ﬀs. Trees are another important component of farmingsystems. They are usually planted along ﬁelds and farms boundaries.Common fruit and nut trees found on the farms include mango, avo-cado, macadamia and papaya. There are also a large variety of localtrees, which are used for ﬁrewood, timber, fodder, live fences, as mulchmaterial or for construction.2.3. Soil sampling transectThe soil sampling transect was located on the Southeastern slopes ofMount Kenya. It included the major agro-ecologies of the county andwas divided into three agricultural areas ( Figs. 1 and 2). The ﬁrst oneincluded tea, co ﬀee with eucalyptus and co ﬀee plantations. The secondarea presented a rotation of annual crops such as maize, peas, greengram (a.k.a mung bean, Vigna radiata ), and cowpeas. The third areafeatured maize, beans, mango, banana, cassava, papaya, peas, andgreen gram. In all three areas, soils under native vegetation, labeled asundisturbed soils, were sampled as a reference and their results com-pared against cultivated soils. In the ﬁrstarea, samples were taken fromforested areas; whereas in the second and third areas, soils under nat-ural vegetation (transition between forest and savanna) and cropsprovided the samples.A. Segnini et al. Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 476–4834772.4. Soil sampling and carbon stocks determinationSoil samples were collected in April 2010 at depths: 0 –2.5, 2.5 –5,5–10, 10– 20 and 20 –30 cm in three ﬁeld replicates. Pits were also ex-cavated to evaluate bulk densities in each soil layer. Samples from eachdepth interval were collected through an aluminum ring of knownvolume ( ∼100 cm3) and pooled for the subsequent evaluation of soildry (105 °C) weight. All samples were taken on private land and nospeciﬁc permissions were required. The ﬁeld studies did not involveendangered or protected species.Soil samples were air-dried and gently crushed using a mortar andpestle and passed through a 2 mm sieve (9 mesh). After this pre-treat-ment in Kenya, portions of soils (5 g) were transported to the SoilsLaboratory at Embrapa Instrumentation in São Carlos, São Paulo,Brazil. These sub-samples were ﬁnely ground to pass through a0.25 mm sieve (60 mesh) for analyses.Total carbon analysis was performed in the Soils Laboratory, induplicate, on approximately 10 mg of soil samples using a 2400 CHNS/O analyzer series II (Perkin-Elmer). As the quantity of inorganic carbonin the soil is relatively small or either zero per cent across the soilsampling parts from Kenyan area and soil types ( Batjes, 2004 ), weconsidered that the total amount of carbon is related to organic carbon,with insigni ﬁcant number of carbonates.Soil carbon stocks are usually estimated using the soil bulk densityat each depth interval and the corresponding carbon content(Veldkamp, 1994):=× × × Cstock soil C content BD layer depth 10 (1)where C stock (Mg ha−1); BD = bulk density (Mg m−3) and sampledsoil layer depth or thickness (m). Soil carbon stocks by soil layer (0 –2.5,2.5 –5, 5 –10, 10– 20 and 20– 30 cm) and total (0 –30 cm) were comparedacross land uses.2.5. Soil carbon humi ﬁcationSoil pellets of approximately 0.5 g, 1 cm of diameter and 2 mmthick, were inserted into an Embrapa Instrumentation built apparatus toacquire LIFS data ( Milori et al., 2006 ). The equipment, with portabilityfeatures, employs laser-induced optical techniques. Samples were ex-cited by a continuous wave (cw) laser at 405 nm blue radiation, emittedby a diode laser equipment with a power source of around 200 mW. Theexperimental parameters followed Segnini et al. (2010) . The ratio of thearea under this ﬂuorescence emission band and total organic carboncontent (g kg−1) was deﬁ ned as a humi ﬁcation index (H LIF) and isexpressed as arbitrary units (a.u.) ( Milori et al., 2006).2.6. Statistical analysisAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to show statisticallysigniﬁcant di ﬀerences. It was used ANOVA with replication using a 0.05signiﬁcance level ( p< 0.05) and chosen to check relevant e ﬀectscaused by di ﬀerent sites and agro-ecologies regarding soil carbon stocksand soil carbon humi ﬁcation. Once the normality of the distributionwas established, the values found for di ﬀerent depths and the total layer(0–30 cm) were compared using a Tukey test for average comparisons,and the Brown-Forsythe test for homogeneity of variance.2.7. Carbon quanti ﬁcation using Near Infrared SpectroscopyNear Infrared Spectroscopy analyses were carried out using aPerkin-Elmer (Spectrum 100N) spectrometer with an Attenuated TotalReﬂectance (ATR) accessory. Soil samples, previously ground andsieved at 60 mesh, were scanned from 10.000 to 4.000 cm−1(1000 –2500 nm) at a resolution of 16 cm−1with 64 co-added scans perspectrum. Quant+ software was used to obtain the quantiﬁ cationmodel based on partial least squares (PLS) ( Beebe et al., 1998 ). About65% of the samples (n = 120) were utilized to calibrate the model toquantify soil carbon with NIRS. Thirty- ﬁve percent of the data, ran-domly selected, was used for the validation of the methodology usingthe prediction tool (Predict) software. With this procedure, the carbonvalues estimated by the regression model were compared with valuesobtained by a carbon reference technique (CHN). Absolute relative er-rors were individually calculated from each prediction model and thelimit of detection (LOD) was estimated. Calculating LOD with directFig. 1.

Segnini et al. Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 476–483478analysis of solid sample is not trivial and not standardized since theblank (sample without the analyte) is di ﬃcult to be obtained ( Kurfüst,1998 ;Nomura et al., 2008). Moreover, there was not a single soilsample without C detectable by NIRS. As an alternative, LOD was es-timated following IUPAC de ﬁnition (LOD = 3σ /S), where σis thestandard deviation of sample measurement with lower carbon con-centration (an average of 10 measurements for each technique), and S isthe slope of the calibration curve. In addition, soil carbon values pre-dicted by NIRS were used to calculate carbon stocks and HLIF, followingthe methods described previously.Standard cost-bene ﬁt analyses (including equipment cost, depre-ciation, maintenance, reagents use) were made to provide a referencefor comparing alternative methods for quantifying soil carbon contents.Fig. 2.

Segnini et al. Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 476–4834793. Results3.1. Soil carbon stocks and humi ﬁcation processThe main descriptive data of the agro-ecologies from three sites areshown in Table 1. Results for altitude and soil physical attributes arebeing considered. Samples were collected along a slope, with altitudevalues ranging from 738 to 2012 m above sea level. Clay soils were thedominant soil textural class, excepting site 2, which presents sandyloam and sandy clay loam as their soil textures.Analyses of soil carbon content and bulk densities at depth intervalfrom di ﬀerent agro-ecologies are presented in Table 2. The mean bulkdensity ranged from 0.48 ( ± 0.03) Mg m−1in the 0– 5-cm depth at thetea crop (site 1) to 1.97 ( ± 0.25) Mg m−1at rotation crops (site 2). Ingeneral, sites 2 and 3 had higher bulk densities while the mean bulkdensity was lower at the site 1, mainly in the tea crop. In the study, itwas noted a tendency for soil bulk densities increase with depth even inforest system (undisturbed system for site 1). Generally, this tendency isnot observed in undisturbed soils, and this fact was obtained at sites 2and 3.Higher carbon content was obtained at forest and tea crops from site1(Table 2). Additionally, higher soil carbon values were obtained onthe surface layers, both undisturbed soils and crops, and carbon contentdecreased in the lower in all systems. At the surface, forest and teasystem had higher carbon amount (respectively, 10.3 ± 0.1 and5.4 ± 0.2 g kg−1). Another relevant information was that the rotationsystem for site 2 had a signi ﬁcant increase of carbon(1.6 ± 0.1 g kg−1), comparing to undisturbed soil (0.7 ± 0.1 g kg−1).Table 3 shows the carbon stocks at the three study sites and allvegetation types. Carbon stocks were calculated in each depth and ﬁrstcompared by depth, for each crop, so the variation is considered bylayer and in total. Considering all the layers (0 –30 cm), the values ofcarbon stocks ranged to 26 ( ± 3) Mg ha−1for undisturbed system fromsite 2 to 127 ( ± 9) Mg ha−1, for forest from site 1 ( p< 0.05).In our ﬁrst sampling site, besides forest system, soil carbon stocks incropping systems were 81 ( ± 19) Mg ha−1for tea, 64 ( ± 4) Mg ha−1for co ﬀee plus eucalyptus and 56 ( ± 4) Mg ha−1for co ﬀee. Thesevalues were all lower ( p< 0.05) than the soils from the forest. In thesecond site, the reference of natural vegetation represented by a forest-savanna transition on a sandy loam soil, showed less than half the levelsof C stocks (26 ± 3 Mg ha−1) than soils under crops(65 ± 7 Mg ha−1). Additionally, in the third site, the native vegetationpresented higher soil carbon stocks (78 ± 4 Mg ha−1) than crops underrotation (51 ± 3 Mg ha−1). Lower H LIFSwere obtained from the sur-face layers of all evaluated soils ( Table 4). At the surface, H LIFSwashigher from the undisturbed system at site 2, and lower for forest at site1(p≤0.05), varying accordingly to the layer depth. In the deep layers,HLIFSpresents higher values, for all systems and agro ecologies.3.2. Carbon quanti ﬁcation using NIRSIn the present study, NIRS was used to estimate carbon contents.One outlier was detected (using the Spectrum Quant + Perkin Elmersoftware) and after extracting the principal components (PCs), NIRSdata explained 99% of the variance in the measured data using 15 PCs.The measured values of soil C varied from 0.37% to 19.26%. Thecarbon values, estimated by PLS multivariate regression, were com-pared with values obtained by a carbon reference technique (CHN).

TheLOD found for CHN and NIRS technique were, 0.11% and 0.45%, re-spectively. The value of prediction mean error can be associated to thevariation of carbon content, with a wide range of soil sampling sites.The estimated carbon values by NIRS presented more relative predic-tion errors for soil samples with lower carbon contents, near or lowerthan LOD of NIRS and CHN techniques.Carbon stocks and humi ﬁcation degree using carbon values, ob-tained by the NIRS quanti ﬁcation model, were estimated. The Pearsonmoment correlation coe ﬃcients for the linear ﬁt were 0.91 for carbonstocks and 0.82 for humi ﬁcation degree ( p< 0.05), which comparedfavorably with data obtained with the reference technique for C de-termination (CHN), thus showing the high potential of NIRS for soilcarbon assessment.4. Discussion4.1. Soil carbon stocks and humi ﬁcation processThe addition of soil bulk densities values to a ﬁxed soil depth incarbon soil amount is substantial and e ﬀective to monitor soil carbonstocks. Even though bulk density is a basic parameter soil science areaand the precise determination is di ﬃcult ( Walter et al., 2016 ), the formthat was used to in this paper is a standard mode ( Lee et al., 2009 ).Also, the 0– 30 cm depth was chosen because it is the agricultural layer,most a ﬀected by tillage ( Twongyirwe et al., 2013 ) and has the highestsoil disturbance.The soil carbon amount is higher at surface layer for all agroecologysystems. Super ﬁcial layers receive a continuous input of fresh materialfrom vegetation and animals.

Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 476–483481On the other hand, the lower soil carbon concentration found in thedeeper layer could be related to the reduced amount of the externalinputs in to the soil ( Amanuel et al., 2018 ). Probably, forest system andtea crops, with higher soil carbon levels at surface, have the higherinput of vegetation and animals at soil surface, comparing to othersystems. According to Twongyirwe et al. (2013) forest soils typicallyhave most of their organic matter in the litter and upper soil layers. Ifthe soil is tilled, SOM is mixed throughout the tilled soil pro ﬁle whichcould be 30 cm deep. In their data with African soils from southwesternUganda, the authors observed natural forest and major land uses (po-tato, tea and grazing lands) assessing the variability of carbon stocks infunction of some parameters, including altitude. In our case, the alti-tude is not an essential parameter, mainly because the three zones arein diﬀerent local sites, with di ﬀerent features. Our results are based oncomparing undisturbed soils with land use managements.Carbon stocks under natural forests, comparing to di ﬀerent landuses, for site 1, are higher and represent a large stock of carbon with asigniﬁcant di ﬀerence ( p< 0.05). According to Twongyirwe et al.(2013) , cultivated land and grazed lands can have more compacted soilthan soil under natural forest, as our results had showed. In addition,Henry et al. (2009) reported that forests contain large abovegroundcarbon stocks, up to 255 Mg C ha−1and our data suggests that thisstock is compounded by soil carbon, making forest a large carbon re-pository. Notwithstanding, there is a growing concern about the loss ofsuch stocks, caused by land use changes, deforestation and forest de-gradation. They also pointed out that the driest tropical forests of Sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Site 3 hadthe same tendency that site 1, with a decrease of carbon stocks for cropsystems, compared to undisturbed soils. On the other hand, in site 2 wasobserved that the crop system had higher carbon stocks. According toAmanuel et al. (2018) cultivated land had lower amounts of organiccarbon than other land use/land cover types, suggesting the need forsustainable cropping systems such as crop rotation, addition of organicmatter, and crop residues to reverse the situation. As in our results, cropsystems were compared to undisturbed or natural soils, a possible in-formation is that the crop rotation system presented a sustainable form,with a relevant input of carbon (three times more the carbon stocksfrom undisturbed soil).With respect to HLIF- as an indicator of soil quality or recalcitrance-soils under trees and shrubs presented the largest carbon stocks but thelower humi ﬁcation index ( Table 4), particularly at the top layers(p< 0.05). In general, forest soils and native vegetation from site 3presented the lowest humi ﬁcation index, probably due to high input ofresidues. Undisturbed system from site 2 presented higher H LIFlikelyassociated to a very limited and slow incorporation of fresh residues,leading the microorganisms to decompose the organic matter alreadyexisting in the soil more thoroughly ( González-Pérez et al., 2007 ).Previous studies where LIFS was utilized to characterize soil carbonrecalcitrance ( Milori et al., 2006; González-Pérez et al., 2007; Segniniet al., 2011 ,2013 ) have shown that low H LIFcan be associated with thepresence of labile carbon, since the constant input of plant residuesoverwhelms the capacity of microorganisms to metabolize them. Indeeper soil layers, in most sampled soils, there was an increased H LIFassociated to the presence of more aromatic recalcitrant carbon. Underthese circumstances, carbon stability is deemed to be higher since theinput of residues is lower, and there is further decomposition of humicsubstances by microorganisms ( Segnini et al., 2011 ).4.2. Carbon quantiﬁ cation using NIRSThese results corroborate previous ﬁndings indicating that NIRS is agood alternative for conducting soil carbon analyses, with the port-ability and low-cost advantages for ﬁeld research in developing coun-tries ( Shepherd and Walsh, 2007 ;Milori et al., 2011 ;Ferraresi et al.,2012 ;Beltrame et al., 2016; Dinakaran et al., 2016 ;Kusumo andSukartono, 2018 ).Bushong et al. (2015) assessed the accuracy forquantify SOC using NIRS, concluding that NIRS can be used as a quickand accurate method for measuring soil carbon.Calibrations with an average r2= 0.98 were obtained using DRIFTSand r2= 0.96 using NIRS for carbon concluding that for carbon cali-brations both DRIFTS and NIRS can be successfully used ( Madari et al.,2006 ). Notwithstanding, DRIFTS appears to be generally more accurateand robust. Very good calibrations were achieved for the sand and clayfractions of the soil. This study seems to con ﬁrm that soil type itselfdoes not a ﬀect calibrations for total carbon concentrations, but thetextural diversity within the sample population used for calibrationinﬂuences it. The potential of NIRS to predict soil texture and miner-alogy in tropical soils have been assessed by other workers ( Ferraresiet al., 2012; Vendrame et al., 2012 ) who describe the development ofthe calibration models with NIRS and DRIFTS using samples from dif-ferent soil textures and taxonomies. Such models indicated robustness,since the prediction of amounts of clay, silt and sand leads to a texturalclassiﬁcation very similar to the classi ﬁcation obtained from the resultsof the classical method. These results can con ﬁrm the suitability ofspectroscopic techniques for textural analysis of soils.Beltrame et al. (2016) evaluated reference methods (dichromateoxidation and dry combustion) to provide a NIRS calibration modelwith higher predictive ability. A total of 161 soil samples obtained fromhorizons in full pro ﬁles in Brazil were used. Determination of organiccarbon were accessed by PLS model based on NIR spectroscopy. Themodels presented feasible and acceptable results, and no signi ﬁcantdiﬀerences in the prediction ability was observed.Kusumo and Sukartono (2018) tested whether NIRS was able torapidly measure carbon stock in the soil using. Soil samples collectedfrom agricultural lands at the sub-district of Kayangan, North Lombok,Indonesia. The authors compared NIRS a conventional procedure(Walkley and Black). They considered NIRS a rapid measurement andmapping of soil carbon stock of the assessed area. Partial Least SquareRegression (PLSR) was used to develop models from soil carbon datameasured by conventional analysis and from spectral data scanned byNIRS (R2= 0.756 to an average of soil carbon content of 1.03%).In addition, the cost-bene ﬁt analysis of the use of NIRS to determinesoil carbon - considering the sample pre-preparation procedure, theequipment cost, depreciation, maintenance, reagents and analyses, andtime of analysis (around 1 min)- was estimated to be about US$ 0.25 persample (considering 120,000 analyses per year as is the case in Brazil).On the other hand, the cost of CHN technique can amount to US$ 5.10per sample. NIRS o ﬀers advantages in terms of lower cost of equipment,maintenance and procedures, time saving, and is environmentallyfriendly since it does not use chemicals. These results are in agreementwith Bellon-Maurel and McBratney (2011) , who made a bibliographicstudy about techniques as NIR and MIR both used to determine soilcarbon content measurements aiming at carbon credit trading.5. ConclusionsSoil carbon stocks and humi ﬁcation were assessed using spectro-scopic and conventional methods, for soils under di ﬀerent land uses andagro-ecologies in Embu, Kenya. The results showed wide variations inboth carbon stocks and the levels of stability of carbon stored in the soil.Land use/land cover type in ﬂuenced soil carbon amount in assessed soilsystems, mainly in sites one and three. These variables are important foran adequate management of soils, particularly for reducing the en-vironmental footprints of agriculture. Our results substantiated the factthat NIRS-based soil carbon assessments have an important role to playin the analysis of smallholder agriculture globally. These instruments,properly calibrated, can provide carbon content determinations andconsequently enhance the feasibility of estimating soil carbon stocks ata low cost. Notwithstanding, measuring carbon stocks is not enough; anassessment of the stability of those stocks is also mandatory. The pre-sent study shows that this can be achieved with LIFS. We argue that theuse of portable NIRS and LIFS can provide relevant information for soilA. Segnini et al. Journal of Environmental Management 234 (2019) 476–483482management. The goal is to have repeatable measurements that cansupport mechanisms for promoting climate-smart agriculture and togenerate schemes to compensate farmers for sound environmentallyfriendly agricultural practices.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful for the ﬁnancial support from International PotatoCenter (CIP), from Peru, as well as to Brazilian Corporation forAgricultural Research –(EMBRAPA) Instrumentation from soil analysesand International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics(ICRISAT), São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (BrazilianAgency) Process number 2007/58561-7 and National Council forScienti ﬁc and Technological Development (CNPq) (Brazilian Agency)Process number 158389/2011-5.
