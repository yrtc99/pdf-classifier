T reseder Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 926 97, USA  Summary •Numerous ﬁeld studies have measured mycorrhizal dynamics under additions ofnitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or atmospheric CO 2  to test the hypothesis that plantsshould invest in mycorrhizal fungi when soil nutrients are limiting.•Here meta-analyses were used to integrate nutrient responses across independentfield-based studies. Responses were compared between ecto- and arbuscular mycor-rhizal fungi, and among fertilizer types, methods of measurement, biomes, and leadinvestigators. Relationships between degree of response and study length, fertilizationrates, total amounts of nutrients applied, and numbers of replicates were also tested.•Across studies, mycorrhizal abundance decreased 15% under N fertilization and32% under P fertilization. Elevated CO 2  elicited a 47% increase. Nitrogen effectsvaried signiﬁcantly among studies, and P effects varied signiﬁcantly among leadinvestigators. Most other factors did not affect mycorrhizal responses.•These results support the plant investment hypothesis, and suggest that globalstanding stocks of mycorrhizal fungi may increase substantially under elevated CO 2 but decline moderately under P additions. Effects of N deposition may be difﬁcult topredict for individual ecosystems, with a slightly negative inﬂuence overall. Key words: carbon dioxide enrichment, global change, meta-analysis, mycorrhizalfungi, nitrogen fertilization, nutrient limitation, plant investment, phosphorusfertilization.

Plants provide C bytransferring carbohydrates via roots; soils supply N and P .One of the more widely tested hypotheses within the ﬁeld ofmycorrhizal ecology is that plants should invest more C inmycorrhizal fungi where N or P are limiting to plant growth,since mycorrhizal fungi contribute to nutrient uptake byplants (Mosse & Phillips, 1971). Conversely, if N or Pavailability rises, a decline in mycorrhizal abundance isexpected as plants allocate carbohydrates elsewhere andmycorrhizal fungi become C-limited (Read, 1991). Analternate possibility is that mycorrhizal fungi are directlylimited by soil nutrient availability and should proliferatefollowing additions of N or P (T reseder & Allen, 2002). Thesemechanisms apply to both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) andectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi.Controls over mycorrhizal dynamics by C, N, and P aregermane to global change studies. Enrichment of atmosphericCO 2  typically augments photosynthesis (Bazzaz, 1990;Poorter, 1993) and increases nutrient limitation in plants(Oren  et al ., 2001; Schlesinger & Lichter, 2001; Finzi  et al .,2002), while fertilization with N and P (as land is convertedto agriculture) and anthropogenic N deposition enhance soilfertility (Vitousek, 1994). Humans may be altering global andregional distributions of this ecologically and economicallyimportant microbial group.To what extent do large-scale ﬁeld experiments support thehypothesis that mycorrhizal fungi will increase under elevatedCO 2  but decrease under additions of N and P? By contrast toglasshouse studies, ﬁeld-based manipulations of CO 2 , N andP can capture complex conditions that could inﬂuence New Phytologist  (2004)  164 : 347–355 www.newphytologist.org ©  New Phytologist  (2004) Research 348 mycorrhizal abundance, including natural climatic variability,intact soil fauna and microbial communities, and establishedsoil structure. As such, results from ﬁeld experiments areparticularly useful in predicting mycorrhizal feedbacks in eco-systems under global change. Previous reviews have reportedhigh variation among studies in AM colonization of rootsunder elevated CO 2  (Staddon & Fitter, 1998) and in externalhyphal lengths of AM and ECM fungi under N enrichment(T reseder & Allen, 2000), so that delineations of generalresponses are difﬁcult. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative,statistical means of integrating independent results, and ofidentifying aspects of experimental design that might contri-bute to variation among studies (Gurevitch  et al ., 1992; Gure-vitch & Hedges, 1993, 1999; Arnqvist & Wooster, 1995).This study applied this approach to a dataset compiled from31 published N fertilization studies, 20 P fertilization studies,and 14 elevated CO 2  studies. It focused on below-groundchanges in standing crops of the fungi. Separate meta-analyseswere conducted for N, P , and CO 2 . Materials and Methods Sources of data Selection criteria Meta-analyses were performed on dataacquired from published sources that met speciﬁc criteria(Table 1). In particular, the present study focused on ﬁeldstudies in which mycorrhizal abundance was measured inresponse to long-term (> 2-months), large-scale (> 1-m 2 )manipulations of N, P , or CO 2  availability, in comparisonwith an unmanipulated control. Short-term or smaller-scale studies were not included, because it is possible thatmycorrhizal fungi could temporarily proliferate to exploitsmall ‘hot spots’ of nutrients (Jackson  et al ., 1990; Hagerberg et al ., 2003). If so, short-term responses would not necessarilyreﬂect long-term effects. In CO 2  experiments, this studyincluded free-air CO 2  enrichment (FACE), open-topchamber, and closed-chamber designs if they were establishedon pre-existing soil. Planted vegetation was accepted in thecase of agricultural systems only, because my objective was toinclude studies that represented natural systems as closely aspossible in order to best approximate widespread effects ofglobal change. In addition, I limited my data collection toresults in which means, standard deviations, and replicatenumbers were reported or could be determined. This latterspeciﬁcation unavoidably excluded six N-fertilization studiesand eight P-fertilization studies that were otherwise qualiﬁed.In all cases, the unit of replication was the plot. Correlationsbetween pre-existing levels of soil N or P and mycorrhizalbiomass were not considered.Because one assumption of meta-analysis is that studies areindependent from one another (Gurevitch & Hedges, 1999),I used only one set of data from a given system. For instance,mycorrhizal abundance was often measured several timeswithin a given study. In these cases, I restricted my analyses tothe latest sampling date, since global change is often long-term. (Mycorrhizal responses did not vary signiﬁcantly withstudy length in the ensuing meta-analyses.) If more than onepublication presented results from the same ﬁeld plots, I reliedupon data from the most recent paper. In addition, severalstudies applied nutrients at a range of levels; in these cases,I only included data associated with the highest applicationrates. Conversely, if a particular publication reported resultsfrom more than one study system that could reasonably beconsidered independent (e.g. different geographical location,fertilizer type, ecosystem, or dominant vegetation), each sys-tem was designated as a different study. Effects of N, P , andCO 2  were examined in individual meta-analyses in order toavoid redundancy of control groups within studies that simul-taneously tested more than one effect (Gurevitch & Hedges,1993). Data acquisition For each study, meta-analysis requires the mean, standarddeviation (SD), and replicate number ( n ) for the control aswell as the nutrient-addition treatment. When means anderrors were presented in a graph, the image was digitized andGrab-It! software was used to estimate values (Preble, 1998).If standard errors (SE) were reported, these were transformedaccording to the equation: . Unidentiﬁederror bars were assumed to represent standard error. Indices of mycorrhizal abundance The most common measures of mycorrhizal abundancewere percentage root length colonized (for AM fungi) orpercentage root tips colonized (for ECM fungi), both ofwhich are hereafter referred to as ‘% colonization’. Otherapproaches included spore counts per gram soil (AM) andhyphal length per gram soil (AM and ECM). When morethan one index of mycorrhizal abundance was reported withina given study, percentage colonization data were selectedin order to facilitate comparisons with other studies thatmeasured colonization only. Data regarding production ofECM sporocarps was not included, as the analysis focused onbelow-ground dynamics. Statistics Meta-analyses were used to determine the signiﬁcance ofmycorrhizal responses to nutrient enrichment. For each studyand each type of nutrient addition (N, P , or CO 2 ), the effectsize was calculated as the natural log of the response ratio (‘R’),which is the mean of the treatment divided by the mean of thecontrol (Hedges  et al ., 1999). An R of 1 indicates that thenutrient addition had no effect. The estimate of variancewithin each study was represented as  ν ln R , which is a function  SE SD    () =⋅ n−12 14698137, 2004, 2, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01159.x by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023].

To determineif R deviated signiﬁcantly from 1 across studies (i.e. nutrientadditions had a signiﬁcant general effect), a random effectsmodel using MetaWin software was applied (Rosenberg et al.,2000). Random effects models allow comparisons amonggroups in a framework similar to analysis of variance (  ).In addition, signiﬁcant variation in R among studies canbe assessed. Responses between AM and ECM fungi weresequentially compared, among types of N or P fertilizationapplied (e.g. ammonium nitrate vs. ammonium sulphate),among methods of measurement, among biomes, and amonglead investigators (i.e. ﬁrst authors). Continuous model meta-analyses was also used to test for relationships between R andstudy length, levels of nutrient addition, total amounts ofnutrients applied (in the case of N or P fertilization), theproduct of study length and CO2 concentration in theenriched treatment (in the case of elevated CO2), or numbersof replicate plots. Statistical results reported include R; 95%conﬁdence intervals for R (CI); degrees of freedom ( d.f.); totalheterogeneity in R among studies (QT); and in the case ofcomparisons among groups, the difference among groupcumulative effect sizes (QM), and the residual error (QE)(Rosenberg et al., 2000).ResultsNitrogen fertilizationAcross studies, N fertilization reduced mycorrhizal abundanceby an average of 15% (Fig. 1), but with signiﬁcant variationamong studies (QT = 100, d.f. = 30; P < 0.00001). Moreover,a meta-analysis restricted to percentage colonization dataindicated a smaller, but still signiﬁcant, decrease of 5.8%(Table 2), again with signiﬁcant heterogeneity among studies(QT = 84.8, d.f. = 26, P < 0.00001). Aspects of experimentaldesign inﬂuenced how mycorrhizal fungi responded to N. Inparticular, declines in mycorrhizal abundance were slightlymore pronounced under higher rates of N application ( R =−2.54 × 10−4 * [rate] + 0.905, P = 0.020), although two studieswith application rates of 1000 kg N ha−1 h−1 (Hutchinsonet al., 1998) had large leverage. When these two studieswere omitted, no signiﬁcant effects of application rate wereapparent. Replicate number was weakly negatively relatedto R ( R = −0.0372 * [replicate number] + 0.964, P = 0.007),potentially because studies with more replicate plots also hadhigher rates of N additions (Table 1). Neither the totalamount of nitrogen added nor the duration of fertilizationwas a signiﬁcant factor. Likewise, we found no signiﬁcanteffects of mycorrhizal type, fertilization type, measurementindex, biome, or lead investigator (Table 2).Phosphorus fertilizationMycorrhizal fungi declined moderately under P fertilization,with an average reduction of 32% (Fig. 1). Moreover, variationamong studies was nonsigniﬁcant (QT = 22.5, d.f. = 19, P =0.259), indicating consistency among systems in mycorrhizalresponses to P . Response ratios did not differ between AM andECM fungi, among type of fertilizer applied, among biomes,among measurement types, or as a function of fertilizationrate, fertilization duration, total amount of P added, orreplicate number. However, R varied signiﬁcantly among leadinvestigators (Table 2). When analysis was restricted to studiesthat reported percentage colonization, P effects were stillsigniﬁcant (Table 2).Elevated CO2By contrast to N and P fertilization, CO2 enrichmentconsistently and strongly increased mycorrhizal growth, by anaverage of 47% across all studies (Fig. 1), and by 36% withinstudies that measured percentage colonization ( R = 1.36,CI of 1.11–1.68, number of studies = 12). Among the studycharacteristics examined, none contributed signiﬁcantly todifferences among studies (Table 2), and there was nosigniﬁcant variation among studies in general (QT = 14.5,d.f. = 13, P = 0.342). We could not test for differences amongmeasurement types, since percentage colonization was theonly metric used by more than one study.DiscussionFor each nutrient examined, results from the meta-analysessupported the hypothesis that mycorrhizal fungi are moreFig. 1 Responses of mycorrhizal fungi to nitrogen fertilization, phosphorus fertilization, and elevated CO2 in ﬁeld studies.

Responses were signiﬁcant in each case, as conﬁdence intervals did not overlap with 1. Thirty-one studies were represented for N, 20 for P , and 14 for elevated CO2. 14698137, 2004, 2, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01159.x by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023].

Replicate numbers within N studiesinﬂuenced response ratios, but not substantially. What othercharacteristics of the studies might be responsible for theremaining variation in N effects? It is possible that mycorrhizalfungi may not be as effective in facilitating plant uptake ofinorganic N compared with inorganic P (Mosse & Phillips,1971; Smith & Read, 1997). In particular, nitrate is moremobile in the soil than is phosphate, so diffusion or mass ﬂowmay supply N at adequate rates in nitrate-rich systems. Underthese circumstances, plant investment in mycorrhizal fungimay be minimal even in control plots. Alternately, mycorrhizalgrowth may be N-limited in some ecosystems (T reseder &Allen, 2002) so that N fertilization increases mycorrhizalabundance.

The smaller conﬁdence intervalsfor N effects vs P or CO2 effects (Fig. 1) reﬂect the largernumber of N studies included in the meta-analyses.Although most study variables did not signiﬁcantly inﬂu-ence mycorrhizal responses to P fertilization, in many casesthe number of studies represented within groups was low(Table 2). For example, ECM responses to P were determinedin two studies only. Likewise, all but two studies appliedsuperphosphate as the source of P . Hyphal length was used asan index of abundance in two P studies, compared with 17 Pstudies reporting percentage colonization. T ropical forests andtemperate grasslands were represented by three P studies each.These small sample sizes limit my ability to determinewhether these variables are important factors in mycorrhizalresponses to P .Seven biomes were included in the meta-analyses, albeitunequally. Agricultural systems were the most common, com-prising 25 of 65 cases (Table 1). Deserts were the least common,with one study represented. Moreover, all data from naturaltropical forests were collected in Hawaii. A more diversesampling of nutrient effects within tropical forests, deserts,boreal forests, and woodlands/shrublands would improve thepossibility of establishing general patterns among and withinbiomes.To include studies that encompassed as broad a range ofregions and biomes as possible, data on hyphal lengths andspore counts was incorporated, in addition to % colonization.However, % colonization is not necessarily comparable withthe others, since this parameter is a function of standing rootlength as well as mycorrhizal biomass (Allen, 2001). Coloni-zation levels can be interpreted as an assessment of relativeallocation toward mycorrhizal fungi by plants. For this reason,additional meta-analyses were conducted on % colonizationdata only. Effects of N, P , and CO2 remained signiﬁcant – butsmaller – despite the reduction in sample size. Standing stocksof ﬁne roots tend to increase under elevated CO2 (Rogerset al., 1994). Thus, total mycorrhizal biomass may be morestrongly affected by CO2 enrichment than would be indictedby % colonization alone. Root responses to N and P are morevariable (Ostertag, 2001), so it is difﬁcult to relate % colon-ization to mycorrhizal biomass in fertilization studies withoutspeciﬁc data from each study. Even though percentage colon-ization tended to be associated with smaller response ratios,there was no evidence for signiﬁcant differences among typesof measurements used.In summary, mycorrhizal abundance generally increasesunder elevated CO2 and declines in response to N and Pfertilization across studies. Plants may adjust allocation of Cto mycorrhizal fungi according to the degree to which plantgrowth is N or P limited, as hypothesized (Mosse & Phillips,1971; Read, 1991). Direct limitation of mycorrhizal fungiby soil nutrients appears to be at most a secondary control,evident in a subset of studies. In respect of environmentalchange, global standing stocks of mycorrhizal fungi may besubstantially augmented by atmospheric CO2 enrichmentand moderately reduced by P fertilization. AnthropogenicN deposition effects might vary among ecosystems, with aslightly negative inﬂuence overall. These shifts in mycorrhizaldynamics may elicit corresponding shifts in ecosystemdynamics, including nutrient uptake by plants (Smith &Read, 1997), trace gas emissions (Redeker et al., 2004), carbonsequestration in glomalin (T reseder & Allen, 2000), andaggregate formation in the soil (Rillig et al., 1999b).AcknowledgementsThanks to A Cross, L Methratta, and K T urner for technicalassistance and discussion, D Pellet, J Lansing, M Allen, andM Gavito for providing access to data, and all other authorswhose studies were included in the analyses.
