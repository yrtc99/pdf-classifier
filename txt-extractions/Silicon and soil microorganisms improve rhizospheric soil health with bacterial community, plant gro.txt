Silicon may potentially increase nutrient availability in rhizosphere with improved plants’ growth, development as it does not produce phytotoxicity. The rhizospheric microbiome accommodates a variety of microbial species that live in a small area of soil directly associated with the hidden half plants’ system. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) play a major role in plant development in response to adverse climatic conditions. PGPRs may enhance the growth, quality, productivity in variety of crops, and mitigate abiotic stresses by reprogramming stress-induced physiological variations in plants via different mechanisms, such as synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, exopolysaccharides, volatile organic compounds, atmospheric nitrogen fixation, and phos -phate solubilization. Our article eye upon interactions of silicon and plant microbes which seems to be an opportunity for sustainable agriculture for series of crops and cropping systems in years to come, essential to safeguard the food security for masses.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 May 2022 Revised 13 July 2022 Accepted 15 July 2022 KEYWORDS Plant microbes; environmental pressure; plant growth-development; productivity; stress resistance; sustainable agriculture; siliconIntroductionProblems and concerns regarding the usage of synthetic fertilizers, irrigation, herbicides, and pesticides have prompted a quest for alternate techniques to combat nutrient and water limitations on crop plants. Microorganisms may boost crop nutrition as well as the ability of crops to withstand unfavorable environmental issues.1–3 Consequently, microorganisms in agricultural systems may reduce the application of traditional fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. The interactive demonstrations include bacterial and mycorrhizal stabilization of soil aggregates and morphology, rhizobacterial promotion of plant performance through enhan -cing the bioavailability of nutrients, and enhancement of plant development by influencing phytohormone levels and production of stress-defense components.1,4,5 Dodd et al.6 (2010) demon -strated changes in root hormones, morphology, and plant devel -opment mediated by rhizobacteria. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) mediated root trait variations may contri -bute to the agro-ecosystem via improving crop stand, resource use efficiency, stress resistance capacity with healthy soil profile.7,8The long-term use of chemical fertilizers may adversely affect environment, soil health, quality, and production capa -city of plants.9 The utilization of rhizospheric microorganisms was found to be beneficial for reducing the detrimental effects caused by synthetic fertilizers.10,11 Hence, useful plant–bacter -ial communities have been investigated for precision and sus-tainable agriculture. Diversified bacteria are closely connected with plant cells, and as a result, they extend beneficial effects.12– 14 Acetobacter, Acinetobacter, Azospirillum, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Candida boidinii , Enterobacter, Klebsiella varii -cola F2, Nocardiopsis alba, Penicillium chrysogenum, Pseudomonas, Promicromonospora, Pseudomonas fluorescens YX2, Raoultella planticola YL2, and few others may colonize with broad range of plant cultivars.14–20 The distribution of endophytic bacteria is determined by various crops and crop circumstances.21,22 The endophytic bacteria on plants have a lot of potential as bio-fertilizers.23 Endophytic bacteria may get colonized intra and intercellularly promoting plant estab -lishment and plant performance.3,24,25The phyllosphere, endosphere, and rhizosphere are the dif-ferent kinds of microorganisms.26,27 The phyllosphere, the above-ground surface of plants considered as complex ecosys -tem where microorganisms and the host plant get associated to create dynamic communities.28 The number of microbial species found in the microbiome of a live plant generally outnumbers the host cells.14 Plant microbiomes are important bioresources for sustainable agriculture as effective microbes may maintain plant development and enhance plant nutritional availability via solubilization of P, K, and Zn, fixation of nitrogen along with other functions.29,30 Agricultural practices, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides may change the composition of the plant microbiomes.3 Plants and microbes may also work together to reduce environmental pollutants and soil toxicity.4CONTACT Xiu-Peng Song  xiupengsong@gxaas.net ; Yang-Rui Li  liyr@gxaas.net  Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Biotechnology and Genetic Improvement (Guangxi), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Genetic Improvement/Sugarcane Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/ Sugarcane Research Center, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, Guangxi 530007, ChinaPLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR                        2022, VOL. 17, NO. 1, e2104004 (15 pages) https://doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2022.2104004© 2022 The Author(s).

Still, plants get benefit for better adaptation toward adverse environmental conditions, in case having Si.1,31,32 Silicon constitutes a significant part of the soil, mainly aluminum silicates or other silicate minerals unavail -able for plant absorption.33 The level of plant-available form of Si in the soil solution (H4SiO 4) differs between 0.1 and .06 mM (2.8–17.1 mg Si L−1) is about two orders of magnitude higher than the phosphorus level.34 Silicon is taken up by plant root systems and translocated through the plant to be deposited as SiO 2 phytoliths in the lumen, cell walls, and intercellular spaces.35 However, plant species vary greatly in their efficiency in accumulating Si ranging from 0.1 to 10% of Si on dry weight basis.36–38 Consequently, few plant species are less affected by Si application than others.39 Silicon regulates availability of various elements in soils by competing for binding on soil particles depending on the speciation of silicic acid.40 Soils contain 100–500 µmol L−1 silicic acid, although the availability varies depending on soil type, temperature, and pH level.41,42 Hence, it can be re-considered as a recently established defini -tion of the importance of nutrients, according to Epstein and Bloom43 (2005), mostly found to be beneficial when plants face biotic and/or abiotic stresses.31,44Our paper reports application Si and PGPRs essential to alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses and enhancing nutrient use efficiency (NUE) to promote plant performance and pro-ductivity. The recent advancement in Si and PGPRs interaction relies on the current scientific research to elucidate the benefits conferred by these bio stimulants in response to adverse envir -onmental conditions for sustainable agriculture under climate change.Impact of Si and plant microbiome on plantsImplementing sustainable approach to increase plant resis -tance against environmental stresses is essential to enhance food production around the globe. The crop production may require ca. 60–100% enhancement by 2050 to meet the pro-jected global population of 9.7 billion.20,45 However, achieving this target without any loss of agro-ecosystems is challenging. Nowadays, agricultural and food production sectors are threa -tened by the era of climate change, land degradation, limited availability of water, and more recently breakthrough in pan-demics like COVID-19.20Biotic factorsPlants are always found in association with various species in natural habitats. They do have an inherent immune system that can detect invading microorganisms and create a possible suc-cessful response against specific phytopathogens. The plants’ innate immune system plays key role in regulating the action of microbial species in their microbiome system.46,47 Salicylic acid (SA) is produced in significant amounts by certain PGPRs, and some of these rhizobacteria may induce systemic resistance against stressed plants. Various PGPRs can produce SA in an iron availability-dependent way, and SA is detected on plant roots,48 although likely initiating from plant root systems upon interaction with rhizobacteria. Several PGPR strains have been reported to have the ability to produce SA. Pseudomonas is the best-studied genus for SA production, and SA-producing spe-cies include P. aeruginosa, P. aureofaciens, P. corrugata , and P. fluorescens .49,50 It has also been suggested that exudation of the signal molecules jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) into the rhizosphere can be associated with the interplay between roots and microbes during the initial stage of colonization.51–53 Ethylene plays a vital role in stress tolerance capacity for some PGPR.54 As a result, plant microbiomes depend on the plant genotypes, growth age, and presence of bacterial strains.53Bacteria are the most thoroughly characterized part of the plant microbiome due to their potential for plant growth promotion.3 Plant species, genotypes, life cycle duration, root proximity, and soil types influence the bacterial microbiome composition.3,55,56 Bacteria, the core of the complex intercon -nected microbiome, have a considerable impact on other microbiome residents, including other bacteria. The synergistic effects, such as biofilm development and bacteria cling with the surface protection.57 Furthermore, due to additive effects, mul-tispecies biofilms are most efficient compared to monospecies biofilms, resulting in mutual proliferation when a new species is introduced to the microbiome.58 Olive trees cultivated with knot disease are an example of a significant association between bacteria in the plant microbiome. The pathogen was responsible for the olive knot found to be Pseudomonas savas -tanoi PV. savastanoi supplemented by nonpathogenic bacterial species like Pantoea agglomerans and Erwinia toletana , leading the disease to worsen.59,60 Bacterial interactions with other bacteria in the plant microbiome may be inhibiting. Many Pseudomonas species have also been reported to inhibit R. solanacearum and decrease pathogen density and infection prevalence.61 The intricate interplay in the plant, bacteria, and other microbes is more likely to impact the fundamental action mechanisms producing variations in the bacterial population of plants by other bacteria.3,62Bacteria and fungi have been observed to interact exten -sively, with bacterial populations influencing fungal popula -tions and vice versa. This relationship appears mostly plant- independent, as bacterial-mediated fungal community altera -tions have been observed in planted and unplanted settings.63 Depending on the precise condition of the interactions, bac-teria in the plant microbiome might be advantageous or inhi-biting to fungi. Through symbiosis, keystone bacteria, such as members of the Burkholderia genus, may considerably enhance the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), but P. fluorescens restrict fungal growth functions.64 In-plant microbiome, symbiosis is commonly associated with bacteria and fungi, notably with AMF.4,64,65 Rhizopus spp. of fungi and bacterial spp. Burkholderia developed an endosymbiotic rela-tionship in which Rhizopus fungi relied on Burkholderia activ -ities to create spores that infected Oryza plants with blight.66 Fungi play various important functions in the plant micro -biome. The plant microbiome’s fungi vary by host, and get influenced by nitrogen deposition,67 and soil types.68 Fungi may be significant to plant development and cause plant diseases,69 also enhances plant performance, including productivity.70e2104004-2 K. K. VERMA ET AL.Archaea have more potential for plant growth enhance -ment, despite being understudied concerning the plant microbiome. Their close connections with atmospheric vari-ables and other microbial residents frequently form symbiotic relationships with plants.1,71 Archaea were revealed to inter -act with plants and fungus in a bog habitat, impacting nutri -ent delivery and secondary plant capabilities. Archaea have not been thoroughly explored with their possible application in agriculture. The archaeon Methanococcoides burtonii pro-duces non-photosynthetic Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bipho -sphate carboxylase), rate-limiting CO 2 fixation process during leaf gas exchange, which was found to boost photo -synthetic performance and plant development capacity in tobacco plants by acquiring in vivo biosynthesis of rubisco encoded by rbcL and rbcS genes of cpDNA and nDNA, respectively.72 This response suggests a link between nema -todes and the various players in the plant microbiome, which might be used in agriculture to protect against nematode infection.73Silicon and PGPRs have been shown to mitigate adverse plant diseases.1,74 Some of the known mechanisms by which Si and PGPRs alleviate the biotic stress in plants are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Many suitable nutrient-rich niches on/ inside roots attract a greater diversity of microorganisms. The basic process by which PGPRs defend plants from phytopatho -gens is competition for the nutrients and niches.39,143,144 Induced systemic resistance, which improves defense against a wide range of diseases and insect herbivores, is another meaningful way pathogens control PGPRs in the rhizosphere and endorhiza prime the entire plant body.1,4,143,145 Like PGPRs, Si may manage plant pathogenic diseases by forming physical barriers. Precipitation of amorphous silica in plants is a mechanical barrier.146Various chemical changes in soil are linked with PGPRs. Some bacterial strains directly associate plant physiology by mimicking the synthesis of phytohormones, whereas others enhance the availability of minerals and nitrogen content in the soil to augment growth.147 Another effect of Si on patho -genic disease control to the formation of chemical barriers, that is, the increased defense-related enzymes such as chitinases, β- 1,3-glucanases, peroxidase, lipoxygenase, polyphenol oxidases, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.1,2 Silicon may enhance plant resistance capacity to pathogenic infections by (i) enhan -cing gene expression associated with tolerance to pests and diseases; (ii) increasing phenolic content, callose, or methyla -conitate (phytoalexins), and lignin; (iii) upregulating the expression of genes associated in encoding the proline-rich protein (PRP1) and the major enzymes in phenylpropanoids pathways; and (iv) increase polyphenol content, antimicrobial flavonoids, and anthocyanin.1,2,39,144,148Role of plant rhizobacteria and Si on plants in response to adverse environmental conditionsWater and salinity stressWater stress is a major environmental stressor in agro- ecosystems, resulting in losses ca. millions of dollars annually.1,75,149 However, water stress on plants has been extensively researched, but less information about the effect of drought on the plant microbiome. Water stress, of course, causes a complete loss of plant and microbial biomass.150,151 However, investigations on diverse plants utilizing stress treatments that resulted in an enormous enrichment in bac-teria have indicated that some species of bacteria do a better performance during stress conditions.144,151 Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacterial isolates alleviated plant biomass declines in water deficit-stricken grapevines by reducing photosynthetic inhibition caused by stress, most likely through 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate (ACC) deami -nase production. The proposed mechanisms for plant-growth enhancement by PGPRs include bacterial synthesis of the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cytokinin (CYT), and gibberellin (GA); breakdown of plant-produced ethylene by bacterial production of ACC deaminase; and enhanced the availability of nutrients and nitrogen in the soil.3,147,152,153Table 1.

The plant microbiome is a complex network of inter -dependent bacteria that shifts many other factors interacting with fungus. Compared to fungi, the effect of salinity appears to have a more significant influence on bacteria.157 Because most bacteria are not acclimated to highly saline conditions, rising soil salinity drastically reduces bacterial richness and diversity.157,158 Plant growth-promoting bacteria have been identified from rhizospheric saline soil and low potential for increasing plant development in salt-stressed areas in an envir -onmentally acceptable approach.1 Fatima et al.159 (2020) found that the saline-soil isolate Alcaligenes sp. AF7 had a variety of plant growth-promoting traits, such as the production of exo-polysaccharides, indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid, and side-rophores that were prominent up to various salinity thresholds, and the bacterium enhanced the Oryza vegetative growth stage more than two-times during salinity.The strain NCCP-11 T of Cellulomonas pakistanensis sp. nov., isolated from paddy shown to be moderately halotolerant.160 Cellulomonas isolates found potential as PGPR in rice, boosting minerals bioavailability by decompos -ing organic matter via secreted enzymes, that is, cellulases and hemicellulases.161 Most of the trials under salinity-stress con-ditions could find other important halotolerant microorgan -isms in the microbiome to be used during salinity to sustain agricultural crop production. Plants with Si and PGPRs are beneficial for the salinity and water-stressed conditions.1,85,162 Tables 1 and 2 highlights the action mechanisms through which Si and PGPRs help plants cope with saline and water- stressed plants. By limiting the accumulation and distribution of water and minerals, salinity and water deficit negatively affect plant development, development, and output.163 The length and region of the root surface affect plant nutrient absorption and more exposed areas for the absorption of scat-tered ions result from an increase in root surface morphology. During salinity and water stress conditions, Si can improve root development, nutrient uptake, phytohormones, and over -all plant performance.144,164,165The water deficiency also restricts nutrient uptake and accu -mulation by roots and subsequent transfer to shoots, lowering nutritional bioavailability and metabolism.166 PGPRs may directly affect plant behavior by solubilizing P by secreting a variety of extracellular phosphatases and producing organic and inorganic acids and protons and K to improve nutrient uptake.1,74 PGPRs may enhance plant resistance capacity to salt and water deficit by reducing Na+ absorption and affecting the accumulation and distribution of a few primary nutrients in plants treated with Si.167 In earlier demonstrations, the exogenous use of Si increased leaf photosynthetic performance in various plant cultivars during salt and limited water supply.75 Higher levels of soluble salts and specific ions (Na+ and Cl−) severely influence plant performance by enhancing osmotic pressures and inhibiting water absorption and distribution.39,163 Plants require an optimal water level for survival during salinity and water stress conditions via osmotic adjustment.168The incredible action of Si is achieved by adjusting the levels of solutes, such as proline, glycine betaine, carbohydrates, and polyols and antioxidative enzymes, that is, total phenolics, total soluble sugars, and total-free amino acids caused by salinity. Reactive oxygen species play important roles in balancing nor-mal plant development and improving their tolerance efficiency to stresses.31,39,144 Damage to the plasma membrane and endo -membrane systems and disruption of normal metabolism can result from these ROS. Like PGPRs, Si-fertilizer may reduce oxidative injury in various plants during salinity and water stress by increasing antioxidative enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities.169 Further, Si maintained the permeability and stabi -lity of cell membranes in plants cultivated during abiotic stress.39 Reduced leaf relative water status is a common reaction of plants in salinity stress circumstances.1,32,164,170 Various scientific reports have also shown that the Si may significantly enhance plant tolerance capacity to noxious environmental factors.31,32 Inoculating stressed plants with PGPRs may activate signaling pathways that increase the host’s disease resistance, the phenom -enon known as induced systemic resistance.148,171 PGPR- mediated physical and chemical variations that improve resis -tance to stressors have also been proposed as induced systemic tolerance.8,172 Silicon leads to activating key genes associated with salinity and drought-stressed plants.39,173Heavy metal toxicityWhen agricultural lands are contaminated with heavy metals (HMs), soil microorganisms are more sensitive to the impacts of HMs.174,175 The number of soil microorganisms reduces by direct killing or biochemical deactivation. Heavy metal pollu -tion will change the composition of the soil microbial commu -nity, and the microorganisms that can adapt to these stress increase in abundance.175–177 The different HMs have different effects on the microbiome, with zinc being the more effective in causing alterations in microbial diversity, followed by cad-mium and lead.178,179 Although the impact of metals on differ -ent members of the microbiome are not fully understood, the application of plant growth-promoting microbes to aid in contaminated metallic ions reduced through phytoextraction has the potential to become broadly used in agriculture due to its demonstrated effectiveness.180,181 These strains could be employed to enhance plant performance in metallic- contaminated environments. The effects of toxic ions on the microbiota may identify new players who could help bioreme -diation efforts in agricultural systems.8Metal–resistant siderophore–producing PGPRs might reduce metallic toxicity by providing nutrients to plants and binding metals other than Fe.4 Plant hormones, i.e., auxins, e2104004-6 K. K. VERMA ET AL.gibberellins, and cytokinin-producing-PGPRs, may mitigate metal induced-stress in plants and facilitate adaptation and resistance strategies by triggering physiological variations and boosting the absorption of important minerals as a result of expanding plant root systems.8 Interactive use of Si and PGPRs may reduce toxic effects on plants exposed to metal toxicity.1 A variety of plants were shown to have increased tolerance capacity to harmful toxic ions by reducing the accumulation and distribution of metals.182,183 Under various stresses, PGPRs stimulate HMs tolerance genes as well as the develop -ment of more stress response functions, such as ETH and stress proteins.3,184,185Nutrient deficiencyIn plants, Si and PGPRs were found to minimize the negative impacts of nutrient deficiency.1,186 Tables 1 and 2 highlights some known processes by which Si and PGPRs restore nutri -tional imbalance in plants. Si also helps plants to cope with N deficiency by (i) increasing nutrient absorption, (ii) improving nodulation and N2 fixation in leguminous crops, (iii) increasing NUE, and (iv) changing primary metabolism by driving amino acid remobilization.1,39,144 Silicon fertilization was discovered to boost P availability in graminaceous species. At the same time, Si may inhibit P uptake and formation of chlorosis when excessive P levels are applied, presumably by minimizing the rate of transpiration.144 Si also reduces stress caused by K shortage by regulating soil K availability and nutrient content in plants and altering antioxidative enzyme activities to reduce K-deficiency- induced MDA content and oxidative stress.187–189PGPRs enhance plant micronutrient availability,14 reducing soil pH and synthesizes chelating agents. Plants require iron as a key micronutrient element in dry, calcareous, and alkaline environments. Microbial synthesis of the plant hormone auxin, i.e., indole-3-acetic acid/indole acetic acid/IAA, has been known for long period. Generally, IAA secreted by rhizobac -teria interferes with the various plant developmental processes because the endogenous pool of IAA can be altered by the acquisition of IAA that has been secreted by soil bacteria.190,191IAA also acts as signaling molecule affecting gene expres -sion in several microorganisms. It plays vital role in PGPRs- plant interactions. Most Rhizobium species have shown to produce IAA.192,193 Environmental stress factors that modu -late the IAA biosynthesis in different bacteria include acidic pH, osmotic and matrix stress, and carbon limitation.191 Generally, bacteria acquire iron by the secretion of low- molecular-mass iron chelators referred as siderophores, which have high association with iron. PGPRs vary regarding the siderophore cross-utilizing efficiency; some are proficient in using siderophores of the same genus (homologous side-rophores), while others could utilize those produced by other rhizobacteria of different genera (heterologous siderophores).193,194 Hence, bacterial siderophores may help to mitigate adverse environmental stresses. Plants assimilate iron from bacterial siderophores utilizing different mechan -isms, for instance, chelation and release of iron, the direct uptake of siderophore-Fe complexes, or ligand exchange reaction.195 Numerous studies of the plant growth enhance -ment via siderophore-mediated Fe-uptake.4,196,197pHThe pH of the soil is a key component in defining the composi -tion of plant microbiome and its impact on heavy metal accu -mulation. Bacterial species have shown significant fluctuations with little changes in pH, but fungus types found to be slightly associated.198–200 The highly alkaline soils impair plant growth due to poor mineral uptake while acidic soil may cause injury due to excessive uptake of toxic ions.201,202 Some microorgan -isms that promote plant growth have shown promise in redu -cing alkaline stress in plants. Dixit et al.203 (2020) isolated different PGPRs such as Alcaligenes sp. NBRI NB2.5, Bacillus sp. NBRI YE1.3, and Bacillus sp. NBRI YN4.4 from alkaline soil and discovered that they improved germination efficiency and productivity of maize plants in vitro condition during alkaline stress with Bacillus strain NBRI YN4.4 having most remarkable enhanced plant growth. The soil inoculation with NBRI NB2.5, NBRI YE1.3, and NBRI YN4.4 enhanced enzyme activities in the soil, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase , and dehydrogenase under alkaline conditions, indicating the impor -tance of these strains for plant performance and soil fertility in alkaline conditions.203Role of plant hormones with the application of plant microbes and siliconIn addition, endophytic bacteria promote plant growth by producing several phytohormones. Plant nutrient uptake and biomass get boosted by phytohormones.204,205 Endophytic bac-teria create plant growth regulators like CYT, ETH, ABA, GA, and IAA during plant interactions.1,206 Surprisingly, IAA has a significant impact on overall plant performance. Indole- 3-acetic acid is one of the main signals in symbiotic relation -ship between host and endophytes.207 Ethylene is also an important plant hormone that regulates variety of develop -mental and physiological functions.208 Endophytic bacteria produce ethylene precursor enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane- 1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase.180,209 Under stressful condi -tions, ACC hydrolysis improves plant development24 while, some endophytic bacterial strains may emit volatile organic substances like acetoin, pentadecane, 2,3-butanediol, 1 hexa -nol, and indole, promoting plant development.147,210,211 Under water stress, phytohormone producing-PGPRs have also been shown to enhance plant resistance against various environ -mental stresses by changing phytohormone contents viz., aux-ins, ETH, GA, CYT, and ABA.1,39,212,213 The generation of IAA by PGPRs alters root morphology by enhancing the number of root tips and surface area, acquisition of water and minerals with an ability to cope up the drought.32,212Agricultural approachesCrop rotation and fertilizer useCrop rotation, applying natural and synthetic fertilizers and using microbes or transgenic plants are some of the advanced agricultural practices utilized by farmers these days to boost the plant performance, productivity, and quality of the crops including disease-resistant soil214 with improved rhizospheric soil.215 However, the impact of crop rotation on microbial PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR e2104004-7populations in the soil has been poorly known for a long time.216,217 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and PGPR have been used as biofertilizers for their beneficial effects on plant development, especially by mobilizing soil nutrients and producing plant hormones that stimulate root growth.218 Long-term demonstrations may be used to assess the sustain -ability of intensive cropping systems about the effect of con-tinuous fertilization in different combinations of nutrients on the soil profile and crop yield.219 The concentration of amor -phous Si sometimes ranged from less than 1–30 mg g−1 on a total soil basis. Crops may remove millions of tons of Si from soil annually around the world.183,220,221Microbial activity and bio-mineralization play a major role in nutrient cycling in soil and may be shifted by long-duration fertilization.222 Cultivation of some crops may also be an alter -nate source of soil fertility.223 The downregulating behavior of plant-available silicon affected by crop rotations is accompa -nied by N, P, and K combined fertilization. The optimum mineral NPK application can increase the Si-use efficiency (SUE) and promote its uptake/accumulation by plants.221 However, the fertilization by Si can still be an important demand to replenish the reduced levels of nutrients depending on its critical levels in soil and the plant nutrient requirements.224,225 For many years, farmers have used natural and traditional fertilizers on their crops. These fertilizers’ made impact on the soil’s microbial composition, not well understood.226 On the other hand, high nitrogen fertilization enhanced abundance of nitrification and denitrification genes in the surrounding soil with an ability to improve crop biomass and nitrogen content. Lang et al.227 found that when phos -phorus fertilizer increased, the overall community richness of AMF and bacteria dropped, while fungal and bacterial gene copies may get enhanced.Limitations and concluding remarks of the studyAs a result of advancements in DNA sequencing methods, studying the microbiome has become an important research topic these days. The breakthrough may explore better under -standing of complicated microbial communities.228 It may reveal wealth of knowledge about micro-ecosystems that occur inside soil by studying the community of bacteria, cul-turable and unculturable in natural surroundings.229 Targeted amplicon gene sequencing or metagenomic shotgun sequen -cing are commonly used to investigate these communities through DNA sequencing230 with constraints to the soil envir -onment as it is low-cost and effective tool to acquire relevant data of microorganisms. The interplay between Si and the plant microbiome seems to be one the fascinating current studies, also expanding these days with pace. The internationally har-monized regulatory framework (ISO/TC-134) is working on the standardization in the field of fertilizers, soil conditioners, and beneficial substances, that is, materials whose addition is intended to ensure or improve the nourishment of cultivated plants and/ or to improve the properties of soils, and the efficient use thereof. Other key topics include exploration of beneficial mechanisms of Si and bacteria, their plant growth- promoting properties, and the best way to recruit or employ a healthy microbiome consortium to boost crop improvement, cropping systems and plant productivity for sustainable agri-culture for fast growing population, globally.AcknowledgmentsWe are very grateful to the Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, Guangxi, China, for providing the necessary facilities.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).FundingThis research was financially supported by the Guangxi Innovation Teams of Modern Agriculture Technology (nycytxgxcxtd-2021-03), the Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31901594), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760415), the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation (2021GXNSFAA220022), the Fund of Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2021YT011), and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Sugarcane Genetic Improvement Project (21-238-16- K-04-02).ORCIDKrishan K.
