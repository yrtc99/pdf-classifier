However, our understand-ing of their community carbon budget response for a shift in the environmental conditions of naturaland planted forests is limited. Therefore, we investigated the nematode community composition,daily carbon used in production and daily carbon budget, environmental variables, and the interac-tion among trophic groups in the moss, litter and 0–5 cm soil layers of natural subalpine spruce forestand plantations in western Sichuan, China. The result revealed that plantations increased the totalnematode daily carbon budget by approximately 52% through the herbivore channel in the 0–5 cmsoil layer. The herbivorous nematodes’ daily carbon budget and production in the moss layer of plan-tations decreased by approximately 60% compared to natural forests. Nematode daily carbon usedin production and carbon budget had a strong negative correlation with genus richness. The watercontent and total carbon was the most important environmental factor that affected the nematodecarbon budget and production, respectively. However, the environmental factors indirectly affect thedaily carbon budget of herbivore nematodes through omnivore top-down control in subalpine forestecosystems. Our ﬁndings highlight that the planted ecosystems have a certain capacity to maintainabundance, richness, and carbon budget of soil nematode but increase the risk of herbivorous pests.Keywords: nematode carbon budget; soil layers; soil food web; planted forest; environmental factors1. IntroductionPlanted forests (290 million ha) account for seven percent of the total forest area(4.06 billion ha) worldwide and increase by approximately three million ha per year, whilethe area of natural forests decreased by eight million ha per year, during 2010–2020 [1] .Globally, China has the most plantation forests (79.54 million ha) and accounts for approxi-mately 36% of the total national forest area (220 million ha), largely due to the implementa-tion of large-scale programs [ 1,2]. Thus, planted forests play an increasingly important rolein carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation [ 3]. It is generally acknowledgedthat the species richness and abundance across multiple trophic levels (i.e., vertebrates,invertebrates, and plants) in plantations is 32.7% and 15.7% lower than that in naturalforests [ 4]. However, the diversity of soil fauna and microbes, as well as carbon stockdensity in plantations, was similar to natural forests [ 3,4]. Furthermore, most previousnematode studies focused on the top 15 cm of soil, with less attention being paid to the mossand litter layers in forest ecosystems [ 5,6]. Then, even though the moss and litter layersshow more than twice the abundance of nematodes, with a predominance of predatorsForests 2022 ,13, 462. https://doi.org/10.3390/f13030462 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/forestsForests 2022 ,13, 462 2 of 16(mean occurrence 40%), compared with the soil layer [ 7,8]. Therefore, whether plantedecosystems are “green deserts” or suitable habitats for biodiversity, as well as the effects ofbiodiversity-related ecosystem services, remain unclear [4,9].Nematodes are the most abundant multicellular organisms on earth and occupy acentral position in the soil food web [ 10,11]. The nematode community regulates soil carbon(C) cycling by directly feeding the different forms of carbon in soil (i.e., microbial biomasscarbon, old/recent soil carbon, root-derived carbon) to ﬂow into the food web [ 12–14]. Forexample, the herbivore nematodes directly consume root productivity by approximately4.4–20.2%, produce waste products and cadavers, shear root litter, and leak root exudatesto induce C input to soil [ 15]. Bacterivore and fungivore nematode-selective grazingstimulated microbial-derived SOC retention or degradation through indirectly alteringmicrobial community composition and their associated functional genes [ 12,16]. Omnivoresand predators integrate the above herbivorous, fungivorous, and bacterivorous channelsinto a multichannel by trophic cascading control, which relates to both root- and microbial-derived SOC processes [ 10,17]. The nematode carbon budget is estimated based on thebody size and abundance of each genus and obtained by the sum of the amounts that arerespired and used for production [ 18,19]. It is sensitive to environmental changes andcommunity assembly processes and indicates the magnitude of C ﬂow into the soil foodweb [ 20]. Thus, the nematode carbon budget is meaningful to reﬂect their communitycharacteristics and functions [ 20]. Furthermore, nematode individuals of different speciesoccupy complementary ecological niches and enhance resource use, so that their carbonbudget is enhanced by species richness and abundance [ 21]. These complementarity effectswould be also offset or outweighed by interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc competition [ 22]. Thus,a community with high nematode abundance or richness does not necessarily have a highcarbon budget. However, our understanding of the nematode carbon budget response forshifts in the environmental condition in plantations and natural forests is limited.Previous studies have shown that the soil environmental factors, including soil organiccarbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, and water content (WC), positively affectthe nematode community’s abundance, richness, and carbon budget across global orlocal levels [ 10,18]. It is generally accepted that plantation has negative impacts ( 8.4–36%decreased) on several soil properties, including SOC, TN, C/N ratio, and WC [ 23]. However,18.1–42.5% of cases have reported that these soil properties were increased [ 23,24] orsimilar [ 3] in plantations compared to natural forests. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to predictthe effects of plantations on the nematode community’s composition and function, asdetermined by these environmental factors. For example, previous studies have revealedthat the plantations decreased the nematode abundance, taxa richness, and proportionof omnivores and predators by more than 30% compared to natural forests [ 25,26], whileKerfahi et al. [ 27] revealed that the omnivore and root parasites abundance increasedby approximately 30–80%, but there was a similar richness in the plantation comparedto natural forest. Furthermore, different nematode trophic groups interacted with eachother through the soil food web relationship and indirectly changed the effect size of theenvironmental factors for nematodes, creating a more complicated relationship betweenthe soil environment and nematode community. For example, in the nematode soil foodweb, the SOC indirectly inhibited predators and omnivores through interacting withbacterivores, so the total effect size of SOC on predator nematodes was weakened [ 28]. Theenvironmental factors’ effects are also enhanced by a positive interaction between differenttrophic groups [ 10]. Thus, the inﬂuence of those environmental factors on the nematodecarbon budget needs to be reconsidered with food web interactions.In this study, we aimed to explore the nematode carbon budget distribution patternand response mechanisms for community composition, soil food web, and environmentalcondition shifts in natural and planted forests. We hypothesized that: (1) if nematodeabundance or richness decrease, then their carbon budget and production would be de-creased because higher abundance or richness enhance complementarity for resource use;(2) if the plantation environmental factors (i.e., SOC, TN, WC) decreased in plantation,Forests 2022 ,13, 462 3 of 16then the nematode carbon budget and production would be also decreased because poorenvironmental conditions lead to lower abundance and richness; (3) if the different trophicgroups interact positively, then the effect size of the soil environmental factors for nematodecarbon budget and production would be enhanced because environmental factors indirectlyinﬂuence nematode carbon budget through the soil food web relationship.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study AreaThis study was conducted in the cold temperate coniferous forest zone at an altitude of2800–3500 m above sea level in the Minshan Mountains, located in the transition belt of theeastern Tibetan plateau to Sichuan Basin, China (103.40–103.72 E, 32.24–33.10 N) (Figure 1A).The area is characterized by high mountains and deep valleys, and provides importantecological services for water and biodiversity conservation. Alpine and gorge ecosystems,along with primary forests, are the key conservation objects in this region [ 29]. The Minjiangand Baishuihe rivers (both branches of the Yangtze River) originate from this area. The studysite has a plateau mountain climate, with a mean annual precipitation and temperature of540.8–708.4 mm and 6.3–13.1C, respectively [ 30] (Figure 1E,F), typical brown forests soils,classiﬁed as Luvisols or Leptosols [ 31,32], and the greatest snow cover from late Octoberto late March. The plant community of the tree layer is dominated by Picea purpureaMast., Picea asperata Mast., and Abies fargesii Franch.; the shrub layer is dominated by Ribesjanczewskii Pojark., Lonicera similis Hemsl., Sorbus wilsoniana Schneid., Rosa omeiensis Rolfe,andRubus sumatranus Miq.; and the herb layer is predominantly Thalictrum aquilegiifoliumLinnaeus, Pilea notata C. H. Wright, Anaphalis sinica Hance, Geranium wilfordii Maxim., andFragaria vesca L.2.2. Experimental Design and SamplingThe Songpan and Jiuzhaigou counties in western Sichuan province contain part of thedegraded forest ecosystems in China. Major forest policies have been initiated since 1998,including the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP), with the aim to restore naturalforests, reforest arable areas with slopes greater than 25, or regenerate both plantations andnatural forests in the degraded areas for soil and water conservation [ 33]. In October 2018,ﬁve experimental areas (each containing both the spruce plantation and adjacent naturalforest) were selected after ﬁeld investigations (Figure 1A,D). The distance between adjacentexperimental areas was more than 5 km. General information on the sampling areas issummarized in Table S1. In each experimental area in both plantation and adjacent naturalforests, 20 m 20 m plots were established in three replicates, with a distance of 30 mbetween adjacent plots (Figure 1D). Thus, a total of 30 plots (2 forest types5 experimentalareas3 replicates) were established in this study (Figure 1A–D). Five sampling points(one at the center and one per corner of each plot) were selected. The moss, litter and0–5 cm soil layers were sampled separately, and samples of the same layer collected fromthe ﬁve sampling points per plot were pooled and mixed thoroughly. The moss and litterlayers were sampled from 10 cm 10 cm monoliths. The moss layer sample included theclosely associated organic matter that is important for moss nutrition [ 7]. Soil sampleswere collected from a depth of 0–5 cm, as this depth coincides with the highest abundanceof most nematode species (including bacterivores, fungivores, and plant parasites) inwoodlands [ 34]. All samples were divided into two parts, one of which was used fornematode extraction in a local sample site within two days of sampling and the other, forfurther analysis, was kept cool during transport.2.3. Sample AnalysisThe Baermann funnel method [ 35] was used to extract free-living nematodes from100-g fresh moss, litter, and soil samples, collected from plantations and natural forests. Theﬁrst 100 individuals of all the extracted nematodes were used for nematode identiﬁcation atthe genus level under a microscope (Upright Light Microscopes DM6B, Leica Microsystems,Forests 2022 ,13, 462 4 of 16Wetzlar, Germany), as described previously [ 36]. Nematode individual abundance wasdeﬁned as the number of nematodes per 100 g of dry-weight of the sample. Based ontheir feeding characteristics, nematodes were allocated to ﬁve trophic groups: bacterivores,fungivores, herbivores, omnivores, and predators [37].Forests 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 18    Figure 1.

Soil samples were collected from a depth of 0–5 cm , as this depth coincides with the highest Figure 1.

The mean annual precipitation and temperature layer were found using the online resourceshttps://worldclim.org/, accessed on 10 March 2022.To calculate the nematode carbon budget and production, we ﬁrst measured the nema-tode body size according to Zhao et al. [ 38]. Each identiﬁed nematode was photographedunder a microscope, and its maximum body diameter (D) and body length (L) along thebody curvature were measured using ImageJ [ 39]. In total, 7323 individuals were iden-tiﬁed and measured. The fresh weight (W t) of individual nematodes was calculated asLD2/1.6106at the genus level [ 18]. Individual nematode daily C used in production(DP) and daily C respiration were calculated as 0.104 Wt/12cp tand 0.0159 Wt0.75,respectively, where cp tis the cp value of genus t [ 18]. The individual nematode dailycarbon budget (DB) was obtained by the sum of the respiration part and the productionpart [ 18,20,40]. Finally, we multiplied the DP and DB value of individual nematode byindividual abundance to compute the total DP and DB at the community level [18].To assess the environmental factors, the thickness (T) and fresh weight (50 cm 50 cmmonolith, with ﬁve replicates) of the moss and litter layers were directly measured in eachplot [ 41]. The biomass (B) of moss and litter were calculated using the water content andfresh weight. Water content was measured as the weight lost after oven-drying 20 g ofForests 2022 ,13, 462 5 of 16a moist ﬁeld soil sample to a constant weight (105 2C) [42]. The moss layer water-holding capacity (WHC) was gravimetrically determined after immersing 100 g of freshmoss in water for 24 h. The bulk density (BD) of each soil sample was calculated based onits measured volume (cm3) and dry weight. Soil pH was measured in a 1:2.5 soil: watersuspension with a digital pH meter [ 42]. Soil inorganic N (NO 3 -N, NH 4+-N) was extractedfrom fresh soil samples using 2 M of KCl and determined using a ﬂow injection autoanalyzer(AutoAnalyzer3, Bran + Luebbe, Norderstedt, Germany). Dissolved organic C and N (DOCand DON, respectively) contents of soil were extracted from 10-g fresh soil samples using2 M of KCl. Soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN, respectively) contentswere extracted by chloroform fumigation-K 2SO4. The DOC, DON, MBC, and MBN weredetermined using a TOC/TN analyzer (Multi N/C®2100 (S), Analytik Jena AG, Jena,Germany). The total C and N contents (TC and TN, respectively) of all the layers weremeasured using an elemental analyzer (Vario MACRO cube, Elementar, Langenselbold,Germany), the C/N ratios were calculated as mass ratios [42]2.4. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22.0 for Windows; IBM,Armonk, NY, USA). The data were ﬁrst examined for the normality and homogeneity ofvariances. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effects of the threedifferent layers (moss, litter, and soil) in plantations and natural forests on nematode DP andDB, as well as on environmental variables. The least signiﬁcant difference (LSD) test wasused for multiple comparisons. The independent-sample t-test was used to test differencesamong nematode DP and DB and environmental variables in the same layer of naturaland plantation forests. Simple linear regression was used to analyze the relationshipsbetween nematode abundance and DP and DB. Statistical tests were considered signiﬁcantatp< 0.05. The relationship between nematode C and environmental variables wasanalyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) using CANOCO (version 5.0 forWindows; Microcomputer power, Ithaca, NY, USA). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling(NMDS), based on Bray–Curtis similarity, was used to analyze the nematode communitycomposition difference inﬂuenced by the forest types and substrate layers, using the veganpackage for R [ 43]. Random forest was used to analyze the importance and signiﬁcance ofthe environmental variables using the random Forest [ 44], A3 [ 45] and rfPermute (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rfPermute/rfPermute.pdf, accessed on 10 March 2022)package for R [ 46]. Percentage increases in the mean squared error (MSE) of variables wereused to estimate the importance of environmental variables [46].Structural equation modeling (SEM) was carried out using AMOS (version 26 for Win-dows; IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) to analyze the interaction between the environmentand the ﬁve trophic groups, with regard to soil depth and forest type, starting with aninitial model (Figure S1) based on previous research on the soil food web [47]. Additionalstatistical texts ( 2, GFI and RMSEA) and their associated p-values were used to determinethe ﬁt of the SEM model. Before SEM, principal component analysis (PCA) was carriedout to reduce the environmental variables, and four principal components (37.05%, 21.71%,12.59%, and 11.70% of variance, explained by PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4, respectively) wereextracted to use to calculate the SEM model. Ten signiﬁcant importance environmentalvariables (MB, LB, WHC, WC, TC, TN, C/N, NH 4+-N, DOC, and pH) were put in the PCAaccording to the random forest analysis.3. Results3.1. Nematode Abundance and Richness in Natural and Planted Spruce ForestsA total of 116 genera were identiﬁed at the study site (Table S2). The results revealedthat the nematode community composition was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by substrate layersbut not signiﬁcantly by forest type (Figure 2). Plantation forests had a signiﬁcantly higherindividual abundance of total nematodes, herbivores, bacterivores, and genus richnessof total nematodes than natural forest in 0–5 cm soil layers (58.39%, 55.98%, 73.72%, andForests 2022 ,13, 462 6 of 1610.64%, respectively, p< 0.05) (Figure 3A,B,D,G). However, in the moss layer, the plantationforest had a signiﬁcantly lower individual abundance of herbivores (52.08%) and genusrichness of bacterivores (25.16%) than natural forest ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3D,H). In addition,the individual abundance of total and trophic groups of nematodes in the 0–5 cm soil layerof both plantation and natural forests (except for herbivores in plantation forests) wassigniﬁcantly lower (28.5–97.11%) than in moss and litter layers ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3A–F).The results also indicated that the moss layer had signiﬁcantly lower total nematode genusrichness in both forests and bacterivore genus richness in the plantation than in the litter(11.82–31.06%) and soil (8.78–38.18%) layers ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3G,H). Similarly, in plantationforests, the genus richness of fungivores was signiﬁcantly lower in the 0–5 cm soil layerthan in moss and litter (approximately 36%) layers ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3I). In both forests,herbivore genus richness was signiﬁcantly higher in the 0–5 cm soil layer than in the moss(176.76% and 92.98% in plantation and natural forest, respectively) and litter (146.15% and80.33% in plantation and natural forest, respectively) layers ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3J). In thenatural forest, the moss layer had signiﬁcantly lower omnivore genus richness than thelitter layer (37.93%, p< 0.05) (Figure 3K).Forests 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 18    Figure 2.

Nematode Genus Richness Negatively Correl ated with Carbon Budget and Production in Subalpine Forest In niche complementarity theory, the coexistence of different species in a community partitions their resource requirements, which finally facilitates the neighboring species’ resource use of different foraging and life -history strategies [48]. A previous study showed that the increase in nematode abunda nce enhances the predation intensity, pos-sibly inducing a higher C flow into the food web [12]. In the current study, the positive correlation between nematode individual ab undance and C budget was also supported by the niche complementarity theory: increasing  abundance enhances resource use so that the carbon budget would also be increased in  plantation compared to natural forest [21]. This result is consistent with our first hypothesis. However, the niche complementarity theory is not always supported by the previous and current studies. For example, Zhang et al .

Nematode Genus Richness Negatively Correlated with Carbon Budget and Production inSubalpine ForestIn niche complementarity theory, the coexistence of different species in a communitypartitions their resource requirements, which ﬁnally facilitates the neighboring species’resource use of different foraging and life-history strategies [ 48]. A previous study showedthat the increase in nematode abundance enhances the predation intensity, possibly induc-ing a higher C ﬂow into the food web [ 12]. In the current study, the positive correlationbetween nematode individual abundance and C budget was also supported by the nichecomplementarity theory: increasing abundance enhances resource use so that the carbonbudget would also be increased in plantation compared to natural forest [ 21]. This result isconsistent with our ﬁrst hypothesis.However, the niche complementarity theory is not always supported by the previousand current studies. For example, Zhang et al. [ 20] indicated that the variation in genusForests 2022 ,13, 462 12 of 16richness did not contribute to the increase in carbon budgets. Nielsen et al. [ 22] proposedthat the relationship between soil species richness and ecosystem processes could beneutral. The neutral relation would be supported by the functional redundancy theory,which pointed out that the loss of a species does not change the ecosystem function, becausedifferent species in separate niches would organize the same function [ 49]. In functionalredundancy theory, species numbers show an asymptotic response of soil processes, withmaximal effects attained with few species [ 49]. Nielsen et al. [ 22] also proposed a 12%negative relationship between soil species richness and ecosystem processes when thespecies richness is greater than ten. In reality, the soil nematode community alwayscomprises more than ten species [ 10,19,20], so the negative relationship was more possiblein a real food web. In the current study, the nematode genus richness showed a strongnegative correlation with daily carbon budget and production (Figure 5B,D), which isconsistent with the study of Nielsen et al. [ 22]. With the increase in genus richness, thecompetitive interaction becomes stronger and beyond the effect of complementarity, whichweakens the predation on carbon sources and ﬁnally decreases the daily carbon budgetand production of the nematode community [ 22,50]. This result is inconsistent with ourﬁrst hypothesis that a community with high nematode genus richness does not necessarilyhave a high carbon budget in subalpine spruce forests. Therefore, it is necessary to not onlymeasure nematode community through abundance or richness, but also take the carbonbudget into consideration.4.2. Nematode Abundance, Richness, and Carbon Budget in Spruce Plantations and Natural ForestsPrevious studies have found that natural forests had approximately 7–33% highernematode abundance and taxa richness than plantations [ 25,26]. This could be attributed tonatural forests having more soil fertility than plantations [ 23]. However, our ﬁndings wereinconsistent with previous ﬁndings; the individual abundance and genus richness of totalnematodes in the 0–5 cm soil layer in plantations were signiﬁcantly higher (58.39% and10.64%, respectively) than those in natural forests (Figure 3A,G). This could be attributedto the signiﬁcantly higher values (15.86–48.86%) of environmental variables, such as soilWC, TN, TC, and pH, in plantations compared to natural forests (Table 1). A few studiesalso showed that SOC is higher in plantations than in natural forests (from 3% to 4%) [ 24],possibly because planted areas are well-managed, for example, by cutting tree branches toimprove light conditions and tree health, which could have a positive long-term inﬂuenceon the top-soil’s physicochemical properties. In our plantation study areas, the sawdustresidues left by logging would have increased the input of soil organic matter. These higherlevels of environmental variables are likely to provide more abundant food resources forsoil nematodes [ 51]. Consequently, the plantation signiﬁcantly increased environmentalconditions, such as water content, C and N in 0–5 cm soil, leading to a higher daily carbonbudget (by approximately 52%) than natural forests (Figure 4A and Figure S3). However,the nematode carbon used in production was not inﬂuenced by forest type (Figure 4G).Previous studies reported that the carbon production of nematodes was signiﬁcantlyincreased (62.7–147.1%) when residue mulching [ 19] or conservation tillage [ 52] wereapplied in agricultural ecosystems. This could be because agricultural systems havebeen subjected to more human disturbance than forest ecosystems. Therefore, the secondhypothesis is partly consistent with our results. Plantations increase the nematode carbonbudget but do not change the carbon used in production, which suggests that the nematodehas reduced carbon use efﬁciency [19].Yeates [ 51] reported higher (more than 81%) nematode abundance in the forest ﬂoor(moss, litter and humus) than in mineral soil. Similarly, high species richness and biomasswere found in the moss layer, where larger nematodes such as Aporcelaimellus obtusicaudatuswere abundant (6–22%) [ 7]. Powers et al. [ 8] reported that approximately 62% of the overallnematode genetic diversity existed in the litter and understory habitats, rather than inthe soil. The current results revealed that the total individual abundance of nematodes inthe moss and litter layers ranged from approximately four to eight-fold more than in theForests 2022 ,13, 462 13 of 160–5 cm soil layer of plantations and natural forests (Figure 3A) and approximately 95% ofthe nematode carbon budget and production in the moss and litter layers in both forests(Figure S2). These results suggest that ignoring the moss layer community would lead to agreat underestimation of the nematode abundance and carbon budget in subalpine forests.However, previous studies paid less attention to comparing the effect of plantations on themoss layer nematode community. Our study highlights a simpliﬁed nematode communitycomposition and a decreased herbivore carbon channel in the moss layer of the plantationsand natural forests.4.3. Environmental Factors Indirectly Promote Herbivore Carbon Budget in Subalpine Spruce ForestA distinct daily carbon budget distribution pattern in plantations and natural forestswas attributed to herbivores, which was the only trophic group affected by forest type.Herbivores feed on plant roots and epidermal cells as well as litter [ 37]. In plantations, the5.13–16.13% higher moss layer coverage tends to homogenize the microhabitats, and theshort needle litter of spruce easily pass through the moss layer into the litter and 0–5 cmsoil layers, which provide more abundant food resources for herbivores. In natural forests,20–60% higher herb coverage and more diverse plant species provide different forms of leaflitter, with the large leaf litter remaining in the moss layer and providing herbivores witha diverse food source (Table S1). However, the soil environmental valuables were not animportant factor for the DB and DP of herbivores in this study (Figure 6A,B). This result wasconsistent with previous ﬁndings reported by Pan et al. [ 28], who found that environmentalvariables (represented by SOC) do not directly inﬂuence herbivores’ metabolic footprint.Zhang et al. [ 10] also indicated that environmental variables (represented by SOC) have anindirect effect on herbivores through microbial biomass carbon. The effects that a notablydifferent pathway of environmental variables have on herbivore nematodes demonstratedthat the soil food web interaction obviously changes the effect that environmental factorshave on the nematode community. In real webs, the herbivore channel constitutes the mainfood source for omnivores, which might be stimulated by a reduced predation intensityfrom omnivores [ 17]. The positive interaction between omnivores and herbivores enhancedthe effect size of the soil environmental factors for nematodes in an indirect way. Thisﬁnding was consistent with our third hypothesis. However, the herbivore nematodes, suchasPratylenchus, Meloidogyne , and Xiphinema, were considered as pests for trees [ 53], thusincreasing the risk of nematode infection in plantations.4.4. Reliability and UncertaintyOur estimate for nematode biomass C for both the individual and community levels iswithin the range of previous studies [ 38,54]. These facts ensured that the carbon budgetand production estimation were accurate. Our result also revealed that the nematodeproduction C and the C budget in the 0–5 cm soil layer of plantations and natural forestsare within the range of a temperate steppe [ 20]. Our estimate is, therefore, adequatelyreliable. However, our nematode production C was 16-fold lower than the black soil ofNortheast China [ 52] and 9-fold lower than the results of Luo et al. [ 19], although a higherindividual abundance of nematodes was obtained in this study. The main reason for this isnot only because of differences between the nematode communities in the two regions, butdifferences in the methods used to estimate the nematode biomass [ 19,52]. Previous studiesoverestimated the nematode individual biomass because they used the adult body masstaken from the Nemaplex website to estimate the whole community, although more than50% of individuals were juveniles [ 52]. Due to the lack of a feasible method for weighing theactual mass of nematodes, we used over 7000 individuals to measure the nematode lengthand width, and calculated biomass using an allometric growth equation. This methodhas been widely used to estimate nematode biomass [ 18,20,38] and has been shown tobe accurate in providing useful information when comparing relative differences acrossdifferent systems.Forests 2022 ,13, 462 14 of 165. ConclusionsCompared with natural forests, intensively managed spruce plantations increased thedaily carbon budget of total nematodes by approximately 52% through the herbivore chan-nel in the 0–5 cm soil layer, while the daily carbon budget and production of herbivorousnematodes was decreased by approximately 60% in the moss layer. The nematode carbonproduction and budget are signiﬁcantly promoted by individual abundance, while genusrichness inhibited this in the subalpine forests. Environmental factors directly promotedthe nematode carbon budget and production of bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores, andpredators, while the carbon budget of herbivore nematodes was indirectly promoted by en-vironmental factors through the omnivore top-down interaction. In conclusion, the plantedecosystems have a certain capacity to maintain the abundance, richness, and carbon budgetof soil nematodes but increased the risk of herbivorous pests.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/f13030462/s1; Figure S1: an initial model for nematode carbonused in production and budget through food web bottom-up (A) and top-down (B) relationships;Figure S2: vertical distribution of relative daily carbon used in production (A) and daily carbon budget(B) of nematodes in subalpine plantation and natural forests; Figure S3: incremental percentage (%)of plantations than natural forests.
