Calibrations of MIR spectrawith partial least square regressions were developed with 10–80% of the set and ﬁve random selections ofsamples. Comparisons between samples with contrasting organic or inorganic carbon content and regressioncoefﬁcients of calibration equations both showed that organic carbon was ﬁrstly associated with a widespectral region around 2500–3500 cm−1(which was a reﬂection of its complex nature), and inorganic carbonwith narrow spectral bands, especially around 2520 cm−1. Optimal calibrations for both organic and inorganiccarbon were achieved by using 20% of the total set: predictions were not improved much by including more ofthe set and were less stable, probably because of atypical samples. At the 20% rate, organic carbon predictionsover the validation set (80% of the total) yielded mean R2, standard error of prediction (SEP) and RPD (ratioof standard deviation to SEP) of 0.89, 6.7 g kg−1and 3.0, respectively; inorganic carbon predictions yielded0.97, 2.8 g kg−1and 5.6, respectively. This seemed appropriate for large-scale soil inventories and mappingstudies but not for accurate carbon monitoring, possibly because carbonate soils were included. More work isneeded on organic carbon calibrations for large-scale soil libraries.IntroductionAll countries are required to provide regular greenhouse gasinventories. Among them, countries with a quantiﬁed emissionreduction objective (Annex B countries of the Kyoto Protocol tothe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)should produce estimates on a regular basis, including agricultureand forestry activities, using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change guidelines (IPCC, 2006). While gross ﬂuxes ofmethane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are directly computed,carbon dioxide (CO 2) ﬂuxes are derived from a mass-balanceapproach, from differences over time of variations in biomasscarbon and soil organic carbon stocks. Annex B countries need,therefore, to implement systems to quantify soil organic carbonCorrespondence: B. G. Barth `es.

Soil carbon estimates over large areas,at national, continental or global scales (Batjes, 1996; Bernouxet al., 2002), have been proposed on the basis of classical digitalmaps linked with carbon estimates per map unit, using eithersoil classiﬁcation (Batjes, 1996), vegetation or biome delineation(Woomer et al., 2004), or a combination of both (Bernoux et al.,2002). Other spatial estimates involve the interpolation of punctualdata using either splines or geostatistical approaches (Bernouxet al., 2007). Saby et al. (2008) calculated that the number ofsites needed to detect a 1% relative change in soil organic carbonstock (in MgC ha−1) could reach 1 000 000 at the European scale.These calculations involve the organic fraction of soil carbon;inorganic soil carbon, which consists mainly of carbonates, islittle involved with CO2exchanges. Soil organic carbon is oftencalculated by difference between total carbon and inorganiccarbon, the latter being analysed separately. Soil inorganic carboncontent provides important information on mineralogy and soil©2012 NERCJournal compilation ©2012 British Society of Soil Science 141142 C. Grinand et al.chemical functioning involving pH and exchangeable cations.Thus both organic and inorganic soil carbon fractions are worthdetermining, but conventional procedures are costly and timeconsuming and not compatible with the implementation of largemonitoring networks. Such networks have to be re-analysedregularly. There is thus an urgent need for time- and cost-effectivemethods that would provide accurate estimates of soil organic andinorganic carbon, in order to enable such networks.Several methods have recently been proposed for cost-effectiveestimates of soil carbon. Cremers et al. (2001) tested laser-inducedbreakdown spectrometry (LIBS), which is based on atomic emis-sion spectroscopy. Other spectroscopic methods for characterizingsoil carbon include the analysis of light diffusely reﬂected bysamples in two neighbouring electromagnetic domains, namelythe near-infrared (0.8–2.5 μm) and mid-infrared (2.5–25 μm)ranges. Often this has involved near-infrared reﬂectance (NIR)spectroscopy (NIRS; Chang et al., 2001; Barth `eset al., 2006;Brunet et al., 2007a), and more recently, visible and NIR (VisNIR,400–2500 nm) spectroscopy (VisNIRS; Shepherd & Walsh, 2002;Brown et al., 2005, 2006; Brunet et al., 2008). A particularly inter-esting feature of VisNIRS, NIRS and MIRS is their capability tomake rapid measurements (about one sample per minute or less),with no consumables or hazardous reagents required, and for lim-ited costs. Recent reviews have highlighted the huge potential ofdiffuse infrared reﬂectance spectroscopy for agricultural applica-tions regarding soil fertility assessment, and considered this tobe an alternative to traditional soil analyses (Du & Zhou, 2009;Reeves, 2010).The potential of infrared spectroscopy has been tested fordecades in a wide range of settings, from ﬁeld to global scales(Brown et al., 2005). It has gained recent interest because ofthe increasing need for soil data in environmental studies, fordigital soil mapping (Grinand et al., 2008), or climate changemitigation (Feller & Bernoux, 2008). For two decades NIRS hasmainly been used as a quantitative tool, to relate spectra to car-bon concentrations statistically, whereas MIRS has long been usedfor qualitative studies and spectral interpretation (McCarty et al.,2002; Reeves, 2010). The MIR region mainly includes fundamen-tal vibrations of chemical bonds, which allows visual discrimi-nation of spectral features (peaks); in contrast, the NIR regionincludes overtones and combinations, which results in much over-lapping and few identiﬁable features (Shepherd & Walsh, 2002).Recently, MIRS has also been used for quantitative characteri-zation of soil properties (Janik & Skjemstad, 1995; Janik et al.,1998; Zimmermann et al., 2007), which can thus be performedusing different spectral domains through ﬁeld, laboratory, air-borne or satellite measurements (Stevens et al., 2008). Quantita-tive spectroscopy most often requires calibration: this is usually amultivariate regression procedure that expresses a given property,determined by a conventional method, as a function of absorbanceat all or selected wavelengths of the spectral region considered.The calibration equation can then be used to predict that prop-erty for new samples from their spectra only, provided that thecalibration model has sufﬁcient accuracy. Most determinations oforganic and inorganic carbon by NIRS (Chang et al., 2001; Shep-herd & Walsh, 2002; Barth `eset al., 2006) and MIRS (Janik et al.,1998; McCarty et al., 2002) were accurate ( R2>0.9) and hada standard error close to the usual standard error for laboratorymeasurements (around 1 g kg−1for organic carbon). However,prediction accuracy was often less for heterogeneous sample sets,such as those collected from large regions, than for more homoge-neous sets, originating from only a few hectares (McCarty et al.,2002; Brunet et al., 2007a).The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the accuracyof MIRS predictions of soil organic and inorganic carbon con-tents at a country scale, using a national library including about2000 samples representative of topsoils from France. The 0–30-cm soil depth is that most affected by agricultural practices such astillage, and is thus considered in most models of soil organic mat-ter dynamics from plot to national scales (Milne et al., 2007). Inaddition, this depth corresponds to the minimum requirement forcarbon estimates at national scales according to the IPCC guide-lines (IPCC, 2006).Materials and methodsSoil samplesSoil samples were taken from the French R ´eseau de Mesures de laQualit ´e des Sols (RMQS). This is a national soil quality monitor-ing network, the ﬁrst sampling campaign of which took place from2002 to 2009. This network involves observations of soil proper-ties on a 16 ×16-km regular grid across the French metropolitanterritory (550 000 km2), and was designed to represent climate,soil and land-use diversity over the territory. The inventory willeventually consist of observations from 2200 sites, but samplesfrom 2086 sites were available at the time of the study. The siteswere selected at the centre of each 16 ×16-km cell (Jolivet et al.,2006). At each site, 25 individual core samples were taken fromthe topsoil (0–30 cm) using an unaligned sampling design withina 400-m2square area. A systematic unaligned sample designcombines features and advantages of both simple random and sys-tematic sample designs, and a single sample plot is assigned to arandomly selected location within each cell of the systematic grid.This approach avoids the periodicities of systematic approaches,gives good coverage over an area, is efﬁcient, and deals with mostdistributions (Caeiro et al., 2003). Core samples were bulked toobtain one composite sample for each site, which was then air-dried, gently crushed and sieved to pass a 2-mm mesh.Conventional determination of soil organic and inorganiccarbon contentsSoil organic carbon content was calculated as the differencebetween total carbon and inorganic carbon contents. Totalcarbon content was determined by Dumas combustion analysiswith an elemental analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc CHNNA2000, Waltham, MA, USA), on about 25–30-mg aliquotsof ﬁnely ground ( <0.25 mm) air-dried soil samples, sealed©2012 NERCJournal compilation ©2012 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,63, 141–151MIRS prediction of soil carbon at national scale 143into tin capsules, according to the standard French procedureNF ISO 10694 (AFNOR, 1995a).Soil inorganic carbon content was calculated as 0.12 ×soil carbonate content. Carbonate content was determined onﬁnely ground ( <0.25 mm) air-dried soil samples using aBernard calcimeter, according to the standard French procedureNF ISO 10693 (AFNOR, 1995b). The carbonate content was cal-culated after calibration with a pure calcium carbonate standardand was expressed as equivalent calcium carbonate content.Distributions of both organic and inorganic carbon contentswere characterized by their minimum, maximum, mean, median,standard deviation and skewness; the latter is deﬁned as the thirdstandardized moment:skewness =n(n−1)(n −2)n/summationdisplayi=1(xi−¯x)3SD3, (1)where nis the set size, ¯ xthe mean and SD the standard deviation.Spectrum acquisition and pre-processingAliquots of about 0.5 g of <0.2-mm ground sample wereplaced in a 17-well plate and scanned from 4000 to 400 cm−1(2500–25 000 nm) at 4 cm−1resolution, using a Nicolet 6700Diffusive Reﬂectance Fourier Transform Spectrophotometer(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Instruments, Madison, WI, USA).Thirty-two co-added scans per sample were performed then aver-aged, and spectra were recorded as absorbance, which is thelog-transform of the inverse of reﬂectance. Spectrum acquisitionlasted about 1 minute per sample.Data processing was performed using The Unscrambler9.7 software (CAMO Technologies, Woodbridge, NJ, USA) forspectrum transformation and the R-Stat software (R DevelopmentCore Team, 2005) for partial least square (PLS) regression (PLSR)and validation. Several usual spectrum pre-processing methodssuch as ﬁrst and second derivatives, standard normal variate(SNV) transform or multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) weretested but did not usefully improve predictions. The only beneﬁ-cial spectrum transformations were the removal of 10 wavelengthsat both spectrum ends and smoothing over a ﬁve-point segment,which helped reduce noise: this process was applied for subse-quent analyses, either qualitative or quantitative. Limited beneﬁtof MIR spectrum pre-processing was also reported by Minasny &McBratney (2008).Principal component analysis was carried out on spectral dataand showed that the two ﬁrst components accounted for 84% oftotal variance.Calibration and validationOutlier identiﬁcation was carried out on the response variables(organic and inorganic carbon content) to remove extremevalues that might over-inﬂuence calibration models. An arbitrarythreshold deﬁned by the mean plus eight times the standarddeviation was used to identify these outliers. This led to theremoval of two samples for organic carbon; no samples wereremoved for the inorganic carbon calibration.Partial least square regression was used to ﬁt sample spectra toconventional measurements of soil organic and inorganic carboncontents. It is a well-suited and widely used multivariate techniquein quantitative spectroscopy. It can handle collinearity that affectsinfrared spectra by transforming absorbance values with respectto the response variable (organic or inorganic carbon content) inorder to reduce the information from hundreds of variables to afew orthogonal factors. Ten-fold cross-validation was performedto calculate the standard error of cross-validation (SECV). Thiscommonly used model setting was needed because of the largenumber of calibration samples, and enables grouping withoutaltering the predictive ability of the cross-validated models. Theminimum SECV was used to select the optimal number ofPLS factors to retain for building the prediction model. Thencalibration was performed on the whole calibration set, whereasthe cross-validation results referred to a pooled combination ofthe results obtained from the samples left out during the cross-validation procedure. Finally, the prediction models were testedon the validation set, which included samples not used for modeldevelopment. The number of samples used for calibration andvalidation is presented in the following section.The ability of the MIRS-PLSR method to predict organic andinorganic carbon was evaluated by using parameters commonlyused in quantitative infrared spectroscopy. For each dataset,coefﬁcient of determination ( R2; Equation (2)) and standard errorbetween MIRS predictions and conventional measurements werecalculated. The former measures the proportion of the totalvariance accounted for by the model, and was presented for thevalidation set only. The latter is the standard deviation of thedifference between measured and predicted values, expressed ingk g−1, and was presented for calibration (SEC), cross-validation(SECV) and validation (standard error of prediction, SEP;Equation (3)). Prediction accuracy on the validation set was alsoevaluated using the ratio of standard deviation to SEP (denotedRPD; Equation (4)) and the ratio of SEP to mean referencevalue over the validation set (relative SEP, denoted %SEP;Equation (5)). A good prediction result is assumed to have smallstandard error and large R2and RPD. As regards the predictionsof soil properties using infrared spectroscopy, values proposed byChang et al. (2001) have often been considered: models with RPDbelow 1.4 have no predictive ability, those with RPD between 1.4and 2.0 are acceptable and improvable, and those with RPD above2.0 have excellent predictive ability.

Regression was performed ﬁve times using differentrandom iterations for the selection of calibration samples, in orderto assess prediction robustness and reproducibility, which are twoimportant criteria to build up a calibration model. Although itis known that the calibration set has to be representative of thetotal set, there are still issues regarding the way it is selected.Random sampling has been reported to produce varying resultsin heterogeneous sample populations (Islam et al., 2003; Brunetet al., 2007a) but has not been extensively studied yet (Brownet al., 2005). Here the minimum, maximum and mean modelparameters (such as SECV, SEC, R2, etc.) have been used toprovide information on the extent of predictive ability and onsigniﬁcant differences between models.Results and discussionReference carbon dataThe soils used in this study were collected from a large geograph-ical area, which covers a wide range of soil units and representsmost of the soil types of France. According to the French soilclassiﬁcation, 33 soil reference groups were sampled, with a domi-nance of Brunisols (Cambisols according to IUSS Working GroupWRB, 2006; 27% of the sample set), calcareous soils (Calcosols,22%) and Luvisols (16%). As a result of the large variety ofsoil samples studied, variations in organic and inorganic carboncontents were huge, as measured using conventional procedures(Table 1). Organic carbon ranged from 0.6 to 170 g kg−1afterremoval of outliers (up to 250 g kg−1), averaged 25.6 g kg−1andstandard deviation was 78% of the mean. Inorganic carbon rangedf r o m0t o1 0 4gk g−1, averaged 6.4 g kg−1and standard devia-tion was 250% of the mean. The calcium carbonate content of1108 samples was below the 1 g kg−1detection limit, thus themedian equalled 0 g kg−1. Distributions of both organic and inor-ganic carbon were positively skewed (skewness was around 3for both), with more small than large values; thus medians weresmaller than the means, especially for inorganic carbon. Corre-lation between organic and inorganic carbon contents was notsigniﬁcant ( R=−0.01, P=0.59).Semi-qualitative spectrum analysisSpectral measurements and laboratory results were ﬁrst usedin a qualitative way to identify peaks or absorption regionsthat characterized carbon fractions. Spectral regions associatedwith organic carbon variations were identiﬁed by testing thesigniﬁcance of difference in mean absorbance at each spectral datapoint between organic carbon-rich ( >50 g kg−1) and carbon-poor(<1 0gk g−1) samples from Cambisols (the soil class with thelargest number of samples), using a Student t-test ( P< 0.001).A similar procedure was carried out for inorganic carbon ( >6.0and <1.2 g kg−1, which corresponds to >50 and <10 g calciumcarbonate kg−1) in the Calcosols.The difference in mean absorbance between organic carbon-richand carbon-poor topsoils from Cambisols was signiﬁcant for awide region between 3550 and 2080 cm−1, and for bands around1660 and 1150 cm−1(Figure 1a). Organic matter is a complexmixture of compounds, containing various proportions of chemicalgroups that are nearly all infrared active (Janik et al., 1998). Thusorganic carbon cannot be identiﬁed with clearly separated peaksbut as a whole spectral region with overlapping bands.In contrast, numerous small spectral regions differed signif-icantly in mean absorbance between inorganic carbon-rich andcarbon-poor topsoils from Calcosols (Figure 1b). Among them,only two could be attributed to stretching or bending vibrations incarbonate molecules, around 2520 and 1800 cm−1, as noted by Du& Zhou (2009). Other regions differing signiﬁcantly in absorbanceaccording to inorganic carbon level could not be attributed tocarbonates but more probably to soil properties that correlatednegatively with inorganic carbon. This was particularly the casefor regions around 1880 and 2000 cm−1, which relate to quartz(Du & Zhou, 2009).In short, semi-qualitative analysis of spectra showed thatabsorption of both carbon fractions could be located in theMIR region. Nevertheless, though some carbon compounds havebeen assigned to speciﬁc spectral bands, broad spectral regionscorresponding to C-O or C-C vibrations have to be taken intoaccount to describe carbon contribution to MIR spectra fully.

The identiﬁcation of chemicalbonds that affected MIRS prediction of soil organic and inorganiccarbon contents was also carried out by studying the coefﬁcientsof regression of these contents on absorbance spectra.Calibration intensity and model robustnessThe interest of diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy for quantifyingsoil properties depends on the proportion of samples usedfor calibration; it also depends on the stability of predictionswhen different calibration sample selections are carried out. Fororganic carbon, mean validation RPD and R2increased with theproportion of samples used for calibration, markedly when theproportion increased from 10 to 20%, and then only slightly upto 80% (Figure 2a). Moreover, R2and RPD were less variableand thus more stable when calibration used 20% or 30% ofthe samples; at smaller or larger rates, the results were moreaffected by the selection of calibration samples. Reduced stabilityat large calibration rates could be explained by samples thatwere atypical for one reason or another. When included in thecalibration set, atypical samples would reduce overall calibrationquality and thus that of the prediction (validation), and this wasmore likely to occur when calibration intensity increased. Whennot included in the calibration set, atypical samples were notpredicted well individually (validation), but they did not affect theoverall performance of the calibration, and this was more likelyto occur when calibration intensity decreased. At an intensity of10%, it might be assumed that the calibration set was too smallto be representative of the total set.With inorganic carbon, mean and standard deviation ofvalidation R2were much less affected by the size of the calibrationset (Figure 2b). In contrast, the proportion of calibration samplesaffected validation RPD more clearly, with a noticeable increasef r o m1 0t o2 0 % ,t h e na g a i nf r o m4 0t o8 0 % ;i ta l s oa f f e c t e dthe variability of validation RPD, with greater standard deviationwhen from 40 to 80% samples were used for calibration.Variations in validation RPD and in its variability with the size ofthe calibration set could be related to the very skewed distributionof conventional data for inorganic carbon, which resulted in alarge standard deviation (it was three times greater than themean; Table 1). However, RPD values were always large ( >5)when compared with accuracy thresholds proposed for predictionmodels of soil properties using diffuse reﬂectance (Chang et al.,2001); thus the inﬂuence of the size of the calibration set on RPDand its variability was not important. Using 20% of the samplesfor calibrating both organic and inorganic carbon could thus beconsidered appropriate for the sample set studied. This indicatedthat the national soil sample population under study was correctlyrepresented by 20% of the samples. Soil and soil-use diversityis large over all of France but not to the point where only thepopulation of 2086 would be truly representative.Very few studies have addressed such questions. Shepherd &Walsh (2002) reported a similar result for a very diverse set includ-ing about 1100 samples from seven countries and 10 soil orders ineastern and southern Africa. They observed that stable validationresults for topsoil organic carbon could be achieved with 20% ofthe samples for calibration. They also noted that a global modelmight be more robust than local models in their ability to pre-dict values for new samples even though geographically distinctsamples were used in the calibration. Similarly, when discussingcalibration sample size for a more homogeneous set including283 samples from six sites with similar soils in north central Mon-tana (USA), Brown et al. (2005) found an optimum when using35% randomly selected samples for calibration. Increasing thecalibration sample size did not result in a meaningful increase inprediction accuracy and thus was not worthwhile. The results ofthe present study also suggest that optimal calibration set size forheterogeneous soil sample populations could be estimated at 20 to35% of the samples for organic carbon and inorganic carbon pre-dictions. However, such calibration intensity cannot be consideredappropriate for all soil sample sets: Brunet et al. (2007b) observedthat optimal calibration sample size ranged between 50 and 75%for organic carbon for an extremely diverse set of 436 soil samplesoriginating from about 300 locations in 40 countries and repre-senting 13 soil orders. This strongly suggests that more work isneeded to estimate optimal calibration sample size depending onthe set diversity and the soil property considered.©2012 NERCJournal compilation ©2012 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,63, 141–151146 C.

For validation, R2was 0.97 and RPD averaged 5.6and was greater than 5.3 whatever the replicate (Table 2). ThusMIRS prediction of inorganic carbon was excellent for the sampleset considered, as also shown by the comparison between MIRSpredictions and reference measurements presented in Figure 3(b)and in Figure 4(c,d). Depending on the selection of calibrationsamples, variation in R2was less than 0.01 and RPD ranged from5.3 to 6.0, thus both were stable. Relative SEP nevertheless rep-resented a large proportion of mean reference value for inorganiccarbon (43 to 48%), mainly because of the very skewed distri-bution of inorganic carbon reference data. The mean referencevalue was small (6.4 g kg−1)because many samples includedno carbonates; relative prediction error could not be consideredas an appropriate indicator of prediction accuracy for variablesfor which the average value is much smaller than the maxi-mum. Not surprisingly, the map of MIRS predictions of inorganiccarbon (Figure 4c), as did that of conventional measurements(Figure 4d), showed that the soils richest in inorganic carbonwere located on calcareous substrates, especially in the chalkChampagne (northeast), in the calcareous Prealps (southeast), inareas of Jurassic limestone along the Aquitain Basin (southwest)and along the Pyrenees (south).

Brown et al.(2005), studying a more homogeneous set with a narrow range ininorganic carbon (0–26 g kg−1) and intensive calibration (70%),achieved VisNIRS prediction of inorganic carbon with R2=0.94–0.96, RPD =4.0–4.9 and %SEP =19–24% depending onthe selection of the calibration set (ﬁve replicates). Brown et al.(2006) also reported cross-validation R2=0.83 (RPD and relativeerror could not be calculated) for a very large, diverse set origi-nating from four continents and having a wide range in inorganiccarbon (0–129 g kg−1). In contrast, somewhat disappointing Vis-NIRS cross-validation of inorganic carbon was reported bySummers et al. (2011) for a fairly diverse but small topsoilsample set from south Australia with a narrow range in inor-ganic carbon (0–51 g kg1; 75 samples, R2=0.69, RPD =2.1,%SECV >100%). In the latter case the use of reﬂectance insteadof absorbance could be a possible reason for less accurate predic-tions than in other studies. Considering only those studies that usedabsorbance, relative prediction error tended to increase and R2andRPD to decrease when the range in inorganic carbon increased.Quantifying soil organic carbon content at a national scaleCalibration for this used 20% of the total set size, with ﬁvereplicates. For validation, R2and RPD averaged 0.89 and 3.0 andwere greater than 0.88 and 2.7, respectively, whatever the replicate(Table 2). The SEP ranged from 6.3 to 7.2 g kg−1, representing25–28% of the mean reference value. This indicated very goodMIRS prediction of organic carbon for the sample set considered;however, predictions were less accurate than for inorganic carbon.Examples of comparisons between measured and MIRS-predictedorganic carbon values are presented in Figures 3(a) and 4(a,b).The maps of MIRS predictions (Figure 4a) and conventionalmeasurements (Figure 4b) of organic carbon were very similar,and strongly driven by climate and land use.

In contrast,soils poor in organic matter were located in areas of large-scalecrop cultivation such as the Parisian Basin (north-centre) andAquitain Basin (southwest), and in vineyard areas such as alongthe Mediterranean coast (southeast).Other authors have reported MIRS prediction of organic carbonwith PLSR. McCarty et al. (2002) found similar results for organiccarbon prediction over a fairly heterogeneous sample set fromcentral USA ( R2=0.94, RPD =4.1, %SEP =26%) but usedmore samples for calibration (75%). Viscarra Rossel et al. (2006)using a leave-one-out cross-validation achieved worse results fororganic carbon for a very homogeneous set of 118 topsoil samplescollected in an Australian ﬁeld, with much smaller R2(0.73)and RPD (1.7), though relative standard error of cross-validationwas also small (11%). In contrast, Zimmermann et al. (2007),also using a large calibration intensity (85%), found better resultsfor organic carbon ( R2=0.94, RPD =4.1, %SEP =10%) for adiverse set of 111 topsoil samples representative of Switzerland.Comparable results have been achieved by using VisNIRS withPLSR. For instance, for a large and very diverse topsoil sampleset with a large calibration intensity (67%), Shepherd & Walsh(2002) reported validation R2of 0.91 and %SEP of 19%. Brownet al. (2005) achieved validation R2=0.81 and RPD =2.2 whenaveraging ﬁve replicates over a smaller and more homogeneousset and with a large calibration intensity (70%). For a very largeand very diverse set (3794 samples from four continents) andusing boosted regression trees, Brown et al. (2006) obtained cross-validation R2values of 0.82. Thus comparison with publishedresults suggests that the results of the present study were verysatisfactory: the accuracy of the organic carbon prediction modelwas comparable to others for similarly heterogeneous soil samplesets but using much fewer samples for calibration.In the present study, large organic carbon values were notice-ably under-predicted by MIRS. Studying a large and very diversesample set with VisNIRS, Shepherd & Walsh (2002) attributedsuch poor predictions to possible errors in the laboratory analyti-cal methods rather than to genuine lack of VisNIRS predictivepower. Moreover, it is worth noting that in the present studyorganic carbon reference data were not measured but calculatedby difference between total carbon and inorganic carbon, whichcaused error accumulation. As a consequence, the less than per-fect MIRS predictions of organic carbon ( R2=0.89) might resultfrom imperfect reference data. In contrast, inorganic carbon, forwhich reference data were obtained by direct measurement, wasmuch more accurately predicted, especially at large values. Otherstudies involving MIRS or VisNIRS predictions of organic andinorganic carbon similarly reported more accurate results for©2012 NERCJournal compilation ©2012 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,63, 141–151MIRS prediction of soil carbon at national scale 149-0.050.000.050.100.15400 800 1200 1600 2000 2400 2800 3200 3600 4000tneiciffeoc noissergeRWave number / cm-1Calibration of organic carbon using 20% samplesCalibration of organic carbon using 100% samples-15-10-50510400 800 1200 1600 2000 2400 2800 3200 3600 4000tneiciffeoc noissergeRWave number / cm-1Calibration of inorganic carbon using 20% samplesCalibration of inorganic carbon using 100% samples(a)(b)Figure 5 Coefﬁcients of regression of (a) organic and (b) inorganic carbon content on absorbance spectra, models being developed by using 20% or 100%of the samples from across France.inorganic than for organic carbon. McCarty et al. (2002) measuredorganic carbon after soil acidiﬁcation, which they acknowledgedmight remove some organic carbon. Brown et al. (2005) calcu-lated organic carbon reference data by difference between total andinorganic carbon. Both procedures might result in some impreci-sion. In addition, McCarty et al. (2002) reported that carbonateabsorption bands in the MIR domain could mask spectral featuresimportant for organic carbon calibration. As far as sample setsthat include carbonated soils are considered, calibration modelsfor organic carbon will not be completely satisfying because ofeither spectral perturbations by carbonates or imperfect referencedata for organic carbon.Spectral regions of greatest relevanceThe chemical compounds that affected MIRS predictions stronglywere identiﬁed by studying the coefﬁcients of PLS regression oforganic and inorganic carbon contents on absorbance at everywave-number (Figure 5). Regressions built with 20% or 100%samples yielded similar coefﬁcients, which conﬁrmed that 20%samples represented the total set properly.Some spectral regions contributed heavily to MIRS predictionof soil organic carbon content. Positively contributing regionswere from 2700 to 3600 cm−1and especially around 2920 cm−1,which has been assigned to aliphatic C-H stretch of carboxylicacids, humic acids and humin especially, and around 1230 cm−1,which has been ascribed to C-O stretch and O-H bending in humicacids and aromatic amines (Silverstein & Webster, 1998; Tan,2003). These regions were comparable to those where absorbancewas signiﬁcantly greater for Cambisols rich in organic carbonthan for those with small contents (Figure 1a). The region around1880 cm−1, attributed to quartz (Du & Zhou, 2009), had aheavy negative contribution to organic carbon prediction, which isconsistent with the fact that sandy soils are poor in organic matter©2012 NERCJournal compilation ©2012 British Society of Soil Science, European Journal of Soil Science ,63, 141–151150 C. Grinand et al.in general (Barth `eset al., 2008). This region is one of the veryfew where absorbance was less for organic-rich Cambisols thanfor those that were organic poor.Spectral regions that had a major positive contribution to MIRSprediction of soil inorganic carbon content were (i) around 2520and 1800 cm−1, which have been ascribed to carbonate (Du& Zhou, 2009; D’Acqui et al., 2010); (ii) around 1660 cm−1,assigned to asymmetric stretching of O-C-O in carbonate (Su& Suarez, 1997) but also to 2:1 clays such as montmorillonite(Du & Zhou, 2009); (iii) around 1080 cm−1,a s s i g n e dt os y m -metric stretching of O-C-O in carbonate (Su & Suarez, 1997) butalso to 1:1 clays such as kaolinite (Du & Zhou, 2009); and (iv)around 490 cm−1, ascribed to Fe-O bending vibrations (Russell,1979), which might be related to iron oxide-rich residual claysthat result from weathering of calcareous materials. The regionaround 1340 cm−1, which has been attributed to quartz (D’Acquiet al., 2010), had a substantial negative contribution to carbonateprediction, which is consistent with the fact that carbonated soilsinclude little quartz. On the whole, regions that had large positive(or negative, respectively) contributions to carbonate predictionwere those where absorbance was signiﬁcantly larger (or smaller,respectively) for Calcosols rich in, than for Calcosols poor in,inorganic carbon (Figure 1b).ConclusionThe present work demonstrated that MIRS yielded accurate pre-dictions of topsoil organic and inorganic carbon contents at thescale of a medium-sized country (France), which has not beendemonstrated so far. Analysis of variance between spectra of soilsrich and poor in organic or inorganic carbon, as well as regres-sion coefﬁcients of calibration equations, showed that the MIRSsignature of organic carbon involved a wide spectral band around2500–3500 cm−1, while that of inorganic carbon was related tosome narrow bands, especially around 2520 cm−1.Varying the proportion of samples used for calibration showedthat 20% could be considered an optimal level for MIRSprediction of both organic and inorganic carbon contents, fora sample set representing the topsoil diversity of France. Thiscalibration rate resulted in accurate and stable predictions: rangesof SEP, validation R2and RPD were 6.3–7.2 g kg−1, 0.88–0.90and 2.7–3.1 for organic carbon, and 2.6–2.9 g kg−1, 0.97 and5.3–6.0 for inorganic carbon, respectively. The similarity betweenregression coefﬁcients of calibration equations that used 20 and100% of the total set conﬁrmed that 20% was the optimalcalibration intensity for the studied set. This was an importantresult, which has not been established clearly so far.An important and interesting feature of MIRS (and otherinfrared spectroscopies) is that numerous soil properties, such asnitrogen and clay contents, pH and cation exchange capacity, canbe inferred from the same spectrum, as long as correspondingreference data are available for calibration. Moreover, oncedetermined, calibrations can be used to make predictions withsamples from new sampling campaigns (with a possible needfor calibration strengthening through spiking; Guerrero et al.,2010), which makes diachronic studies easier. However, thoughMIRS is appropriate for large-scale soil inventories and formany environmental and mapping studies, the accuracy of MIRSpredictions presented here did not seem to be good enough formonitoring soil organic carbon precisely. This might be attributedto the noticeable proportion of carbonated samples included in thesample set, as carbonates complicate spectral and conventionalcharacterizations of organic carbon and thus its calibration. Morework is needed to improve organic carbon calibration in large-scale soil libraries including carbonated soils, for instance throughsample set stratiﬁcation or spectrally local calibrations.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the French ADEME (Agencede l’Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l’Energie; con-tract 0675C0102), by IRD (Institut de Recherche pour leD´eveloppement) and by INRA (Institut National de la RechercheAgronomique).
