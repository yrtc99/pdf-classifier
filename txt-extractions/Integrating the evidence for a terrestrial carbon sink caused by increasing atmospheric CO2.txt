These direct responses have the potential toincrease plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from theatmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sinkwould slow the rate of [CO2] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO 2responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global changeand evidence for a [CO2]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here wesynthesize theory and broad, multidisciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO 2](iCO 2) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in globalphotosynthesis since pre-industrial times. Established theory, supported by experiments,indicates that iCO2is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting,atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparentiCO2responses are high in comparison to experiments and predictions from theory. Plantmortality and soil carbon iCO 2responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidencesupports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO 2, albeit with uncertain magnitudeand strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change.New Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Foundation www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley reviewNewPhytologist 2414 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

IntroductionPhotosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to bind CO 2to a ﬁve-carbon sugar, transferring CO 2from the atmosphere to plants(Calvin & Benson, 1948; Farquhar et al., 1980). Sugars producedby photosynthesis provide the building blocks and the primary fuelfor much of life on Earth. Plant tissues, many microbes, animals,and dead organic matter are all composed of carbon-richcompounds formed from these photosynthetic sugars. In manyenvironments, an increase in atmospheric CO2concentration[CO 2] increases photosynthesis. Thus an increase in [CO 2] leads togreater plant sugar availability with the potential to increase thetotal amount of carbon stored in the live and dead organic matter inan ecosystem. These observations have led to the CO2-fertilizationhypothesis (Box 1): that plant responses to increasing atmospheric[CO 2] drive increases in terrestrial-ecosystem carbon storage,creating negative feedback on atmospheric [CO 2] growth.Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increased[CO 2] by 48% (1760 –2019, 277 –411 ppm), an increase inatmospheric CO 2-carbon of 277 Pg C (Friedlingstein et al., 2019).However, global-scale carbon accounting quantiﬁes anthropogenicemissions to the atmosphere at 645 Pg C and suggests a substantial‘natural’ terrestrial carbon sink (a net ﬂux of carbon from theatmosphere to intact terrestrial ecosystems) which currentlyremoves the equivalent of 33 /C69% of anthropogenic atmosphericCO2(2009–2018; Friedlingstein et al., 2019). Along with theocean carbon sink, this terrestrial carbon sink is mitigating the rateof climate change. Process-based carbon-cycle models attributeincreasing [CO2] (iCO 2; Table 1) as the primary driver of theterrestrial carbon sink, albeit with substantial uncertainty(Huntzinger et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2019). However, iCO2isnot the only global-change factor that can inﬂuence terrestrialcarbon stocks. Anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change(hereafter land-use change) and recovery (Pugh et al., 2019),nitrogen cycle changes (Fowler et al., 2013), and climate change allaffect ecosystem carbon stocks (Keenan & Williams, 2018). A vastand overwhelming literature often disagrees about the size andduration of CO2-driven increases in terrestrial carbon storage andpredictive understanding of this process is a long-standing andunresolved scientiﬁc goal.Predictive understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems respondto iCO 2requires knowledge of a range of processes, theirinteractions, and how these processes scale. For example, terrestrialecosystem responses begin with photosynthesis inside the leaf, yetscale to have long-term global impacts. All the relevant processesmust be understood across scales, and ultimately at the global scalebecause iCO2and climate change are global-scale phenomena withdecadal to centennial dynamics.Given that c. 50% of plant biomass is carbon-acquired viaphotosynthesis, it is reasonable to assume that increased photo-synthesis increases plant biomass production (BP) and experimen-tally elevated [CO2] (eCO 2) commonly increases BP (e.g. Baiget al., 2015). However, in natural ecosystems iCO 2may not alwaysincrease BP, primarily because plant tissues require nutrients, andBP responses to iCO2will interact with soil nutrient availabilityand other limiting factors (Strain & Bazzaz, 1983; Rastetter et al.,1997). A related argument is that present-day [CO 2] is likely tosupply plants with unprecedented carbon availability that may besurplus to BP requirements (K ¨orner, 2003a). This is because for atleast one million years before the industrial revolution [CO2] wasmuch lower (170 –300 ppm) (Bereiter et al., 2015).Ecosystem carbon stocks are the result of both inputs (BP forplants or litter production for soils) and outputs. Thus for the CO 2-fertilization hypothesis to hold true, the residence time of carbon inan ecosystem must not be reduced by an amount that would negateeffects of increased BP on terrestrial carbon pools. However, it hasbeen suggested that both vegetation and soil carbon residence timesmay be reduced by iCO2(van Groenigen et al., 2014; K ¨orner,2017).Drawing from multiple disciplines, vast quantities of diversedata have been collected on the [CO 2] responses of many processes.Often this evidence can appear conﬂicting. For example, many free-air CO 2enrichment (FACE) experiments show BP gains (Walkeret al., 2019), while others show none (Bader et al., 2013; Ellsworthet al., 2017). Many tree-ring studies indicate historical increases inintrinsic water-use efﬁciency (iWUE) but no detectable change inBP (Pe ˜nuelas et al., 2011; van der Sleen et al., 2015), while themajority of forest-inventory analyses suggest biomass gains(Brienen et al., 2015; Hubau et al., 2020). Flux-tower data, globalCO2-ﬂask networks, and remote-sensing data are now of sufﬁcienttimescales (decades) to study CO 2responses against backgroundvariability, but have led to different inferences (Kolby Smith et al.,2016; Fern ´andez-Martı ´nezet al., 2017).This literature represents a wealth of information and inferencethat can appear fragmented, posing an opportunity for integration.Thus our overall goal is to provide a synthetic review of key lines ofevidence related to the CO2-fertilization hypothesis, speciﬁcally:(1) overview of theory and potential mechanisms within the CO 2-fertilization hypothesis;Table 1 Acronyms and abbreviations.Anet Net photosynthetic carbon assimilationfAPAR Fraction absorbed photosynthetically active radiationBAI Basal area incrementBP Biomass production, the sum of all tissue productionover a given time, typically 1 yrCx Carbon in pool x, where xis either vegetation (‘veg’), soil,ecosystem (‘eco’)CO 2 Carbon dioxide[CO 2] Atmospheric CO 2concentrationeCO 2 Elevated CO 2from experiments and CO 2springsFACE Free-air CO 2enrichmentGPP Gross primary productiongs Stomatal conductanceiCO 2 Increasing CO 2from fossil fuel emissions and land-use changeiWUE Intrinsic WUE ( Anet/gs)kx Turnover rate of carbon in pool x(see C x)LAI Leaf area indexNBP Net biome production, net land atmosphere exchangeNEP Net ecosystem productionOCS Carbonyl sulphideUE Use efﬁciencyVPD Vapour pressure deﬁcitWUE Water-use efﬁciency (transpiration /BP)/C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2415 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

Within each of these high-level processes, numerousinterrelated mechanisms and subprocesses shape terrestrial ecosys-tem CO2responses (Fig. 1b; Section II).Within these processes we integrate four primary evidencethemes (Box 2). eCO 2studies in Evidence theme 1 provide theonly direct evidence for CO 2responses but are restricted in spaceand time. Observation studies (Evidence themes 2 –4) span abroader range of evidence types covering larger spatial scales andlonger temporal scales but provide only indirect evidence for theeffect of iCO 2on terrestrial ecosystems.To quantify and standardize CO 2effects across variablesand varying ranges of [CO 2] we report data as a relativized β-factor:β¼logeye=ya/C0/C1=logeCO 2,e=CO 2,a ðÞ Eqn 1where yaandyeare the values of any response variable at lower[CO 2] (CO 2,a) and higher [CO 2] (CO 2,e), respectively. Othermethods to calculate the β-factor have been proposed (e.g.Friedlingstein et al., 1995) but we use Eqn 1 for the ease ofinterpretation that results from scale independence (SupportingInformation Notes S1; Fig. S1). A value of β=1 represents directproportionality between a variable’s CO 2response and the changein CO 2. Where possible (i.e. when reported at source) we reportuncertainties as 95% conﬁdence intervals.Box 1 The CO 2-fertilization hypothesis.The stimulation of photosynthesis by CO 2has been called ‘CO 2fertilization’ (Ciais et al., 2014), a term that goes back to global carbon cycle modelling inthe 1970s (Bacastow & Keeling, 1973). However, ‘CO 2fertilization’ or the ‘CO 2-fertilization effect’ have been used to refer to the [CO 2] response of anynumber of variables across scales. This broad usage has been a source of confusion and, more commonly, ‘fertilization’ is a value-laden, agricultura l termthat means the addition of nutrients to increase crop yield. Acknowledging the precedence of the term, its multiple uses, and the fact that CO 2responsesof some processes may be neutral or negative, we opt to refer to ‘CO 2responses’ of explicitly deﬁned variables and scales.We reserve the term ‘CO 2fertilization’ solely to label the hypothesis that: plant responses to increasing atmospheric [CO 2] lead to increasing terrestrial-ecosystem carbon storage, causing negative feedback on atmospheric [CO 2] growth. This deﬁnition of the CO 2-fertilization hypothesis is explicit aboutthe feedback on atmospheric [CO 2] growth, implying the potential of this process to slow climate change. The hypothesis is therefore deﬁned at climate-change relevant scales, that is, global in space and decadal to centennial in time.For the CO2-fertilization hypothesis to be true, Eqn B1 must be positive at the global scale and over a speciﬁed time period:ΔNEP¼ΔCeco¼ΔCvegþΔCsoilwhere NEP is net ecosystem production, C vegand C soilare plant and soil (including litter and coarse woody debris) terrestrial carbon that sum to give totalecosystem carbon (C eco), and Δrepresents change as a result of increasing [CO 2]. A change in carbon storage is the net result of inputs and outputs(Olson, 1963):dC=dt¼I/C0kCwhere C is stored carbon, Iis the input, and kis the turnover rate of the pool (the inverse of mean residence time).Net primary production (NPP) represents the net input of carbon to C vegand is calculated as gross primary production (GPP), which responds directly toiCO 2, minus autotrophic respiration ( Ra). In practice, NPP is often estimated from total biomass production (BP), the sum of leaf, wood, root, andreproductive tissue production over a given time period (Vicca et al., 2012). In addition to BP, NPP includes carbon used for the production of volatiles,root exudation, supply to symbionts, and changes in nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs). However, these carbon ﬂuxes are difﬁcult to measure andoften have very short residence times, somewhat akin to respiratory carbon. Therefore, to align with measurements and residence time we use BP todecompose changes in Cveg:dCveg=dt¼BP/C0kvegCvegwhere kvegis the turnover (litterfall and mortality) rate of vegetation biomass. For soils, the inputs to C soilare vegetation litter production and mortality, aswell as nonbiomass NPP ﬂuxes (S) that include exudation and carbon supply to symbionts:dCsoil=dt¼kvegCvegþS/C0ksoilCsoilwhere ksoilrepresents the turnover rate of soil carbon caused by microbial decomposition.Eqn B3Eqn B1Eqn B2Eqn B4New Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Foundation www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley reviewNewPhytologist 2416 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseAs described earlier, attributing iCO 2as the cause of trends isconfounded by covarying factors which also drive variability in theterrestrial carbon sink. We discuss these other global-change factorsin the context of attribution, but do not cover them in depth. Thedifference between direct evidence from eCO2experiments andindirect evidence from historical data (concurrent with a suite ofglobal-change factors) motivates our use of two abbreviations:eCO2and iCO 2. As with eCO 2and iCO 2, we distinguish directCO 2responses ( βdir) from indirect apparent CO 2‘responses’ ( βapp).II. Theory –a hierarchy of mechanism1. Direct plant physiological responses to CO 2Photosynthesis is limited by CO 2or light (Farquhar et al., 1980).When CO 2is limiting, theory predicts that eCO 2increases leaf-scale net carbon assimilation ( Anet)(βdir,hist =0.86, c. 280–400ppm; Table S1). The enzyme that ﬁxes CO 2(RuBisCO) alsocatalyses an oxygenation reaction, which results in CO 2loss(photorespiration; Farquhar et al., 1980). eCO 2also suppressesphotorespiration (Fig. 2a). Given that photorespiration alwaysoccurs during C 3photosynthesis, the suppression of photorespi-ration by eCO 2increases Anetalso when light is limiting, but with alower response ( βdir,hist =0.31). Canopy-scale Anetresults from amixture of CO 2and light-limited photosynthesis, and thus has anintermediate eCO 2response that depends on the fraction of light-saturated leaves in the canopy ( βdir,hist =0.60/C60.3; Fig. 2c). As[CO 2] increases, the fraction of light-saturated leaves in the canopyis expected to decrease, and therefore the historical eCO 2responseof GPP is expected to be higher than the future response(βdir,fut =0.46/C60.2,c. 400–550 ppm; Fig 2c).C4plants have evolved to concentrate carbon, thus saturatingphotosynthesis and suppressing photorespiration at low [CO 2](Ehleringer & Bj ¨orkman, 1977). Therefore Anetin C 4plants is notdirectly inﬂuenced by [CO 2] above c. 200 ppm (Fig. 2a), althoughwater savings from reduced stomatal conductance ( gs) maystimulate Anetindirectly (Leakey et al., 2004).Photosynthesis requires the acquisition of other resources andeCO 2stimulation of Anetincreases Anetper unit resourceconsumption, that is, increases resource use-efﬁciencies of water(WUE), light (LUE), and leaf nitrogen (Cowan, 1982; Drake et al.,1997). Increased use efﬁciencies imply a shift in a plant’s resource-use economy (Bloom et al., 1985) which is commonly studied usingoptimization theory.Optimization theory predicts that a change in the ratio ofAnet:gs(iWUE) in proportion to the change in [CO 2](βdir≈1;Fig. 2d) maximizes the beneﬁt of carbon gain while minimizing thecost of water lost for C3(Medlyn et al., 2011) and C 4plants (Linet al., 2015). Canopy-scaling theory predicts that the increase iniWUE is preserved at the canopy scale (Fig. 2e). Where theresponse of Anetto eCO 2is less than proportional ( βdir<1) theincrease in iWUE (i.e. Anet/gs) implies a reduction in gs(canopy-scale iWUE βdir,hist =1.1/C60.1,Anetβdir,hist =0.60/C60.3, thusgsβdir,hist =−0.53/C60.2; Fig. 2f,i). Owing to the lower pre-dicted Anetin the future, the predicted decrease in gsis greater(βdir,fut =−0.62/C60.1).Optimization theory also predicts reduction in photosyntheticcarboxylation capacity ( Vcmax), reducing nitrogen demand (Bowes,1991; Drake et al., 1997). A reduction in leaf nitrogen may alsooccur as a result of limited plant-available soil nitrogen (Sec-tion II.2) or physiological competition for the products of electrontransport (Bloom et al., 2012).2. Plant biomass productionBiomass production of leaf, wood, and root tissues is controlled bythe interplay of source (resource acquisition), sink (metabolic tissueproduction) (Muller et al ., 2011; Fatichi et al ., 2019), andregulatory processes (phenology, hormones) (Schwartz, 2013;Bahuguna & Jagadish, 2015). Within this framework, eCO2canincrease BP when BP is either carbon source-limited or when eCO 2can alleviate other limitations. Plant BP is carbon source-limitedwhen in competition with respiration for available carbon andwhen light limits BP (Lloyd & Farquhar, 2008). Sustained periodsof high growth may also reduce carbon stores (W ¨urthet al., 2005),potentially leading to carbon-source limitation.Biomass production is also carbon sink-limited by stoichiometricnutrient requirements (Elser et al., 2010). Thus increased BP requireseither increased nutrient acquisition or increased stoichiometriccarbon-to-nutrient ratios. Increased plant-available carbon may beable to ‘pay’ for increased nutrient acquisition via a number ofmechanisms (e.g. increased ﬁne-r oot BP, mycorrhizal investment,exudation, atmospheric N ﬁxat ion) (Luxmoore, 1981; Hungate et al.,1999; Fleischer et al., 2019). Changing stoichiometry may result infeedbacks that compound nutrient limitations by reducing decompo-sition rates and nutrient availabi lity (Comins & McMurtrie, 1993),known as progressive nitrogen limitation (Luo et al., 2004).In environments where BP is primarily sink-limited (e.g. tree-lines (temperature limitation), arid and semiarid (water limita-tion)), increased carbon availability may have little effect on BP(Kramer, 1981; K ¨orner, 2003b). However, in water-limitedenvironments, increased iWUE could increase BP (Mooneyet al., 1991; Wullschleger et al., 2002). LAI may also be limitedby water availability (Woodward, 1987; Yang et al., 2018) andincreased WUE may increase LAI and light absorption, leading toindirect positive feedback on GPP and transpiration (Fatichi et al.,2016; Trancoso et al., 2017).If BP is restricted by sink limitation, BP efﬁciency (BP per unitGPP) would decrease and the labile p roducts of photosynthesis wouldaccumulate. If BP is stimulated thi s may be as short-lived, primarytissues (leaves and ﬁne-roots) or lon g-lived, secondar y tissues (wood)(De Kauwe et al., 2014). Division of carbon among these tissuesdetermines the residence time of carbon in plant biomass. Wood hasgreater residence time and thus greater potential to increase Cvegaccumulation over multiple years. Greater production of short-livedtissues (i.e. leaves and ﬁne-roots) ma y increase resource capture and willincrease litter carbon inputs to the soil.3. Plant mortalityIncreases in mortality rates reduce vegetation residence times andhave the potential to offset any biomass gains resulting from/C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2417 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

By easing the carbon and hydraulic impacts of abioticand biotic stressors such as drought, or pest and pathogen attack,eCO2could potentially decrease mortality. Greater carbonresources could supply greater maintenance respiration, storedcarbon reserves or synthesis of defence compounds (McDowellet al., 2008). More efﬁcient water use (Section II.1) could delay theonset or intensity of drought, which could reduce the risk of xylem-conductivity losses.Indirect inﬂuences on mortality may emerge from the acceler-ation of individual size growth. Increased growth could reducesmall-size-related mortality by speeding individuals out of thehazards of early life (e.g. browsing) and increasing their ability toacquire resources (Metcalfe et al., 2014; H ¨ulsmann et al., 2018).Conversely, increased growth could increase large-size mortalityrisk, with tall trees being more susceptible to hydraulic stress,windthrow, lightning, and certain pests or pathogens (Bugmann &Bigler, 2011; Bennett et al., 2015; K ¨orner, 2017; Trugman et al.,2018).At the stand scale, increased growth may accelerate post-distur-bance successional dynamics (McDowell et al., 2020). Intensiﬁedcompetition for light, water, and nutrients could lead to earlierreorganization and transition (self-thinning) phases of development(Bormann & Likens, 1979), but also an earlier switch from transitionto steady-state phases (Miller et al., 2016). Acceleration of standdevelopment by eCO2may or may not change self-thinningrelationships (tree size to stem density) of a forest stand, with nochange leading to no change in biomass. However, acceleration ofBox 2 Evidence themes.Theme 1: Direct exposure to elevated CO 2Experiments in which plants are grown in CO 2-enriched air and observations of plants growing close to geological CO 2sources provide the only directevidence of plant and soil responses to future [CO 2]. The ﬁrst eCO 2experiments were typically at the scales of leaves or small, individual plants.Ecosystem-scale open-top chambers (OTCs) and larger free-air CO 2enrichment (FACE) experiments have since been implemented over decades inmore natural settings. All of these experiments provide evidence for the direct CO 2effect on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Theseexperiments also provide valuable data on biomass production, allocation to organs, and transpiration. The timescale of most experiments ( <10 yr),however, is generally much shorter than many ecosystem processes, and evidence for CO 2effects on mortality, plant community dynamics, or changesin soil carbon stocks is limited.Theme 2: Tree growth measurementsTree rings and forest inventories provide long-term estimates of wood BP in forest ecosystems across the globe (e.g. Hember et al., 2019; Hubau et al.,2020). Tree ring data are annually resolved estimates of individual stem growth over the past decades to millennia (e.g. Babst et al., 2014). These dataprovide insights into individual growth variability in relation to environmental changes including soil moisture, temperature and potentially al so iCO 2.Repeated inventories of forest ecosystems offer an assessment of forest-scale dynamics and the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, andmortality over previous decades and in some cases around century length (Pretzsch et al., 2014). Inventories tend to have a coarser temporal resolution(5–10 yr resurveys) but represent forest-stand spatial scales, albeit that plot scale varies widely: 0.067 ha forest inventory analysis, c.1–2 ha (e.g.Brienen et al., 2015; Hubau et al., 2020), 50 ha ForestGEO network (e.g. Chave et al., 2008).Theme 3: Ecosystem monitoringEcosystem eddy-covariance and global remote sensing may detect effects of iCO 2on carbon, water, and energy ﬂuxes over recent decades. Tower-based sensors are used to calculate ecosystem-scale ( c. 1 km) carbon, water, and energy ﬂuxes from the covariance of gas concentrations and verticalwind velocity (Baldocchi, 2003). A global network of continental networks (http://ﬂuxnet.fluxdata.org) synthesizes ﬂux-tower data from 916 site s,some in operation for over two decades, while the majority have run for a decade or less and are located in temperate ecosystems (Chu et al., 2017).Satellite and other aircraft-borne Earth observing systems have been measuring the reﬂectance of electromagnetic radiation from the Earth’s surfa ce,used to infer changes in vegetation cover, leaf area, and biomass at a global scale (Fensholt et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2020). Reﬂected wavelengths fromLandsat (ﬁrst launched in 1972), MODIS, and other instruments can be used to measure the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation(fAPAR) and greenness indices, which are further used to infer leaf area index (LAI), GPP, and NPP with the help of simple models (Myneni et al., 1997;Field et al., 1998). Microwave wavelengths are used to measure vegetation optical depth (VOD, ﬁrst available in the early 1980s) which can be used toinfer vegetation water content and, by extension, vegetation biomass (Liu et al., 2015).Theme 4: Large-scale constraintsAt regional-to-global scales, several long-term data streams provide constraints on the global carbon budget and its change over time. These datastreams include near-surface and vertical proﬁles of atmospheric CO2concentration and δ13C, global water-cycle measurements, and atmosphericcomposition from ice cores. Atmospheric CO 2measurements can be combined with other data and models to infer the global carbon budget and spatialdetails of land carbon uptake (Peylin et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2019). The impact of vegetation responses to iCO 2on the hydrological cyclemeasured by stream gauges can also act as further indirect evidence (Ukkola et al., 2016; Trancoso et al., 2017). Carbonyl sulphide (OCS) can be used toinfer global carbon assimilation because it is taken up by plants through stomata and is transformed by carbonic anhydrase (Wohlfahrt et al., 2012;Whelan et al., 2018)./C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2419 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensestand development could increase biomass at the landscape scale byclosing forest gaps more quickly. Differential mortality effects ondifferent plant species could alter competitive dynamics, communitycomposition, and associated stand properties (e.g. among fast-growing, ruderal /pioneer species and more conservative, slow-growing species; Ruiz-Benito et al., 2017).4. Organic matter decompositionResidence times of litter and SOM vary from minutes to milleniaand can respond rapidly to environmental perturbation (Trum-bore, 2009; Schmidt et al., 2011; Dwivedi et al., 2019). Increases inSOM decomposition rates reduce SOM residence times and havethe potential to offset any eCO2-related increases in litter inputs.Accelerated decomposition of litter and particulate SOM (i.e.priming) can result from microbial responses to increased labile-carbon availability (Kuzyakov et al., 2000; Blagodatskaya et al.,2014), including at depth (Fontaine et al., 2007). Organic acidsproduced by roots can destabilize mineral-associated SOM(Keiluweit et al., 2015). eCO2effects on environmental conditionscould also affect SOM decomposition. CO 2-related increases insoil water (Section II.1) would probably stimulate decompositionin water-limited ecosystems (Castanha et al., 2018), but couldreduce oxygen availability (slowing decomposition) in energy-limited ecosystems.Microbial activity has also been linked to the formation ofmineral-associated SOM (Cotrufo et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017),and potentially soil aggregates (Ge et al., 2018), which might slowdecomposition by restricting microbial access to SOM (K ¨ogel-Knabner et al., 2008). Changing litter stoichiometry might slowdecomposition (Section II.2). Roots can distribute carbon deeperin the soil where decomposition is slower and capacity for mineralstabilization is higher (Jackson et al., 2017; Hicks Pries et al., 2018).Greater decomposition rates might also increase soil nutrientavailability, potentially reducing plant nutrient limitation(Treseder, 2004; Dijkstra, 2008) or increasing microbial immo-bilization. Over longer timescales, nutrient immobilization canreduce nutrient losses, leading to accumulation of ecosystemnutrient stocks which may enhance mineralization and progres-sively release plants from nutrient limitation (Rastetter et al., 1997;Walker et al., 2015).5. Terrestrial ecosystem carbon responses to CO2The response of terrestrial carbon storage to eCO 2(ΔCeco) is thenet result of the above described processes. Potential increases in BPand litter production are balanced by potential increases in loss rates(Eqns B3 and B4). Increased BP of short-lived primary tissues suchas leaves and ﬁne roots could lead to greater biomass of thesetransient Cvegpools and to increased litter inputs to the soil. If woodBP is stimulated by eCO 2, over medium timescales (annual toseveral decades) ecosystem biomass could increase as a result of thelonger residence time of wood. However, wood BP is tied to treesize growth rates and the effects of tree size on mortality rates may beeither positive or negative (Section II.3). Greater wood BP orgreater wood mortality rates would result in greater coarse woodydebris, which may immobilize nutrients (e.g. Zimmerman et al.,1995).Increased plant inputs to litter and soil (e.g. wood, leaf and rootlitter, root exudates, and mycorrhizal subsidies) could increaseCsoil. However, the complex processes that drive the formation anddecomposition of SOM make the response of C soilto eCO 2difﬁcult to predict (Schmidt et al., 2011; Dwivedi et al., 2019;Section II.4). Increased soil mineralization rates could lead togreater Cecoif nutrients are redistributed from soils to plants, whichhave higher carbon: nutrient ratios and hence can store morecarbon per unit nutrient (Rastetter et al., 1992; Zaehle et al., 2014).A one-pool ecosystem carbon model (Box 1) with simplifyingassumptions (BP βdir=GPP βdir; residence time βdir=0)provides baseline-expected βdirfor carbon storage (Fig. 2j –l). Themodel indicates that when starting carbon storage is nonzero, βdirdepends on the time of measurement (Fig. 2j,k). Based on theobserved [CO 2] trend (Le Qu ´er´eet al., 2018), the model indicatesthatβdircalculations over a 30 yr period (typical of forest-inventoryanalysis) are generally a little smaller ( βdir,hist≈0.5) than steady-state ( βdir,hist =0.6; Fig 2l). Departures from these expected βvalues derived from GPP responses alone provide a guide to themagnitude of positive and negative feedbacks in eCO 2studies andcan help to guide iCO 2attribution in historical studies.III. The evidence1. PhysiologyCarbon assimilation and GPP Evidence across FACE experi-ments (11 sites, 45 species) shows that eCO 2increased leaf-level,light-saturated photosynthesis ( βdir=0.73/C60.2; see Notes S3for methods), and supports differences between C 3(βdir=0.79/C60.2) and C 4species ( βdir=0.27/C60.2) (Ainsworth &Long, 2005; all reported βvalues are in Table 2). Evidence suggeststhat maximum photosynthetic capacity acclimated (reduced) toeCO2, primarily maximum carboxylation capacity ( βdir=−0.38/C60.1) (Ainsworth & Long, 2005; Ainsworth & Rogers,2007). Nevertheless, in many forest eCO 2experiments, photosyn-thetic stimulation ( >5 yr) was only minimally affected byacclimation (Crous et al., 2008; Bader et al., 2010; Ellsworthet al., 2017).Indirect evidence also suggests increased photosynthesis withiCO 2. Deuterium isotopomers of glucose in plant archives indicatethat the leaf-level photorespiration: assimilation ratio has decreasedsince pre-industrial times ( βapp=−0.99) (Ehlers et al., 2015),which translates to an increase in photosynthesis ( βapp=1.0)(Ehlers et al., 2015). GPP estimates from eddy-covariance (23 sites,c. 20 yr) suggest a recent increase ( βapp=1.6/C60.9), attributing asubstantial iCO 2contribution ( βdir,hist =1.2/C60.6) (Fern ´andez-Martı ´nez et al., 2017). Eddy-covariance data used to calibrate amodel suggests a lower iCO 2response ( βdir,hist =0.5/C60.2)(Ueyama et al., 2020).Ice-core measurements of atmospheric carbonyl sulﬁde (OCS)combined with mass-balance analysis suggests that global GPP hasincreased since pre-industrial times ( βapp=0.95/C60.2) (Camp-bellet al., 2017), as do ice-core measurements of atmospheric O 2/C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2421 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

Satellite-based evapotranspiration combined with anecosystem WUE model estimated increased GPP over recentdecades ( βapp=1.1/C60.5) (Cheng et al ., 2017). Fourteenmethods to estimate GPP from satellite-based fAPAR resulted inwide-ranging iCO 2sensitivities ( βdirrange: −0.39/C60.34 to1.6/C61, mean =0.52/C60.3; 2000 –2014) (Sun et al., 2019).Water-use efﬁciency, stomatal conductance, and transpira-tion Experimental evidence also supports increased iWUE inresponse to eCO 2(βdir=1.2/C60.4; four sites, seven species)(Ainsworth & Long, 2005). In two FACE experiments (DukeUniversity and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL), tree-ringδ13C implies increased iWUE ( βdir=1.4 and 1.3, respectively)(Battipaglia et al., 2013). Tree-ring δ13C samples from across theglobe suggest increased iWUE in many biomes since pre-industrialtimes in northern boreal gymnosperms ( βapp=1.2/C62t o1.5/C61.6) (Saurer et al., 2004), tropical forests ( βapp=1.0) (vander Sleen et al ., 2015), and a wide range of forest biomes(βapp=1.19; Keller et al., 2017). Attribution to iCO 2also suggestsincreases in iWUE in European Pinus and Quercus (βdir=1.0/C60.6 and 0.67 /C60.9; nine to 14 sites) (Frank et al., 2015).Additional environmental factors have contributed to observediWUE trends (e.g. drying trends have increased iWUE; Saureret al., 2014).δ13C in atmospheric CO 2combined with mass-balance mod-elling suggests a global increase in iWUE since pre-industrial times(βapp=0.94/C60.2) (Keeling et al., 2017).Evidence from Duke and ORNL FACE experiments supportsincreases in ecosystem-scale plant WUE (annual BP /Transpiration;βdir,hist =0.76 and 1.1, respectively) (De Kauwe et al., 2013).Inferred from eddy-covariance, ‘inherent’ WUE (vapour pressuredeﬁcit (VPD) ×GPP/evapotranspiration (ET)) increased intemperate and boreal forests with notably higher magnitude(βapp=4.72; 21 sites) (Keenan et al., 2013). A follow-up studyreduced this estimate ( βapp=2.5) (Mastrotheodoros et al., 2017).An eddy-covariance calibrated, canopy-scale model suggestediCO 2reduced gs(βdir,hist =−0.28/C60.09) and increased iWUE(βdir,hist =0.73/C60.2) (Ueyama et al ., 2020). Satellite-basedmodels (2000 –2013) of GPP and ET suggest smaller or decreasedWUE (GPP /ET) ( βapp=−0.49 and 0.28) (Tang et al., 2014; Xueet al., 2015).Experimental evidence has thoroughly demonstrated reducedleaf-scale gsin response to eCO 2(βdir,fut =−0.22/C60.15) (Med-lynet al., 2001). Averaged across FACE experiments (12 sites, 40species), eCO 2reduced gs(βdir,fut =−0.60/C60.2) but withsubstantial variability across functional groups (Ainsworth &Long, 2005) and disturbance history (Donohue et al., 2017).Notably for Eucalyptus saligna in whole-tree chambers, canopy-scale iWUE was very tightly constrained ( βdir,fut =0.98/C60.2),and variability in the Anetresponse controlled the gsresponse(Barton et al., 2012).Across four FACE experiments (Duke, EucFACE, ORNL, SwissCanopy Crane), transpiration responses were only reduced byeCO2at ORNL ( βdir,fut =−0.54), an ecosystem that is rarelywater-limited (Leuzinger & K ¨orner, 2010) (De Kauwe et al., 2013;Gimeno et al., 2018). Airborne remote sensing suggested decreasedevapotranspiration with long-term volcanically derived eCO 2inCalifornia (Cawse-Nicholson et al., 2018). Stream-gauge networksindicate global increases in runoff (Gedney et al., 2006), inagreement with reduced gsover the northern hemisphere extrat-ropics (Knauer et al., 2017). However, decreases in runoff have alsobeen observed (Ukkola et al., 2016; Trancoso et al., 2017) andmodest runoff increases across the tropics have been driven byprecipitation increases (Yang et al., 2016).2. Biomass productionElevated [CO2] increased BP in four temperate-forest, stand-scale(25–30 m diameter) FACE experiments in the early years(βdir,fut =0.56/C60.2) (Norby et al., 2005) and over a full decade(βdir,fut =0.49/C60.3) (Walker et al., 2019). These forest ecosys-tems were in the early phases of secondary succession (initiated1–13 yr after a major disturbance). In three later-succession forests(c. 100 yr old), BP did not respond to eCO2(note ﬁne-root BP wasoften not measured): deciduous broadleaved trees ( βdir,fut =−0.097 /C61.0 to 0.55 /C61.7; 8 yr; Bader et al., 2013), Picea abies(βdir,fut =−0.30/C60.7; 5 yr eCO 2; Klein et al., 2016), and a low-productivity Eucalyptus woodland ( βdir,fut =−0.26/C60.6; 4 yreCO 2; Ellsworth et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020).Elevated [CO 2] consistently decreased speciﬁc leaf area(βdir,fut =−0.16/C60.07) (Ainsworth & Long, 2005), whichrequires increased leaf BP at a given LAI (De Kauwe et al., 2014).Synthesis of experiments (19 sites) suggests that eCO 2increasedgrassland leaf and stem BP ( βdir,fut =0.17/C60.07) (Hovendenet al., 2019), related to summer water savings and spring wateravailability (Morgan et al., 2004; Hovenden et al., 2019). Meta-analysis found that eCO 2increased ﬁne-root BP across experiments(βdir,fut =0.56), in forests ( βdir,fut =0.92), and, to a lesser degree,in grasslands ( βdir,fut =0.18) (Nowak et al., 2004).Tree-ring analysis at CO 2springs in Italy (two sites) suggests thateCO 2increased Quercus ilex tree-ring width (a proxy for wood BP)initially ( βapp=0.49–0.81), and the increase diminished as treesaged (H ¨attenschwiler et al., 1997). Basal-area increment (BAI)analysis showed the eCO 2response stabilized at around 10 yr(βapp=0.27) (Norby et al., 1999).A large number of tree-ring studies have found little evidence forincreases in wood BP. No detectable trends in BAI were foundacross tropical forests (3 sites, 12 species) (van der Sleen et al.,2015), and both increasing and decreasing trends were found acrossNorth American boreal forests (598 sites, 19 species) (Girardinet al., 2016). Syntheses across biomes found no signiﬁcant increasein tree-ring width since 1950 ( βapp=0.23/C60.8; 40 sites)(Pe ˜nuelas et al., 2011) and variable responses of BAI ( βapp=-0.45/C60.7; 37 sites, 22 species) (Silva & Anand, 2013).Conversely, Pinus andQuercus tree rings from Missouri showed apositive response to iCO 2that diminished with tree age ( βapp=-3.3, at age 1 yr; βapp=1.1, at age 50 yr) (Voelker et al., 2006).Evidence from multi-plot inventory data consistently showincreasing wood biomass (Section III.5), but few of these studiesquantify wood BP.

Two large tropical-forest plots showed no change in above-ground wood BP (Clark et al., 2010; Rutishauser et al., 2020). Bycontrast, tropical forest-plot networks (321 and 244) suggest thatabove-ground wood BP increased in Amazonia ( βapp=1.2/C60.6)(Brienen et al., 2015) and Africa ( βapp=0.69/C60.63) with aregression-attributed iCO 2response ( βapp=0.54/C61) (Hubauet al., 2020). Analysis of worldwide forest plots (695) suggested thatwood BP increased ( βapp=0.94/C61.1) over recent decades (Yuet al., 2019).BP–nutrient interactions and progressive nitrogen limitation AtDuke FACE, nitrogen availability inﬂuenced the magnitude of BPresponses (McCarthy et al., 2010) and experiments in later-succession systems with no BP response were limited by nitrogen(Flakaliden; Sigurdsson et al., 2013) and phosphorus (EucFACE;Ellsworth et al., 2017). Limiting factors were not examined for anumber of the other later-succession experiments (Bader et al.,2013; Klein et al., 2016).Elevated [CO2] experiments in early-succession ecosystemssuggested that BP gains were supported by increased nitrogenacquisition rather than changes in stoichiometry (Finzi et al., 2007;Zaehle et al., 2014). Nitrogen acquisition was increased throughincreased ﬁne-root BP (see earlier), changing root traits (Iversen,2010; Nie et al., 2013; Beidler et al., 2015), and below-groundcarbon ﬂux to mycorrhizal symbionts and rhizosphere microbialassociations (Section III.4; Drake et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2011;Terrer et al., 2018). Meta-analysis suggests that eCO2increasednitrogen ﬁxation in more intensively manipulated experiments butnot in more natural settings (total 441 studies, rates were scaled toplant or ground-area units; B.A. Hungate, unpublished).Experimental evidence for progressive nitrogen limitation islimited to a single forest (ORNL; Norby et al., 2010) and a singlegrassland (Biocon; Reich et al., 2006). Palaeoclimatic evidencesuggests that despite increasing carbon storage the nitrogen cyclebecame more open between the Last Glacial Maximum and theindustrial revolution (Fischer et al., 2019; Jeltsch-Th ¨ommes et al.,2019).Leaf area, water, and land cover interactions In some low LAIecosystems, eCO2increased LAI, but did not in higher LAI ( c.5 )ecosystems (Norby & Zak, 2011; Bader et al., 2013). However, lowLAI ( c. 1) at EucFACE did not respond to eCO 2(Duursma et al.,2016). The LAI response to eCO 2in low LAI systems has beeninterpreted as CO 2accelerating open canopies towards closure(K¨orner, 2006). However, evidence from two FACE sites (Dukeand Rhinelander) suggests that LAI can be higher at canopy closure(Walker et al., 2019). Higher above-ground biomass in somegrasslands (Hovenden et al ., 2019) indicates potential LAIincreases, although increases in leaf mass per unit area wouldreduce the LAI response relative to the biomass response. Highgrassland biomass responses have been linked to low soil matricpotential (Morgan et al., 2004), although more complex interac-tions with precipitation seasonality have also been indicated(Hovenden et al., 2019).Satellite data show ‘greening’ trends over much of the planet,inferred as increasing LAI (Zhu et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016)and with model-based attribution primarily to iCO2(Zhu et al.,2016). Consistent with theory, satellite greenness data suggestincreased foliage cover in warm and semiarid regions, probablyan iCO 2effect via increased WUE (Donohue et al., 2013). Treerings have indicated decreasing sensitivity to rainfall or droughtin the eastern US, possibly indicating WUE-mediated iCO2response (Wyckoff & Bowers, 2010; Helcoski et al ., 2019).However, less severe droughts, noted in the eastern US,probably appear as reduced growth sensitivity (Maxwell et al.,2016). At the Florida scrub oak experiment, eCO2alleviateddrought-related declines in net ecosystem production (NEP; Liet al., 2007) but the opposite was observed in the Nevada desertFACE (Jasoni et al., 2005).3. Plant mortalityGlasshouse experiments with potted plants have found little beneﬁtof eCO 2on survival during drought or high temperature (e.g. Duanet al., 2014; Bachofen et al., 2018). However, remote-sensingevidence shows increased vegetation cover in drylands (Donohueet al., 2013; Section III.2) which suggests a possible reduction inmortality in those regions.We are unaware of direct or indirect evidence for CO 2-relatedincreases in individual-scale mortality, but growth –mortalityrelationships provide some insights. Evidence supports both aninterspeciﬁc growth –survival tradeoff (Wright et al., 2010; Bug-mann & Bigler, 2011) and an intraspeciﬁc tradeoff (Bigler &Veblen, 2009; Di Filippo et al., 2012, 2015; B ¨untgen et al., 2019).However, there are common exceptions, with some high-growth-rate species with long life spans (R ¨uger et al., 2020) and otherspecies that show no, or even negative, growth –mortality relation-ships (Ireland et al., 2014; Cailleret et al., 2017).Experimental evidence for stand-scale mortality responses toeCO2is rare. In the young, regenerating stand at RhinelanderFACE, over 11 yr of eCO 2lowered rates of self-thinning (i.e.higher stand basal area for any given stem density; Kubiske et al.,2019).At broader scales, most inventory networks have shown increasesin stand-scale mortality rates. Increases in biomass mortality havebeen observed in Amazon forests ( βapp=2.4) (Brienen et al., 2015)and across continents ( βapp=1.6–3.9) (Yu et al., 2019). Tree stemmortality rates have increased, across species, elevation, and treesize, in the western US ( βapp=6.2/C63; van Mantgem et al., 2009)and Canada ( βapp=6.1) (Peng et al., 2011). However, none ofthese studies conclusively attribute trends to iCO 2and other globalchange (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. pest and pathogens)agents have often been attributed drivers of mortality trends (Penget al., 2011; Luo & Chen, 2015). Finally, several networks observeddecreases or nonsigniﬁcant changes (e.g. in stem mortality rates inGermany (Pretzsch et al., 2014) and biomass mortality in tropicalAfrica ( βapp=−0.88/C62)), although multiple regression esti-mated that CO 2increased mortality ( βdir,hist =1.8/C64) (Hubauet al., 2020)./C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2429 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

Organic matter decompositionEvidence for changes in SOM decomposition rates comes primarilyfrom experiments. Many eCO 2experiments have demonstratedincreased plant litter production and allocation of carbon belowground (e.g. Drake et al., 2011; Iversen et al., 2012). Meta-analysis(53 experiments, primarily FACE and OTC) showed that eCO 2increased litter production ( βdir,fut =0.4/C60.1) and SOM-decomposition rates ( βdir,fut =0.34/C60.2) (van Groenigenet al., 2014), yet priming effects are difﬁcult to detect in ﬁeldstudies (van Groenigen et al., 2014; Georgiou et al., 2015).Results from ecosystem-scale experiments indicate some hetero-geneity and nuance in these responses. For example, in a scrub oakecosystem, 6 yr of eCO 2increased SOM decay despite unchangedmicrobial biomass (Carney et al., 2007), and at ORNL FACE adecade of eCO 2resulted in a small but nonsigniﬁcant increase insurface-soil SOM decomposition along with a reduction inmicrobial nitrogen (Iversen et al., 2012). In a later-successionforest, eCO2increased microbial biomass ( βdir,fut =0.40/C60.4)but with no change in soil respiration ( βdir,fut =−0.18/C60.7)(Bader & K ¨orner, 2010). At EucFACE, +30 ppm eCO 2increasedsoil respiration ( βdir,fut =1.3), but a further increase of 120 ppmproduced no additional effect after 3 months ( βdir,fut =0.3) or3y r ( βdir,fut =0.21) (Drake et al., 2016, 2018). This 3 yr responsewas nonsigniﬁcant but accounted for about half of the additionalcarbon acquired under eCO2(Jiang et al., 2020).Data on long-term changes in SOM decomposition in responseto iCO 2remain limited. Synthesis of 23 ﬂux towers with increasedGPP (Section III.1) suggested a nonsigniﬁcant increase in ecosys-tem respiration ( Re;βapp=0.58/C61) (Fern ´andez-Martı ´nezet al.,2017). Synthesis and statistical upscaling of chamber measure-ments suggested that global soil respiration has increased ( βapp=-0.22) (Bond-Lamberty & Thomson, 2010). Statistical predictorsof this trend include temperature anomaly and year (possibly aniCO2effect). Notably, heterotrophic respiration would be expectedto increase if C soilincreased, even with no change in decompositionrates.Accelerated SOM-decomposition may release nutrients and feedback onto the activity of plant processes. For example, at DukeFACE, increased root exudation ( βdir,fut =1.1/C60.6) was cou-pled with a nonsigniﬁcant but substantial increase in microbialbiomass ( βdir,fut =1.1/C61.3) and production of nitrogen-acquir-ing extracellular enzymes (Phillips et al., 2011). Exoenzyme activitywas increased at Duke and Rhinelander FACE (Larson et al., 2002;Finzi et al., 2006), although no change in nitrogen mineralizationwas observed in laboratory incubations (Zak et al., 2003), perhapssuggesting that stimulation of microbial activity required plantinputs. Conversely, leaf δ15N suggests that eCO 2may haveincreased nitrogen mineralization but not ring width in maturetrees in a European forest (Bader et al., 2013). eCO2increasednitrogen and phosphorus mineralization for a limited period atEucFACE (Hasegawa et al., 2016) and enzyme activity in an alpineforest (Souza et al., 2017). Conversely, meta-analysis suggestseCO2increased ﬁne-root C : N ratios ( βdir,fut =0.13) (Nie et al.,2013), which are associated with lower decomposability.Contrasting mycorrhizal associations have been linked tobiomass responses under low soil nitrogen conditions (Phillipset al., 2013; Terrer et al., 2016). Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi areassumed capable of stimulating SOM decomposition, whilearbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are not, resulting in increasednitrogen in above-ground BP in ECM trees but not in AM plants,primarily grasses (Terrer et al., 2018). Conversely, AM associationwith Avena fatua in a laboratory and ﬁeld setting increased SOM-decomposition rates under eCO2(βdir,fut =1.4) (Cheng et al.,2012).5. Terrestrial ecosystem carbonDirect evidence from site-scale studies In the four longest-running FACE experiments eCO 2over a decade increased C vegincrement ( βdir,fut =0.60/C60.4) in these early-succession tem-perate forests (Walker et al., 2019). eCO 2of geological originincreased tree basal area in 30-yr-old trees ( βdir,fut =0.23–0.39)(H¨attenschwiler et al., 1997). Conversely, in the later-successionforest at EucFACE, 4 yr of eCO 2did not increase C vegincrement(Jiang et al., 2020), probably because of phosphorus limitation(Ellsworth et al., 2017). Other experiments in later-successionforests did not quantify C veg. Meta-analysis and extrapolation (138experiments) predicted a global increase in C veg(βdir,fut =0.22/C60.1) related to soil C : N ratio in AM-associated ecosys-tems and soil phosphorus in ECM-associated ecosystems (Terreret al., 2019). Biomass responses were generally higher in ECMsystems than in AM systems (Terrer et al., 2016), while anothermeta-analysis showed analogous biomass responses in trees com-pared with grasses (Song et al., 2019).Synthesis of meta-analyses found that eCO2increased C soilacross all ( >200) experiments analysed ( βdir,fut =0.039 /C60.03)but not in ﬁeld experiments lasting ≥2 yr without nitrogenaddition (25) ( βdir,fut =0.0054 /C60.03) (Hungate et al., 2009).However, C soilresponses to eCO 2at individual sites are mixed. Forexample, a decade of eCO 2increased C soilat ORNL FACE(βdir,fut =0.51/C60.6, 0–90 cm) (Iversen et al., 2012) and in adesert ecosystem ( βdir,fut =0.59/C60.62) (Evans et al., 2014), butnot in a scrub oak ecosystem ( βdir,fut =−0.15/C60.5) (Hungateet al., 2013). In the desert ecosystem, inorganic carbonate poolsmay have contributed to increases in C soilthrough nocturnal CO 2uptake (Hamerlynck et al., 2013) although net effects are probablysmall (Soper et al., 2017).Given limited data, litter addition experiments can also providesome insights. Synthesis of priming responses to litter addition (26studies) suggested that 32% of litter inputs accumulate as C soil(Liang et al., 2018). Ten to 30 yr of doubled above-ground litterinputs in temperate forests increased C soilat two sites (29 /C613%and 33 /C628%) but had no effect at three sites (Lajtha et al., 2018),or in one tropical forest (Sayer et al., 2019). Based on theseresponses and assuming that doubled CO 2doubles litter produc-tion (which is unlikely), βdir,hist for C soilwould range from 0 to0.41/C60.3.Measurement of NEP requires whole-ecosystem enclosure, andthus data are few. In a US salt marsh, higher rates of NEP wereNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Foundation www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley reviewNewPhytologist 2430 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

A data-assimilation approach provided a comprehensivecarbon budget at EucFACE showing no change in Ceco(Jiang et al.,2020).Indirect evidence from global and regional studies Spatiallyexplicit atmospheric [CO 2] measurements, fossil-fuel emissions,and other data are integrated using atmospheric transport models toinfer terrestrial net biome production (NBP). These ‘inversions’suggest a global NBP of 2.3 /C60.9 (MACC-II), 2.3 /C61.5 (Jena-CarboScope) (1995 –2014; Fern ´andez-Martı ´nezet al., 2019), and1.9/C60.5 PgC y−1(2010–2014; Li et al., 2018) and all estimatedpositive trends in global NBP ( βapp=19/C67, 11/C64, 9.8 /C65).These estimates of NBP include both ‘natural’ NBP and land-usechange-related (instantaneous and legacy) NBP.Global land-use change-related NBP was estimated frombookkeeping models at −1.4/C61.4 Pg C yr−1(2000–2009;Friedlingstein et al., 2019), and are predominantly in the tropics(−1.4/C60.3 Pg C yr−1) with ﬂuxes outside the tropics balancingto a net ﬂux of near zero (Houghton & Nassikas, 2017). Regionalanalysis of NBP show a strong sink in northern hemisphere extra-tropics (2.3 /C60.6 Pg C yr−1(1992–1996), 2.2 /C60.5 Pg C yr−1(2001–2004)) but a substantial source in the tropics ( −1.1/C61.5(1992–1996) and −0.9/C60.9 PgC yr−1(2001–2004)) (Gurneyet al., 2004; Peylin et al., 2013). Combined with land-use change-related NBP, these inversion results suggest small ‘natural’ NBP inthe tropics ( c. 0.3–0.5). However, analysis of the verticalatmospheric [CO2] gradient suggested close-to-neutral tropicalNBP (Stephens et al., 2007), implying ‘natural’ NBP of similarmagnitude and opposite sign to land-use change-related NBP,attributed primarily to iCO2(Schimel et al., 2015).Flask, aircraft, and satellite-based measurements show trends inthe seasonal-cycle amplitude of [CO 2] since c. 1960 (Keeling et al.,1996; Graven et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2018), implying seasonalintensiﬁcation of northern NBP ( βapp=2.2/C60.6) (Graven et al.,2013). iCO 2has been implicated as a major driver of these trends(Forkel et al., 2016; Bastos et al., 2019), although increasing cropproduction (Gray et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014) and warming-induced increasing vegetation cover (Keenan & Riley, 2018) arealso likely candidates.Carbon budgeting estimated global ‘natural’ NBP at 3.6 /C61.0Pg C yr−1(2009–2018) and 141 Pg C since 1959 from the budgetresidual, and 3.2 /C61.2 Pg C yr−1and 130 Pg C from process-based models (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). Based on the residualestimate of ‘natural’ NBP and the lower and upper bounds of eitherglobal vegetation or global ecosystem carbon stocks, βapp=0.93–1.4 (assuming all the sink is in vegetation) or βapp=0.18–0.29 forecosystem carbon (global vegetation and nonpermafrost soils).Synthesis and extrapolation of global inventory data suggestedincreased C eco(βapp=1.0/C60.6), C veg(βapp=1.9), C soil(βapp=0.31), litter carbon ( βapp=0.92), and dead wood carbon(βapp=0.64) (Pan et al., 2011). Few additional data on C soilchanges over the historical period are available. Evidence frommultiplot forest-inventory data consistently shows net gains inwood Cvegin recent decades in tropical Africa ( βapp=0.77; Hubauet al., 2020), the Amazon ( βapp=0.69; Brienen et al., 2015),Borneo ( βapp=0.48/C60.3; Qie et al., 2017), and in large 50 haplots across the tropics ( βapp=0.30/C60.24; Chave et al., 2008).Wood C vegalso increased in plots across the eastern US ( βapp=2.9/C61.5; McMahon et al ., 2010) and globally ( βapp=0.82/C60.5; Yu et al., 2019). Long-term geological CO 2releasewas associated with reduced lidar-estimated above-ground C veg(Cawse-Nicholson et al., 2018).Flux towers measure NEP directly, yet have been runningfor a relatively short time. Synthesis of 23 ﬂux towers indicateincreased NEP ( βapp=4.3/C62), with high CO 2sensitivity(βdir,hist =4.6/C62) (Fern ´andez-Martı ´nez et al., 2017).IV. Synthesis1. Evidence for the CO 2-fertilization hypothesisIn this section we integrate and interpret the evidence for change inthe components of the carbon cycle during the historical recordconcurrent with increasing [CO2] (iCO 2;c. 280–400 ppm), inresponse to elevated [CO 2] (eCO 2;c. 390–500 ppm), and theprobability and magnitude of iCO 2as a driving factor in thehistorical change. In doing so we acknowledge that we are mixingevidence across scales, measurements, methods of analysis, and, insome cases, different variables that may not be perfectly compa-rable. However, this is required for a broad synthesis, and a formalmeta-analysis is not our intention. We assign conﬁdence as ‘high’(all estimates agree), ‘medium’ (estimate means disagree, substan-tial overlap in conﬁdence intervals), or ‘low’ (estimate meansdisagree, little overlap in conﬁdence intervals).Physiology A number of independent lines of indirect evidence –ice-core OCS (Campbell et al., 2017) and O18(Ciais et al., 2012),glucose isotopomers (Ehlers et al., 2015), satellite ET (Cheng et al.,2017), and ﬂux-partitioned eddy-covariance (Fern ´andez-Martı ´nezet al., 2017) –provide high conﬁdence that terrestrialGPP has increased concurrently with iCO 2. Estimates of the GPPincrease disagree by a factor of 1.7 ( βapp=0.95–1.6, mean =1.2;Table 2), but overlap in conﬁdence intervals (Figs 3, S2) indicatesthat these estimates are consistent and suggests medium conﬁdencein the magnitude of the increase in GPP concurrent with iCO2.Above the canopy-scale GPP can be measured only indirectly, andmost of these estimates are a function of the [CO2] trend (Box 3;isotopomers, satellite, OCS) which introduces a circularity.However, we place less conﬁdence in estimates (usually satellite-based) that omit a CO2effect from the theory used in their GPPestimation (Box 3; De Kauwe et al., 2016). Flux-partitioned eddy-covariance provides the only estimate of GPP that does not require[CO2] in its calculation and provides the highest βappof 1.6 /C60.9(Fern ´andez-Martı ´nez et al., 2017). A smaller proportion of thischange was attributed to iCO 2(βdir,hist =1.2/C60.6).Synthesis of direct evidence from experiments provides highconﬁdence that ecosystem-scale eCO 2increases diurnal pho-tosynthesis in leaves ( βdir,fut =0.68/C60.2). This increase isvery similar to the theoretical value for a light-saturated leaf(βdir,fut =0.70/C60.2, Table S1). The theoretical value for thecanopy-scale photosynthesis response to iCO 2(280–410 ppm,/C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2431 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseβdir,fut =0.60/C60.3; Table S1) is about half the observed meanincrease in GPP concurrent with iCO 2(βdir,hist =1.2). For iCO 2to be the sole driver of the observed responses all leaves would haveto be operating at the light-saturated rate of increase and therewould have to be additional positive feedbacks of equivalentmagnitude.The majority of global models tend to follow the theoreticalresponse to iCO 2(Keenan et al., 2016). A carbon cycle model wasable to replicate the OCS increase in GPP ( βapp=0.95/C60.2) andchange in northern seasonal [CO 2] amplitude by hypothesizing leafoptimization and predicting a substantial increase in LAI (note thephosphorus cycle was disabled) (Haverd et al., 2020). However, it isnot clear that leaves optimize as hypothesized (Smith & Keenan,2020), and models consistently represent allocation and LAIsimplistically. For example, LAI trends are inferred in high-LAItropical rainforests (Zhu et al., 2016). In these regions models areprobably predicting an increase in maximum LAI, which conﬂictswith experimental evidence and resource investment theory. Analternative hypothesis is that iCO2accelerates the recovery of forestgaps such that landscape-scale LAI is greater –a hypothesis notrepresented by any of the models used for attribution. Outside oftropical forests, changes in LAI are related to both iCO 2(Donohueet al., 2013) and temperature-stimulated increases in growingseason length (Keenan & Riley, 2018). An additional considerationis that models tend to underestimate GPP relative to solar-inducedﬂuorescence (a GPP proxy) in agricultural regions (Guanter et al.,2014; Walker et al., 2017), agriculture being another major factorof global change. Taken together, we are conﬁdent that thehistorical GPP increase was primarily driven by iCO2and also thatiCO 2was not the sole driving factor. However, it is unclear whichfactors might be driving the additional change in GPP.A number of independent lines of indirect evidence –tree-ringδ13C (e.g. Saurer et al., 2004; Pe ˜nuelas et al., 2011; Frank et al.,2015), ﬂux-partitioned eddy-covariance (Keenan et al., 2013;Mastrotheodorus et al., 2017), and atmospheric δ13C (Keelinget al., 2017) –provide high conﬁdence that iWUE (across leaf toglobal scales) and WUE (across leaf to ecosystem scales) haveincreased over the historical period ( βapp=0.85–3.9, mean =1.5). There remain large differences (factor of 5) between theseestimates of the increase, primarily as a result of the eddy-covarianceestimates ( βapp=2.4/C62.0 and 3.9 /C62.5). The causes for thesedifferences are not fully understood, although scale (Medlyn et al.,2017), plasticity (Mastrotheodorus et al., 2017), high variabilityand short timescales (indicated by the high uncertainty), and GPPtrends that are higher than expected from iCO 2alone (see earlier)all play a role. Eddy covariance estimates skew the mean and themodal change is around βapp=1 (Fig. 3), similar to the mean foriCO 2-attribution studies ( βdir,hist =0.80) and the theoretical valuefor iWUE ( βdir,hist =1.1). As with GPP, other than eddycovariance these indirect methods use [CO 2] in their calculation(Box 3). Satellite estimates of WUE suffer from very short timeperiods (13 yr) with low signal-to-noise ratio, leaving littleconﬁdence in these trend estimates. Direct evidence from multipleexperiments support iWUE and WUE increases ( βdir,fut =0.65–1.6, mean =1.1) in agreement with predictions from theory(Fig. 2). Taken together this evidence provides high conﬁdencethat iCO 2has increased iWUE, medium conﬁdence that themagnitude is in accordance with theory, and low conﬁdence in themagnitude of the historical change in WUE.How do these changes in iWUE translate to changes in water use?Theory predicts that iWUE ( Anet/gs) responses are very tightlyconstrained ( βdir≈1), so if the change in Anetis below 1, gswilldecrease (Barton et al., 2012). The observed changes in GPP ( βapp≈1) suggest that widespread and broad-scale reductions in gsmightnot have occurred. Reductions in stomatal conductance couldoccur at points in time or space, but as spatial and temporal scaleincreases, iCO2-induced decreases in stomatal conductance prob-ably translate into smaller decreases in transpiration (Field et al.,1995; K ¨orner et al., 2007).Increased vegetation cover in semiarid regions (Donohue et al.,2013; Ukkola et al., 2016), increased rooting depth (Y. Yang et al.,unpublished; Iversen, 2010), soil –water feedback on gs, competi-tion and atmospheric coupling (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986;Buckley et al., 2017; Sperry et al., 2019; Sabot et al., 2020) are allmechanisms that may lead to no change in water use at larger scales.This is particularly likely to be the case in water-limited regionswhere long-term transpiration is primarily precipitation-driven(Fatichi et al., 2016), that is, plants use the water that is available.Biomass production Ecosystem-scale forest-inventory networkssuggest increases in wood BP concurrent with iCO2(mean βapp≈1;Brienen et al., 2015; Yu et al ., 2019, Hubau et al ., 2020).Conversely, evidence from tree rings is mixed (e.g. Pe ˜nuelas et al.,2011; Silva & Anand, 2013). Both of these methods are subject topotential sampling biases (Box 3). However, the tree-ring biases arepotentially larger and can be either positive (Nehbas-Ahles et al.,2014) or negative (Brienen et al., 2016). The inventory evidenceprovides medium conﬁdence in an increase in wood BP over thehistorical period, with low conﬁdence in the magnitude ( βappc. 1).However, this is an area of disagreement among several in ourauthorship group.Many studies show increased BP in response to eCO2(e.g. Baiget al., 2015), but these studies are often short-lived and underartiﬁcial conditions. Evidence from long-term, large-scale FACEexperiments ( <10 experiments) is mixed, with both increases (e.g.Norby et al., 2005) and no change in BP observed (e.g. Bader et al.,2013; Jiang et al., 2020) ( βdir,fut =−0.3 to 0.56, mean =0.19).Many studies show a BP response to eCO 2that is higher at sites withhigher nutrient availability (e.g. Terrer et al., 2018), greater whennutrients were added (e.g. Reich et al., 2006; Sigurdsson et al.,2013), or show no response when nutrients are low (e.g. Sigurdssonet al., 2013; Ellsworth et al., 2017). However, strong evidence forthe widely held progressive nitrogen limitation hypothesis isrestricted to two experiments (Biocon, ORNL) (Reich et al., 2006;Norby et al ., 2010). At both of these experiments nutrientdynamics also caused declining BP in the ambient treatments,indicating that eCO2responses can be tied, via nutrient availability,to underlying ecosystem dynamics.Biomass production responses were observed in earlier-succes-sion more-disturbed ecosystems, which also tend to have highernutrient availability (K ¨orner, 2006). The experiments with noresponse were often situated in later-succession forests, some ofNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Foundation www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley reviewNewPhytologist 2432 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

The forest inventoriesin which BP increases concurrently with iCO 2were observed inlater-succession, primarily tropical, forests that are assumed to bestrongly nutrient-limited. These inventory responses are high ( βapp≈1) compared with the results from experiments even in earlier-succession forests ( βdir,fut =0.49/C60.3). However, the evidence isinsufﬁcient to robustly evaluate how eCO 2affects late-successionaland tropical forests. Taken together, this evidence suggests highconﬁdence that eCO 2can stimulate BP ( βdir,fut≈0.5), that theresponse is diminished by nutrient limitations, and that theobserved inventory response is probably a result of iCO2andadditional factors.Vegetation mortality A number of independent plot networksprovide high conﬁdence that tree mortality has increased over thehistorical period but low conﬁdence in the magnitude ( βapp=−1.2–7.4, mean =2.8; Figs 3, S3). The greatest changes areprimarily attributed to drought. Causes of mortality are oftenstochastic, multifactorial, and play out over long time periods,making trend identiﬁcation and attribution at ecosystem andlandscape scales uncertain (McMahon et al., 2019). For individualscale mortality, an intraspeciﬁc growth –survival tradeoff isapparent for some species (e.g. Di Fillipo et al., 2015), whichwould reduce life spans if iCO2increases wood BP. However anintraspeciﬁc growth –survival tradeoff is not ubiquitous amongspecies (e.g. Cailleret et al., 2017).Glasshouse eCO 2experiments suggest that eCO 2does notreduce drought-related mortality (e.g. Duan et al ., 2014;Bachofen et al., 2018). However, eCO 2commonly increased leafarea in these experiments, increasing transpiration which probablyexacerbated mortality risk (Duan et al., 2018). What does thismean for eCO 2responses in ecosystems? Owing to the juvenilegrowth stage of these plants, leaf area increases were much higherthan expected in closed canopy systems (see Box 3), and increasedroot BP from eCO2would exacerbate pot-volume constraints onroot proliferation. Inference from these experiments is limited. Atthe stand scale there is very limited evidence that eCO2mightchange self-thinning relationships allowing higher basal area for agiven stem density (Kubiske et al., 2019). Evidence for changes inmortality caused by iCO 2is weak and mostly indirect with limitedsupport for both increases and decreases in individual and stand-scale mortality rates. Taken together the response of mortality toiCO2and eCO 2is unknown, even the direction of change isunclear.Fig. 3 βdistributions based on data from Table 2 for water-use efﬁciency (WUE), gross primary production (GPP), biomass production (BP), turnover rate ofvegetation ( kveg) and soil organic matter ( ksoil), and plant (C veg) and soil (C soil) carbon.

These trends couldpossibly be related to increasing heterotrophic respiration anddecomposition, but increasing temperature is inferred as the cause,not iCO2(e.g. Bond-Lamberty et al., 2018). Owing to the lownumber of studies, there is low conﬁdence that SOM decompo-sition has increased over the historical period and it is unknownwhether SOM decomposition rates have increased.Evidence from eCO 2experiments generally supports the theorythat rising [CO 2] increases SOM-decomposition rates (e.g. vanGreonigen et al., 2015) as a result of increases in microbial biomass,rhizosphere priming, mycorrhizal association and increases in soilwater content (see references in Section III.4). Smaller changes indecomposition rates have been associated with lower microbialbiomass and higher soil water (Bader & K ¨orner, 2010; Iversen et al.,2012). Taken together, the evidence suggests there is mediumconﬁdence that eCO2increases rates of SOM decomposition butwith low conﬁdence in the magnitude. Increasing SOM decom-position will also release nutrients that may be available for plantgrowth and BP. Plant nutrient acquisition through mycorrhizaland other root –microbe interactions are probably mediators of thisprocess (Terrer et al., 2018). Notably, the large step-change ineCO2experiments compared with the more gradual iCO 2couldlead to a greater imbalance of available resources resulting in acarbon surplus (Box 3) which could fuel greater microbial activity.It is worth noting that increased SOM-decomposition rates do notnecessarily imply lower Csoilif litter inputs are also increasing(Liang et al., 2018).Terrestrial ecosystem carbon Multiple independent lines ofevidence –global-scale carbon budgeting (Friedlingstein et al.,2019), atmospheric inversions (e.g. Peylin et al., 2016; Fern ´andez-Martı ´nez et al., 2019), seasonal [CO 2] amplitude trends (Gravenet al., 2013), and forest inventories (e.g. Pan et al., 2011; Hubauet al., 2020) –imply a CO 2sink in terrestrial ecosystems (Figs 3,S4). This evidence provides high conﬁdence that terrestrialecosystem carbon has increased over the historical period, withsubstantial changes in the ‘natural’ carbon sink almost balanced bya net carbon source from land-use change. Global carbonbudgeting and global forest analysis suggest responses concurrentwith iCO2in the range, βapp=0.18–1.0. The ‘natural’ carbonstore response estimated for global intact forests ( βapp=0.66/C60.4; Pan et al., 2011) is higher than estimated for the‘natural’ land surface ( βapp=0.18–0.29; Friedlingstein et al.,2019). Trends observed in eddy-covariance NEP (site-scale‘natural’ sink) and inversion NBP (global-scale combined ‘natural’and land-use sink) are extremely high ( βapp=4.3–19, mean 11).The extremely high βappfor global NBP (and, to a lesser degree,NEP) results from global NBP being near zero as the ‘natural’ sinkis almost balanced by the net source from land-use change, and thussmall absolute changes can be high in relative terms (Box 3).CO2effects on terrestrial carbon are convolved with theeffects of concurrent anthropogenic changes in climate, nitrogendeposition, and land-use change, including agricultural intensi-ﬁcation and ﬁre management. Attribution analyses indicate aprimary role for iCO2(e.g. Schimel et al., 2015; Keenan et al.,2016; Bastos et al ., 2019; Fern ´andez-Martı ´nez et al ., 2019;Haverd et al., 2020). These analyses depend on the inclusion ofaccurate explanatory-variable datasets and accurate processrepresentation in models, which may not be the case. Quan-tiﬁcation of the effect of iCO2on global carbon storage interrestrial ecosystems remains elusive.As with BP responses, studies of forest inventories show higherCvegresponses ( βapp=0.3–2, mean =0.85) than studies of eCO 2experiments ( βapp=0.22–0.39) (Fig. 3). However, the highestvalues come from two analyses: one that includes global forestregrowth ( βapp=1.9; Pan et al., 2011) and younger ( c.5 0–100 yrold) temperate forests ( βapp=2/C61; McMahon et al., 2011).Exclusion of these higher change studies results in a narrower range(βapp=0.3–0.85, mean =0.57). This exclusion narrows thedifference between responses inferred from iCO 2and eCO 2studies, which is consistent with theory as relative stock changes areunderestimated more in short-term experiments than in inventory-type studies (Fig. S2). Responses of vegetation carbon incrementmay give a more accurate estimate of responses in systems that arefar from equilibrium when initially exposed to eCO2(Fig. S2).Vegetation carbon increment responses estimated from FACEexperiments ( βapp=0.60/C60.4; Walker et al., 2019) are consis-tent with the reduced range from inventory studies. However, thetheoretical underestimation of undisturbed forest-inventoryresponses (Fig. S2) yet similarity of these responses with thosefrom disturbed forests subjected to eCO2and not the lower valuesfrom undisturbed forests (e.g. Jiang et al., 2020) requires furtherconsideration. Either eCO 2experiments are underestimatingresponses or other factors have affected the inventory evidence.Both of these evidence types are likely to be missing the full extent ofmortality (e.g. Chambers et al., 2013), and evidence from larger-scale 50 ha plots suggests a lower response for intact tropical forests(βapp=0.30/C60.2; Chave et al., 2008).Evidence of changes in C soilis mixed and context-dependent. Onaverage there is no detectable response across experiments (Hun-gate et al., 2009), although at some individual sites, Csoildidaccumulate (e.g. Iversen et al., 2012; Evans et al., 2014). The onlystudy (to our knowledge) of soil carbon changes concurrent withiCO2suggests a relative response in global forests ( βapp=0.31;Panet al., 2011), which would be substantial if extrapolated tomineral soils globally. As with vegetation carbon stocks, the long-term, relative responses of soil carbon stocks are probablyunderestimated by short-term eCO 2experiments (Fig. S2). Takentogether, evidence suggests medium conﬁdence that eCO 2increases ecosystem carbon stocks over short to medium timescalesand that iCO2has contributed to the change over the historicalperiod, but with low conﬁdence in the magnitude.2. What we need to knowConﬁdence in the magnitude of CO 2effects is generally low. Inparticular, iCO 2attribution is a major challenge in testing theCO 2-fertilization hypothesis over the historical period.

We advocate using log-log βas a stable(Notes S1; Fig. S1), relativized metric for comparison withtheoretical expectations and other studies.Process-based models are also used to deconvolve causation frommultiple global-change factors. Models often represent key mech-anisms oversimplistically and yet are also equiﬁnal, while modelensembles represent a nonrandom sample of nonindependentmodels (Beven, 2006; Fatichi et al., 2019; Sanderson & Fisher,2020). Thus, models need always to be interpreted in the context ofthe mechanisms they represent, those they do not, how represen-tations might bias results, and how well they reproduce observa-tions (e.g. Medlyn et al., 2015). Mechanistic models (or modules)of BP, resource acquisition and allocation, how soil and plant waterstatus affect gs, plant –microbe effects on soil decomposition,vegetation structure and demography (e.g. competition, mortal-ity), and land-use need to be developed and applied moreextensively to the CO2-fertilization hypothesis. Alternativehypotheses to explain observed phenomena should be evaluatedwithin model ensembles, and calibrated to allow the hypotheses tocompete on an equal footing (e.g. Zhang et al., 2015). Agile andextensible models (e.g. Clark et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2018) willbe needed to rapidly incorporate this understanding, includinguncertainty, into the internally consistent and quantitative systems-level theory that models represent.It is crucial that future eCO2experiments are designed andresourced to understand the mechanistic basis for responses (or lackthereof) and do not simply report signiﬁcance or effect sizes.Integration with extensible, process-based models will help us toevaluate and explore the mechanistic basis for observed responses(Medlyn et al., 2015). During the lifetime of long-term experi-ments, new hypotheses will arise to explain unexpected or keyobservations that may help to provide context and mechanismsunderlying the observed responses. These long-term experimentsrepresent very large investments, and for relatively small additionalinvestment, related studies can test mechanistic hypotheses as theyarise during an experiment’s lifetime.3. Suggestions for high-priority future studies/C15Understanding the mechanistic basis for GPP increases observed overthe historical period and how this relates to water use . GPP, iWUE,and water use are intimately tied. The mechanisms by which plantsmight adjust to iCO2(photosynthetic acclimation /optimization,more and deeper roots, gsresponses to water status) are not fullyunderstood and thus not well explored within models. A quanti-tative synthesis of canopy or stand-scale photosynthetic responsesin eCO2experiments would be informative./C15Biomass production inferred from tree rings and forest inventoriesreach very different conclusions. Where possible, studies that canintegrate these two types of evidence, such as tree-ring sampling atinventory sites (e.g. Dye et al ., 2016; Evans et al ., 2017),acknowledging respective biases, will be fruitful. The mechanismsunderlying how increased GPP leads to increased BP and increasednutrient acquisition through plant –microbe associations are keyareas for future study, especially over successional gradients. eCO2studies in mid- and late-succession ecosystems, and tropical, boreal,semiarid, and savannah ecosystems will help to address the young,temperate ecosystem bias in eCO2studies./C15How iCO 2affects mortality is key to understanding C vegandcommunity responses to iCO 2. As mortality is a relatively rare eventin established vegetation, change detection and attribution ofcausation require large-scale, long-term monitoring and, ideally,experiments (Hartmann et al., 2018). Understanding the mechan-ics of observed growth –mortality tradeoffs and whether iCO2maybe alleviating mortality in semiarid regions is a high priority./C15Studies of the C soildecomposition rate over the historical period arepractically nonexistent; additional studies are required. As with BP,efforts to fully understand plant –microbe –soil (and probably inverte-brate), carbon –nutrient interactions continue to be a high priority.Furthermore, investigation of responses in deep soil layers are few ornonexistent. Understanding how the opposing processes of increasedlitter production, root –microbe interactions, increased decompositionrates, and rates of mineral-associated SOM formation balance to affectCsoilthroughout the soil proﬁle will be k ey to predictive understanding.This may be especially relevant in nonforest ecosystems, where thelargest potential change in ca rbon storage is below ground./C15iCO 2affects ecosystem carbon primarily through effects on NEP, andthus understanding of C ecoresponses to iCO 2will emerge from theseresearch priorities. Further, NBP is what the atmosphere ‘sees’,which includes additional nonrespiratory carbon losses caused byﬁre (anthropogenic and wild), hydrological export, and export ofconsumer goods. iCO2may interact with some nonNEP ﬂuxes(e.g. greater grassland BP, leading to higher fuel loads, greater BP inregrowing forests following land-use change). Land-use changeNBP is often calculated without considering iCO2and separatelyfrom ‘natural’ NBP caused by iCO 2, climate change, nitrogendeposition, and other factors (e.g. Friedlingstein et al., 2019),although the boundary between these ﬂuxes is blurred (Pongratzet al., 2014). Integrated studies that consider all of these factors,especially land-use change (including iCO2acceleration ofregrowth following disturbance; e.g. Pugh et al., 2019), agriculture,and ‘natural’ ﬂuxes, will yield further insights.V. ConclusionsTo evaluate the CO 2-fertilization hypothesis, we synthesizedevidence from wide-ranging disciplines within an integratedtheoretical framework. We have medium or high conﬁdence thatGPP, iWUE, BP, and mortality have all increased over thehistorical period. However, we frequently have low or mediumconﬁdence in the magnitude, and low conﬁdence in how much ofthe change is attributable to iCO2.The complex nature of the problem demands integrated studies,and further integration is required to fully combine the broadevidence in a way that is scale-, bias-, and uncertainty-aware(Box 3). Inference regarding trends and responses (or lack thereof)should always be grounded in the context-dependence and biasesassociated with a particular study. Further experiments andobservations are needed to help reconcile differences amongevidence streams. For example, tree-ring sampling at ﬂux sites or/C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley review Review 2435 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

A holistic, community-based approachwill enable the greatest advances and provide the most robustinformation to decision-makers.The required size of climate-change mitigation efforts dependsdirectly on how future terrestrial carbon storage evolves. Evidencefor the CO2-fertilization hypothesis suggests a highly valuableecosystem service that is buying us time in the ﬁght against climatechange, although the size of this subsidy remains unclear. Based ondiminishing theoretical GPP responses, probable increasing nutri-ent limitations, increasing mortality, and other negative temper-ature-related effects (Pe ˜nuelas et al., 2017) it is highly likely thatincreases in terrestrial carbon storage as a result of iCO2will declineinto the future. A decline in this subsidy will result in acceleratedclimate change on the current trajectory of anthropogenic CO2emissions.Box 3 Consideration of methods and bias.In eCO 2experiments , conﬁnement of roots in pots can limit below-ground resources. While eCO 2can accelerate leaf area gain in open-grown plants,leading to compound interest that does not occur with closed canopies (Norby et al., 1999). These experiments represent early post-disturbance‘reorganizing’, and possibly open-canopy ecosystems but are not representative of closed-canopy ecosystems. Oscillating [CO 2] may lessenphysiological responses (Allen et al., 2020). The step-change in [CO 2] results in a large shift in the ecosystem resource balance (Walker et al., 2015),while soil disturbance can increase nutrient availability (K ¨orner, 2006). Many experiments (and evidence themes more broadly) do not quantify total BP,especially root BP. Even the longest-running experiments are short-lived relative to the life span of trees. Landscape-scale atmospheric feedback s (e.g.increased VPD that could mitigate reductions in transpiration) cannot be accounted for (Leuzinger et al., 2015).Many ‘measurements’ rely on models in their calculation , and thus have the potential to omit or presuppose a CO 2effect. For example, satellite grossprimary production (GPP; e.g. Sun et al., 2018) and net primary production (NPP; e.g. Kolby-Smith et al., 2016) are calculated from the fraction ofabsorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) using a light-use efﬁciency model (Monteith, 1972) that often does not include the CO 2effect onphotosynthesis (De Kauwe et al., 2016). Thus, changes in GPP result only from changes in leaf area index (fAPAR) or climate. Conversely, measurementmodels that include a CO 2effect are thus not independent of iCO 2(e.g. iWUE from δ13C, carbonyl sulphide, or isotopomers) and thus have the potentialto presuppose a CO 2-related trend.Carbon isotope discrimination during photosynthesis reduces the13C:12C ratio ( δ13C) in plant material and is used to calculate iWUE from δ13C(Farquhar et al., 1982; Farquhar& Cernusak, 2012).The commonlyused model neglects mesophyll and photorespiration discrimination (Farquhar et al.,1982; Farquhar & Cernusak, 2012), and accounting for these effects can increase iWUE trends by c. 50% (Keeling et al., 2017).Tree-ring trends are subject to sampling and survivorship biases (Brienen et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2015) that can affect growth trends by up to 200%(Hember et al., 2019; Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2014), leading some to question whether tree rings should be used for trend detection at all (Brienen et al.,2012). However, tree rings are the only data that offer insights into tree BP since the industrial revolution.Many studies use tree-ring width as a proxy for wood BP because it is a direct measurement. However, trees grow in three dimensions and change in theone-dimensional ring width does not directly scale with wood volume growth and thus BP in different sized trees. Conversion to the two-dimensional ba salarea increment (BAI) helps to unify this size mismatch, but again does not account for nonlinear change in wood BP with tree size (Anderson-Teixeira et al.,2015). Allometric scaling should be applied to ring width and BAI to attempt a best possible estimate of wood BP (e.g. Dye et al., 2016). Static allometricrelationships over time can introduce bias where environmental changes have altered resource allocation. For example, shifting allocation from wo od toleaves in Russian forests reconciled apparently conﬂicting inventory data that suggested BP declines, while remote sensing suggested increases (L apeniset al., 2017). Furthermore, wood volume growth does not always scale with BP as wood density can also change (Pretzsch et al., 2018).Forest inventory plots ( c.1 ha and less) can undersample mortality , resulting in overestimates of biomass accumulation (Chambers et al., 2013).Generally, statistical power for detecting and attributing change in mortality and SOM is often low (Hungate et al., 2009; Sulman et al., 2018; McMahonet al ., 2019). Statistical power for detection is low as a result of measurement uncertainty, low signal-to-noise, heterogeneity, and potentialpretreatment differences. Low statistical power presents a real challenge for attribution when employing commonly used binary mortality assessme ntsor bulk SOM measurements (Sulman et al., 2018; McMahon et al., 2019). Furthermore, satellite data, ﬂux towers, and experiments all suffer from shorttime periods, often with much background variability that can obscure or amplify trends.Quantiﬁcation of global ‘natural’ NBP is confounded with quantiﬁcation of land-use change-related NBP which is uncertain (95% CI is 92% of themean ﬂux; Friedlingstein et al., 2019). Land-use change-related NBP is calculated using bookkeeping models that account for complex legacy effectsand many elements of land-use change, which adds to the uncertainty (Pongratz et al., 2014). Furthermore, potentially substantial interactions of land-use change-related NBP and iCO 2are not considered by these methods. C vegand C soilchanges, loss of storage /sink capacity, and potential CO 2interactions with secondary succession all convolve land-use change and ‘natural’ NBP ﬂuxes, suggesting a false dichotomy in these ﬂux calculation s.Calculating and interpreting β, or any relative response, is challenging for carbon stocks in which pre-change values can be large, change is the productof two opposing ﬂuxes cumulative over multiple years, and concepts of steady state and nonsteady state apply. Ideally we would like to know βfrom pre-change steady state to post-change steady state. However, an ecosystem may not be in steady state before change and post-change ecosystems enter atransient phase and can take a long time to reach steady state. Calculated during the transient phase, βwill be a function of initial stocks and thedevelopmental stage explored (seedling, sapling, mature tree) and signals will accumulate over time. For ecosystems not in steady state pre-change ,βofthe changes in the stock increment is not sensitive to initial stocks, but could be large where pre-change increments are small (i.e. when pre-change t hesystem is close to steady state). For steady-state ecosystems pre-change, acknowledgment that βis nonsteady state is needed and a βthat explicitlyincludes temporal scale should be sought.New Phytologist (2021) 229: 2413–2445 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Foundation www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley reviewNewPhytologist 2436 14698137, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16866 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].
