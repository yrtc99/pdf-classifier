How-ever, how soil moisture affects response of SOCmineralization to litter addition in forest ecosys-tems remains unexplored. We added13C-labeledlitter to subtropical forest soils with three masswater contents (L, 21%; M, 33%; H, 45%). Carbondioxide production was monitored, and the com-position of soil microbial communities was deter-mined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA). When nolitter was added, SOC mineralization was greater inthe M-treated soil. Litter addition promoted SOCmineralization, but this promotion was altered bysoil moisture and litter type. Priming effects in-duced by P. massoniana leaf litter in the M-moist-ened soil were signiﬁcantly ( P<0.05) higher thanthose in other treatments. Litter-derived C wasapproximately 55% incorporated into 18:1 x9c and16:0 PLFAs, and this proportion was not signiﬁ-cantly affected by soil moisture. Soil moisture af-fected the distribution of litter-13C in i15:0, i17:0,and cy19:0 individual PLFAs. The primed C evo-lution was signiﬁcantly related to the ratio ofGram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. Theseresults suggest that changes in soil moisture couldaffect SOC mineralization in forest ecosystems.Key words: soil moisture; litter addition; primingeffect; soil microbial community; soil organiccarbon; forest eocsystem.INTRODUCTIONAlthough future changes in precipitation stronglydepend on climatic zone and region, consideringrecent climate changes, increasing rainfall andlonger drought conditions may be expected (IPCC2007 ). These conditions cause frequent changes insoil moisture and consequently inﬂuence theavailability of carbon (C) and nutrients (Schimeland others 2007 ; Butterly and others 2009 ) and themineralization of soil organic C (SOC; Navarro-Garcı ´a and others 2012 ; Wang and others 2013a ).Therefore, as highlighted by Kuzyakov ( 2010 ),studying the inﬂuence of soil moisture on thepriming effect is of particular importance forunderstanding the potential inﬂuence of climatechange on the C cycle.The priming effect is deﬁned as the promotion orretardation of SOC mineralization by the additionReceived 10 March 2015; accepted 23 October 2015;published online 4 March 2016Author contributions Qingkui Wang designed this experiment andwrote this paper.

This effect has beenextensively studied in response to the addition oforganic C to soil, ranging from easily degraded Csources (Hamer and Marschner 2005 ; Qiao andothers 2014 ) to plant residues (Potthast and others2010 ; Wang and others 2013a ). Most studies on thepriming effect have focused on the quantity andquality of external substrates (Hamer and Marsch-ner2005 ; Potthast and others 2010 ) and on nutri-ent availability (Nottingham and others 2009 ;Zhang and Wang 2012 ; Wang and others 2014 ).Soil moisture is a key factor inﬂuencing SOCmineralization in terrestrial ecosystems (Liu andothers 2009 ; Moyano and others 2013 ). Althoughsome studies on SOC mineralization in relation tosoil moisture have been conducted (Schimel andothers 2007 ; Misson and others 2010 ; Manzoni andothers 2012 ), little is known about how soil mois-ture affects the priming effect in forest ecosystems.The composition and activity of the soil microbialcommunity affect the magnitude and direction ofthe priming effect (Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov2008 ; Garcia-Pausas and Paterson 2011 ; Yao andothers 2012 ; Wang and others 2014 ). The responseof the soil microbial community to litter additionmay be affected by changes in soil moisture be-cause soil moisture plays a vital role in regulatingmicrobial activity and community composition(Hackl and others 2005 ; Chen and others 2007 ;Brockett and others 2012 ). For example, short-term increases in soil microbial activity can occurafter rewetting of dry soils, as shown by a ﬂush of Cmineralization (Navarro-Garcı ´a and others 2012 ;Go¨ransson and others 2013 ). Although manystudies have investigated the inﬂuence of soilmoisture on microbial community composition(Chen and others 2007 ; Brockett and others 2012 ;Zumsteg and others 2013 ), none of these studieshave monitored changes in microbial communitycomposition with priming effect changes. More-over, changes in soil microbial community com-position may alter litter-C ﬂow within the soilmicrobial community (Rubino and others 2010 ;Garcia-Pausas and Paterson 2011 ; Wang and others2014 ). Some recent studies have successfully traced13C-labeled substrates through soil microbial com-munities using13C-stable isotopic techniques, andimportant information on microbial utilization of agiven substrate has been obtained through GC-C-IRMS analyses of individual phospholipid fattyacids (PLFAs; Moore-Kucera and Dick 2008 ; Dun-gait and others 2011 ; Wang and others 2014 ).However, data on the effect of soil moisture on Cﬂow from13C-labeled substrates into soil microbialcommunity are unavailable.In the subtropical forest ecosystem of China,summer droughts have become more severe, andthe frequency of heavy rains has increased, therebyresulting in frequent changes in soil moisture. Inthe present paper, we report the responses of SOCmineralization in an incubation experiment as af-fected by soil moisture and the addition of Cun-ninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana litters.This study aims to illustrate how soil moisture af-fects the priming effect and litter-C ﬂow into thesoil microbial community in forest ecosystems. Ourinitial hypotheses are that the priming effect wouldincrease by increasing soil moisture and that therelative contribution of SOC- and litter-derived Cin CO2ﬂuxes depended on soil moisture. To sepa-rate litter from SOC mineralization, we used13C-labeled litter and monitored13C ﬂow through themain microbial groups. We believe that this study isthe ﬁrst to assess the inﬂuence of soil moisture onthe priming effect in forest ecosystems.MATERIALS AND METHODS13C-Labeled Leaf Litter and SoilSamplingIn South China, C. lanceolata and P. massoniana arethe main tree species used for timber production;these trees are cultivated over total areas ofapproximately 11.3 and 12.0 million ha, respec-tively. Therefore, litters from the two tree specieswere chosen for the incubation experiment. Thesite has a humid mid-subtropical monsoon climatewith a mean annual temperature of 16.5 /C176C andprecipitation of 1200 mm. The seedlings of C.lanceolata and P. massoniana were labeled with13CO 2gas in a growth chamber. After 3-monthlabeling, the isotopic d13C values of C. lanceolata andP. massoniana leaf litters were 996 and 1318 &,respectively. Other chemical properties of the C.lanceolata and P. massoniana leaf litters are shown inTable 1. The soil used in the present experimentwas collected from the 0–10 cm layer of a C. lance-olata forest located at the Huitong National Re-search Station of Forest Ecosystem (26 /C17650¢N,109/C17636¢E) in Huitong County, Hunan Province,South China. Fresh soil samples were transportedto the laboratory and immediately sieved(<2 mm). Visible organic residues were removedby hand picking. The soil was classiﬁed as ultisolaccording to the second edition of USDA soil Tax-onomy. The sand, silt, and clay contents of the soilSoil Moisture Alters the Response of SOC Mineralization to Litter Addition 451samples were 11.7, 44.7, and 43.6%, respectively.The total C and N contents of the soil were 26.7 and2.05 g kg-1, respectively. Soil pH was measured ata soil-to-H 2O ratio of 1:2.5 (w/v) using a pH meter.Incubation ExperimentApproximately, 8.5 kg of fresh soils collected waspreincubated for 5 days in a bucket containing abeaker with distilled H 2O to prevent desiccationand a beaker with 1 M NaOH solution to trap theevolved CO2. The experimental design included 27samples divided into 9 treatments with 3 truereplicates per treatment (Table 2). Nine soil sam-ples were amended with C. lanceolata (CL) leaf lit-ter, another nine soil samples were amended withP. massoniana (PM) leaf litter, and the remainingnine samples were used as control soils. The leaflitter was ground and then added as 5% of the SOC.The nine treatments included three soil mass watercontents, that is, 21% (L), 33% (M), and 45% (H)representing 44, 69, and 95% of the water-holdingcapacity of the soil.All soil samples were air-dried in the laboratory,and then wetted with distilled water to achieve L,M, and H soil moisture levels, respectively. Groundleaf litter was homogeneously incorporated withthe soil to produce a mixture. This mixture and avial containing 20 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solution wereplaced into 500-ml ﬂasks to create a microcosm.Microcosms were incubated in the dark for 45 daysat 25 /C176C. The CO2evolved from the soil was mea-sured on days 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 29, and 45 byalkali-trapping in the vials. After each sampling,the ﬂasks were ﬂushed with reconstituted humidand C-free air.At the end of each sampling interval above,10 ml of NaOH solution was used to determine theamount of CO2-C evolved from soil via titrationwith 0.1 M HCl. The CO 2evolved from the soilsample was calculated from the difference in thevalues of CO2evolved in the ﬂasks with soil andwithout soil. The remaining 10 ml of NaOH solu-tion was used to analyze the isotopic compositionof the trapped CO 2by a stable isotope-ratio massspectrometer (Picarro G2131-i Analyzer, USA) with0.2&analytical precision.Microbial Community CompositionSoil microbial community composition was deter-mined using PLFAs as biomarkers for differentmicrobial groups. Lipid extraction and PLFA anal-yses were performed as described by Wang andothers ( 2013a ). After incubation, part of the soilwas sampled and freeze-dried for PLFA analysis.Brieﬂy, 5 g of freeze-dried soil was extracted usingchloroform:methanol:phosphate buffer (1:2:0.8).The PLFAs extracted were puriﬁed on silica col-umns with chloroform, acetone, and methanol,amended with methyl-nonadecanoate as an inter-nal standard for quantiﬁcation, and converted tofatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by alkalinemethanolysis. The concentration and isotopiccomposition of individual FAME were analyzed bytandem gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(Thermo Fisher, USA). Qualitative standard mixes(37 Comp. FAME Mix and Bacterial Acid MethylEsters CP Mix, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to iden-tify the peaks. The total bacterial biomass was cal-culated by summing i15:0, a15:0, 15:0, i16:0,16:1x7c, 16:1 x9c, 16:0, a17:0, i17:0, cy17:0, 17:0,18:0, cy19:0, and 20:0 PLFAs (Hill and others2000 ). PLFAs i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0, and a17:0were used as markers for Gram-positive bacteria,whereas PLFAs 16:1 x7c, 16:1 x9c, cy17:0, andcy19:0 were used as markers for Gram-negativebacteria (Moore-Kucera and Dick 2008 ). PLFAs18:1x9c, 18:1 x9t, and 18:2 x9,12c were used asmarkers for fungi, and PLFAs 10Me16:0,Table 1.

Wang and others10Me17:0, and 10Me18:0 were used as markers ofactinomycetes (Hill and others 2000 ).Calculation and Statistical AnalysisA mass balance equation was used to calculatethe amount of CO 2-C derived from litter andSOC under incubation (Blagodatskaya and others2011 ):CL¼Ctðdt/C0dSÞ=ðdL/C0dSÞð 1ÞCS¼CtðdL/C0dtÞ=ðdL/C0dSÞ; ð2Þwhere C t(Ct=C L+C S) is the total amount of CO 2-C during the considered time interval, dtis thecorresponding isotopic composition, C Lis theamount of C derived from the added litter, dLis theisotopic composition of the litter, C Sis the amountof C derived from SOC, and dSis the isotopiccomposition of CO 2-C in the control (non-amen-ded soil) during incubation.The priming effect (PE, %) induced by the addedlitter was calculated by comparing the amount ofCO2-C in litter-containing soil samples with theamount of CO 2-C in the control soil sample:PE¼100/C2ðCO 2-Ctreatment /C0CO 2-CcontrolÞ=CO 2-Ccontrol ; ð3Þwhere C treatment is the accumulated amount of CO 2derived from SOC in treatments with litter additionand C control is the amount of CO 2derived from theSOC without litter addition under the correspond-ing soil moisture level.The percentage of plant-derived labeled C in eachPLFA was determined using a mass balance ap-proach (Rubino and others 2010 ):Pi¼ðd13Ct/C0d13CcÞ=ðd13Cl/C0d13CcÞ; ð4Þwhere d13Ctis the d13C enrichment ( &) of indi-vidual PLFA in the soils treated with litter at theend of incubation, and d13Ccis the d13C enrichment(&) of individual PLFA in the control soil, andd13Clis the d13C of labeled litter ( &). The total la-beled litter-derived C in each PLFA was calculatedby multiplying each Pi by the individual PLFAabundances.All statistical analyses were conducted usingSPSS version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chica-go, USA). Two-way analysis of variance followedby Tukey’s test was used to analyze the effects ofsoil moisture and litter addition on SOC mineral-ization and litter decomposition, primed C evolu-tion, soil microbial community composition, andpercentage distribution of13C among the mainindividual PLFAs. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcientswere calculated to quantify the relationship be-tween the cumulative primed C evolution and theSOC mineralization and microbial communitycomposition. Signiﬁcant differences were deter-mined at P<0.05.RESULTSSOC Mineralization and Priming EffectSOC mineralization in no-leaf litter addition treat-ments differed among soil moisture levels (Fig-ure1). SOC mineralization increased over 45 daysperiod according to the order: M >H>L, andranged from 192 to 241 mg C kg-1soil. Moreover,differences in the rate of SOC mineralizationamong treatments gradually diminished withincreasing incubation time.The temporal evolution of cumulative primed Cevolution after leaf litter addition is shown in Fig-ure2. A high rate of primed C evolution was re-corded during the ﬁrst 21 days. At the late stage(from 29 to 45 days) of incubation, decrease in thecumulative primed C evolution was observed insome treatments but not in the M + PM treatment,suggesting the negative priming effect occurred.After the addition of C. lanceolata leaf litter, thecumulative primed C evolution in the M-treatedsoil was 77.8 and 17.9% higher than those in the L-and H-treated soils, respectively. After the additionofP. massoniana leaf litter, the cumulative primed Cevolution in the M-treated soil was 139.6 and98.5% higher than those in the L- and H-treatedsoils, respectively.Soil moisture affected the priming effect of SOCmineralization (Figure 3). The highest priming ef-fect occurred in the M treatments, showing primingeffect induced by P. massoniana leaf litter addition,was higher than C. lanceolata leaf litter addition. Thepriming effect induced by C. lanceolata leaf litteraddition was 23.2, 32.9, and 30.2% in the L, M,and H soil treatments, respectively. P. massonianaleaf litter addition induced priming effect of 26.1,50.0, and 27.3% in the L, M, and H soil treatments,respectively.Leaf Litter DecompositionLeaf litter decomposition under different soilmoisture levels showed a similar pattern (Figure 4).The decomposition of leaf litters began soon afteraddition during the ﬁrst 21 days and then graduallyslowed down thereafter. Litter showed the highestdecomposition in the M soil moisture treatmentSoil Moisture Alters the Response of SOC Mineralization to Litter Addition 453and the lowest decomposition in the L soil moisturetreatment. C. lanceolata leaf litter decomposition didnot differ in the L and H soil moisture treatments,and P. massoniana leaf litter decomposition did notdiffer in the M and H soil moisture treatments.Considering the total litter decomposition observedduring the 45 days incubation period, the propor-tion of the decomposed litter to the added leaf litterranged from 19.7 to 32.8%.Relative contribution of SOC-derived CO2to to-tal CO 2ﬂuxes ranged from 54.8 to 64.0%, andcontribution of litter-derived CO 2varied from 36.0to 45.2% (Figure 5). SOC-derived C contributedmore to CO 2ﬂuxes than litter-derived C at thesame moisture level.

On average, C. lanceolata litter-derived CO 2showed higher contribution to CO 2ﬂuxes than P. massoniana litter.Soil Microbial Community Compositionand PLFA d13CWithout litter addition, the bacterial PLFA con-centration increased in the M treatment comparedwith that in the L treatment, thereby resulting in ahigher ratio of bacteria to fungi (Table 3). Theconcentrations of actinomycetes, Gram-negativebacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria were alsohigher in the M treatment than in other treat-ments. Microbial communities in the L treatmentwere distinguished from microbial communities inthe M and H treatments by higher abundances ofGram-positive bacteria (i15:0) and lower abun-dances of fungi 18:1 x9c and 18:2 x9,12c (Figure 6).The addition of leaf litters increased the microbialbiomass, but decreased the ratio of bacteria tofungi compared with the treatments without litteraddition at the corresponding soil moisture levels(Table 3). The addition of C. lanceolata leaf litter didnot alter the effect of soil moisture on soil microbialconcentration and community composition. Bycontrast, the addition of P. massoniana leaf litteraltered the effect of soil moisture on the concen-tration and community composition of somemicrobial groups. The concentration of total PLFAs,fungi, and Gram-negative bacteria increased in theL + PM treatment, and the ratio of Gram-positiveto Gram-negative bacteria decreased in theM + PM treatment.Approximately, 55% incorporation of litter-de-rived13C into 18:1 x9c and 16:0 PLFAs was ob-served. These percentages decreased according tothe order 18:2 x9,12c, i17:0, and cy19:0 PLFAs(Table 4). Incorporation of litter-derived13C intothe i15:0 and cy19:0 PLFAs was lower under the Lsoil moisture. Most of the new litter-derived C wasincorporated into non-speciﬁc bacteria and fungalPLFAs, accounting for over 72.3% of the total lit-ter-derived C incorporated into PLFAs. Under theM moisture treatment, incorporation of C. lanceolatalitter C into the total bacteria and Gram-negativebacteria was slightly higher than that of P. masso-niana litter C; incorporation into fungi showed theopposite trend. P. massoniana litter C incorporatedinto fungi was higher under the L moisture treat-ment than that under the M moisture treatment.The relationships between cumulative primed Cevolution and mineralized SOC and the ratio ofGram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria are illus-trated in Figure 7. Signiﬁcant correlations werefound between primed C evolution and mineral-ized SOC and between primed C evolution andratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria;by contrast, no relationship between primed Cevolution and concentrations of total PLFAs, bac-0 1 02 03 04 05 0050100150200250300Cumulative CO2 (mg C kg-1 soil) Incubation time (days) L+CL      M+CL      H+CL L+PM     M+PM     H+PMaabbccdFigure 4.

Our study on the effectsof soil moisture on the response of SOC mineral-ization to litter addition yielded some importantﬁndings in subtropical forest soils. First, the prim-ing effect of SOC mineralization was highest underthe medial soil moisture level, but the response ofpriming effect to soil moisture is strongly related tolitter species. Moreover, relative contribution ofSOC- and litter-derived C to CO2ﬂuxes depends onsoil moisture conditions. Second, the response ofthe soil microbial community to soil moisture isaffected by litter addition. Finally, bacterial com-munity shifts are partly responsible for the differ-ences in soil moisture inﬂuence on the primingeffect. Although some important ﬁndings wereyielded in our experiment, caution should beexercised when our results are applied to what willhappen to priming effects, losses of SOC, and dif-ferential incorporation of litter and SOC into dif-ferent microbial groups in the ﬁeld in response toglobal climate changes. In our experiment, groundleaf litter was used to add into the soil rather thanintact litter. The time course of decomposition ofground litter incorporated into soil will also differfrom intact litter on the soil surface. The basicprinciples derived from our results, however, canbe used to interpret patterns in the ﬁeld, and it isalso quite possible that these results would applymore directly to the effects of moisture interactingwith leaf litter decomposition in the ﬁeld.Without addition of leaf litter, increased CO2production occurred in the M treatment, whichsuggests that native SOC mineralization is con-trolled by soil moisture. Several studies alsodemonstrate that soil respiration increases with soilmoisture (Saiz and others 2007 ; Borken andMatzner 2009 ; Abera and others 2012 ). Findings inforest soils are inconsistent with the observations ofDijkstra and Cheng ( 2007 ) and Geisseler and others(2011 ) in arable soils. The different responses ofSOC mineralization to changes in soil moisturemay be attributed to differences in soil texture andmoisture levels between experiments.Table 3.

Wang and othersSoil moisture is a driver of soil microbial activity,and microbes are generally believed to be the keyfactors affecting SOC mineralization in manyecosystems (Liu and others 2009 ; Moyano andothers 2013 ). Higher primed C evolution in the Mtreatment compared with that in the L treatmentwas attributed to increases in labile C and nutrientﬂux, which could further stimulate microbialgrowth and activities (Schimel and others 2007 ;Iovieno and Baath 2008 ; Butterly and others 2009 ).This ﬁnding is supported by our data of soilmicrobial biomass (Table 3).

Relative abundances of individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in control soils (without leaf litter addition)under different soil moisture levels ( Llow, Mmedial, Hhigh). The vertical bars are standard deviations.Soil Moisture Alters the Response of SOC Mineralization to Litter Addition 457(2002 ) and Iovieno and Baath ( 2008 ) determinedthat increases in C mineralization associated withchanges in soil moisture occurred over relativelyshort periods of time (5–7 days). We also deter-mined that differences in the rate of SOC miner-alization between treatments gradually diminishedwith time, which suggests that the initial ﬂush oflabile C and nutrients had been consumed. Al-though we did not measure levels of the oxygendiffusion, we postulate that lower SOC mineral-ization in the H treatment compared with that inthe M treatment is due to oxygen deﬁciency in thesoil, which inhibits microbial activity and decom-position (Liu and others 2009 ; Geisseler and others2011 ). In future research, we will determine soilpore size distributions, water potentials, and oxy-gen diffusion to explain further how soil moistureaffects SOC mineralization.Litter species affected the priming effect of SOCmineralization. At the same soil moisture level,differences in the priming effect induced by C.lanceolata and P. massoniana leaf litter addition werein accordance with observations from previousworks (Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov 2008 ; Pot-thast and others 2010 ; Wang and others 2013b ),indicating that the quality of the substrate added tosoils affects the magnitude of the priming effect. Ina previous study, Wang and others ( 2014 ) foundthat the leaf litter with higher C:P ratios promotedgreater SOC mineralization. In the present study, C.lanceolata leaf litter which features a higher C:Pratio (425) tended to cause higher priming effectsthan P. massoniana leaf litter with a lower C:P ratio(316) under the H soil moisture levels, but C.lanceolata litter caused lower priming effects than P.massoniana leaf litter under the L and M soil mois-ture levels. We postulate that in this experiment,the functions of other elements in controllingpriming effect may be more important than that ofthe C:P ratio.Contrary to our hypothesis, the priming effectwas relatively more extensive in the M treatmentthan in other treatments. This ﬁnding does notagree with previous observation in agricultural soils(Dijkstra and Cheng 2007 ). Dijkstra and Cheng(2007 ) found that priming effects in the soils with85% of water-holding capacity were higher thanthose in soils with 45% of water-holding capacity.The authors thus believed that the effect of soilmoisture on the priming effect depends on the soiltypes. In the present study, the soil was clay loamwith 43.6% clay, by contrast, the soil used byDijkstra and Cheng ( 2007 ) was sandy loam.Moreover, the highest soil moisture (95% water-holding capacity) in our study was greater thanthat in the study of Dijkstra and Cheng ( 2007 ).Thus, we assume that differences in soil texture andmoisture levels are responsible for distinct re-sponses of priming effect to soil moisture. SOCmineralization with increasing soil moisture fol-lowed a uniform pattern after the addition of C.lanceolata and P. massoniana but the magnitude ofthe priming effect differed. This result suggests thatthe soil moisture dependency of the priming effectis affected by the litter species, as noted in otherstudies on agricultural soils (Geisseler and others2011 ; Abera and others 2012 ). Differences in sub-stance quality may be a possible mechanism foreffect of litter species on the response of primingeffect to soil moisture. In the present study, the twotypes of leaf litter had different initial P concen-tration and C:P. Li and others ( 2002 ) reported thatsoils from C. lanceolata forests had greater phenolicand lignin contents than soils from P. massonianaforests, but we did not determine these contents inthe present study. Thus, our further work couldinclude investigation of the interactive effect of soilmoisture and litter quality on the priming effect.Soil microbes can utilize leaf litter added to soil asenergy and C sources to decompose native SOC.Soil moisture showed minimal effects on the dis-tribution of13C in soil microbial groups for thesame litter species, although13C incorporationshowed signiﬁcant differences in some individual250 300 350 400 450020406080100120140Primed C (mg C kg-1 soil)Soil mineralized C (mg C kg-1 soil)r = 0.847*1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8020406080100120140Primed C (mg C kg-1 soil)G+:G- ratior = 0.785*Figure 7.

Wang and othersPLFAs (for example, i15:0, i17:0, cy19:0). The in-crease in soil microbial activity only lasted for rel-atively short time periods because of depletion ofinitial ﬂush of labile C and nutrients associatedwith changes in soil moisture (Iovieno and Baath2008 ). This resulted in no detectable effect of soilmoisture on the distribution of13C in soil microbialgroups. Therefore, the number of sampling timesshould be increased during the early incubation toqualify the dynamic activity and composition of soilmicrobial communities in future research. The13Cincorporated into Gram-positive bacteria was twiceas much as that incorporated into Gram-negativebacteria likely because of the larger concentrationof Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negativebacteria in the samples. Some studies also deter-mined that incorporation of13C derived fromexudates and glucose into Gram-positive bacteriawas higher than that into Gram-negative bacteria(Rubino and others 2010 ; Dungait and others2011 ). This ﬁnding suggests that the function ofGram-positive bacteria in decomposing litter isgreater than that of Gram-negative bacteria.In conclusion, greater SOC mineralization wasobserved in the M treatment (69% water-holdingcapacity) when no litter was added, which suggeststhat soil water availability is vital to SOC mineral-ization in acid soils from subtropical forests. How-ever, we also note that increases in soil moisturemay result in oxygen deﬁciency, which can inhibitmicrobial activity and SOC mineralization becausethe soil is clay loam with high clay content (Saizand others 2007 ; Liptzin and others 2011 ). There-fore, SOC mineralization may decrease when soilmoisture reaches full water-holding capacity.Priming effects were affected by changes in soilmoisture, and higher priming effects were observedin the M-treated soils. Litter species affected theresponse of priming effects to changes in soilmoisture, which indicates that soil moisture pre-sents different effects on CO2emissions. Distinctcontribution of SOC-derived C to total CO 2ﬂuxesunder different moisture levels suggested that rel-ative contribution of SOC- and litter-derived C toCO2ﬂuxes was dependent on soil moisture condi-tions. Higher amounts of fresh litter C were incor-porated into the 16:0 and 18:1 x9c PLFAs, whichsuggests that these two microorganisms performsigniﬁcant functions in degrading added litter. Fu-ture work could focus on investigating bacterialand fungal communities by next generationpyrosequencing and DNA-based stable isotopeprobing to elucidate the importance of the soilmicrobial community to the soil C cycle further.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by the Strategic PriorityResearch Program of the Chinese Academy of Sci-ences (Grant No. XDB15010301), the State KeyLaboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology (Grant Nos.LFSE2015-17 and LFSE2013-13), and the NationalNatural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.31570466).
