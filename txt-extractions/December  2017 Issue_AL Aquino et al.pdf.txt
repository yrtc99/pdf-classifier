The intensity and frequency of typhoons, drought and flooding increased due to the change in climate and these have a negative impact on crop productivity and food security. Alternative farming practices that can potentially reduce CO 2 emission and optimize the efficiency of plant and soil carbon sequestration is therefore necessary. Thus, this experiment was conducted to determine and compare the potential contribution of organic and conventional corn production systems on carbon sequestration based on plant biomass and soil organic carbon                  accumulation. The field experiment was conducted at the Central Experiment Station, Pili Drive, UP Los Baños, College Laguna from June to September 2012 for the wet season experiment, and from February to May 2013 for the dry season experiment. Four fertilizer treatments and two corn cultivars served as mainplot and subplot, respectively, and were laid out in split -plot in RCBD with three replications. The cultivars evaluated were USM Var 10, a high yielding open -pollinated variety and Crystal, a farmer -selected open -pollinated cultivar. Fertilizer treatments were control, inorganic fertilizer (138 kg N from urea), and organic fertilizer in the form of        vermicompost. The rate of vermicompost used during the wet season was 8 t ha-1 while during the dry season 8 and 10 t ha-1 was used. Data on root and shoot biomass and organic carbon content, soil organic carbon, and bulk density were monitored at 30 and 60 days after sowing during the wet season and until 90 days after sowing during the dry season. Plant carbon (C) sequestration was calculated based on root and shoot biomass and on the carbon content of the plant tissues. Soil C sequestration was calculated based on soil organic carbon content, soil depth and bulk density. For both wet and dry season experiments, the use of inorganic fertilizer contributed to highest total plant C sequestration. Between the two cultivars, USM Var 10, a high yielding open -pollinated variety, contributed more to C sequestration. Soil C sequestration was likewise highest using inorganic fertilizer, but values did not differ during the wet and dry         season. The total carbon sequestration using inorganic fertilizer was undeniably much greater than using vermicompost. However, considering the adverse environmental impacts of                 inorganic fertilizer, (i.e. CO2 emission during its manufacture, transport, and use; deterioration of soil and water quality; and impact on human) this may reduce its C sequestration potential.

On a global scale, a GHG emission from agricultural land use is estimated at 10-12% or 5.1 -6.1 Gt of the total anthropogenic annual emissions of CO 2-equivalents (IPCC 2007). CO2 released from agriculture comes largely from   microbial decay and burning of plant residues (Janzen 2004). The current farming practices that are highly dependent on external chemical inputs, such as            fertilizers and pesticides, also contribute to increased carbon emissions through their manufacture. The      production of mineral fertilizers contributes 1% to the global anthropogenic (man -made) GHG emission (Williams 2006). The use of these chemical inputs also depletes soil organic matter thereby releasing CO2 into the atmosphere (Pretty and Ball 2001).    The challenge therefore, is adopting farming practices that can help reduce GHG emission in the                 Full Paper  INTRODUCTION   Global warming brought about by increasing               concentration of green house gases (GHG) in the atmosphere is a major concern due to its impact on climate change. Among the GHGs, carbon dioxide accounts for 72% of the total GHG emission making it the most important cause of global warming. From the current concentration of 387 ppm, it is increasing at the rate of 1.5 ppm a-1 (Wang et al. 2010), which led to a substantial increase in global surface tempera-ture and altered the distribution of precipitation and increased the frequency of natural disasters (Lal 2007).   The atmospheric concentration of CO 2 and other GHG such as nitrous oxide (N 2O) and methane (CH4) increased drastically since the industrial revolution (Wang et al. 2010). Agriculture is reported to release significant amounts of CO 2, CH4 and N 2O to the       AL Aquino et al.    atmosphere, optimize the efficiency of carbon               sequestration, and maintain the same level of crop productivity. Organic farming is increasingly being   recognized as having the greatest potential to address all these issues. Recent studies reported on the      contribution of organic agriculture in increasing carbon sequestration and reducing CO 2 emission and in    maintaining or increasing yield. Organic rice fields in Indonesia showed a 30% higher soil carbon storage (25.0 Mg ha-1) over that of conventional field (17.6 Mg ha-1) (Komatsuzaki and Syuaib 2010). In soybean, an increased total organic carbon was observed with the application of organic amendments compared to          inorganic fertilizer (Gilani and Bahmanyar 2008).            Enhanced soil organic carbon pool was also observed with the use of organic manures and compost more than the application of the same amount of inorganic fertilizer (Gregorich et al. 2001). In the Rodale Farming Systems Trial in the mid -Atlantic region of the          continental USA, manure -based organic system          sequestered 1218 kg C ha-1 a-1 while legume -based organic system sequestered 857 kg, and the                    conventional system sequestered 217 kg (Pimentel et al. 2005). It was estimated that the global average  sequestration potential of organic croplands is            between 0.9 -2.4 Gt CO 2 a-1 (Niggli et al. 2009). This is equivalent to an average sequestration potential of about 200 -400 kg C ha-1 a-1 for all croplands.   To meet the increasing demand for corn, both for food and for industrial use, the volume and area of                    production will also increase as more farmers engage or shift to corn farming. Increasing the volume and area of corn production could potentially increase CO 2 sequestration thru biomass production and conversion of sequestered carbon into more stable soil organic matter. During photosynthesis, carbon from                 atmospheric CO 2 is transformed into components  necessary for plants to live and grow. Once the plant dies, it decomposes and some of the carbon is                    released into the atmosphere but some are captured within the soil and increases the soil organic matter (TEEIC 2012).   However, corn production relies mainly on inorganic fertilizer and chemical pest control to increase yield and food supply, practices that contribute to green house gas emission. Information on carbon                sequestration in organic corn production under               Philippine condition is very limited which makes it more difficult to promote and convince farmers to shift to organic farming as a way to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Thus, this experiment aimed to            determine the carbon sequestration capacity of high yielding and farmer -grown open pollinated corn                cultivars and to compare the potential contribution of organic and conventional corn production systems on CO2 sequestration based on plant biomass production and soil organic carbon accumulation. During the        experiment, plants were inadvertently subjected to abnormal growing conditions either due to excessive or insufficient rainfall. The occurrence of successive typhoons and monsoon rains during the months of July-October 2012 caused flooding and waterlogged condition in the experimental area which coincided with the vegetative stage of the plants. On the other hand, plants were subjected to drought during the months of February -May 2013 because of very little rain and relatively higher temperature during this         period. Due to the prolonged waterlog and drought conditions biomass production and consequently           carbon sequestration was severely affected.   MATERIALS AND METHODS   Time and Place of the Study  The field experiment was conducted at the Central Experiment Station (CES), Pili Drive, UP Los Baños (UPLB), College Laguna, Philippines, from June to September 2012 for the wet season experiment, and from February to May 2013 for the dry season              experiment. The laboratory analysis for total carbon content of plant tissues was done at the Analytical Services Laboratory of the Institute of Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture and Food Science (CAFS), UPLB. The soil organic carbon content was analyzed at the Soil Testing Laboratory, Agricultural Systems Institute, CAFS, UPLB.   Experimental Design, Treatment and Crop               Establishment  The experimental factors were two corn varieties and three fertilizer treatments. The corn varieties included a white local farmer -grown variety ‘Crystal’, obtained from Cagayan Valley, and USM Var 10, a high yielding open pollinated variety. The fertilizer treatments were the following: control (zero fertilizer), vermicompost, and inorganic fertilizer. During the wet season               experiment, the vermicompost treatment was only 8 t ha-1. But during the dry season, 8 and 10 t ha-1 of              vermicompost rates were evaluated. The factors were arranged in split -plot in RCBD with 3 replications.              Fertilizer treatment served as mainplot and corn             cultivar as subplot. Each subplot had an area of 30 m2. Each block was separated by a 1.5 m alley, while mainplots were spaced 1 m apart.   The recommended rate of inorganic fertilizer, based on the results of the soil analysis, was 6 bags of Urea ha-1, equivalent to 135 kg of nitrogen (N). Results of the soil analysis showed sufficient amount of               phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) such that the          fertilizer recommendation was only for N (135 -0-0 kg NPK ha-1). The vermicompost used contains 1.66% N, so the amount of N applied for the 8 t ha-1 rate was equivalent to the recommended rate for inorganic           fertilizer while that of 10 t ha-1 was equivalent to 166 kg of N. All of the recommended amount of                vermicompost was applied at planting. For the         inorganic fertilizer (Urea), half of the recommendation was applied basally and the other half applied as side dress at 25 d after sowing (DAS). The vermicompost was applied along the furrows, before the seeds are sown. The inorganic fertilizer were also applied along the furrows but was first covered with a thin layer of soil before seeds were sown. This was done to avoid direct contact between the fertilizer and the seeds thereby preventing possible damage on the seeds.  AL Aquino et al.  12   Corn seeds were sown at a distance of 20 cm         between hills and 0.75 m between rows at 3 seeds per hill. The experimental plots were irrigated the day after sowing to moisten the soil and initiate seed                     germination. Seedlings were thinned to two per hill         2 wk after germination. Missing hills were replanted            1 wk after germination.   Insect pests in the conventional plots were managed following the recommended crop protection practices while that of the organic plots were managed using alternative crop protection practices.  Pest control was done when the need arises. Weed management in both conventional and organic plots was done               manually and only when the need arises.   During the dry season experiment, furrow irrigation was done almost every wk after seedling emergence until at least a wk before harvesting. However, there were times that irrigation was delayed due to                  inadequate water supply or unavailability of irrigation pipes.  Data gathered  The shoot and root biomass were monitored starting at 30 d after sowing (DAS) and every 15 d thereafter, while bulk density and soil organic carbon were            monitored at 30, 60 and 90 DAS. However, during the wet season, the shoot and root biomass were              monitored up to 60 DAS only since plants did not              survive the waterlogged condition beyond 60 DAS.   Shoot and root biomass  Five randomly selected plants from each treatment plots were carefully dug to collect as much of the roots as possible. The roots and shoots of individual plant samples were then separated and oven -dried at 70 °C for 72 h or until a constant dry weight was attained. Samples that were very wet were air -dried first before oven drying. When constant dry weight was attained, the root and shoot samples were weighed separately. The dried tissues were analyzed for percent organic carbon content of the roots and the shoots. The root and shoot biomass per ha were computed and was used as the basis for determining the above and below ground carbon sequestration.   Carbon sequestration potential  Above and below ground carbon sequestration             potential of corn was determined by separately                  analyzing the carbon content of shoot and root tissues. Soil carbon sequestration was determined from soil samples taken from each of the treatment plots.    Plant carbon sequestration (Mg ha-1). A 10-g          composite sample of dried shoots and roots from each of the treatment combination was brought to the          Analytical Services Laboratory of the Institute of Plant Breeding, UPLB, for the analysis of total carbon           content. The total carbon sequestered was calculated using the formula:   CS Plant = [(SDM)(SCC)] + [(RDM)(RCC)]   Where: CSPlant= Plant Carbon Sequestration  SDM= Shoot dry matter, t ha-1 SCC= Shoot carbon content,  (amount in percent/100)  RDM = Root dry matter, t ha-1 RCC = Root carbon content,    (amount in percent/100)   Soil organic carbon sequestration  (Mg ha-1). Soil samples within the 0 -25 cm depth were collected from each plot using an auger and analyzed for organic carbon content following the Walkley -Black Procedure. Bulk density was also determined by taking soil           samples from each of the plot using a core sampler. Soil plus the core sampler weight was recorded before drying the samples overnight at 105 C. Soil plus core sample weight was recorded after oven drying for the calculation of bulk density. Soil organic carbon storage was calculated based on the formula of Komatsuzaki and Syuaib (2010):   SCS  = BD × SOC ×DP   where: SCS = Soil organic carbon storage (Mg ha-1) BD = Bulk density (g cm-3) SOC = Soil organic carbon content (%)  DP = Soil depth (cm)   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Wet Season Experiment   Plant Carbon Sequestration  Root, shoot and total plant carbon sequestrations at 30 and 60 DAS were significantly highest in plants grown under inorganic fertilizer treatment. USM Var 10 also consistently showed significantly higher shoot and total plant carbon sequestration than Crystal (Table 1). The greater carbon sequestration of plants grown with   inorganic fertilizer can be attributed to better crop growth and higher biomass production (Table 2). Due to the bigger leaf area of plants grown with inorganic fertilizer, photosynthetic rate was higher resulting to greater net assimilation rate and consequently greater biomass production. At 30 DAS, despite the greater shoot biomass compared to the root biomass, the amount of carbon sequestered in the roots is almost the same as the amount sequestered in the shoots. This is attributed to the higher organic carbon content in the roots than in the shoots (Table 3). This response is typical in most cereal grains where carbon allocation to the roots is highest during the early growth stages and declines at flowering (Crawford et al. 2000; Hulugalle et al. 2009). Later, when the roots are fully established, most of the carbon is then allocated to the shoots for the grain yield, hence, at 60 DAS carbon sequestration in the shoot increased tremendously.   The amount of carbon sequestered by the plants         regardless of the fertilizer treatment were quite low compared to the amount reported in the literatures ranging 200 -1200 kg C a-1 (Pimentel et al . 2005). The 13 Contribution of organic corn production to CO 2 sequestration    wet season experiment was characterized by             excessive rainfall due to the occurrence of typhoons and monsoon rains. The continuous downpour and high volume of rainfall saturated the soil in the                experimental area until it became flooded and                waterlogged. This growing condition resulted to poor plant growth and therefore low dry matter production and consequently low plant carbon sequestration.   Among the fertilizer treatments, plant growth was best under inorganic fertilizer resulting to the highest amount of plant carbon sequestered.  The enhanced plant growth under inorganic fertilizer treatment                 implies that both cultivars are more adapted to this kind of fertilizer. This response could be the result of years of cultivation under conventional production   system. The potential carbon sequestration of the corn cultivars, therefore, depends to a greater extent on improved plant growth. Since inorganic fertilizer       improved plant growth better than vermicompost, plant carbon sequestration in this fertilizer treatment was highest. However, the manufacture of inorganic             fertilizer alone contributes to CO 2 emission (Williams 2006). For urea, producing 1 kg of the product               releases 0.91 kg CO 2-eq (Bentrup and Pallière 2014). Thus, carbon sequestered through improved plant growth may be reduced by the CO 2 emitted not only during its manufacture but also during its transport. On the other hand, CO 2 emissions from vermicompost can not be quantified. According to Sánchez et al. (2015) the CO 2 emissions from composting facilities are considered biogenic CO 2 emissions so the global warming potential of these emissions are not taken into account because they are considered carbon   neutral.    Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration  Inorganic fertilizer showed the highest SOC                sequestration 30 and 60 DAS (Table 4). This is             contrary to the report that soil carbon sequestration is higher with organic fertilizer application than inorganic amendment (Komatsuzaki and Syuaib 2010;                 Gregorich et al. 2001). The higher SOC in inorganic fertilizer may be attributed to better plant growth,         resulting to higher root biomass production and          enhanced SOC (Follet 2001).   Carbon sequestration for all fertilizer treatments           declined at 60 DAS (Table 4). During this time,                photosynthesis was already severely affected due to waterlogging. This caused a decrease in root biomass production and a decrease in carbon input from the roots, hence the decline in SOC. Another possible  reason for this occurrence is that dissolved organic carbon may have been carried into the deeper soil horizon by water moving downwards (Steinbeiss et al. 2007). The transport of dissolved organic carbon into the deeper soil horizon may also explain the low SOC of vermicompost.  Table 1.

But                     vermicompost showed the lowest value at both growth stages and also exhibited the highest decline at 60 DAS (Table 4).  A low bulk density indicates that soil is porous and therefore the movement of air, water and solutes through the soil horizon is not restricted. Since water infiltration is not restricted, organic carbon may be carried along with the water into the lower soil        horizon, hence reducing SOC at the upper 0 -25 cm horizon. The result suggests that the application of vermicompost improves soil structure, which will be beneficial in the long run because this will influence better organic matter accumulation and consequently higher SOC (FAO 2005).   Dry Season Experiment   Plant Carbon Sequestration  During the dry season, inorganic fertilizer consistently produced the highest root, shoot and total plant          carbon sequestration in all the monitoring periods. At 60 DAS, there was a significant increase in total plant carbon sequestration for all fertilizer treatments due to the considerable increase in shoot carbon                    sequestration (Table 5). Results of tissue analysis showed almost the same carbon content for roots and shoots which confirms the role of shoot in carbon         sequestration (Table 6). These results imply that shoot biomass contributes significantly to plant carbon          sequestration. Total plant carbon sequestration              remained high at 90 DAS but the increment from 60 DAS was small compared to the increment from 30 -60 DAS.   The high carbon sequestration of plants in inorganic fertilizer was due to greater biomass production    (Table 7). This also means that among the fertilizer treatments, inorganic fertilizer contributed more to  carbon sequestration by promoting better plant growth and development. This was evident in the amount of carbon sequestered, which was twice or more than the amount sequestered by plants applied with                       vermicompost. However, considering the CO 2           emission during the production of urea, which is about 0.91 kg CO 2-eq kg-1 of urea or 2 kg CO 2-eq kg-1 of N from urea (Bentrup and Pallière 2014), this may             reduce the overall contribution of urea to total plant carbon sequestration by about 273 kg CO 2-eq ha-1. This emission does not even include transport and emissions due to ammonia and nitrate.   Between the two rates of vermicompost, applying              8 t ha-1 contributed more to plant carbon sequestration due to the higher biomass production. Increasing the rate to 10 t ha-1 failed to increase biomass production, hence the lower plant carbon sequestration. Mineral fertilizer are readily available for plant uptake so the effect on plant growth and biomass production is         immediate. In contrast, vermicompost must first               undergo mineralization before the nutrients becomes available for plant uptake. Moreover, nutrient release from composts in general is gradual. Due to this       nature of organic amendment, plant growth is slower and as a result biomass production is also lower.   Between the two cultivars, USM Var 10 contributed more to plant carbon sequestration compared to               Crystal (Table 5).

The growth and dry matter production of USM Var 10 with inorganic fertilization was remarkably better than Crystal, thus resulting to considerably higher root, shoot and total plant C           sequestration. Unlike Crystal, USM Var 10 is a high yielding variety developed for inorganic farming.   The amount of carbon sequestered in all fertilizer treatments represent the amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere if the stover is not incorporated or plowed back into the soil after each cropping.                Improving crop growth and biomass production through increased photosynthesis will increase CO 2 sequestration, which in turn will contribute to reducing atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Despite the low               nutrient content of vermicompost and smaller             contribution to plant carbon sequestration, it can still contribute to minimizing CO 2 since its use as organic amendment causes carbon to stay bound to soil (Sánchez et al. 2015). Moreover, unlike mineral           fertilizers that are imported, vermicomposts are            produced locally, hence CO 2 emission due to long   distance transport is also minimized.   Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration  The soil organic carbon (SOC) for all fertilizer        treatments increased from 30 to 90 DAS periods but the differences were not significant (Table 8). Plants were exposed to moisture deficit throughout most of their life cycle because of very little rain and             insufficient irrigation water, resulting to low root           biomass production. Decomposing roots and plant litter contribute to SOC concentration (Bot and Benites 2005). If root biomass production is low, and root             turnover is low due to inefficient root decomposition, this will contribute little to SOC concentration.   Adequate moisture is essential for efficient root           decomposition (Bot and Benites 2005). Due to the moisture deficit during the experiment, root               decomposition would be slower. Moreover, roots           degrade or decompose longer and therefore gradually transform to soil organic carbon (Rasse et al. 2005). A similar study reported no differences in SOC             concentrations across N application of 0, 67, 135, 202 and 269 kg N ha-1 y-1, suggesting that either crop           residue inputs and C mineralization effect of N              fertilization were equivalent or that soils were C         saturated (Brown 2013).   Bulk density (BD) values were similar regardless of the fertilizer treatment, although relatively lower values were observed under vermicompost treatment (Table 8).   The ideal BD of <1.10 g cm-3 was observed in all           fertilizer treatment but only up to 60 DAS. Towards the end of the crop cycle, BD values increased beyond the ideal level.   A high BD indicates that the soil is compact and has low porosity and may cause restrictions to root growth resulting to poor plant growth. Restricted root growth can lead to low root biomass production. With low root biomass production and inadequate moisture to              hasten root decomposition, very little carbon will  be added to the soil. These conditions could have             contributed to the lack of significant differences in soil organic carbon sequestration among the fertilizer treatments and between cultivars.

CONCLUSION   High-yielding corn cultivars such as the USM Var 10 contributed more to plant C sequestration due to their inherent higher biomass production. The application of inorganic fertilizer further increased the plant carbon sequestration of this cultivar promoting plant growth and consequently biomass production. Although the growth of Crystal was also promoted with the applica-tion of inorganic fertilizer, its response was not as  substantial as USM Var 10, thus its capacity for          carbon sequestration was lower. The combined car-bon sequestration from plant biomass production and soil carbon accumulation with inorganic fertilizer             application was 1,904 Mg CO 2-eq ha-1 while that of vermicompost contributed to carbon sequestration of 935 to 1040 Mg CO 2-eq ha-1.  The total carbon sequestration using inorganic                fertilizer was undeniably much greater than using      vermicompost. However, considering the various e nvironmental impacts of inorganic fertilizer, i.e., CO 2 emission during its manufacture, transport, and use; deterioration of soil and water quality; and impact on human health, this reduces its potential capacity to sequester carbon. Vermicompost can be a suitable alternative for its indirect positive effect on carbon  sequestration. It improves soil health and causes           carbon to stay bound to the soil  thereby improving soil structure and promoting better root growth. In the long run, the continuous improvement in soil quality due to organic amendment may be translated to improved crop growth and biomass production, which in turn will             contribute to greater carbon sequestration.
