Optimizing Inorganic CarbonSequestration and Crop Yield WithWollastonite Soil Amendment in aMicroplot StudyFatima Haque, Rafael M. Santos and Yi Wai Chiang *School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, CanadaCarbon dioxide (CO 2) is a major greenhouse gas, and its concentration in the atmosphereis increasing continuously, hence there is an urgent need to reduce its level in theatmosphere. Soils offer a la rge natural sink to store CO2.T h i ss t u d yf o c u s e so nsequestering CO 2in the agricultural soils as inorganic carbon, which can beaccomplished by adding alkaline-earth silicates. Wollastonite is used in this study as asoil amendment, to sequester CO2viathe geochemical route of mineral carbonation. Theﬁrst objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of mixing a wide range ofdosages of wollastonite, as a soil amendment, on the growth performance of twoleguminous plants frequently used in agricultural sector: soybean and alfalfa. The plantswere grown with different wollastonite dosages (3 –20 kg·m−2for soybean and 3 –40kg·m−2for alfalfa), for a duration of 14 weeks in a microplot experiment in Ontario, Canada.The second objective was to ﬁnd evidence of enhanced weathering of wollastonite in soil,in addition to the augmentation of inorganic carbon content in soil. For this, mineralogicalassessment of the soils was performed using XRD and SEM-EDS analyses. Wollastoniteincreased the soybean yield by two-fold in the plot amended with 10 kg·m−2. At alldosages, wollastonite increased the alfalfa growth in terms of height and above-groundbiomass dry weight, as well as root biomass. The rate of CO 2sequestration, at optimumwollastonite dosage, reached 0.08 kg CO 2·m−2·month−1. XRD and SEM-EDS analysesindicated accumulation of calcite in wollastonite-amended soil and formation of otherweathering products. The results obtained from this study help to understand the impactof wollastonite soil amendment on agronomy, and will aid in implementing such negativeemissions technology by informing farmers and industry alike that the use of wollastonitecontributes toward global climate change mitigation while supporting crop yield. Theﬁndings of this study add to the existing body of knowledge on enhanced weathering asan atmospheric CO2removal technology, providing further evidence that wollastoniteweathering in agricultural soils can lead to signi ﬁcant capacity for CO 2sequestration asinorganic carbon, while concurrently promoting plant growth.Keywords: enhanced weathering, soil amendment, ﬁeld crops, plant growth, CO 2sequestration, inorganic carbonatesFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1012 1Edited by:David Manning,Newcastle University, United KingdomReviewed by:Corina Carranca,Instituto Nacional Investigaciao Agrariae Veterinaria (INIAV), PortugalFrancesco Marinello,University of Padova, Italy*Correspondence:Yi Wai Chiangchiange@uoguelph.caSpecialty section:This article was submitted toPlant Nutrition,a section of the journalFrontiers in Plant ScienceReceived: 23 March 2020Accepted: 22 June 2020Published: 03 July 2020Citation:Haque F, Santos RM and Chiang YW(2020) Optimizing Inorganic CarbonSequestration and Crop Yield WithWollastonite Soil Amendment in aMicroplot Study.Front. Plant Sci. 11:1012.doi: 10.3389/fpls.2020.01012ORIGINAL RESEARCHpublished: 03 July 2020doi: 10.3389/fpls.2020.01012INTRODUCTIONAgriculture can contribute to greenhouse gas mitigation, either viaphotosynthesis and the organic carbon cycle, or viaterrestrialenhanced weathering of alkaline-earth silicates, also known asmineral carbonation ( Hartmann et al., 2013 ;Zomer et al., 2017 ).While photosynthesis contributes towards increasing carbonstorage in biomass and soil organic matter, terrestrial enhancedweathering of calcium and magnesium silicate rocks and thesubsequent precipitation of calcium or magnesium carbonates inthe soil can additionally lead to augmentation of inorganic carboncontent of soils and the underlying formations ( Moosdorf et al.,2014 ;Machmuller et al., 2015 ). Several independent researchgroups have recently reported on the increased inorganic carboncontent of soils amended with alkaline-earth minerals ( Renforthet al., 2009 ;Renforth et al., 2011 ;Manning et al., 2013 ;Washbourne et al., 2015 ;Amann et al., 2020 ). Hence, usingalkaline-earth mineral soil amendments to grow plants has thepotential to mitigate atmospheric CO2.The addition of certain alkaline-earth minerals to land hasbeen shown to enhance soil quality and plant productivity,especially in nutrient poor and highly weathered acidic soil(Jones and Handreck, 1965 ;Mitani and Ma, 2005 ;Silva et al.,2005 ;Keller et al., 2012 ;Haynes, 2014 ;Meena et al., 2014 ). Usingalkaline-earth minerals as a soil amendment not only contributestowards soil inorganic carbon accumulation (and thus CO2sequestration), but also amends soil chemical propertiespotentially resulting in improved soil fertility. Someagricultural soils are characterized by low available calcium(Ca) and high available aluminum (Al) content; as a result,plant root growth will be impaired, and water and nutrientsuptake by plants will be affected ( Haque et al., 2019a ).VanStraaten (2006) has evaluated the effect of multi-nutrient silicaterock fertilizers on the movement of nutrient around the rootsurface as well as the biochemical processes, ﬁnding that it hasthe potential to supply the soils with macronutrients (N, P, K)and micronutrients (especially Ca and Mg).Wollastonite (nominally CaSiO3, but also found in associationwith other minerals, such as diopside (CaMgSi 2O6)) is a Ca-richmineral. Wollastonite, as with other alkaline-earth silicates,undergoes mineral carbonation reaction when in an aqueousenvironment saturated with CO2, though the rate of reaction(both silicate dissolution and carbonate precipitation) variesdepending on geochemical conditions, such as the CO 2partialpressure and the pH ( Lackner, 2003 ;Huijgen et al., 2006 ;Manningand Renforth, 2013 ). Equations (1) –(3) show how carbonsequestration viawollastonite weathering occurs ( Hangx andSpiers, 2009 ).CO 2 dissolution :  2CO 2(g)+2 H 2O(1)↔2H2CO 3(aq)↔2HCO 3−+2 H+(1)Wollastonite  dissolution :  CaSiO 3(S)+2 H+!Ca2++H 2O(1)+S i O 2(S) (2)Calcium  carbonate  precipitation :  Ca2++2  HCO 3−!CaCO 3(S)↓+H 2O(1)+C O 2(g) (3)These reactions show that wollastonite has the potential tosequester carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the surroundingenvironment as well. If this proces s occurs in the agricultural soil,it would offer an attractive sequ estration method. Among a widevariety of natural alkaline-earth silicates for the terrestrialweathering process, wollastonite is one of the most promisingcandidates because of its simple ch emistry, high weathering rate,and the ease of production of carbonated products due to theweaker bonding of Ca ions to the silica matrix ( Palandri andKharaka, 2004 ;Schott et al., 2012 ). Wollastonite is widelydistributed around the world, occurring in China, Finland, India,Mexico, Spain, Canada, and the U.S., with a reserve size exceeding100 million tons ( Brioche, 2018 ) .T h em a i ns o u r c eo fw o l l a s t o n i t ei nOntario, Canada (where this study was conducted), is a surfacemine operated by Canadian Wollas tonite in the village of Seeley'sBay, located 30 km north of the city of Kingston.In our previous study, Haque et al. (2019c) determined therole of plants: legumes (green bean) and non-legumes (corn), onwollastonite weathering and inorganic carbonate formation insoil. Legumes produce root nodules, which aid in nitrogenﬁxation, hence releasing protons into the soil ( Hardarson,1993 ;Danyal et al., 2016 ). The protons released facilitatedwollastonite weathering and resulted in increased release ofcalcium ions in the soil, thus capturing more dissolvedatmospheric/soil CO2, leading to increased formation ofcalcium carbonate in the soil. Non-legume plant (corn) grewbetter in the wollastonite-amended soil, but the inorganiccarbonate accumulation, in this case, was less compared to thatof the legume plant ( Haque et al., 2019c ). Hence, in the presentstudy, leguminous plants were selected to further investigate theeffect of wollastonite on the growth performance of two plantspecies commonly used in agriculture: a high-value agriculturalcrop, soybean ( Glycine max ), and a cover/forage crop, alfalfa(Medicago sativa ). In the ﬁeld, soybean is usually grown in thesummer and post-harvest the ﬁeld can be covered with alfalfa.Wollastonite weathering under laboratory conditions is welldocumented ( Huijgen et al., 2006 ), however, the onlyexperimental data under northern hemisphere croppedconditions is available in our previous pot study ( Haque et al.,2019c ), and in our recently published ﬁeld study ( Haque et al.,2020 ). In the latter, we analyzed the soil from two commercialﬁelds in Ontario, where wollastonite was being used as a soilmineralizer, to identify evidence of soil inorganic carbonaccumulation (as pedogenic carbonates), and also conducted aﬁeld experiment to grow soybean under three different dosages ofwollastonite. At a ﬁeld-scale, the main limitation is the use of lowapplication rates of wollastonite. As there is a limited study onthe use of wollastonite as a s oil amendment, commercialproducers do not consider testing higher application rates. Asa result of the low application rates, as well as the large area ofﬁelds, the main challenge is to separate the wollastonite grainsand weathering products from the soil to study morphologicaland mineralogical changes. Therefore, to provide more evidenceHaque et al. Wollastonite Soil Amendment: Microplot StudyFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1012 2on the effect of wollastonite on plant growth, as well aswollastonite carbonation in soil under ambient conditions, thispresent microplot study was carried out. Also, the plants selectedfor this study are two common plants (soybeans and alfalfa) usedin the agricultural sector; hence, with the results established fromthis microplot study, the growers can make an informed decisionto apply wollastonite on their ﬁeld. The ﬁrst objective of thisstudy was to evaluate the bene ﬁt of mixing a wide range ofdosages of an alkaline-earth silicate, wollastonite, as a soilamendment, on the growth performance of the plants in termsof above-ground biomass dry weight, root biomass, stem width,leaf blade width, and plant height. For soybean, the weight of thepods was also measured to determine the effect on the yield. Thesecond objective was to ﬁnd evidence of enhanced weathering ofwollastonite in soil. In addition to determining the inorganiccarbon content in the soil, mineralogical assessment of the soilswas performed using non-destructive techniques useful incharacterizing mineral weathering and carbonation ( Haqueet al., 2019b ), namely XRD and SEM analysis. The resultsobtained from this study help to understand the impact ofwollastonite soil amendment on agronomy, and will aid inimplementing such negative emissions technology.MATERIALS AND METHODSSoil and Plant SelectionThe soil, used to set up the microplot on the rooftop, wascollected from a commercial agricultural ﬁeld located inWoodstock, southwestern Ontario, Canada (43°08'57.7 ”N 80°37'29.8 ”W, EL 247m). The soil classi ﬁcation is identi ﬁed as sandyloam (gravel 11 g/kg, sand 551 g/kg, silt 295 g/kg, clay 155 g/kg)with a pH of 6.63 and 32 g/kg dry organic matter content. Itstaxonomic classi ﬁcation, based on historical soil surveys of thearea ( Mozuraitis and Hagarty, 1996 ), is orthic melanic brunisol,with soils from this area having been formed on glacial till(Webber and Hoffman, 1967 ), characterized as rapidly drainedwith high water conductivity, and being non-stony, sandy,mixed, mildly alkaline, and strongly calcareous. Refer toTable S1 for more information.Since soybean was grown on this particular farm, and it is amajor global and regional crop, it was selected as the agriculturalcrop for this study. A leguminous cover crop was selected to takeadvantage of the bene ﬁts that nitrogen- ﬁxation activity in rootnodules was found in our prior study to bring to wollastoniteweathering ( Haque et al., 2019c ). To this end, alfalfa, as a widelyused leguminous forage crop, was selected. Soybean ( G. max )seeds coated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum , and alfalfa ( M.sativa ) seeds coated with Sinorhizobium meliloti , were used; theseeds were coated with the aforementioned bacteria for theirlegume-root nodulating and nitrogen- ﬁxing abilities.Microplot SetupThe experimental microplot was set up at the Thornbroughbuilding rooftop in the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.Soybean plants were grown with four different wollastonite-in-soil dosages, containing 1.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt.% mineral soilamendment (MSA), along with a control plot of the unamendedsoil. These dosages are equivalent to 3 kg·m−2to 20 kg·m−2basedon 0.15 m soil depth, which is the usual tillage depth employed attheﬁelds. Alfalfa plants were grown with six differentwollastonite-in-soil dosages, containing 1.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and20 wt.% MSA, along with a control plot of unamended soil.Wollastonite was tumbled with soil in large buckets for blending,with the aim being to achieve good mixing but with minimaldisruption to soil texture.Testing a wide range of wollastonite dosage on experimentalplots will help to understand which dosage range is best suitedforﬁeld application, and determine an upper limit beyond whichplant and mineral weathering bene ﬁts decline. A higher dosagewas investigated to study the alfalfa since as a winter-hardy covercrop, it could be used in ﬁelds that decide to apply wollastonite atlarger dosages in late-Fall post-harvest, just prior to alfalfaseeding. Moreover, at the ﬁeld scale, the highest suitableamendment dosage is not intended to be used in a singleapplication, but could be thought of as the cumulative ofseveral applications over multiple crop cycles.Plots of various MSA compositions (1.5 to 20 wt.%) withoutany plants were also maintained to check for the wollastoniteweathering and carbonate a ccumulation under uncroppedconditions, hence enabling distinction of plant effects on theweathering processes versus soil and ambient effects. Eachmicroplot, with a dimension of 0.6 m length, 1.2 m width, and0.15 m depth, was ﬁlled with soil or MSA. No other chemical,mineral or organic amendments (e.g. solid or liquid fertilizers,limestone/dolomite, manure/compost, etc.) were used in theseexperiments, as the ﬁeld soil used was considered to be ofadequate fertility for the purpose of this research. The plotswere open to drainage to emulate the setup as close as possible totheﬁeld conditions. At the start of the experiment, the soils weresupplied with adequate tap water, and later depended on rainwater as the source of water supply. Daily climatic data from thisstudy is reported in the Supplementary Material ( Figure S1 ). Themaximum, minimum, and mean temperatures recorded duringthe experimental run are 25.7, 12.6, and 19.2°C, respectively. Theschematic of the experimental set up is given in Figure 1 andFigure S1C . The experiments ran for 14 weeks, from late June toearly October, 2018. At the end of the experiment, the soil fromeach plot was sampled, using a soil core sampler (0.013-mdiameter) at ﬁve different points radially distributed withineach microplot and down to full depth (0.15 m); cores werethoroughly hand-blended, air dried, and sieved through 200 µmmesh prior to all soil analyses.Plant Growth TrialsThe plant growth and development were analyzed based on thedevelopment stages. At the end of the experimental run, after 14weeks, the plants were harvested by cutting them just above thesoil level. The number of plants recovered from each microplotwas: 30 soybean plants, and 15 alfalfa plants. The main growthparameters recorded were plant height, stem width, leaf bladewidth, root dry biomass, and above-ground biomass dry weight.Haque et al. Wollastonite Soil Amendment: Microplot StudyFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1012 3The root dry biomass of each plant was determined by separatingthe roots from the soil by washing with suf ﬁcient water anddrying the sample at 80°C for 48 h. Above-ground biomass dryweight of each plant was determined after drying the sample in adrying oven at 80°C for 48 h ( Jones et al., 2009 ). All suchmeasurements reported in the results section were averagedamong all collected plants from each microplot, and standarddeviations values were calculated. The yield of the soybean podscollected from the plants at week 14 was determined from thecombined mass of pods from each subplot with each microplot.Subplots contained 10 soybean plants. Thus the yield wasaveraged between the three subplots in each microplot, andstandard deviation calculated.Chemical AnalysesThe pH of the samples was determined using a 1:5 ratio of soiland 0.01 M CaCl2solution, followed by 30 min shaking and 1 hsettling time before taking the pH measurement of the clearsupernatant ( Pansu and Gautheyrou, 2007 ).The carbonate content (calculated as g CaCO3·(kg soil)−1) wasdetermined by using a calcimeter. Soil samples were suspendedin MiliQ water (5 g in 20 ml), to which 7 ml of 4M HCl wasadded within in a sealed Erlenmeyer ﬂask connected to agraduated water- ﬁlled manometer-style column that recordedthe released CO2volume (Eijkelkamp Calcimeter 08.53) ( Chenet al., 2015 ). The amount of CaCO 3accumulated in the soil as theresult of the sequestration of the dissolved CO 2present in the soilpore-water by the calcium ions dissociated from wollastonite iscalculated using Equation (4). The CaCO 3Initial value accountsfor the carbonate content added to the soil as the result ofwollastonite application (wh ich contains small amounts ofnaturally present calcite) together with the initial CaCO3content in the untreated soil.CaCO 3 accumulation  gkg/C18/C19= CaCO 3Final(gkg)−CaCO 3Initial (gkg) (4)The pH and calcimetry analyses were made in triplicates andmean results reported herein have been represented along withstandard deviations. The data were statistically analyzed usingone-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) along with Tukey test.P < 0.05 was used as the limit for statistical signi ﬁcance. Dataanalysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software.Mineralogical and MicrostructuralAnalysesThe mineralogy of the soils and mineral was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical Empyrean) operated with CuKaradiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffraction patterns werecollected over a 2 qrange of 5 –70° ( Gineika et al., 2019 ) and thecrystalline phases were identi ﬁed using the software HighScorePlus (Malvern Panalytical). The morphology, structure, andchemical composition of sam ples were analyzed using ascanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Inspect S50)equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS,Oxford X-Max20 SSD).Wollastonite CharacteristicsWollastonite for the study was sourced from CanadianWollastonite's Ontario mine ( 44°27'30''N, 76°15' 20''W,Sangster (1998) ). Analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD)showed that the main mineral phases included wollastonite(CaSiO3) and diopside (CaMgSi 2O6)(Figure S2 ). The ﬁnewollastonite consisted of 49.0 wt.% wollastonite, 20.4 wt.%diopside, and the remainder free SiO 2and minor silicates,aluminates and sulfates. The inherent calcite (CaCO 3) amountof 3.8 wt.% was determined by using the calcimeter.Elemental composition of the soil was quanti ﬁed byWavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (WDXRF, MalvernPanalytical Zetium). Duplicate samples, in loose powder form,were analyzed for 20 min using standardless Omniam method,under helium and at 1 kW power, and concentrations werecalculated as oxides. The average sum before normalization was88.3 wt.%, with the balance being porosity and undetectable lightelements (H, C, O, N). The average concentrations of thedetected oxides present in amounts greater than 0.10 wt.%,normalized to 100% were: 52.5 wt.% SiO2, 29.8 wt.% CaO, 4.63wt.% MgO, 4.04 wt.% Al 2O3, 3.17 wt.% Fe 2O3, 1.61 wt.% K 2O,1.57 wt.% Na 2O, 1.30 wt.% SO 3, 0.74 wt.% P 2O5, 0.24 TiO 2;0.19 SrO.The particle size distribution of wollastonite was determinedby wet laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer SM), and thesurface weighted (Sauter) mean diameter (D [3,2]) was foundto be 4.37 ± 0.06 µm and 90% of particles by volume (D90) wereFIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the experimental setup.

The multipoint BET (Brunauer,Emmett and Teller) speci ﬁc surface area was determined to be3.476 m2·g−1. This was performed by a physisorption analyzer(Quantachrome Autosorb iQ), using N 2adsorption at 77K onsamples previously degassed under vacuum, consecutively at120°C (30 min soaking time) and 350°C (300 min soaking time).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffect of Mineral Amendment on PlantGrowthFigure 2 shows the variation in the soybean root biomass andabove-ground dry biomass, when grown with differentwollastonite dosages, using a sample size (n) of 30 plants. Theplant height data is given in Figure S4 . The soybean trialsshowed that the plants performed best in the 5 wt.%wollastonite-amended soil, with the plants exhibiting increasedplant height (8.1% higher), and greater root biomass (32.5%greater) and above-ground biomass dry weight (twofold greater),in comparison to those grown in the control plot as well asshowed a statistical difference (p <0.05). In all treatments, theroots had reached the base of the growth containers andexhibited healthy root biomass. There was no signi ﬁcantchange in the stem and leaf blade widths for the varioustreatments ( Table S2 in the Supplementary Material).The 5 wt.% wollastonite-amended soil showed the highestsoybean yield (twofold greater), as seen in Figure 3 andFigure S5 . The yield decreased for the 7.5 and 10 wt.% MSAmicroplots. At the end of the growth trial, the pH of the MSA 7.5and MSA 10 soils was 7.43 ± 0.04 and 7.76 ± 0.05, respectively,whereas for the MSA 5 soil the pH was 7.11 ± 0.03 ( Figure S6A ).The suitable pH range for soybean is 6.5 –7.0, as at higher pH, thesupply of bioavailable nutrients to the plant is disrupted ( Fageriaand Baligar, 1999 ), which can be one of the reasons why the yieldof soybean is low in case of the microplots with the two highestwollastonite dosages. Even though the yield in case of MSA 7.5 islow in comparison to the control (unamended soil), there is nosigniﬁcant difference (p >0.05) in the plant height, root biomass,and above-ground biomass dry weight ( Figure 2 andFigure S4 ),which implies the plant grew well, but was less ef ﬁcient in itsreproductive stage. For MSA 10 microplot, root biomass waslower by 14.7% as compared to the control, and poor rootbiomass density can be responsible for shorter plant height(18.2%) and lower above-ground biomass dry weight (12.7%).Overall, all tested wollastonite dosages did not result in negativegrowth performance, i.e., zero seedling germination or plantsenescence before the end of the growth trial. This implies that anappropriate amount of wollastonite, when added to the soil,supports good plant growth.The growth response of the alfalfa to wollastonite amendmentis shown in Figure 4 (n = 15). Overall, the growth of alfalfa wasbetter than the control in all treatments. In contrast to thesoybean trials, growth of alfalfa was best with 10 wt.%wollastonite-amended soil. At the end of the 14-week growthperiod, the alfalfa grown in MSA 10 was taller in height bythreefold ( Figure S7 ), possessed higher above-ground dry weight(by 3.6-fold), and had threefold greater root biomass incomparison to the control (p <0.05). Amending the alfalfamicroplots with wollastonite increased the soil pH, as seen inFigures S6B andS7B. The pH of the control soil plot was 6.42 ±0.05, and that of the 20 wt.% MSA plot was 8.09 ± 0.04, whichimplies that higher wollastonite dosage can be used for plantspreferring alkaline soil for their growth, for which alfalfa can be acandidate. Alfalfa is a cover crop that is usually sown after thegrowing season, therefore this cover crop would be compatiblewith applying a higher wollastonite dosage that could help withFIGURE 2 | Variation in the soybean: a) root biomass, and b) above-groundbiomass dry weight, with different dosages (wt.% in soil) of wollastonitemineral soil amendment (MSA).

Then in theupcoming season, when other agricultural crops will be planted,the soil will be well mineralized with wollastonite as a result ofthe cover crop-timed application.W o l l a s t o n i t e - a m e n d e ds o i lp r o m o t e dg o o dp l a n tg r o w t h ,t h u sconﬁrming its potential to be used as a soil amendment in theagronomic sector. Canadian Wollastonite and its distributors havealready been marketing wollast o n i t et of a r m e r si nO n t a r i oa n dbeyond, and assessing the effects and fate of wollastonite incommercial farms is also part of our current research. In thepresent study, increased soybean yield in wollastonite-amendedsoil, as well as healthier alfalfa growth, shows the positive effectsof this alkaline-earth mineral. In addition to the aboveground plantgrowth, root biomass also showed a positive response towollastonite addition. Visual i nspection of the roots showed noobservable signs of swollen root tips, or root browning. Rootnodules formed, thus indicating the unaltered activity ofrhizobium bacteria in the wol lastonite-containing soilenvironment. These positive responses of the growth performancemay be due to the release of silica into the soil (Equation (2)), whichaccumulates in certain plants in the form of phytogenic silica ( Kelleret al., 2012 ). Si is known to offer numerous bene ﬁts to plant growthincluding better yield and quality, nitrogen ﬁxation, and alleviate theabiotic and biotic stress as a result of extreme temperatures, metaltoxicity, salinity or drought ( Ma, 2004 ;Mitani and Ma, 2005 ;VanBockhaven et al., 2013 ).Coskun et al. (2019) provides a criticalreview on the mechanism of how Si can bene ﬁt the plant growth.Guntzer et al. (2012) reports that soybean plants are Siaccumulators, which supports the positive growth of soybeanplants in wollastonite-amended soil. Be ́langer et al. (2016) offersevidence on the transport and accumulation of Si in the roots andleaves of soybean cultivars. The plant-available form of silicon in thesoil is mainly as monomeric silicic acid (H4SiO 4)(Dietzel, 2002 ),which is the hydrated form of SiO 2, thus readily available whenwollastonite weathers in soil. Hodson et al. (2005) described thehigh-density accumulation of phytogenic silica in the roots andshoots of soybeans and alfalfa, which explains the taller and denserroot biomass observed in case of both the plant species studied inthis work.In the agriculture sector, wollastonite can be used as a limingagent, as it helps in increasing the soil pH (reducing soil acidity)by adding calcium and magnesium, thus reducing aluminum andmanganese solubility in the soil ( Osman, 2012 ;Goulding, 2016 ).It can be applied using the same broadcaster as the traditionallime spreader. Fertilizing the soil with Si is known to improve theyield of rice as well as sugarcane, especially in Si-de ﬁcient oxisolsoils ( Savant et al., 1999 ;Korndörfer and Lepsch, 2001 ;Keepingand Meyer, 2006 ). In fact, using wollastonite for Si fertilization ofFIGURE 4 | Variation in the alfalfa: (A)root biomass and above-ground biomass dry weight, with different dosages (wt.% in soil) of wollastonite mineral soilamendment (MSA). In all cases, n = 15 and statistically analyzed using Tukey test.

Hence, application of wollastonite inagricultural ﬁelds is a known practice; however, usingwollastonite for sequestering carbon viaterrestrial enhancedweathering is not well reported. In our recent study ( Haqueet al., 2020 ), aﬁeld-scale wollastonite amendment experimentwas conducted at a commercial soybean farm, for veri ﬁcation ofCO 2sequestration and effects on crop yield at ﬁeld conditions.Soils at two additional farms (leafy vegetables, and potato) thathad voluntarily used wollastonite amendment for one or morecrop cycles were also studied for evidence of CO2sequestration.This study showed that application of wollastonite resulted inpedogenic carbonate accumulation, proportional to time since,and rate of, mineral amendment.World reserves of wollastonite exceed 100 million tons, and inOntario, the nearest mine is located in Kingston ( Brioche, 2018 ).Hence, the availability and location of the alkaline-earth mineralare also important to determine its feasibility as a mineral soilamendment. Wollastonite was used in this study because it isavailable in Ontario, Canada. Similarly, across the world,different types of alkaline-earth minerals can be used based ontheir availability. For example, olivine, a major constituent ofdunite rock, is mined in several countries including Spain, Italy,Norway, Sweden, Austria, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, and thecost price is in the order of a few tens of US$ per ton in theRotterdam harbour. Therefore, depending on the location, aneconomically feasible alkaline-earth mineral can be used as thesoil amendement. The world reserve of the various alkaline-earthminerals is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey in the MineralCommodity Summaries report ( Brioche, 2018 ).The net cost of CO2sequestration as a result of wollastoniteapplication was estimated in our previous study ( Haque et al.,2020 ) at $240/ton CO 2, assuming the cost to farmer, in Ontario,of $44/ton wollastonite, and assuming a net sequestration of 0.2 tCO2per ton of wollastonite, to account for CO 2emissions frommine to farm. The carbon price for CO 2emission in Ontario isexpected to reach $50/ton by 2022 ( Pricing carbon pollutionfrom industry, 2019 ). As such, additional bene ﬁts of wollastonite,for plant growth and to replace limestone application, areimportant to cover the cost of wollastonite application, andmore research is needed to con ﬁrm such bene ﬁts. The higherdosages of wollastonite tested in this study were intended forresearch purposes, to determine the upper limit of bene ﬁcial soilamendment. For real ﬁeld applications, high dosages wouldresult in higher cost of wollastonite application (in view ofeconomic, transport and management considerations) ifapplied in a single season, therefore, it is more feasible toachieve such high amendment by continuously amending thesoil with wollastonite every year or crop cycle.Using a non-renewable natural resource, i.e. wollastonite in ourstudy, in agriculture may have the l imitation of reaching exhaustionin the future, though in the nea rer term there are enough knownreserves (and likely more) to signi ﬁcantly contribute to CO2sequestration and agricultural bene ﬁts before signi ﬁcant depletionin reserves is observed. To have a continuous supply of wollastonitefor mineral weathering in agricu lture, wollastonite can also besynthesized chemically from limestone and silica sand ( Kotsis andBalogh, 1989 ), a concept behind the wollastonite-containingcements of Solidia Technologies Inc. and HeidelbergCement(Canadian Wollastonite, 2019 ), though this is an energy intensiveprocess and the CO2released would need to be captured ingeological storage sites. Additional ly, there are other alkaline-earthminerals available globally that potentially can sequester CO 2insoils and bene ﬁt agriculture; some of these are referred to as ‘rockdust’.C O 2sequestration by other minerals (e.g. olivine or basalt)may not be as fast or bene ﬁcial compared to wollastonite, dependingon the chemical composition and mineralogy of the rock, andfurther research is warranted to identify promising candidates.Carbon Sequestration in SoilAccumulation of Inorganic Carbon in SoilOverall, the inorganic carbon in the amended soil, measured interms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) content, was found to behigher than the control microplots, and the CaCO 3amounts thataccumulated in the wollastonite-amended soils are given inFigure 5 . In this microplot study, the plots were open todrainage to emulate the setup as close as possible to the ﬁeldconditions. Based on the detailed study provided by Kelland et al.(2020) , elemental mass budgets indicate that the products ofbasalt dissolution (alkalinity and cations) do not immediatelytransport directly to the marine environment viasurface watersbecause of uptake of elements into plant biomass and temporarysequestration onto soil exchangeable sites (e.g. clay and organicmatter). Likewise, the loss of nutrients or product of wollastonitedissolution can be assumed to have insigni ﬁcant impact on theﬁnal results. For the microplots planted with soybean plants, theaccumulated amount of CaCO3increases with the higher dosagesof wollastonite, and a similar trend is seen for the microplotsFIGURE 5 | Calcium carbonate accumulation (bars) and CO 2sequestered(lines) in the various MSA microplots, amended with 1.5 –10 wt.% wollastonitefor soybean, and 1.5 –20 wt.% wollastonite for alfalfa.Haque et al. Wollastonite Soil Amendment: Microplot StudyFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1012 7planted with alfalfa up to 15 wt.% MSA application ratio, afterwhich the inorganic carbon accumulation drastically reduced for20 wt.% MSA. The ﬁrst step of carbonate precipitation iswollastonite dissolution in soil, which is predominantlycontrolled by the soil pH. Geochemical modelling showswollastonite dissolution is favored at a pH less than 10, andlower pH leads to increased wollastonite dissolution ( Haqueet al., 2019c ). At a higher wollastonite application rate (20 wt.%MSA), there is a possibility that the soil pH resulted in slowwollastonite dissolution, thus resulting in fewer calcium ions inthe soil to precipitate as carbonate. At the end of 14 weeks, thehighest accumulation of 3.22 g CaCO3·(kg soil)−1was found inthe alfalfa MSA 15 microplot, which is equivalent to thesequestration of 0.3 kg CO 2·m−2, for a soil depth of 0.15 m. Inthis study, the lowest CaCO 3accumulation on plantedmicroplots occurred in the case of alfalfa grown with 1.5 wt.%MSA, which is expected and there was no signi ﬁcance differencewith respect to the untreated soil (p > 0.05) For the remainingamended soil (MSA 5 –MSA 20), the CaCO3accumulation wassigniﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) compare to the control soil.With unplanted soils, the CO 2sequestration value did notsurpass 0.025 kg CO 2·m−2, reached with MSA 15, con ﬁrming thecrucial role of plants, particularly leguminous, in accelerating theweathering of wollastonite in soils. Under cropped conditions,organic acids are produced from the roots, which facilitates thedissolution of the wollastonite, hence increasing the release ofcalcium ions in the soil, which further reacts with the dissolvedCO2present in the soil (as bicarbonates) to form calciumcarbonate. Different types of plant species release differenttypes of root exudates, and possess different root biomass(Nezat et al., 2004 ). Thus, the availability of protons andorganic acids present in the soil solution for the dissolution ofwollastonite will differ. This explains why the two legume specieschosen in this study result in different calcium carbonateaccumulation the soil, for the same amendment.The highest calcium carbonate accumulation of 3.22 g·kg−1reported in this study, obtained over 14 weeks, is equivalent to netmonthly accumulation of 0.08 kg CO 2·m−2·month−1, for a soildepth of 0.15 m. This value compares favorably to Manning et al.'sdata, who reported on a plot composed of compost and quarryﬁnes, and showed the net rate of accumulation to be in the order of0.15 kg CO2·m−2·month−1to a depth of 3 m ( Manning et al., 2013 ).Kelland et al. (2020) report soil inorganic carbonate precipitationviabasalt weathering in soil used to grow sorghum, reporting 0.24kg CO 2·m−2·year−1(0.02 kg CO 2·m−2·month−1) sequestrationusing basalt application. It is of the same order of magnitude asthe rate reported in this study (0.08 kg CO2·m−2·month−1).Mineralogical AssessmentXRD analysis of the different soil samples from thewollastonite-amended microplots was conducted, and thediffractograms of two such samples are shown in Figure 6 .Since the soil composition is complex, quanti ﬁcation of thedifferent mineral phases is a challenge, therefore the peakswere qualitatively identi ﬁe d .T h ec o n t r o ls o i ls h o w e dt h em a i npeaks for quartz (SiO2) and albite (NaAlSi 3O8), which areusually present in most of the sandy loamy soils(Schönenberger et al., 2012 ). The amended soil showed thecharacteristic peaks for wollast onite and calcite, which are notpresent in the control. The high calcimeter reading foramended soil is thus due to the formation of calcite, at leastin part as amorphous carbonates can also form under ambientconditions ( Versteegh et al., 2017 ).FIGURE 6 | XRD diffractogram showing the main peaks and crystalline phases present in the as-received unamended soil (top) and in a wollastonite-amended soil(alfalfa MSA 10) sampled at the end of the experiment (bottom).

The ﬁne needle-shaped wollastonite is noticeable inthe amended soil sample ( Figure 7B ). A closer look at the EDSspectrum of the carbonated wollastonite fragments reveals thechemical pro ﬁle. Comparing the EDS data of the uncarbonatedwollastonite with the carbonated sample provides information onthe occurrence of weathering and mineral carbonation.Figure 7C shows the SEM-EDS data for the as-receivedwollastonite used in this study. The needle-shaped structure(Figure 7C , spectrum 2) contains silicon (Si), calcium (Ca), andoxygen (O) as the main elements. An irregular-shaped structure(Figure 7C , spectrum 1) consists of Si, Ca, and O, which are themain elements present in wollastonite, as well as Mg, Na, Fe, andAl, which are usually present in trace amounts. Figure 7D showsthe SEM-EDS data for a carbonated wollastonite fragment fromthe amended soil. Spot EDS analysis at four different points showsthat this fragment consists of Ca, C, Si, and O as the mainelements, suggesting that the formation of CaCO3. The Si contentof this fragment at various points is in the range of 11.8 –13.2wt.%, which is lower than that of the feedstock wollastonite(Figure 7C ) containing approximately 21 wt.% Si. This impliesthat wollastonite dissolution (Equation (2)) has taken place,resulting in the release of Si during the enhanced weatheringreactions. The presence of the C content on the wollastonite grainconﬁrms that carbonation occurred, and carbonate is precipitatedon the wollastonite surface.Figure S8 shows SEM image of other mineral grains fromamended soil, this time associated with organic matter.

This study hasdemonstrated that following 14 weeks of exposure to ambientOntario atmospheric conditions, inorganic carbonate accumulatedin the wollastonite-amended soil, and CO2sequestration of 0.3 kgCO 2·m−2, for a soil depth of 0.15 m, was achieved. Calcite wasobserved in the XRD diffractogram, and dissolution ofwollastonite was evident from the SEM-EDS study. Wollastoniteamendment of soils also resulted in better growth of soybean andalfalfa plants, as indicated by the biomass dry weight yield data,thus implying the positive effect of wollastonite on agriculturalcrops and its potential to be used as a soil amendment in theagricultural sector. These co-bene ﬁts of wollastonite soilamendment would encourage producers to effectively usewollastonite to contribute towards global climate changemitigation, without compromising their produce. Findings fromthis microplot study serve to guide future ﬁeld scale studies, nowthat we know the optimal and, even more importantly, the limitingdosages that lead to good plant growth. To further elucidate theeffect of wollastonite on plant growth, study on the transport ofsilicon in the plants and the accumulation of phytogenic silica inthe different plant tissues (shoots, roots, as well as leaves) will beinsightful. A greenhouse-based experiment on these topics hasbeen initiated in our research group, which also aims to study themutual action when wollastonite is combined with conventionalfertilizers and liming agents. Opportunity also exists to investigatethe bene ﬁts of wollastonite amendment for crops under stressedconditions, including in urban rooftop/balcony farms, and toisolate the physical effects of wollastonite amendment in soilsfrom the chemical and (micro)biological effects. Such thoroughstudies will provide a deeper understanding on the effect ofwollastonite application as a soil amendment.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSFH: Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing —Original Draft.
