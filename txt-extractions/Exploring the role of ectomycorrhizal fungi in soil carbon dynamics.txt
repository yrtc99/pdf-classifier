ViewpointsExploring the role ofectomycorrhizal fungi in soilcarbon dynamicsSummaryThe extent to which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi enable plants toaccess organic nitrogen (N) bound in soil organic matter (SOM) andtransfer this growth-limiting nutrient to their plant host, hasimportant implications for our understanding of plant –fungalinteractions, and the cycling and storage of carbon (C) and N interrestrial ecosystems. Empirical evidence currently supports a rangeof perspectives, suggesting that ECM vary in their ability to providetheir host with N bound in SOM, and that this capacity can bothpositively and negatively inﬂuence soil C storage. To help resolve themultiplicity of observations, we gathered a group of researchers toexplore the role of ECM fungi in soil C dynamics, and propose newdirections that hold promise to resolve competing hypotheses andcontrasting observations. In this Viewpoint, we summarize thesedeliberations and identify areas of inquiry that hold promise forincreasing our understanding of these fundamental and widespreadplant symbionts and their role in ecosystem-level biogeochemistry.IntroductionThe potential for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to participate insoil organic matter (SOM) dynamics represents one of the mostactive areas of ecological research (Talbot et al., 2008; Averill et al.,2014; Lindahl & Tunlid, 2015; Sterkenburg et al., 2018). Thistopic has widespread importance for our understanding of plantgrowth (Terrer et al., 2016, 2017) and soil carbon (C) storage,which has been suggested to both increase (Orwin et al., 2011;Averill et al., 2014; Averill & Hawkes, 2016) and decrease (Phillipset al., 2014) due to the activity of these widespread plant symbionts.Recent laboratory evidence suggests that ECM fungi may obtainnitrogen (N) from organic compounds composing SOM, poten-tially allowing plants to access growth-limiting N beyond inorganicsources (Nicol /C19aset al., 2019). The potential for widespread accessto organic N compounds in forest ecosystems would fundamentallyalter our understanding of NPP and plant nutrition (N €asholmet al., 2009).Research investigating the role of ECM fungi in SOM dynamicsand plant N acquisition is important from several perspectives,ranging from our basic understanding of SOM dynamics (Averillet al., 2014) to the importance and accurate representation ofmycorrhizas in global biogeochemical models (Clemmensen et al.,2013; Franklin et al., 2014; Terrer et al., 2016, 2017; Brzosteket al., 2017). Empirical evidence, including the work of Gadgil &Gadgil (1971, 1975), has provided support for an array ofmechanistic perspectives (Fernandez & Kennedy, 2015), andseveral high-proﬁle papers have recently reignited the importanceof resolving the multiplicity of viewpoints surrounding thisfundamental ecological dynamic (Talbot et al., 2008; Averillet al., 2014; B €odeker et al., 2016; Terrer et al., 2016; Norby et al.,2017). Moreover, if we can identify the underlying processesthrough which mycorrhizas inﬂuence soil C storage, then we maybe able to harness physiological variation among them to bettermanage forests and sequester greater amounts of anthropogenicCO2into SOM.Toward that end, we held a workshop to gather a small group ofresearchers working on this issue from multiple perspectives. Ourtwo-day workshop at the University of Michigan on 21 –22 May2018 consisted of presentations and discussions that focusedthought on resolving the processes that may underlie the seeminglydisparate empirical evidence that currently exists regarding theability of ECM fungi to provide plants with N bound in SOM andto mediate soil C dynamics. For example, it is presently unclearwhether all ECM taxa can acquire N bound in SOM for plant use;nor do we understand the net effect of ECM-facilitated access to Non ecosystem-level processes. Below, we summarize points ofgeneral agreement amongst participants, and propose new avenuesof research that hold promise for resolving contrasting empiricalobservations.Precise terminology can inform experimental designand interpretationPrecise deﬁnitions of the physiology of ECM fungi clarify thepossible roles of ECM fungi in SOM dynamics. Foremost, wedeﬁne SOM as an heterogeneous group of chemically andphysically stabilized plant and microbial detritus ( sensu Lehmann& Kleber, 2015) containing organic N in various forms (Rilliget al., 2007; Nannipieri & Eldor, 2009). The proliferation ofresearch investigating ECM fungi and SOM dynamics has resultedin widespread usage of the terms ‘saprotrophy’, ‘decomposition’,‘decay’ and ‘modify’, to describe ECM physiology. We stronglysuggest that these terms are not interchangeable and have speciﬁcmeanings that need to be differentiated. Foremost, there waswidespread agreement that ECM fungi are unlikely to engage in thesaprotrophic metabolism of SOM, in which ECM directly obtainenergy from organic compounds contained therein (Lindahl &Tunlid, 2015). This consensus is widely consistent with oldermycorrhizal literature (Harley, 1969), although recent evidence/C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 33–39 33www.newphytologist.comForumsuggests that free-living saprotrophic fungi can form mycorrhizal-like associations with plant roots (Smith et al., 2017). For clarity,we focus on unequivocal and well-known mycorrhizal lineages inour discussions throughout.The decay of SOM by ECM fungi is deﬁned as the sustained andintegrated modiﬁcation of chemical bonds present in SOM. Thisdeﬁnition does not specify which bonds are modiﬁed, nor does itspecify the extent of overall decay. ECM decay of SOM includes thetransformation of organic matter into smaller molecules, as well aschanges in functional groups (i.e. primary amines, carboxyl groups)and physical structure. These modiﬁcations may lead to the releaseof soluble compounds; additionally, these transformations mayrender remaining SOM chemically or physically resistant to furthermodiﬁcation (Lindahl & Tunlid, 2015; Wang et al., 2017). Ourdeﬁnition of decay is delineated from the widespread use of‘decomposition’ or ‘saprotrophism’, which we deﬁne as thesequential and temporally integrated process in which differentorganic compounds contained in plant and microbial detritus aremetabolized to obtain metabolic energy andnutrients. We notethat our deﬁnition and distinction of the terms decay anddecomposition are conceptually consistent with previous work(Lindahl & Tunlid, 2015), but avoid semantic irregularities thatmay propagate between ﬁelds of study. Indeed, referring to ECMfungi as decomposers can be misleading if taken to mean that ECMfungi are metabolically similar to free-living saprotrophs whichobtain energy by metabolizing plant and microbial detritus.Our deﬁnition of SOM decay by ECM fungi emphasizes theinteraction of speciﬁc oxidative and hydrolytic extracellular ECMactivities (enzymes and hydroxyl radicals) in relation to the range ofchemical bonds present in SOM. Furthermore, this mechanisticdecay perspective focuses attention on the fundamental elementsthat are thought to be critical to understanding the net effect ofECM fungi on SOM dynamics, particularly the production andconformation of enzymes and hydroxyl radicals that are needed toliberate organic N-bearing compounds, as well as the uptake ofthese compounds by ECM hyphae (Orwin et al., 2011; Terreret al., 2017; Pellitier & Zak, 2018). Focusing on the enzymatic orradical catalysts that ECM fungi use to modify SOM requires amechanistic ‘match’ in the parametrization of SOM compounds.For example, the C : N ratios of SOM can be helpful incertain situations to describe the chemical ‘lability’ of SOM todecay; however, interpretation of data may be complicated if theextracellular activities of ECM fungi, which act on certain sets ofbonds present in SOM (Sinsabaugh, 2010) are studied in relationto the C : N of a target substrate. Models that represent ECM fungiand SOM stocks have variously parameterized the biochemical‘lability’ of SOM (Orwin et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2015; Baskaranet al., 2017; Terrer et al., 2017), leading to a range of conclusionsregarding the speciﬁc ECM extracellular catalysts that decay SOM,as well as their relative importance. As a result, some authors haveargued that proteases and laccases –which are widespread in ECMfungi (Kohler et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016) –are used by ECMfungi to decay SOM (Rineau et al., 2015), whereas others havesuggested that class II fungal peroxidases are of greater relativeimportance for ECM decay because they can degrade more‘recalcitrant’ compounds present within SOM pools (Baskaranet al., 2017; Kyaschenko et al., 2017). Recent models that includeboth hydrolysable and oxidizable ‘fractions’ of SOM (Baskaranet al., 2017) incorporate a more mechanistic view of ECM decaythat can inform experimentation and articulation of the relativeimportance of different enzymatic or radical-based decay pathways.Carefully deﬁning ECM decay requires that both the biochem-ical composition and the physical accessibility of SOM areconsidered. Several decades of experimentation suggest thatECM fungi can decay simple organic substrates in culture(reviewed in Smith & Read, 2008); these studies also show thatone of the key factors controlling the extent to which ECM fungican modify SOM is the biochemical conformation of the SOMitself. For example, although a range of ECM fungi can incorporateorganic N into their biomass when grown on simple protein (e.g.bovine serum albumin), when this substrate is complexed withtannins, ECM growth and N-uptake are reduced substantially(Bending & Read, 1996). By extension, the degree to which N-bearing organic molecules present in SOM are complexed withphenolic moieties may mediate the accessibility of N in SOM toECM fungi. Recent efforts to introduce authentic ﬁeld-derivedSOM substrates into culture-based studies is an important step indeveloping our understanding of the physiological capacity ofECM fungi to decay SOM (Nicol /C19aset al., 2019).Alongside studies investigating the biochemical composition ofSOM, a growing body of research highlights how physiochemicalbinding of SOM to minerals, as well as aggregate formation,determines the fate of SOM throughout decay processes (Tornet al., 1997; Schmidt et al., 2011; Lehmann & Kleber, 2015).Indeed, some studies suggest that the adsorption of SOM to claymicelles determines decay trajectories to a greater degree than doesthe biochemical composition of SOM alone (Lehmann & Kleber,2015; Newcomb et al., 2017). Most work on SOM stabilizationand persistence focuses on a broadly conceived microbial pool andrarely considers the speciﬁc activity and physiology of ECM fungi(but see Wang et al., 2017). However, given that ECM hyphae aremorphologically similar to their saprotrophic ancestors, elementsof current research investigating free-living saprotroph attack ofmineral- and aggregate-bound SOM can inform our understand-ing of ECM decay and SOM accessibility (Wang et al., 2017).Substantial physiological variation across ECMlineages in their capacity to modify SOMOne of the most signiﬁcant points of consensus was that thecapacity for ECM fungi to modify SOM is likely to varysubstantially across evolutionary lineages. ECM fungi have inde-pendently evolved >85 times (Tedersoo & Smith, 2013), primarilyfrom free-living Dikaryotic saprotrophs. Available genomic surveysof ECM fungi reveal substantial variation in the copy number ofgenes putatively involved in the modiﬁcation of SOM (Kohleret al., 2015; Shah et al., 2016; Pellitier & Zak, 2018). For example,the copy number of class II peroxidase genes, as well as the numberof lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) genes, spans anorder of magnitude amongst independent lineages of ECM fungi(Kohler et al., 2015). Conference participants also agreed thatmany lineages of ECM fungi have the genetic potential to produceNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 33–39 /C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comViewpoints ForumNewPhytologist 34 14698137, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15679 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensesome combination of hydroxyl radicals, glycoside hydrolases andlaccases, suggesting that ECM can decay SOM to a degree (Pritsch& Garbaye, 2011; Phillips et al., 2013; Terrer et al., 2017; Op DeBeeck et al., 2018). However, when such ﬁndings are placed inrelation to other fungal guilds (i.e. white rot and brown rotsaprotrophs, as well as ericoid mycorrhiza), the abundance of genespotentially involved in SOM modiﬁcation is substantially lower innearly all lineages of ECM fungi (Martino et al., 2018), suggestingthat ECM are not likely to mediate the modiﬁcation of SOM to thesame extent as free-living saprotrophs.Context-dependence of ECM and SOM modiﬁcationAn additional point of consensus was the recognition that themodiﬁcation of SOM by ECM fungi is likely to be stronglycontext-dependent. Such a consensus is notable because it willpropel future research investigating whether or not ECM fungifunction in similar ways across distinct forest ecosystems (Read,1991; Phillips et al., 2013; Averill et al., 2014; Terrer et al., 2017;Steidinger et al., 2018). Conference participants engaged inlengthy deliberations regarding the soil conditions in whichECM fungi are most likely to participate in the substantial decayof SOM. Through these discussions, soil N availability consistentlyemerged as a plausible factor governing ECM decay. Thisconsensus mirrors some current models that parameterize ECMdecay as a function of soil fertility (Orwin et al., 2011; Franklinet al., 2014; Baskaran et al., 2017). At this time, however, relativelylimited direct evidence exists to test these hypotheses under ﬁeldsettings (but see Lilleskov et al., 2002; Sterkenburg et al., 2015;Kyaschenko et al., 2017). Intriguingly, B €odeker et al. (2014)observed that class II peroxidase expression by ECM fungi in thegenus Cortinarius was downregulated in boreal forests amendedwith inorganic N. Similarly, other studies have found signiﬁcantvariation in the transcriptomic proﬁles of laboratory grown ECMfungi (Shah et al., 2016) and laboratory soil environments (Dor /C19eet al., 2015).Finally, the ﬂuctuating allocation of host photosynthate toECM mutualists (H €ogberg et al., 2010) potentially mediatingdecay emerged as a vibrant area of discussion. Host-derivedorganic compounds fuel the metabolism of ECM fungi; if ECMfungi decay SOM using energetically expensive enzymes orFenton chemistry (Rineau et al., 2012; Lindahl & Tunlid, 2015;Op De Beeck et al., 2018), then the nutritional status of the planthost has implications for ECM decay (Baskaran et al., 2017;Terrer et al., 2017). Indeed, experiments in pure culture systemshave revealed that the oxidation of SOM and the expression ofassociated enzymes and hydroxyl radicals are triggered by theaddition of glucose, suggesting that such dynamics may beregulated by the supply of photosynthate from the plant host(Rineau et al., 2013; Nicol /C19aset al., 2019). These considerationsare particularly relevant given the high model sensitivity ofphotosynthate allocation to ECM mutualists in recent models ofplant growth under elevated atmospheric CO2(Terrer et al.,2016, 2017). These models rely on the assumption that plantsallocating more photosynthate to ECM obtain greater quantitiesof growth-limiting N derived from SOM (Terrer et al., 2016,2017). This, however, remains an important and outstandingquestion to test empirically, because even if ECM fungi decaySOM to obtain N, much of that N may become immobilized infungal biomass (Franklin et al., 2014; Koide & Fernandez, 2018).Finally, recent studies suggest that ECM fungi alter SOM stocksdifferentially across soil horizons (Craig et al., 2018), which maybe related to differences in the surrounding biotic communities(Lindahl et al., 2007). This remains a largely unexplored ecolog-ical feedback that could have important implications for plantgrowth and the cycling of C and N in soil.ECM directly and indirectly modify the biochemicalcomposition and amount of SOMCurrent evidence suggests that ECM fungi play a key role in theaccumulation and turnover of SOM in temperate and borealforests, doing so at multiple scales and through a variety ofmechanisms. Below, we have clariﬁed and summarized several ofthe mechanisms that have been widely proposed.Together, the ability for certain ECM taxa to produce a range ofoxidativeand hydrolyticenzymes,aswellasFenton-based oxidationof SOM, constitute one of the most widely invoked mechanismswhereby ECM fungi could alter the accumulation and turnover ofSOM (Orwin et al., 2011; Averill et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2016;Kyaschenko et al., 2017; Op De Beeck et al., 2018). Rather thanmetabolizing organic molecules in SOM, ECM may modulateSOM storage by removing organic N –the so called ‘N-mining’hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that ECM fungi oxidize SOMto varying degrees to obtain small organic N-bearing molecules(peptides) while leaving relatively C-rich substrates behind (Orwinet al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2013; Averill et al., 2014). This has beenhypothesized to result in nutrientlimitation for the remainder ofthefree-living saprotrophic community, the so-called Gadgil effect,thereby reducing overall decomposition of SOM by saprotrophsand increasing soil C (Orwin et al., 2011; Fernandez & Kennedy,2015; Averill & Hawkes, 2016; Sterkenburg et al., 2018). Afrequently overlookedconsideration is that the enzymatic or Fentonbased chemistry needed for ECM to ‘mine’ organic N, wouldnecessarily modify the molecular structure of the remaining SOM(Nicol /C19aset al., 2019); importantly these modiﬁcations may result inmix of compounds that are more orless chemically accessible tosubsequent enzymatic attack. Here is an example where the C : Nratios of SOM may not provide sufﬁcient detail to explore theinteraction of ECM fungi and free-living saprotrophic communi-ties. Although the N-mining hypothesis has grown in popularity,direct empirical evidence from the ﬁeld that ECM oxidize organicmatter and thereby release N, leading to enhanced plant nutrition, isstill missing. Accordingly, broad generalizations about the decaycapacity of ECM across phylogenetic lineages and ecosystemsshould be avoided until additional data is collected. However, weagree that such physiology is plausible (Shah et al., 2016; Nicol /C19aset al., 2019) and may be of major importance in some ecosystems(Averill et al., 2014; Clemmensen et al., 2015; Sterkenburg et al.,2018). Quantitative ﬁeld-based estimates of organic N-uptake byECM fungi would represent a major advance in our understandingof the potential magnitude of this phenomenon./C2112019 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112019 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2019) 223: 33–39www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Viewpoints Forum 35 14698137, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15679 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseGiven the growing evidence that the dynamics of SOM are bestrepresented as an ecosystem-level process (Lehmann & Kleber,2015), we similarly suggest that the role of ECM fungi in SOMdynamics must be considered within a broader context of biotic andabiotic interactions (Johnson et al., 2013). Accordingly, an addi-tional mechanism whereby ECM fungi may alter SOM dynamics,but which does not involve the production of hydrolytic oroxidative enzymes (or Fenton based radicals), is via the presence oflive and dead hyphae. Foremost, the ‘priming-effect’, that is theexudation of energy-rich low molecular weight organic compoundsfrom metabolically active hyphae, has been proposed to alter theactivity of associated soil organisms decomposing SOM (Phillipset al., 2012; Sulman et al., 2017). Further, ECM hyphae cancontribute to the formation of mineral stabilized SOM by thesecretion of mineral surface reactive metabolites (Wang et al.,2017). The extent to which different ECM hyphal morphologies(Agerer, 2001) contribute to the priming and stabilization of SOMremains an important question (Hobbie & Agerer, 2010; Tedersooet al., 2012).Similarly, the recalcitrance of dead ECM hyphae as well as theirproduction has received considerable attention (Clemmensenet al., 2013, 2015; Ekblad et al., 2013; Fernandez et al., 2016;Hagenbo et al., 2018). For example, cord-forming rhizomorphicECM fungi, such as those in the genus Cortinarius , can producesigniﬁcant amounts of hyphal biomass; however, these detritalinputs may speed decay and reduce long-term accumulation ofSOM (Clemmensen et al., 2015). By contrast, hyphae produced bythe globally widespread Cenoccocum (Tedersoo et al., 2012) candisplay varying degrees of melanization, which may lead to theaccumulation of SOM (Fernandez & Koide, 2014). We do not yetfully understand how the necromass from hyphae with a range ofmorphologies and biochemical constituents inﬂuences their rate ofdecay and subsequently SOM formation (Certano et al., 2018).Given that c.20% of host NPP is allocated to belowgroundmutualists (Leake et al., 2004; Ekblad et al., 2013), the fate of ECMnecromass is likely to play a large role in SOM dynamics. It isplausible that living and dead hyphae contribute differentially toSOM dynamics; therefore, disentangling speciﬁc mechanismsfrom the net effect of ECM activity on SOM stocks remains criticalto building predictive understanding of the conditions where ECMare most likely to impact SOM stocks. To conclude, we note thatthe myriad mechanisms discussed above likely act in parallel, andthe relative importance of each may vary with the seasonality of hostphotosynthate allocation belowground, the interaction of SOMwith mineral surfaces, soil microbial community membership, andecosystem type (Keller & Phillips, 2019).Ways towards new understandingElucidate the chemical and physical accessibility of SOM todecay by ECM fungiIt was widely agreed that ongoing efforts to characterize andconstrain the physiological capacity for ECM fungi to modify thebonds present in SOM can greatly improve model efforts thatincorporate the activity of these widespread plant symbionts onSOM (Nicol /C19aset al., 2019). Similarly, estimates of organic Nliberation and fungal transfer of this N to the plant host are urgentlyneeded to inform models which suggest that sustained plants’growth under elevated CO2is facilitated by accessing N in SOM viaECM mutualists (Terrer et al., 2017). Gathering these datasets willrest on a ﬁrm understanding of ECM decay physiology and theirability to modify the bonds present in SOM in situ . Researchuncovering the formation and stabilization of SOM in forestecosystems (Lehmann & Kleber, 2015) combined with detailedstudies of ECM decay physiology will facilitate this effort,especially when paired with measures of plant N-uptake.Explore and incorporate physiological variation amongstECM lineages and communities in models of SOM dynamicsElucidating the extent to which communities distributed acrossdistinct biomes are functionally equivalent in their capacity tomodify SOM was an important future direction articulated bymany workshop participants. Linked climate –ECM communitymodels suggest large-scale taxonomic and morphological variabil-ity at the regional and continental scale (Steidinger et al., 2018);plausibly, this variability suggests that widely distributed ECMcommunities may not be functionally equivalent (but see Talbotet al., 2014). Research spanning a variety of spatial scales isrecommended to uncover the environmental constraints govern-ing the distribution of ECM fungi (Peay & Matheny, 2016), andtheir ability to decay SOM and transfer N to their plant host. Apossible by-product of such studies is the direct reﬁnement of therole of ECM fungi in SOM dynamics across a range of scales andbiomes. Indeed, if genomic evidence is corroborated by experi-mental investigations revealing that not all ECM can contributeequally to the decay of SOM, then coupled plant –soil modelsshould explore model sensitivity when variation amongst ECMlineages and communities is included. This remains a formidable,but essential, scientiﬁc challenge to address if we are to accuratelyportray this integral ecological interaction at an ecosystem orlandscape scale.Elucidate the consequences of ECM for SOM stocks andplant N acquisition across a range of scalesRecent research investigating the role of ECM fungi in soilbiogeochemical cycles has signiﬁcantly stimulated the ﬁeld ofmycorrhizal and plant ecology. However, the net effect of ECMactivity on SOM remains relatively unknown; only a handful ofstudies have used modeling approaches to quantify and constrainthe potential role of ECM fungi in SOM dynamics, showing thatwhen the activities of ECM are included into models, the effect sizecan be quite large (Orwin et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2015; Baskaranet al., 2017). There are signiﬁcant differences in the generalparameterization of these models, namely interactions with free-living saprotrophs, the proportion of organic N ECM may transferto plant hosts, the inﬂuence of the soil environment on ECMphysiology, as well as the contribution and decay of hyphalnecromass. Accordingly, the role of ECM fungi in the accumula-tionorloss of SOM remains relatively undeﬁned.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseunderstanding the relevancy of the interaction of the ‘N-mining’hypothesis and the Gadgil-effect, involves deriving quantitativeestimates of the amount of organic N which different ECM lineagescan liberate from SOM. In so doing, the net effect of the potentialinteraction of ECM fungi with free-living saprotrophs could bebounded quantitatively. Indeed, modeling approaches may ulti-mately provide mechanistic insight into SOM dynamics, if theyexplicitly probe the sensitivity of multiple plausible mechanisms ofSOM modiﬁcation by ECM fungi. To achieve such results,mechanistic in vitro studies of ECM interacting and contributing toSOM will reduce model uncertainty.Study a broader phylogenetic range of ECM fungi under awide range of laboratory and ﬁeld conditionsThere was widespread agreement that future research must embracea wider phylogenetic range of study organisms. At present, very fewECM species are commonly used in laboratory experimentalstudies. Although this reﬂects the signiﬁcant difﬁculty of culturingand manipulating many ECM taxa, there is an urgent need tounderstand the extent to which fully sequenced and commonlystudied ECM species are functionally representative of their genus.Bringing experiments to the ﬁeld may be the only way to close theknowledge gap arising from over-reliance on easy-to-manipulatelaboratory fungi and the species that more often dominate ECMcommunities in the ﬁeld. Finally, studying a range of ECMcommunities across soil fertility gradients, soil textures and forestcommunities provides a means by which to better understand thecontexts where ECM are most likely to contribute strongly to SOMdynamics.Closing commentsWorkshop participants employ a wide range of methodologicalapproaches, and our research encompasses broad biological andspatial scales. Here, we argue that a multi-pronged approach thatleverages community-wide expertise in ecosystem-level modeling,ﬁeld and laboratory experimentation, knowledge of natural history(Peay, 2014), and replicable molecular techniques (Nguyen et al.,2015) will further our understanding of the physiological capacityof ECM to mediate the cycling and storage of C and N in terrestrialecosystems. Above, we have identiﬁed important knowledge gapsin the physiological potential for ECM to modify SOM andprovide host plants with additional sources of N above and beyondinorganic forms in soil solution. Until these gaps are ﬁlled, it istenuous to assume that the manipulation of the ECM communitycomposition is a viable means to manage terrestrial ecosystems forincreased storage of anthropogenic CO2in soils.AcknowledgementsThis workshop was made possible by the University of Michigan’sBeyond Carbon Neutral Program, which provided ﬁnancialsupport to all participants.
