Theobjectives of this study were to investigate the impacts of conventional tillage (CT), NT, and multiple cropping sequences on soilorganic C (SOC) and N (SON) sequestration and on distribution within aggregate-size fractions in a southcentral Texas soil at theend of 20 years of treatment imposition. Soil organic C and SON sequestration were signiﬁcantly greater under NT than CT for agrain sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]/wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)/soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (SWS),a wheat/soybean doublecrop (WS), and a continuous wheat monoculture (CW) at 0–5 cm and for the SWS rotation at 5–15 cm.At 0–5 cm, NT increased SOC storage compared to CT by 62, 41, and 47% and SON storage by 77, 57, and 56%, respectively,for SWS, WS, and CW cropping sequences. Increased cropping intensity failed to enhance SOC or SON sequestration at eithersoil depth compared to the CW monoculture. No-tillage increased the proportion of macroaggregates ( >2 mm) at 0–5 cm but notat 5–15 cm. The majority of SOC and SON storage under both CT and NT was observed in the largest aggregate-size fractions(>2 mm, 250 mm to 2 mm).

IntroductionIncreasing importance has been placed on the use ofagricultural soils for the mitigation of atmospheric CO 2through sequestration of soil C. Enhancement of Csequestration may be achieved by adoption of bestmanagement practices such as NT and residue manage-ment. Impacts of tillage on soil organic matter (SOM)have been well documented, but results vary due tomany factors, such as soil type, cropping systems,residue management, and climate ( Reicosky et al.,1995 ). Cultivation reduces SOM and alters thedistribution and stability of aggregates ( Six et al.,1998 ). No tillage can increase soil aggregation and Cand N storage, and improve soil physical, chemical, andbiological properties ( Paustian et al., 1997; Hendrixet al., 1998 ).

All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.still.2004.09.017have been observed in surface soils, near the rootingzone and crop residues ( Dick, 1983; Franzluebbers etal., 1994a, 1995b; Potter et al., 1998; Bossuyt et al.,2002 ). The greatest increases in SOM are often observedin highly intensive cropping systems, where multiplecrops are grown annually ( Wood et al., 1991;Franzluebbers et al., 1994a, 1995b; Ortega et al., 2002 ).Types of crop residues play important roles in Csequestration and soil aggregation, possibly due to C/N ratio or other qualities of residues ( Lynch andBragg, 1985; Franzluebbers et al., 1995a ;Potter et al.,1998 ). The initial rate of degradation of crop residuesis often governed by C/N ratio ( Oades, 1988; Ghideyand Alberts, 1993; Chesire and Chapman, 1996 ), butas residues undergo decomposition, they become morerecalcitrant and degradation becomes controlled bythe lignin content or lignin/N ratio ( Melillo et al.,1982; Tian et al., 1992 ). Thus, the ability of soils tosequester C is also closely linked to N cycling.Impacts of tillage on distribution of SOM amongaggregate-size fractions are not widely reported,especially in the southern USA. No tillage maypromote soil aggregation through enhanced binding ofsoil particles as a result of increased SOM content(Paustian et al., 2000; Six et al., 2000 ). Macroag-gregates often form around particles of undecomposedSOM, thus, providing protection from mineralization(Gupta and Germida, 1988; Gregorich et al., 1989; Sixet al., 2000 ). Macroaggregates also form frommicroaggregates because of effects of binding agents,such as polysaccharides and fungal hyphae ( Tisdalland Oades, 1982; Beare et al., 1997 ). Microaggregatesare more stable than macroaggregates, and tillagesubsequently disrupts large aggregates more thansmaller aggregates, making SOM more susceptible tomineralization ( Cambardella and Elliott, 1993; Six etal., 1998 ). Since CT often increases the proportion ofmicroaggregates to macroaggregates ( Six et al., 2000 ),there may be less crop-derived SOM in CT than NTsoils ( Six et al., 1999 ). Thus, SOC and SONsequestration may be enhanced by increasing theproportion of macroaggregates in soil through theutilization of reduced tillage. Speciﬁc objectives ofthis study were to determine the impacts of tillage andwheat cropping sequences on SOC and SONsequestration and distribution within aggregate-sizefractions 20 years after adoption of NT and residuemanagement in a southcentral Texas soil.2. Materials and methods2.1. Site descriptionA long-term ﬁeld experiment was initiated in 1982on the Brazos River ﬂoodplain in southcentral Texas(308320N, 96 8260W). Long-term average annual rain-fall is approximately 980 mm, and average annualtemperature is 20 8C. The soil used was a Weswoodsilty clay loam (ﬁne-silty, mixed, superactive, thermicUdiﬂuventic Haplustepts) with pH 8, having 115 gsand kg/C01, 452 g silt kg/C01, 310 g clay kg/C01, and 94 gCaCO 3kg/C01. Three cropping sequences were estab-lished under both CT and NT. Cropping sequencesincluded a grain sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.)Moench]/wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)/soybean [ Gly-cine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (SWS), a wheat/soybeandoublecrop (WS), and a continuous wheat mono-culture (CW). For CT under wheat, soil was diskedthree to four times after harvest. Conventional tillagein sorghum and soybean consisted of disking to adepth of 10–15 cm after harvest, followed by chiselingto 25 cm, a second disking, and ridging prior to winter.Conventional tillage sorghum and soybean alsoreceived one to three in-season cultivations annually.Sorghum stalks were shredded for both CT and NTtreatments. Under NT, no soil disturbance occurredexcept for banded fertilizer application and planting.For CW and WS, wheat was planted in 0.18 m widerows in November and harvested in May, followed bythe soybean crop for WS. Soybean was planted in 1 mwide rows in early June and harvested in October. Forthe SWS rotation, sorghum was planted in 1 m widerows in March and harvested in August, followed bywheat in winter, then soybean the following summer.The rotation resulted in three crops every 2 years.Wheat received 68 kg N ha/C01as NH 4NO 3, with halfsurface broadcast applied shortly after emergence, andhalf in late February. Nitrogen was subsurface appliedpreplant at 90 kg N ha/C01for sorghum. Soybeanreceived 34 kg P 2O5ha/C01banded preplant with noadded N. Field plots measured 4 m wide by 12.2 mlong and treatments were replicated four times.2.2. Soil samplingSoil samples were taken in May 2002 after wheatharvest from SWS, WS, and CW sequences. Soil coresA.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 68were taken to a depth of 20 cm with a 2.5 cm diameterprobe, with 25 cores being taken per plot. The top 15 cmwere sectioned into 0–5 and 5–15 cm depth intervals.Samples from respective depths in each plot were thencombined, dried at 50 8C for 7 d, and passed through a4.75 mm sieve. Additional triplicate samples weretaken using an 8 cm sampler for measurement of bulkdensity ( Blake and Hartge, 1986 ).2.3. Soil analysesFractionation of soil aggregates was achieved usinga wet-sieving procedure ( Elliott and Cambardella,1991; Cambardella and Elliott, 1994 ). Approximately,90 g soil samples were capillary-wetted to ﬁeldcapacity to prevent slaking following immersion.Wetted soil was immersed in water on a nest of sieves(2 mm, 250 mm, 53 mm) and shaken vertically 3 cmfor 50 times during a 2 min period. Soil aggregatesretained on sieves were then backwashed into pre-weighed containers, oven dried at 50 8C for 2–3 d, andweighed. Material that passed through the 53- mmsieve was not collected, but contents of this fractionwere determined by calculation of the differencebetween whole soil and the sum of the three aggregate-size fractions ( >2 mm, 250 mm to 2 mm, 53–250mm). Aggregate-size fractions included macro-aggregates ( >2 mm), small macroaggregates (250 mmto 2 mm), microaggregates (53–250 mm), and silt +clay associated particles ( <53mm). Subsamples fromaggregate-size fractions were ground past a 0.5-mmsieve and analyzed for SOC and SON. Whole soilsamples that did not undergo aggregate-size fractiona-tion were also analyzed for SOC and SON.Soil organic carbon was determined using amodiﬁed Mebius method ( Nelson and Sommers,1982 ). Brieﬂy, 0.5 g soil was digested with 5 ml of1.0 N K2Cr2O7and 10 ml of H 2SO4at 150 8C for30 min, followed by titration of digests with standar-dized FeSO4. Soil organic N was quantiﬁed using aKjeldahl digestion procedure ( Gallaher et al., 1976 ),with NH 4–N analyzed colorimetrically ( TechniconIndustrial Systems, 1977 ).2.4. Statistical analysesThe experimental design was a split-split plotwithin a randomized complete block. Tillage treat-ment served as the main plot, cropping sequence wasthe split plot, and N application rate was the split-splitplot, although only one N rate was tested in this study.Data were analyzed using JMP Software ( SASInstitute Inc., 1995 ). Analysis of variance (ANOVA)was performed for individual treatment comparisonsatP<0.05 with separation of means by the leastsigniﬁcant difference (LSD). The determination ofdifferences between aggregate-size fractions wasperformed using a three-way ANOVA with factorsbeing cropping sequence, tillage regime, and aggre-gate-size fractions.3. Results3.1. Bulk densityBulk density was not impacted by tillage regimeat either 0–5 or 5–15 cm. Bulk density increasedwith depth, averaging 1.42 g cm/C03at 0–5 cm and1.67 g cm/C03at 5–15 cm. Bulk density was signiﬁ-cantly affected by cropping sequences at both soildepths. At 0–5 cm, the bulk density of CW(1.46 g cm/C03) was signiﬁcantly higher than SWS(1.27 g cm/C03) under NT. Under CT, the bulk density ofA.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 69Fig. 1. Soil organic C (SOC) and organic N (SON) concentrations at0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depths. CT and NT refer to conventional andno tillage. SWS, WS, and CW denote sorghum/wheat/soybean,wheat/soybean, and continuous wheat sequences, respectively. Errorbars represent the standard error of the mean.CW (1.64 g cm/C03) was higher than both SWS and WS(1.26 and 1.42 g cm/C03, respectively). At 5–15 cmunder CT, bulk density was signiﬁcantly higher forCW (1.77 g cm/C03) than for SWS (1.59 g cm/C03) andWS (1.65 g cm/C03).3.2. SOC and SON concentrations of whole soilNo tillage signiﬁcantly increased SOC and SONconcentrations for all cropping sequences at 0–5 cm,but no impacts of tillage or cropping sequences wereobserved at 5–15 cm ( Fig. 1 ). At 0–5 cm, nodifferences among cropping sequences were observedunder CT, but CW had the lowest SOC and SONconcentrations under NT. Both SOC and SONconcentrations were signiﬁcantly higher at 0–5 cmthan 5–15 cm for all cropping sequences.3.3. Aggregate-size distributionAggregate-size distribution was generally notimpacted by tillage regime at either soil depth.Only in the >2 mm fraction at 0–5 cm and in the250mm to 2 mm fraction at 5–15 cm was theproportion of whole soil greater under NT than CT(Fig. 2 ). The two largest aggregate-size fractionsrepresented the greatest proportions of whole soil atboth 0–5 and 5–15 cm. Few differences betweencropping sequences were observed at 0–5 cm. At5–15 cm, SWS had a greater proportion of soil in theA.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 70Fig. 2.

SOC and SON concentrations of aggregate-sizefractionsSoil organic C concentrations for all croppingsequences and for all aggregate-size fractions, exceptthe<53mm fraction, were signiﬁcantly higher underNT than CT at 0–5 cm ( Fig. 3 ). At 0–5 cm, averagedacross cropping sequences, the highest SOC concen-trations under CT were observed in the <53mmfraction and the lowest concentrations in the >2m mfraction. Under NT, the highest SOC concentrationswere observed in the 250 mm to 2 mm fraction. At5–15 cm, few differences in SOC concentrations wereobserved between cropping sequences or tillagetreatments. Likewise, SOC concentrations weresimilar among aggregate-size fractions at this lowerdepth.At 0–5 cm, NT signiﬁcantly increased SONconcentrations for all cropping sequences and forall aggregate-size fractions, except for WS in the>2 mm fraction and CW in the 250 mmt o2 m mfraction ( Fig. 4 ). Few signiﬁcant differences betweencropping sequences were observed at 0–5 cm. At 0–5 cm, the highest SON concentrations were observedin the<53mm fraction under NT, and at 5–15 cm, thehighest concentrations were observed in the <53mmfraction under both CT and NT. At 5–15 cm, fewimpacts of tillage on SON concentrations wereobserved, but SWS had the highest SON in the<53mm fraction.The C/N ratio of whole soil (C/N = 10.5) was notimpacted by tillage or cropping sequences, and did notvary with depth. However, at 0–5 cm, the C/N ratio ofthe>2 mm fraction (C/N = 8.2) was signiﬁcantlylower than the average ratios of the other threeaggregate-size fractions (C/N = 11.3).3.5. SOC and SON storageNo-tillage signiﬁcantly increased SOC and SONstorage for all cropping sequences at 0–5 cm ( Fig. 5 ).A.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 71Fig. 4.

SWS, WS, and CW denote sorghum/wheat/soybean, wheat/soybean, and continuous wheat sequences, respectively. Error barsrepresent the standard error of the mean.At this depth, the lowest SOC and SON storage wasobserved for the SWS sequence under both CT andNT, while no differences were observed between WSand CW. At 0–5 cm, NT increased SOC storage by 62,41, and 47% for SWS, WS, and CW, respectively.Likewise, NT increased SON storage by 77, 57, and56%, respectively. At 5–15 cm, tillage had noinﬂuence on SOC and SON sequestration for WSand CW, but NT increased storage for the SWSsequence by an average of 15% for SOC and 19% forSON. Similar to 0–5 cm, the SWS sequence at 5–15 cm exhibited the least SOC and SON storage underCT, but under NT, no differences between croppingsequences were observed.Soil organic C storage at 0–5 cm was signiﬁcantlygreater under NT than CT for all cropping sequencesin the>2 mm and 250 mm to 2 mm fractions, but noimpacts of tillage and few differences betweencropping sequences were observed in the 53–250mm and <53mm fractions ( Fig. 6 ). At 0–5 cm,NT increased SOC storage in the >2 mm fraction by274, 208, and 152% for SWS, WS, and CW,respectively. To a lesser extent, NT increased SOCstorage in the three smaller aggregate-size fractions byan average of 39%. For the two largest aggregate-sizefractions at 0–5 cm, WS tended to have the highestSOC storage, while the SWS sequence had signiﬁ-cantly lower SOC storage than other croppingsequences. The majority of SOC storage at 0–5 cmwas observed in >2 mm and 250 mmt o2 m mfractions. At 5–15 cm, SOC storage was greater underNT than CT for all cropping sequences in the 250 mmto 2 mm fraction, and for SWS in the >2 mm fraction.In contrast to 0–5 cm, SOC storage at 5–15 cm wasgreater under CT than NT for WS and CW sequencesin the<53mm fraction and for CW in the >2m mfraction. Similar to 0–5 cm, the two largest aggregate-size fractions at 5–15 cm exhibited the greatest SOCstorage.A.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 72Fig. 6.

Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.No tillage signiﬁcantly increased SON storage at 0–5 cm for all cropping sequences in the 250 mmt o2m mand<53mm fractions, and for SWS and CW in the>2m m f r a c t i o n ( Fig. 7 ). No tillage increased SONstorage in the >2 mm aggregate-size fraction by 212, 0,and 85% for SWS, WS, and CW, respectively. No tillageincreased SON storage in the three smaller aggregate-size fractions by an average of 71%. The greatestamount of SON storage was observed in the 250 mmt o2 mm fraction. Similar to SOC, SON storage tended tobe lowest for the SWS sequence in the two largestaggregate-size fractions. However, for the two smallestaggregate-size fractions at 0–5 cm, no differences inSON storage were observed among cropping sequences.Few impacts of tillage on SOC and SON storage wereobserved at 5–15 cm. At 5–15 cm, NT increased SONstorage only for SWS in the >2 mm fraction, and forSWS and WS in the 250 mm to 2 mm fraction.4. DiscussionHigher cropping intensity often results in greaterSOC and SON sequestration ( Franzluebbers et al.,1994a, 1995b; Wright and Hons, 2004 ). At the end of 9years, SOC was only 6–10% greater for SWS and WSthan for CW under NT, and there were no observeddifferences in SOC among cropping sequences for CT(Franzluebbers et al., 1994a ). At the end of 20 years,SOC storage for SWS and WS were only 1 and 5%greater than CW under NT, while SWS had lower SOCthan other cropping sequences under CT. Both SOCand SON storage were lowest in continuous soybeanmonoculture, and highest in SWS or WS sequences(Wright and Hons, 2004 ), corresponding to lowerresidue inputs for monocultures and higher residueinputs for multiple cropping sequences ( Franzluebberset al., 1995a ). For other Texas soils, SOC contentswere greater for continuous wheat than sorghumcropping systems, even though sorghum produced upto 200% greater aboveground biomass ( Potter et al.,1998 ). This result was attributed to the lower Ncontent of wheat than sorghum residues ( Potter et al.,1998 ).In this study, the CW monoculture exhibited SOCand SON storages under both CT and NT and at bothsoil depths similar to the WS doublecrop, andoccasionally exhibited greater storages than the SWSsequence, even though estimated crop residue inputswere approximately, 741, 907, and 555 g m/C02for SWS,W S ,a n dC W ,r e s p e c t i v e l y( Franzluebbers et al., 1995a ).These results may be attributed to higher C/N ratios ofwheat residues and lower turnover rates compared tolower C/N ratios of residues from cropping sequencescontaining sorghum or soybean ( Franzluebbers et al.,1995a ;Potter et al., 1998 ). Wheat residues returned tosoil having lower N contents ( Franzluebbers et al.,1995a ), may promote N immobilization, and maysubsequently depress SOM degradation, leading to SOCand SON storages comparable to high-intensity crop-ping sequences; even though these sequences havesigniﬁcantly higher total residue inputs. Organic matterturnover, mineralizable C, and soil microbial biomasswere reportedly greater for high-intensity sequencesthan for monoculture crops ( Franzluebbers et al.,1994a,b; Salinas-Garcia et al., 1997 ). This suggeststhat greater residue inputs from high-intensitysequences were to some degree offset by enhancedorganic matter degradation. Thus, both residue quantityand quality played important roles in SOC and SONsequestration in these soils.Soil C/N ratio has been shown to be a goodpredictor of aggregate stability ( Bird et al., 2002 ).Lower C/N ratios for macroaggregate fractions thanfor smaller aggregate-size fractions were indicative ofaccumulation of recently deposited plant material inmacroaggregates. Soil aggregation and the stability ofmacroaggregates were likely affected by the C/N ratioor the quality of crop residues returned to soil, andresidue quality played important roles in regulatinglong-term SOM storage in other studies ( Lynch andBragg, 1985; Ghidey and Alberts, 1993 ).At 5–15 cm, NT generally failed to increase SOCand SON storage beyond levels of CT soils. This resultwas likely due to the return of crop residues to thislower soil depth by tillage; thus, comparable SOC andSON levels at 5–15 cm were observed regardless oftillage treatment. The physical breakdown of plantresidues returned to subsurface soils by tillagepromotes the turnover of organic materials. Thus, at5–15 cm, SOC and SON under CT, although storageswere generally equivalent to storages under NT, werelikely more labile since CT subsurface soils containedrecently deposited plant residues. This may haveimportant implications for SOC and SON sequestra-tion when soil conditions become more favorable forA.L. Wright, F.M. Hons / Soil & Tillage Research 84 (2005) 67–75 73SOM degradation, such as would occur during futuretillage operations or changes in residue management.Thus, long-term stability of SOC and SON storage at5–15 cm under CT may be dependent on the continuedreturn of plant residues by tillage.Short-term increases in SOC under NT are seldomobserved in subsurface soils. At the end of 4 years ofNT, SOC increased in the surface 0–5 cm, but not insubsurface soil ( Wood et al., 1991 ). Even with 8 yearsof NT, increases in SOC storage were only observed at0–5 cm ( Ortega et al., 2002 ). Thus, many years of NTmay be required for increases in SOC and SONstorage at lower soil depths to be observed. In a relatedstudy at the end of 9 years of NT, SOC in the top20 cm of soil was 25% higher under NT than CT(Franzluebbers et al., 1998 ). Thus, long-term NT andhigh-intensity cropping systems have potential forsigniﬁcant increases in SOC and SON storage.5. ConclusionsNo-tillage signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced SOC and SONsequestration. Soil organic C and SON storage wereincreased by NT in surface soils but seldom insubsurface soils, presumably due to the return of cropresidues to subsurface soils by tillage. No tillageincreased the proportion of macroaggregates in soil, andthe greatest storage of SOC and SON was observed inthe largest aggregate-size fractions under both CT andNT. Thus, the long-term stability of SOM in soils may bedependent on maintenance of large aggregate-sizefractions. Since macroaggregates are less stable thanmicroaggregates, the long-term stability of SOC andSON is likely dependent on the continuation of reducedtillage and residue management. Increased croppingintensity failed to increase SOC and SON sequestrationcompared to the wheat monoculture sequence, suggest-ing that residue quality, in addition to the quantity ofresidues returned to soil, has important implications forSOC and SON sequestration potential.AcknowledgmentThis research was partially funded by theConsortium for Agricultural Soils Mitigation ofGreenhouse Gases (CASMGS).ReferencesBeare, M.H., Hu, S., Coleman, D.C., Hendrix, P.F., 1997.
