Here,	we	show	substantial	changes	in	carbon	allocation	and	dynamics	of	the	subsoil	but	not	topsoil	in	the	Qinghai‐Tibetan 	alpine	grasslands	over	5	years	of	warming.	Specifically,	warming	enhanced	the	accumulation	of	newly	synthesized	(14C‐enriched)	carbon	in	the	subsoil	slow‐cycling	pool	(silt‐clay	fraction)	but	promoted	the	decomposition	 of	plant‐derived	lignin	in	the	fast‐cycling	pool	(macroaggregates). 	These	changes	mirrored	an	accumulation	of	lipids	and	sug‐ars	at	the	expense	of	lignin	in	the	warmed	bulk	subsoil,	likely	associated	with	shortened	soil	freezing	period	and	a	deepening	root	system.	As	warming	is	accompanied	by	deep‐ening	roots	in	a	wide	range	of	ecosystems,	root‐driven	accrual	of	slow‐cycling	pool	may	represent	an	important	and	overlooked	mechanism	for	a	potential	long‐term	carbon	sink	at	depth.	Moreover,	given	the	contrasting	sensitivity	of	SOC	dynamics	at	varied	depths,	warming	studies	focusing	only	on	surface	soils	may	vastly	misrepresent	shifts	in	ecosystem	carbon	storage	under	climate	change.KEYWORDSdeep	soil,	lignin	decomposition,	physical	fraction,	radiocarbon,	soil	organic	carbon,	warming4384  |    JIA et Al.1 |  INTRODUCTIONThe	response	of	soil	organic	carbon	(SOC)	cycling	to	global	warming	represents	a	critical	feedback	of	terrestrial	ecosystems	to	climate	change	(Koven,	Hugelius,	Lawrence,	&	Wieder,	2017;	Melillo	et	al.,	2017).	Until	now,	most	research	has	focused	on	topsoil	carbon	dy‐namics	(Crowther	et	al.,	2016;	Koven	et	al.,	2017).	In	contrast,	sub‐soil	(i.e.,	residing	>20	cm	below	ground)	containing	more	than	half	of	global	SOC	stocks	(Rumpel,	Chabbi,	&	Marschner,	2012)	remains	poorly	investigated	in	terms	of	its	response	to	warming.	This	knowl‐edge	gap	has	emerged	as	one	of	the	central	uncertainties	 in	our	understanding	 of	terrestrial	carbon	storage	under	climate	change	(Ahrens	&	Reichstein,	2017).Subsoil	carbon	is	conventionally	 assumed	to	be	relatively	sta‐ble	and	unresponsive	 to	air	warming	due	to	its	long	turnover	time	and	good	insulation	at	depth	(Harrison,	Footen,	&	Strahm,	2011).	However,	according	to	the	Intergovernmental 	Panel	on	Climate	Change	(IPCC),	subsoils	are	projected	to	warm	at	roughly	the	same	rate	as	surface	soils	over	the	next	century	(Hicks	Pries,	Castanha,	Porras,	&	Torn,	2017;	IPCC,	2013).	More	importantly,	emerging	evi‐dence	suggests	that	subsoils,	having	varied	organic	matter	sources,	microbial	communities,	and	substrate	availability	compared	to	the	topsoil	(Rumpel	et	al.,	2012),	may	show	even	stronger	response	to	warming‐induced 	shifts	in	microbial	activities	and	functioning	(Fontaine	et	al.,	2007)	in	association	with	altered	plant	community	structure	and	distribution	(Keuper	et	al.,	2017;	Liu	et	al.,	2018).	For	instance,	plant	roots	are	expected	to	grow	deeper	under	warming‐induced	moisture	or	nutrient	limitation	(Johnson,	Rygiewicz,	Tingey,	&	Phillips,	2006;	Liu	et	al.,	2018;	Wang	et	al.,	2017),	potentially	in‐creasing	root	inputs	(including	root	litter	and	exudates)	and	enhanc‐ing	carbon	accumulation	 in	subsoils	that	are	relatively	low	in	SOC	content	(Cotrufo	et	al.,	2015).	Alternatively,	 increased	fresh	carbon	input	and/or	changing	soil	physical	properties	may	lead	to	shifts	in	microbial	communities	(Cheng	et	al.,	2017)	and	accelerate	the	degra‐dation	of	native	SOC	(Fontaine	et	al.,	2007;	Jia	et	al.,	2017).	However,	experimental	evidence	is	lacking	to	demonstrate	how	the	above	pro‐cesses	jointly	affect	SOC	dynamics	in	the	subsoil.	Detecting	changes	in	subsoil	carbon	stock	is	particularly	difficult	given	the	long	resi‐dence	time	of	SOC	(Rumpel	et	al.,	2012)	and	counteracting	 effects	of	warming	on	various	carbon	pools	(Feng,	Simpson,	Wilson,	Williams,	&	Simpson,	2008).	Hence,	in‐depth	investigations	 into	SOC	compo‐sition	and	carbon	allocation	are	essential	to	reveal	changing	SOC	dynamics	and	to	identify	SOC	pools	that	are	sensitive	to	warming.Deep	soil	carbon	dynamics	in	high‐latitude	 and	high‐altitude	ecosystems	warrant	particular	attention	under	warming	because	these	soils	store	the	vast	majority	of	the	global	SOC	pool	(Tarnocai	et	al.,	2009;	Yang	et	al.,	2008).	In	addition,	these	colder	regions	are	experiencing	 a	higher‐than‐average	 warming	trend	in	recent	years	(Chen	et	al.,	2013).	On	the	world's	highest	and	largest	plateau,	Qinghai‐Tibetan	 Plateau	(QTP),	a	natural	warming	trend	in	the	past	decade	has	led	to	a	significant	increase	of	SOC	in	the	subsurface	soil	(10–30	cm)	while	showing	no	effect	on	the	topmost	soil	(0–10	cm)	in	the	alpine	grasslands	(Ding	et	al.,	2017).	These	results	stand	in	contrast	with	previous	views	that	warming	may	induce	large	carbon	losses	from	soils	with	a	high	SOC	content	(Crowther	et	al.,	2016),	es‐pecially	in	the	high‐latitude	 and	high‐altitude	 areas.	Identifying	the	mechanisms	governing	these	divergent	responses	of	SOC	to	warm‐ing	at	different	depths	is	critical	to	minimize	uncertainty	in	future	soil	carbon	feedback	projections.Here,	we	utilize	a	manipulative 	soil	warming	experiment	in	the	QTP	alpine	grassland	(Liu	et	al.,	2018)	to	compare	warming	effects	on	the	composition	and	sourcing	of	SOC	pools	at	different	depths.	Consistent	with	field	observations	 over	QTP	alpine	grasslands	for	the	past	decades,	5	years	of	continuous	warming	increased	grasses	with	deep	roots	and	decreased	sedges	and	forbs	with	shal‐low	roots	in	our	experiment,	resulting	in	elevated	belowground 	net	primary	productivity	 (BNPP)	in	the	subsoil	(30–50	cm;	Liu	et	al.,	2018).	Compared	to	aboveground 	biomass	(59.7	g/m2),	roots	are	the	primary	carbon	inputs	to	the	QTP	grassland	soils	(330.5	g/m2; Yang,	Fang,	Ji,	&	Han,	2009).	With	an	enhanced	BNPP	in	the	sub‐soil,	we	anticipate	a	stronger	warming	impact	on	subsoil	carbon	dynamics	compared	to	the	topsoil	(0–10	cm)	in	terms	of	new	car‐bon	accrual	and	labile‐carbon‐stimulated 	degradation	of	native	SOC.	Furthermore, 	the	altered	plant	community	composition	(Liu	et	al.,	2018)	may	have	cascading	effects	on	the	quantity	and	qual‐ity	of	plant‐derived 	carbon	inputs	into	soils	and	consequently 	the	chemical	composition	of	soil	organic	matter.	To	reveal	the	detailed	mechanisms,	 we	use	radiocarbon	analysis	coupled	with	soil	frac‐tionation	to	disentangle	the	allocation	of	new	carbon	among	SOC	pools	of	varied	turnover	times.	Complementary 	molecular‐level 	analyses,	that	is,	biomarkers,	nuclear	magnetic	resonance	(NMR),	and	high‐resolution 	mass	spectrometry, 	are	further	employed	to	investigate	the	fate	and	degradation	 of	various	plant‐	and		microbial‐derived 	components	in	the	soil.	These	state‐of‐the‐art 	analyses	of	SOC	components,	complemented 	by	in	situ	monitoring	of	ecosystem	carbon	fluxes,	help	to	deliver	a	detailed	understand‐ing	of	how	soil	carbon	dynamics	respond	to	warming	in	this	alpine	grassland.2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  | Experiment design and soil samplingThe	field	warming	experiment	is	located	at	the	Haibei	Alpine	Grassland	Ecosystem	Research	Station	(101°19′E,	37°36′N,	3,215	m	a.s.l.).	The	site	has	a	continental	monsoon	climate	with	a	mean	annual	temperature	of	−1.2°C	and	a	mean	annual	precipitation	 of	489	mm.	Soils	at	the	site	are	Mat‐Gryic	Cambisol	with	a	clay	loam	texture	and	a	mean	pH	of	8.01.	The	surface	layers	of	the	soil	are	seasonally	fro‐zen	with	freezing	initiating	from	the	top	in	the	late	fall.	The	native	plant	community	is	dominated	by	Kobresia humilis ,	Carex przewalskii ,	Helictotrichon tibeticum ,	Stipa aliena,	Saussurea pulchra ,	and	 S. pul‐chra.	A	full	factorial	design	with	two	temperature	levels,	that	is,	con‐trol	and	year‐round	warming	(W1;	warmed	by	1.5–1.7°C),	and	three	precipitation	levels	(ambient,	+50%	precipitation,	and	−50%	precipi‐tation)	were	set	up	in	July	2011	(details	in	Figure	S1).	Each	treatment	    |  4385JIA et Al.had	six	randomly	distributed	plots	(1.8	m	×	2.2	m	each)	on	a	homoge‐neous	landscape.	As	warming	rates	are	reported	to	be	significantly	higher	in	winter	than	the	other	seasons	on	the	QTP	(Chen	et	al.,	2013),	the	experiment	was	expanded	to	include	a	winter	warming	(W2)	treatment	in	January	2012.	On	an	annual	average	basis,	sur‐face	soil	temperature	in	the	W2	treatment	increased	by	the	same	magnitude	as	that	in	the	W1	plots,	but	with	varied	scenarios	of	sea‐sonality	(W2	increased	by	~3°C	during	late‐October	 to	late‐April	and	by	0.5–1°C	for	the	rest	of	the	year).	Warming	plots	were	heated	by	infrared	heaters	installed	1.6	m	above	ground	while	dummy	heaters	were	installed	above	the	control	plots.	Heating	started	immediately	after	installation	and	soil	temperature	was	monitored	continuously	at	the	depths	of	5,	10,	and	20	cm.Three	soil	cores	(diameter	of	3	cm,	depth	of	70	cm)	were	randomly	collected	from	each	plot	of	the	control	and	W1	treatments	in	July	2011	(before	warming)	and	from	all	control,	W1	and	W2	plots	in	the	August	of	both	2013	and	2015	(after	3	and	5	years	of	W1	warm‐ing,	respectively). 	Soils	were	separated	into	various	depths	and	those	from	the	same	plot	and	same	depth	were	homogenized	 in	situ.	For	this	study,	we	selected	the	topsoil	(0–10	cm)	and	subsoil	(30–50	cm	for	2011;	30–40	cm	for	2013	and	2015)	from	four	plots	of	each	tem ‐perature	treatments	(i.e.,	n	=	4).	A	fraction	of	fresh	soils	was	stored	at	−80°C	immediately	after	sampling	for	glycerol	dialkyl	glycerol	tet‐raether	(GDGT)	analysis.	The	rest	was	passed	through	2	mm	sieves	and	freeze‐dried	immediately	with	stones	and	visible	roots	removed.Assuming	that	the	warming	treatments	did	not	change	the	chemical	composition	of	dominant	species	during	our	experimental	period,	we	took	four	additional	soil	cores	(40	cm	in	depth)	from	adja‐cent	areas	outside	the	control	plots	in	August	2015	to	analyze	lignin	phenols	in	plant	roots.	Root	materials	were	picked	out	from	the	en‐tire	soil	cores,	immediately	washed	under	water	and	grouped	into	six	species,	namely	grasses	(H. tibeticum  and S.  aliena),	sedges	(K. humilis  and C. przewalskii),	and	forbs	(S. pulchra  and S.  pulchra),	which	totally	contributed	to	~56%	of	aboveground	 net	primary	productivity	at	the	site.	All	plant	materials	were	kept	at	−20°C,	freeze‐dried,	and	ground	into	fine	powder	before	analysis.2.2 | Ecosystem CO2 exchange measurementTo	complement	our	SOC	measurement 	related	to	warming	effect	on	soil	carbon	stock	changes,	growing‐season	 net	ecosystem	CO2 exchange	(NEE)	and	ecosystem	respiration	(Reco)	were	measured	with	a	transparent	chamber	(40	cm	×	40	cm	×	60	cm)	attached	to	an	infrared	gas	analyzer	(LI‐6400;	LiCor)	during	2013	and	2015.	We	measured	NEE	and	 Reco	2	days	per	month	from	May	to	October	on	sunny	days	during	9:00–11:00	(local	time)	for	all	treatments.	For	each	measurement, 	six	consecutive	recordings	of	CO2	and	water	vapor	concentrations	 were	taken	at	10	s	intervals	over	a	period	of	60	s	with	a	small	fan	running	continuously	 inside	the	chamber	dur‐ing	NEE	measurement. 	The	flux	rate	of	CO2	was	calculated	based	on	the	slope	of	the	linear	regression	for	the	six	concentration	 records	in	the	time	series.	 Reco	was	measured	immediately	after	NEE	meas‐urement	using	a	shade	cloth	to	cover	the	transparent	chamber.	To	calculate	daily	NEE,	diurnal	patterns	of	NEE	at	2	hr	intervals	(over	24	hr)	were	monitored	and	a	calibration	coefficient	of	0.17	(ratios	of	daily	average	values	based	on	diurnal	patterns	to	values	meas‐ured	during	9:00–11:00)	was	used.	The	calibrated	daily	values	were	then	used	to	estimate	growing‐season	 NEE.	Gross	ecosystem	pro‐ductivity	(GEP)	was	calculated	as	the	difference	between	NEE	and	Reco.	Positive	and	negative	values	of	NEE	indicate	CO2	release	and	fixation,	respectively.	During	the	non‐growing	season	(late‐October	to	late‐April),	diurnal	changes	in	Reco	were	small	(Kato	et	al.,	2006;	Wang	et	al.,	2014)	and	respiration	of	non‐growing	season	was	meas‐ured	once	a	month	using	the	LI‐8100	Automated	Soil	CO2	Flux	System	with	LI‐8100‐103	short‐term	chamber	(Li‐Cor	Inc.).	 Reco	rep‐resents	NEE	during	the	non‐growing	 season	due	to	the	absence	of	photosynthesis.2.3 | Soil size fractionation and radiocarbon analysisSoils	were	fractionated	using	a	method	modified	from	Wilson,	Rice,	Rillig,	Springer,	and	Hartnett	(2009)	to	examine	the	allocation	of	new	carbon	and	biomarkers	among	macroaggregates 	(>250	µm),	microag‐gregates	(250–63	µm),	and	silt‐clay	fractions	(<63	µm;	details	in	Text	S1.1).	The	organic	carbon	(OC)	and	14C	contents	of	all	size	fractions	and	bulk	soil	were	measured	after	removal	of	inorganic	carbon	(Text	S1.1).	Radiocarbon	 contents	were	reported	as	∆14C	(‰)	with	field	replicates	(n	=	4).	As	the	subsoil	showed	varying	Δ14C	values	among	fractions	(see	Section	3.3),	we	further	estimated	the	turnover	time	of	subsoil	(but	not	topsoil)	OC	fractions.	Soil	fractions	were	assumed	to	be	in	a	steady	state	over	the	modeled	period	(~1	×	104	years)	and	their	turnover	time	was	estimated	based	on	∆14C	accounting	for	both	radioactive	decay	and	incorporation	 of	the	bomb‐derived	14C	produced	in	the	1950s	and	1960s	(Torn,	Swanston,	Castanha,	&	Trumbore,	2009).2.4 | Biomarker analysesA	range	of	biomarkers	(Table	S1)	was	selected	to	examine	changes	in	the	source	and	degradation	of	SOC	components	that	represent	major	plant	and	microbial	contributions. 	Freeze‐dried	bulk	soils	(<2	mm)	collected	before	(2011)	and	after	warming	(2013	and	2015)	as	well	as	soil	size	fractions	in	2015	were	first	solvent	extracted	to	remove	extractable	lipids	and	then	sequentially	subject	to	base	hy‐drolysis	and	copper	oxidation	to	isolate	hydrolysable	lipids	(including	suberin	and	microbial‐derived 	lipids)	and	lignin	phenols,	respectively	(Otto	&	Simpson,	2007).	Root	materials	of	the	six	plant	species	were	also	analyzed	for	lignin	phenols.	Bulk	soils	collected	from	2015	(but	not	size	fractions	due	to	limited	availability)	were	further	analyzed	for	non‐cellulosic	 sugars	(hereafter	referred	to	as	“sugars”;	Eder,	Spielvogel,	Kӧlbl,	Albert,	&	Kӧgel‐Knabner,	 2010)	and	core	GDGTs	(Tierney,	Schouten,	Pitcher,	Hopmans,	&	Sinninghe	Damsté,	2012).	The	macroaggregates	 and	silt‐clay	fractions	of	the	subsoils	in	2015	were	solvent‐extracted 	using	dichloromethane 	and	methanol	to	iso‐late	core	GDGTs	for	comparison	with	the	bulk	soil.	Details	regarding	extraction	procedures	can	be	found	in	Text	S1.2.4386  |    JIA et Al.Biomarkers	of	interest	were	quantified	after	derivatization	 on	a	Trace	1310	gas	chromatograph 	coupled	to	an	ISQ	mass	spectrom‐eter	(MS;	Thermo	Fisher	Scientific)	or	an	Agilent	1200	liquid	chro‐matograph	and	triple	quadrupole	MS	using	internal	standards	(Text	S1.2).	To	better	illustrate	warming‐induced	 changes	to	biomarker	concentrations 	after	removing	inter‐annual	variabilities,	relative	changes	of	major	molecular	components	were	calculated	as	the	con‐centration	offset	between	warming	(W1	and	W2)	and	control	plots	relative	to	the	concentration	 in	the	control	plots	of	the	respective	sampling	year	and	expressed	as	percentages.Other	than	lignin	phenols,	hydroxy	phenols,	potentially	derived	from	proteins,	tannins,	and/or	lignin	degradation	products	in	the	soil	(Zaccone,	Said‐Pullicino,	 Gigliotti,	&	Miano,	2008),	were	also	detected	in	substantial	amounts	in	the	roots	of	dominant	plant	spe‐cies	at	the	Haibei	Station	(Figure	S2).	In	particular,	sedges	(including	K. humilis  and C.  przewalskii)	with	shallow	roots	(<25	cm,	with	95%	of	the	root	biomass	distributed	in	the	upper	10	cm)	were	most	concen‐trated	with	hydroxy	phenols	while	grasses	(including	 S. aliena  and H. tibeticum)	with	the	deepest	roots	(down	to	85	cm;	Liu	et	al.,	2018)	were	most	enriched	with	lignin	phenols	in	the	root	mass.	Given	the	high	volume	of	root	mass,	both	hydroxy	and	lignin	phenols	are	there‐fore	considered	to	mainly	derive	from	plants	at	our	site.2.5 | Molecular characterization of bulk organic matterTo	further	characterize	warming‐induced 	changes	in	organic	mat‐ter	composition	 in	the	subsoil,	water‐extractable	 organic	matter	(WEOM)	and	bulk	soil	were	examined	by	Fourier	transform‐ion 	cyclotron	resonance	mass	spectrometry 	(FT‐ICR	MS)	and	NMR,	re‐spectively.	Briefly,	WEOM	was	extracted	from	freeze‐dried,	 mixed	subsoils	using	diluted	HCl	(0.1	M),	and	concentrated 	by	solid‐phase	extraction	with	commercially	 available	Bond	Elut	cartridges	with	styrene	divinyl	benzene	polymer	(PPL,	Agilent;	Text	S1.3).	FT‐ICR	MS	analysis	was	performed	on	a	solariX	FT‐ICR	MS	(Bruker	Daltonic	GmBH)	equipped	with	an	electrospray	 source	and	a	15	Tesla	magnet	at	Oldenburg	University	(Text	S1.3).	Identified	com‐pounds	were	aligned	according	to	their	aromaticity	index	(AImod),	ratios	of	oxygen‐to‐carbon	 and	hydrogen‐to‐carbon	 in	their	for‐mula	(Koch	&	Dittmar,	2006)	and	divided	into	five	groups:	(a)	polycyclic	aromatics,	(b)	polyphenols,	 (c)	highly	unsaturated	com‐pounds,	includes	lignin	degradation	products,	(d)	unsaturated	ali‐phatics	and	peptides,	and	(e)	saturated	compounds,	including	lipids	and	carbohydrates.The	HCl‐extracted	 soil	residues	were	further	treated	with	hydro‐fluoric	acid	(10%)	15	times	to	remove	paramagnetic	 materials	and	to	concentrate	SOC.	The	treated	residue	was	rinsed	repeatedly	with	deionized	water,	freeze‐dried,	and	ground	into	fine	powder	for	solid‐state	13C	NMR	analysis.	The	13C	Cross	Polarization/Magic	 Angle	Spinning	NMR	spectra	were	acquired	on	a	Bruker	BioSpin	Avance	III	500	MHz	NMR	spectrometer	 with	a	4	mm	probe	using	spin	rate	of	13	kHz,	contact	time	of	1	ms,	recycle	delay	of	1	s,	acquisition	time	of	0.0135	s,	line	broadening	of	75	Hz,	and	with	2,048	time	domain	points.	Structures	were	represented	by	alkyl	(0–45	ppm),	 O‐alkyl	(45–110	ppm),	aromatic	and	phenolic	(110–165	ppm),	and	carboxylic	and	carbonyl	(165–215	ppm)	carbon.	Alkyl/O‐alkyl	 ratios,	increasing	with	increasing	degradation,	were	calculated	by	dividing	the	areas	of	the	alkyl	and	the	O‐alkyl	regions	of	the	spectra	(Simpson,	Otto,	&	Feng,	2008).2.6 | Statistical analysisAll	statistical	analyses	were	performed	using	SPSS	18.0	(SPSS).	Homogeneity	 of	variances	and	normal	distribution	of	the	data	were	tested	before	applying	parametric	methods	and	log	trans‐formation	was	performed	where	necessary.	Nonparametric 	tests	were	conducted	if	normal	distribution	of	the	transformed	 data	or	homogeneity	 of	variances	was	not	achieved.	The	 t	test	was	used	to	examine	differences	in	the	concentrations	 of	SOC	and	biomarkers	as	well	as	acid‐to‐aldehyde	 (Ad/Al)	ratios	between	control	and	W1	plots	before	warming.	One‐way	ANOVA	was	performed	to	test	the	effects	of	warming	on	the	 Reco,	GEP,	NEE,	SOC	contents,	biomarker	concentrations,	 and	ratios	in	the	bulk	soil	and	size	fractions.	Two‐way	ANOVA	was	used	to	examine	the	main	and	interactive	effects	of	warming	and	soil	size	frac‐tions	on	SOC	content,	 Δ14C,	and	biomarker	concentrations 	in	2015.	Differences	were	considered	to	be	significant	at	the	level	of	p	<	.05.	Principal	component	analysis	(PCA)	was	performed	for	biomarkers	in	soils	of	2015	using	CANOCO	4.5.	Min–max	nor‐malization	of	original	data	into	the	range	of	[0,	1]	was	conducted	before	PCA	analysis.3 |  RESULTS3.1  | Warming effects on ecosystem carbon fluxes and soil bulk propertiesCompared	with	the	control,	both	W1	and	W2	treatments	significantly	increased	soil	temperature	at	the	depths	of	5,	10,	and	20	cm	across	2013	and	2015	(p	<	.05,	Figure	S3a–c).	Soil	temperature	at	the	depth	of	30–40	cm	was	not	monitored	but	estimated	based	on	GDGTs	(Weijers,	Schouten,	van	den	Donker,	Hopmans,	&	Sinninghe	Damsté,	2007),	which	showed	an	increasing	trend	(0.26	±	0.08,	0.48	±	0.21,	and	0.69	±	0.14°C	for	control,	W1,	and	W2,	respectively;	details	are	given	in	the	Supporting	Information).	 Warming	increased	the	length	of	thawing	period,	decreased	soil	freezing	depth	(38.3,	35.4,	and	32.6	cm	for	control,	W1,	and	W2,	respectively)	and	the	duration	of	freezing	period	(Lin,	Wang,	Zhang,	&	He,	2017).	Soil	moisture	de‐creased	at	the	depths	of	5,	10,	and	20	cm	under	W1	and	at	5	cm	under	W2	compared	with	the	control	in	both	years	( p	<	.05;	Figure	S3d–f).Ecosystem	carbon	fluxes	were	monitored	in	2013	and	2015,	exhibiting	slight	inter‐annual	variabilities	(Figure	1a)	and	yielding	similar	results	(i.e.,	NEE	and	Reco)	in	the	control	treatments	to	those	measured	by	eddy	covariance	techniques	(Kato	et	al.,	2006)	or	au‐tomated	continuous	measurement 	in	the	same	grassland	nearby	(Wang	et	al.,	2014).	Compared	to	the	control,	GEP	did	not	change	    |  4387JIA et Al.under	warming	in	the	growing	season	(late‐April	to	late‐October)	 of	2013	but	increased	in	W1	and	not	W2	in	2015	(p	<	.05).	 Reco in‐creased	in	both	W2	and	W1,	relative	to	the	control	during	the	grow‐ing	season	of	2013	and	2015,	respectively	(p	<	.05).	Respiration	rates	also	increased	under	warming	(except	W1	in	2015)	during	the	non‐growing	season	of	both	years	(p	<	.05).	As	a	result,	NEE	was	slightly	less	negative	in	W2	than	the	control	in	2013,	indicating	increased	carbon	release	(instead	of	fixation)	under	W2,	while	NEE	was	similar	across	all	treatments	in	2015.	Overall,	the	above	results	suggest	that	warming	had	minimal	impacts	on	carbon	fluxes	of	these	alpine	grass‐lands	during	the	study	period.Changes	in	NEE	were	too	small	to	be	detected	in	the	SOC	stocks	in	that	SOC	contents	remained	similar	among	all	treatments	at	both	depths	before	(for	W1	and	control	in	2011)	and	after	warming	(in	2013 and 2015; p	 >	.05;	Figure	1b).	As	W2	was	established	1	year	later,	initial	soils	were	not	collected	for	comparison.	However,	given	the	homogeneous	 landscape	and	vegetation	coverage	at	the	study	site,	we	assume	similar	SOC	contents	for	the	control	and	W2	plots	before	warming	as	well.	The	 Δ14C	values	of	SOC,	being	more	de‐pleted	in	the	subsoil	(−224	±	17‰;	mean	±	SEM ; n	=	4)	than	topsoil	(77	±	14‰)	during	2015,	showed	no	difference	among	treatments,	either	( p	>	.05;	Figure	1c).3.2 | Changing dynamics of major SOC molecular components under warmingDespite	unaltered	bulk	SOC	properties,	considerable 	changes	were	observed	in	major	plant‐	and	microbial‐derived 	molecu‐lar	components.	 Importantly,	 these	effects	were	detected	in	the	subsoil	only,	with	no	changes	in	the	topsoil.	Specifically,	biomarkers	of	various	origins	had	comparable	abundances	in	the	control	and	W1	plots	at	both	depths	at	the	start	of	the	experiment	(p	>	.05;	Figure	2).	Neither	warming	treatment	af‐fected	biomarker	abundances	 in	the	topsoil	in	2013	or	2015	(p	>	.05).	However,	subsoils	in	both	W1	and	W2	plots	displayed	a	decrease	of	plant‐derived 	phenols	(Figure	2a)	relative	to	the	control	in	2013	and	2015	(p	<	.05)	despite	enhanced	growth	of	deep	grass	roots	(Liu	et	al.,	2018)	that	are	relatively	abundant	in	lignin	(Figure	S2).	In	contrast,	microbial‐derived 	hydrolysable 	lipids	(referred	to	as	“microbial	lipids”	hereafter)	and	sugars	of	both	microbial	and	plant	origins	increased	in	the	W1	plots	in	2015	(p	<	.05).	The	latter	two	groups	of	biomarkers	also	showed	an	increasing	trend	relative	to	the	control	in	the	W2	subsoils	in	2015,	but	the	difference	was	not	statistically	significant,	prob‐ably	due	to	large	spatial	heterogeneity	 that	obscured	these	ef‐fects.	GDGTs	derived	from	archaeal	and	bacterial	membrane	lipids	also	increased	in	the	W2	subsoils	in	2015	(p	<	.05).	By	comparison,	root‐derived	suberin	lipids	remained	similar	among	treatments	( p	>	.05).Changes	in	the	entire	SOC	molecular	profile	were	identified	using	PCA	of	biomarkers	in	the	warmed	and	control	soils,	which	ex‐plained	78.2%	and	73.7%	of	variance	in	the	top‐	and	subsoil	of	2015,	respectively	(Figure	3).	While	the	topsoil	samples	did	not	cluster	ac‐cording	to	treatments,	subsoils	from	both	warming	treatments	were	separated	from	those	under	control	with	phenols	weighing	in	the	opposite	direction	of	sugars	and	GDGTs	on	the	 x‐axis	and	microbial	lipids	and	suberin	weighing	on	the	y‐axis.	These	results	collectively	suggest	an	accumulation	 of	lipid	and	sugar	components	derived	from	both	plants	and	microbes	at	the	expense	of	lignin	in	the	warmed	subsoil.Enhanced	lignin	degradation	 in	the	warmed	subsoil	was	fur‐ther	evidenced	by	the	Ad/Al	ratios	of	vanillyl	(V)	and	syringyl	(S)	phenols,	which	typically	increase	with	elevated	degradation	(Otto	&	Simpson,	2006).	Before	the	warming	treatment	initiated	in	2011,	both	ratios	were	higher	in	the	top‐	than	subsoils	(p	<	.05;	Figure	S4a),	but	became	similar	between	depths	in	2015	(p	>	.05;	Figure	S4b),	indicating	convergence	 of	lignin	oxidation	state	be‐tween	depths	under	warming.	Moreover,	in	contrast	to	the	com‐mon	observation	of	increasing	Ad/Al	ratios	with	soil	depths	(Otto	&	Simpson,	2006),	the	lower	(Ad/Al)S	ratio	in	the	subsoil	at	this	site	indicated	a	relatively	low	oxidation	stage	of	lignin	likely	due	to	substrate	and/or	temperature	limitations	at	depth.	By	compar‐ison,	the	higher	(Ad/Al)V	ratio	in	the	top,	relative	to	subsoils	of	2011,	can	also	be	partly	attributed	to	the	influence	of	the	shal‐low‐rooted,	dominant	vegetation	(K. humilis)	with	a	very	high	(Ad/Al)V	ratio	in	its	roots	(Figure	S2d).FIGURE 1 Changes	in	ecosystem	carbon	fluxes	(a),	soil	organic	carbon	content	(SOC,	b),	and	∆14C	of	SOC	(c)	under	warming.

In	the	control	subsoil,	the	macroaggregates	 and	silt‐clay	fractions	had	a	turnover	time	of	~1,500	and	~3,100	years,	respectively,	 confirming	the	slow‐cycling	nature	of	OC	associated	with	fine	particles.	Warming	did	not	change	the	mass	proportion	of	size	fractions	at	either	depth	(p	>	.05;	Figure	S5a).	The	OC	and	14C	contents	did	not	change	for	any	topsoil	fraction	under	warming,	either.	However,	warming	had	significant	effects	on	the	subsoil	silt‐clay	fraction	by	increasing	the	OC	content	of	W2	(by	~56%)	and	in‐creasing	the	Δ14C	values	of	W1	relative	to	the	control	(p	<	.05).	The	silt‐clay	fraction	of	W2	subsoils	also	showed	an	increasing	trend	in Δ14C,	but	the	change	was	not	significant	due	to	a	high	spatial	heterogeneity 	(p	>	.05).	These	results	suggest	an	accumulation 	of	recently	synthesized	carbon	in	the	fine	fraction	of	subsoils	under	warming.	Warming	did	not	produce	interactive	effects	with	fraction	size	on	the	mass	proportion,	OC,	or	14C	contents	of	soil	fractions	at	either	depth	( p	>	.05).Phenols	and	lipids	were	further	examined	in	various	soil	fractions	to	explain	their	changes	in	the	bulk	soil	(Figure	4;	Figures	S5	and	S6).	In	the	topsoil,	neither	concentrations	 nor	proportions	of	biomarkers	were	affected	by	warming	in	any	fraction.	By	contrast,	suberin	con‐centrations	increased	in	the	W2	relative	to	control	and	W1	subsoils	with	all	fractions	considered	(p	=	.00)	while	GDGT	concentrations	decreased	in	the	silt‐clay	fraction	of	W2	than	control	and	W1	sub‐soils	(p	<	.05).	Warming	decreased	phenols	in	the	subsoil	macroag‐gregates,	with	significantly	lower	values	in	the	W2	than	control	plots	(p	<	.05).	As	a	result,	warming	decreased	the	percentage	of	phenols	in	the	macroaggregates 	of	W2	subsoils	compared	with	control	(p	<	.05)	without	affecting	the	allocation	of	other	biomarkers	(Figure	S6).Lignin	Ad/Al	ratios	did	not	differ	among	soil	size	fractions	or	warming	treatment	in	the	topsoil	in	2015	(p	>	.05;	Figure	S7).	However,	macroaggregates	 had	lower	(Ad/Al)S	ratios	relative	to	other	soil	fractions	in	the	control	subsoils	(p	<	.05).	Moreover,	the	W1	treatment	increased	the	(Ad/Al)S	ratio	in	the	macroaggregates	but	decreased	the	(Ad/Al)V	ratio	in	the	silt‐clay	fraction	of	subsoils	FIGURE 2 Warming	effects	on	the	concentration	of	major	soil	molecular	components.

A	similar	albeit	nonsignificant 	pattern	was	observed	for	the	W2	subsoil,	indicating	increased	lignin	oxida‐tion	in	the	macroaggregates	 and	a	decreased	oxidation	stage	in	the	fine	fraction	of	subsoils	likely	due	to	fresh	lignin	inputs.3.4 | Composition of bulk organic matter in the subsoilWarming‐induced 	changes	to	bulk	organic	matter	composition	were	further	investigated	for	the	subsoil	in	2015.	Unsaturated	aliphat‐ics	and	peptides	(e.g.,	proteins)	were	more	abundant	in	the	WEOM	from	both	warmed	subsoils	(especially	in	W1)	relative	to	the	control	(Figure	5).	Meanwhile,	polycyclic	aromatics,	polyphenols,	and	highly	unsaturated	compounds	were	less	abundant	(especially	in	W2),	sug‐gesting	a	decrease	of	soluble	aromatic	compounds	(including	tannins	and	lignin	degradation	products)	under	warming.	These	results	are	consistent	with	the	decrease	of	phenolic	biomarkers	and	increase	of	lipids	in	the	bulk	subsoil.	By	comparison,	solid‐state	13C	NMR	analysis	of	bulk	SOC	showed	increased	ratios	of	alkyl/O‐alkyl	 in	the	subsoils	of	W1	(1.09)	and	W2	(1.11)	compared	with	control	(0.96;	Table	S3),	again	suggesting	enhanced	degradation	of	subsoil	SOC	under	warm‐ing,	despite	negligible	changes	in	the	topsoil.4 |  DISCUSSIONFive	years	of	warming	(for	W1)	did	not	alter	SOC	concentrations	in	the	studied	alpine	grassland	due	to	relatively	small	changes	in	NEE	compared	with	soil	carbon	stocks.	However,	given	the	com‐plex	composition	 and	varying	turnover	of	SOC	pools,	shifts	in	carbon	allocation	and	dynamics	among	various	soil	fractions	may	FIGURE 4 Changes	in	bulk	properties	and	biomarker	concentrations	of	soil	size	fractions	under	warming	in	2015.

Using	a	combination	of	sensitive	measure‐ments	on	SOC	characteristics,	 we	reveal	divergent	responses	of	different	SOC	components,	 providing	evidence	for	shifting	carbon	dynamics	(reflected	in	both	molecular	and	14C	composition)	 in	the	subsoil.	These	changes	may	indicate	future	shifts	in	the	carbon	stor‐age	potential	of	soils	under	warming.	Importantly,	none	of	these	ef‐fects	were	detected	in	the	topsoil,	highlighting	that	the	vast	subsoil	carbon	stocks	may	be	the	most	sensitive	components	of	SOC	pools	in	this	study	region	(Figures	2	and	3).In	contrast	to	lignin	accrual	in	the	macroaggregates	 of	a	tall‐grass	prairie	soil	under	elevated	litter	inputs	(Cotrufo	et	al.,	2015),	plant‐derived	phenols	decreased	in	the	warmed	subsoils	(especially	in	macroaggregates)	 relative	to	the	control	(Figure	2a)	despite	en‐hanced	inputs	of	lignin‐enriched	 grass	roots	(Figure	S2).	Our	results	point	to	warming‐enhanced 	lignin	degradation	at	depth	in	this	alpine	grassland.	This	finding	is	corroborated	 by	the	relative	change	of	lig‐nin	Ad/Al	ratios	with	progressive	warming	(Figure	S4),	in	line	with	increased	alkyl/O‐alkyl	 ratios	(Feng	et	al.,	2008;	Pengerud	et	al.,	2017)	in	the	warmed	subsoils	and	decrease	of	soluble	aromatics	de‐rived	from	lignin	and	tannin,	etc.,	in	the	WEOM	(Figure	5;	Table	S3).	The	decrease	of	phenols	in	bulk	subsoils	was	largely	caused	by	their	declining	concentrations	 and	proportions	in	the	macroaggregates	(Figure	4c;	Figure	S6a),	which	are	enriched	with	fungal	communi‐ties	(and	hyphae)	as	the	primary	lignin	degrader	(Gleixner,	Czimczik,	Kramer,	Lühker,	&	Schmidt,	2001)	and	poor	in	minerals	conferring	physiochemical	 protection	for	carbon	substrates	(Wilson	et	al.,	2009).	Enhanced	lignin	oxidation	in	the	macroaggregates	 is	also	evi‐denced	by	the	higher	(Ad/Al)S	ratio	in	the	warmed	than	control	sub‐soil	fractions	(Figure	S7a).The	above	changes	collectively	suggest	that	lignin	degradation	is	more	sensitive	to	warming	in	the	sub‐	than	topsoil	of	this	alpine	grassland.	This	may	be	linked	to	several	factors.	First,	underde‐graded	lignin	in	the	subsoil	(indicated	by	lignin	Ad/Al	ratios)	may	be	more	susceptible	to	degradation	in	the	warmed	soils	with	an	ex‐tended	period	of	microbial	activity	(Lin	et	al.,	2017)	and	a	potentially	increased	size	of	enzyme	pools	(Alvarez	et	al.,	2018),	highlighting	the	vulnerability	of	relatively	fresh	lignin	partially	“cryo‐locked” 	in	the	deep	horizons	of	alpine	soils.	Second,	microbial	degradation	of	mil‐lennia‐old	SOC	was	found	to	be	fueled	by	increased	inputs	of	labile	carbon	via	root	penetration	to	the	deep	layers	of	a	temperate	grass‐land	(Shahzad	et	al.,	2018).	Similarity,	lignin	decomposition 	could	have	been	stimulated	in	our	alpine	subsoil	due	to	warming‐induced	root	deepening.	This	explanation	is	supported	by	a	stronger	comet‐abolic	decay	of	lignin	in	the	glucose‐amended	 incubation	of	subsoils	from	the	warming	compared	to	control	plots	(Jia	et	al.,	2017).	Third,	microbial	genes	involved	in	degrading	complex	organics	such	as	lig‐nin	are	shown	to	increase	under	warming	in	tundra	soils	(Sistla	et	al.,	2013;	Xue	et	al.,	2016),	and	microbial	communities	can	shift	in	favor	of	fungi	that	dominate	lignin	decomposition	 (Gleixner	et	al.,	2001).	In	a	QTP	alpine	meadow,	warming	has	been	reported	to	induce	mi‐crobial	community	shifts	toward	bacteria	at	0–10	cm	but	toward	fungi	in	the	deeper	layers,	highlighting	that	functional	shifts	in	soil	FIGURE 6 Conceptual	figure	showing	contrasts	in	soil	carbon	dynamics	in	response	to	warming	at	varied	depths	in	the	alpine	grassland.	Warming‐induced	vegetation	shifts	(Liu	et	al.,	2018)	are	observed	to	cause	deeper	root	distribution	and	elevated	BNPP	in	the	subsoil,	potentially	increasing	input	of	root	exudates.	These	changes	lead	to	new	carbon	accumulation	in	the	silt‐clay	fraction,	increased	concentrations	of	sugars	and	lipids	as	well	as	enhanced	degradation	of	lignin	in	the	subsoil	likely	due	to	elevated	priming	effect	(Jia	et	al.,	2017).	The	above	shifts	stand	in	contrast	to	the	unaltered	BNPP	and	soil	organic	carbon	(SOC)	dynamics	in	the	topsoil,	underscoring	the	high	sensitivity	of	deep	SOC	cycling	to	warming	in	the	alpine	grassland	[Colour	figure	can	be	viewed	at	wileyonlinelibrary.com]    |  4391JIA et Al.communities	could	underpin	these	subsoil	changes	in	SOC	dynamics	(10–50	cm;	Zhang	et	al.,	2015).In	contrast	to	phenols,	root‐	and	microbe‐derived	 biomarkers	suggest	that	bulk	SOC	received	increased	inputs	of	lipids	and	sug‐ars	from	both	plants	and	microbes	in	the	warmed	subsoil.	In	par‐ticular,	accompanied	by	an	increased	grass	root	redistribution 	into	the	deeper	soil	(Liu	et	al.,	2018),	the	silt‐clay	fraction	of	warmed	subsoils	showed	an	increase	of	OC	content	(Figure	4a)	and	an	ac‐cumulation	of	newly	synthesized	carbon	(Figure	4b)	as	well	as	un‐degraded	(fresh)	lignin	indicated	by	lower	(Ad/Al)V	ratios	relative	to	the	control	(Figure	S7b).	These	results	agree	with	an	increased	silt‐clay	fraction	in	a	warmed	subarctic	grassland	(Poeplau,	Katterer,	Leblans,	&	Sigurdsson,	2017)	and	with	favorable	sequestration	 of	new	carbon	in	the	fine‐sized	soil	particles	under	elevated	root	growth	(Desjardins,	Barros,	Sarrazin,	Girardin,	&	Mariotti,	2004).	It	is	also	notable	that	in	contrast	to	their	increase	in	the	bulk	sub‐soil	(Figure	2d),	archaea‐	and	bacteria‐derived 	GDGTs	declined	in	the	silt‐clay	fraction	of	W2	relative	to	control	subsoils	(Figure	S5c),	likely	due	to	dilution	by	fresh	plant‐derived	 OC.	Therefore,	newly	sequestered	 carbon	in	the	fine	fraction	appeared	to	be	mainly	plant	(root)	derived.	Taken	together,	our	results	indicate	that	while	warming‐enhanced 	degradation	(of	phenols)	mainly	occurred	in	the	fast‐cycling	pool	(i.e.,	macroaggregates),	 sequestration	 of	newly	synthesized	carbon	was	elevated	in	the	slow‐cycling	pool	(i.e.,	silt‐clay	fraction;	Figure	6).	As	fine‐sized	or	mineral‐associated	 fraction	is	considered	to	be	responsible	for	the	long‐term	stabilization	of	SOC	(Cotrufo	et	al.,	2015),	the	shifting	allocation	of	carbon	from	fast‐	to	slow‐cycling	pools	may	benefit	long‐term	SOC	storage	and	explain	the	reported	increase	of	subsurface	carbon	stocks	with	warming	on	the	QTP	(Ding	et	al.,	2017).In	summary,	our	study	provides	compelling	evidence	for	shifting	soil	carbon	dynamics	on	the	QTP	under	warming	(Figure	6).	Given	that	these	effects	were	observed	in	the	subsoil	and	not	topsoil,	our	results	highlight	the	high	sensitivity	of	deep	SOC	cycling	to	warming	in	alpine	grasslands	(Dorrepaal	et	al.,	2009;	Hicks	Pries	et	al.,	2017).	Until	now,	studies	have	focused	primarily	on	the	warming	response	of	topsoil.	Our	results	suggest	that	these	studies	may	misrepresent	or	underestimate	 total	changes	in	SOC	dynamics	or	terrestrial	car‐bon	cycling	under	warming.	The	specific	ecological	mechanisms	identified	can	help	to	provide	insights	into	the	vulnerability	 of	high‐altitude	and	high‐latitude	regions	under	warming.	Moreover,	as	warming	is	reported	to	induce	deeper	root	distribution	in	a	wide	range	of	ecosystems	(Arndal,	Tolver,	Larsen,	Beier,	&	Schmidt,	2018;	Johnson	et	al.,	2006;	Keuper	et	al.,	2017;	Leppälammi‐Kujansuu	et	al.,	2013;	Lim	et	al.,	2018;	Liu	et	al.,	2018;	Shi	et	al.,	2017;	Wang	et	al.,	2017),	the	observed	root‐driven	acceleration	of	subsoil	carbon	cycling	and	new	carbon	sequestration	 may	also	occur	in	non‐alpine	systems.	It	is	important	to	assess	whether,	where,	and	when	new	carbon	accrual	in	the	fine‐sized	fraction	may	outweigh	the	decay	of	native	SOC	at	depth.	It	is	also	necessary	to	examine	if	the	outcome	is	related	to	the	nature	of	organic	matter	preserved	(such	as	the	fresh‐ness	of	lignin	components)	 and/or	the	status	of	nutrient	availabil‐ity	in	the	soil,	given	that	both	microbial	activity	and	plant	growth	are	strongly	regulated	by	nutrient	cycling	under	global	changes	(Fontaine	et	al.,	2011;	Perveen	et	al.,	2014).	Given	the	tremendous	carbon	storage	in	subsoils,	addressing	these	questions	will	be	critical	to	improve	confidence	in	future	projections	of	soil	carbon	dynamics	under	climate	change.	This	could	also	help	us	to	identify	potential	“hot	spots”	for	new	carbon	sequestration 	versus	old	carbon	preser‐vation	under	warming.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis	study	was	supported	financially	by	the	Chinese	National	Key	Development 	Program	for	Basic	Research	(2017YFC0503902, 	2015CB954201),	 the	National	Natural	Science	Foundation	of	China	(41422304,	31630009,	31370491,	41773067),	and	the	International	Partnership	Program	of	Chinese	Academy	of	Sciences	(Grant	no.	151111KYSB20160014).
