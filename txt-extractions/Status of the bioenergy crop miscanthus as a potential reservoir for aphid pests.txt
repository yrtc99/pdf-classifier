Therefore, the introduction of miscanthus crops in Europe needs continuous monitoring andrisk assessment because they may serve as a refuge or a reservoir for aphid pests and/or pathogens ofconventional crops. Here, we ﬁrst report the results of two ﬁeld surveys conducted in northern Franceon the species composition of alate aphids ﬂying above Miscanthus ×giganteus crops. Then, in a ﬁrst lab-oratory experiment, we investigated the colonization process on M.×giganteus of the four major aphidpests (Hemiptera: Aphididae) trapped in the ﬁeld study. Results showed that the performances of thesespecies in terms of feeding, survival, and reproduction, on M.×giganteus , depended on their degree ofspecialization toward Poaceae. The suitability of this plant was moderate for the Poaceae specialist aphidRhopalosiphum padi (L.), low for the polyphagous aphid species, Aphis fabae (Scop.) and Myzus persi-cae(Sulzer) and very low for the Brassicaceae specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae (L.). Nevertheless,M.×giganteus cannot be considered as a reservoir crop for these common aphid pests as their progeniesdid not reach the adult stage. In a second laboratory experiment, the ability of the Poaceae specialistaphid R. padi to colonize M.×giganteus and its putative parents, Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus sac-chariﬂorus was assessed. Results showed that R. padi was able to achieve its life cycle on M. sacchariﬂorusbut not on M. sinensis . The consequences of the introduction of miscanthus in the north of France arediscussed in terms of phytoviruses spreading and in terms of potential reservoir for aphid pests fromconventional neighboring crops.© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionThe use of perennial herbaceous energy crops dedicated to theproduction of biofuels in order to substitute fossil fuels is oneway to reduce CO2emissions ( Smith et al., 2000 ).

Among all potentialplants, Miscanthus ×giganteus , the sterile hybrid between Miscant-hus sinensis and Miscanthus sacchariﬂorus , has been extensivelytrialed as a biofuel in Europe since the early 1980s. Indeed, thispromising candidate as a bioenergy crop is characterized by highbiomass yields, even in cool northern European conditions ( Bealeand Long, 1995 ), a C4 photosynthetic pathway, a high tolerance toabiotic stresses, a perennial growth and a sustainable production(Heaton et al., 2004 ). Therefore, as planting miscanthus for energyproduction develops in Europe, an increased pathogen and pestpressure are likely to occur, and the risk of severe damage mustbe carefully examined by continuous monitoring and risk assess-ments. Miscanthus ﬁelds may indeed serve as a refuge or a reservoirfor pests and/or diseases of conventional crops ( Jørgensen, 2011 ).http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.04.0550926-6690/© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.104 A. Ameline et al. / Industrial Crops and Products 74 (2015) 103–110For example, it has been shown that M.×giganteus could be asuitable host for major maize pests such as the western corn root-worm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) andthe fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)(Gloyna et al., 2011; Prasifka et al., 2009; Spencer and Raghu, 2009 ).Among the agricultural pests, aphids are considered as the mostserious ones, mainly because of the indirect damage they causethrough the spread of phytoviruses. Most of these phytovirus vectorspecies belong to the Aphidinae subfamily (Hemiptera: Aphididae),which includes the genus Aphis ,Myzus , and Macrosiphum (Eastop,1983 ). Phytoviruses are divided into two main categories depend-ing on their transmission mode. Non-persistent viruses are spreadby transient or non-colonizing alate aphids that make brief intracel-lular probes (“potential drops”) when moving from plant to plant,whereas persistent viruses are transmitted by colonizing aphidsspecies and imply sustained feeding in the phloem ( Hooks andFereres, 2006 ).Some studies have shown that miscanthus may act as a peren-nial reservoir of phytoviruses such as the barley yellow dwarfvirus (BYDV) which can be transmitted in a persistent mannerby Rhopalosiphum maidis (Christian et al., 1994; Huggett et al.,1999 ), the switchgrass mosaic virus ( Agindotan et al., 2013 ), andthe sorghum mosaic virus ( Grisham et al., 2012 ).During a ﬁeld sampling study in M.×giganteus crops in the UK,Semere and Slater (2007) showed that Homoptera samples weredominated by Aphididae. However, in this broad scale biodiversitystudy, identiﬁcation was not carried out up to the species level. In anextensive ﬁeld survey set up in four different USA states, Bradshawet al. (2010) recorded large populations of the yellow sugarcaneaphid, Sipha ﬂava which is only present in America ( Blackman andEastop, 2000 ) and the corn leaf aphid, R. maidis which is virtuallycosmopolitan but absent in regions with severe winter conditionssuch as northern Europe ( Blackman and Eastop, 2000 ).The poten-tial for the large-scale production of miscanthus has also led to itsevaluation as a host through laboratory experiments for S. ﬂava(Pallipparambil et al., 2014 ) and for R. maidis (Huggett et al., 1999 ).For instance, Coulette et al. (2013) demonstrated that vitroplantsofM. sacchariﬂorus were not suitable hosts for the black bean aphidAphis fabae , the green peach aphid Myzus persicae , and the birdcherry aphid Rhopalosiphum padi . More recently, Pointeau et al.(2014) showed that M. sacchariﬂorus and, to a lesser extent, M.sinensis were less suitable and acceptable host plants for R. maidisthan M.×giganteus .In France, the ﬁrst miscanthus crops were planted in 2006 andthe surface area was essentially localized in the northern part ofthe country. The introduction of such crops in an agricultural land-scape dominated by plants belonging to the Poaceae taxa (barley,wheat, and maize) may create new refuges or reservoirs not onlyfor monocot specialist aphids but also for polyphagous aphids asso-ciated with other main crops such as rapeseed, potato, legumes(typically beans and peas), sugar beet, turnip, carrots, and lettuce.In the present study conducted in northern France, we ﬁrst car-ried out a ﬁeld survey of alate aphids ﬂying above M.×giganteuscrops. We then made the following assumptions: (1) the ability ofthe most abundant aphid pests trapped in the ﬁeld to successfullyfeed and reproduce on M.×giganteus would depend on their degreeof specialization toward Poaceae and (2) within the Miscanthusgenus, there are different levels of resistance which can modu-late the performances of Poaceae aphid specialists. We tested thesehypotheses through laboratory bioassays. In a ﬁrst one, we inves-tigated the colonization process on M.×giganteus of four majoraphid pests (Hemiptera: Aphididae) trapped in the ﬁeld study: thetwo polyphagous species A. fabae (black bean aphid) and M. per-sicae (green peach aphid), the Brassicaceae specialist Brevicorynebrassicae (cabbage aphid) and the Poaceae specialist R. padi (birdcherry aphid). In a second laboratory bioassay, we investigated thecolonization process of R. padi (i.e., the aphid species that per-formed the best in the ﬁrst laboratory experiment) on the threeMiscanthus species studied in Europe for biomass production, i.e.,M.×giganteus ,M. sinensis , and M. sacchariﬂorus .2. Materials and methods2.1. Field studiesThe experiments were conducted in M.×giganteus ﬁelds locatedon three different sites in Picardy, northern France: two ﬁeldsof 25 ha in Bougainville (49◦51/prime18/prime/primeN, 2◦01/prime29/prime/primeE and 49◦51/prime21/prime/primeN,2◦01/prime44/prime/primeE) and one of 8 ha in Dreuil-les-Molliens (49◦54/prime03/prime/primeN,2◦02/prime23/prime/primeE). Fields in Bougainville were planted with M.×giganteusin 2008 and the one in Dreuil-les-Molliens was planted in 2007.The aphid survey was conducted a ﬁrst time in 2011 from May2nd to July 29th and a second time in 2014 from May 7th to July2nd. The ﬁeld study started immediately after crop harvesting andwhen it was stopped ca. two months later, the plants had grownca. 150 cm high. In each site, a yellow water trap used to catch dif-ferent species of alate aphids was placed on a pole just above theplant canopy and 50 m away from the border ( Marame et al., 2010 ).Traps were checked every week and the insects caught were kept insmall plastic containers with 70% ethanol until identiﬁcation undera stereomicroscope (Leica M165C).All aphids trapped were identiﬁed at species level and only thoseconsidered as the main pests in Picardy (FREDON Picardie PestMonitoring Network) were taken into account for this study. Elevenspecies were thus numbered: the green peach aphid M.persicae(Sulzer), the black bean aphid A. fabae Scopoli, the cabbage aphid B.brassicae (L.), the willow-carrot aphid Cavariella aegopodii Scopoli,the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), the birdcherry-oataphid R. padi (L.), the blackcurrant-sowthistle aphid Hyperomyzuslactucae (L.), the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (F.), the potato aphidMacrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), the lettuce aphid Nasonoviaribisnigri (Mosley), and the willow-carrot aphid Cavariella theobaldi(Gillette & Bragg).2.2. Insects and plants for laboratory experimentsThe M. persicae colony was established from one female col-lected in 1999 in a potato ﬁeld near Loos-en-Gohelle (France) andwas reared on turnip plants ( Brassica rapa cv.“purple top whiteglobe”). Both the colonies of R. padi and B. brassicae were providedin 2008 by INRA-Le Rheu (Rennes, France) and they were rearedon barley ( Hordeum vulgare cv. “Cervoise”) and rapeseed ( Brassicanapus cv.“Stego”), respectively. The colony of A. fabae , provided in2012 by Gembloux Agro-Bio-Tech (Belgium) was reared on broadbeans ( Vicia faba cv. “Maya”).For each aphid species, colonies were initiated from a singleapterous parthenogenetic female and maintained on their respec-tive host plant in a ventilated Plexiglas®cage in different growthchambers under 20 ±1◦C, 60±5% R.H., and 16:8 (L:D) photoperiodto induce parthenogenesis.Plantlets of the three Miscanthus species, i.e., M.×giganteus (cv.“GigB”, 2 n=3x= 57), M. sacchariﬂorus (cv. “Sac”, 2 n=2x= 38) and M.sinensis (cv. “Goliath”, 2 n=4x= 76) ( Zub et al., 2012 ) were obtainedby in vitro multiplication as described by Rambaud et al. (2013) .Single rooted shoots coming from clusters, rooting in perlite, werepotted in plastic pots (ﬁrstly 9 ×9×10 cm, then 16 ×13 cm and20×15 cm) containing potting soil in a growth chamber under20±2◦C, 60±5% R.H, and a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod. Plants used inthe experiment were 8–12 weeks old (after potting) and 60–80 cmhigh.A. Ameline et al. / Industrial Crops and Products 74 (2015) 103–110 1052.3. Feeding behavior studiesThe electrical penetration graph DC-system described byTjallingii (1978, 1988) was used to investigate the feeding behaviorof alate aphids on Miscanthus spp. In a ﬁrst bioassay, the feed-ing behavior of M. persicae ,R. padi ,B. brassicae, and A. fabae wasinvestigated on M.×giganteus and in a second bioassay, the feed-ing behavior of R. padi was investigated on the three Miscanthusspecies.To insert one aphid and one plant into an electrical circuit, athin gold wire (20 /H9262m diameter and 2 cm long) was stuck on theinsect’s dorsum by conductive silver glue (EPG systems, Wagenin-gen, The Netherlands). Eight aphids were then connected to theGiga-8 DC-EPG ampliﬁer and each one was placed on a plantlet leafof a different plant. A second electrode was inserted into the soilof each of the potted plants to complete the electrical circuits. Therecordings were performed continuously for 8 h during the day.Alate aphids in their dispersal phase were collected on the innerwall of the rearing cages. Owing to their variable propensity to ﬂyor probe they were standardized in a Plexiglas®chamber (305 mmhigh, 152 mm diameter) as described by Brunissen et al. (2009) .The whole aphid-plant system was placed inside a Faraday cage at20±1◦C. Acquisition and analysis of the EPG waveforms were car-ried out with PROBE 3.5 software (EPG Systems, www.epgsystems.eu). Parameters from the recorded EPG waveforms were calculatedwith EPG-Calc 6.1 software ( Giordanengo, 2014 ). These parameterswere based on different EPG waveforms described by Tjallingii andHogen Esch (1993) corresponding to: (C) stylet pathways in planttissues except phloem and xylem; (pd) potential drops (intracel-lular stylet punctures); (E1) salivation in phloem elements; (E2)passive phloem sap ingestion; (E1 + E2) activity within phloemvessels, (G) active xylem sap ingestion; and (F) derailed styletmechanics. For the study related to the feeding behavior of the fouraphid species on M.×giganteus , 20–24 individuals were tested andfor the study relating to the feeding behavior of R. padi on the threeMiscanthus species, 19–23 individuals were tested.2.4. Survival and reproductive traits bioassaysIn a ﬁrst bioassay, the performances of M. persicae ,R. padi ,B.brassicae , and A. fabae were investigated on M.×giganteus , and in asecond bioassay, the performances of R. padi were investigated onthe three Miscanthus species.Pools of synchronized ﬁrst instar nymphs (less than 24-h old)of each aphid species were obtained from parthenogenetic adultfemales placed on leaves of their host plant set in 1.5% agar in Petridishes (90 mm diameter). To obtain synchronized young adults,ﬁrst instar nymphs were further kept in the same device forsix–eight days, depending on the aphid species.For the nymph survival study, groups of ﬁve ﬁrst instar nymphswere transferred onto the plantlets to be tested. These groups ofaphid nymphs were enclosed in clip cages on leaves at mid-heightof each plantlet and their survival was recorded every two days. Foreach of the two bioassays, six–ten replicates were performed.For the adult performance study, young adults were individuallytransferred onto the plantlets to be tested. Survival and fecunditywere assessed every day until the female died. For each of the twobioassays, 25–40 replicates were performed.2.5. Statistical analysisBecause the homoscedasticity of all distributions was not con-ﬁrmed, non-parametric tests were used. EPG parameters anddemographic parameters were compared between aphid speciesfor the ﬁrst bioassay and between plants for the second bioassayby using a Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance ( Hvalue).Post-hoc multiple comparisons were carried out with the non-parametric pairwise Mann–Whitney Utest. The false discovery rate(FDR) approach ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 2009 ) was used to con-trol the family-wise error rate. All statistics were performed usingR(R Development Core Team, 2014 ).3. Results3.1. Field studyA total of 2436 alate aphids belonging to 50 different specieswere trapped in 2011 and 2014. The 11 focal species represented65% of the identiﬁed individuals in the 2011 campaign and 80%of the identiﬁed individuals in the 2014 campaign ( Table 1 ). Thetwo most abundant species were the two polyphagous speciesM. persicae and A. fabae (54 % of the captures).

B.brassicae which feeds on a wide range of Brassicaceae plants wasabundantly captured in 2011. The Asteraceae specialists ( H. lactucaeand N. ribisnigri ) represented less than 3% of the captures. Finally,the Fabaceae specialist Acyrtosiphum pisum , the Apiaceae special-ist ( Cavariella sp.), the Poaceae specialists ( R. padi and S. avenae ),represented, respectively, less than 2% of the captures.These ﬁeld results led us to evaluate through laboratory bioas-say, the ability of miscanthus colonization by the three maintrapped aphid species ( M. persicae ,A. fabae , and B. brassicae ). EvenifR. padi was not frequently trapped during these two ﬁeld surveys,it is probably the most important cereal pest and can be hosted by alarge number species belonging to more than 30 genera of Poaceaeincluding maize, sorghum, and barley (Blackman and Eastop, 2000 ).Therefore, it was also chosen for subsequent laboratory bioassays.3.2. Bioassay 1: feeding behavior and performance of the fouraphid species on M. ×giganteus3.2.1. Electrical penetration graph studiesThere was a signiﬁcant effect of the aphid species for thefollowing parameters ( Table 2 ): number of probes ( H= 16.06;P< 0.01), total duration of probing ( H= 30.4; P< 0.001), number andtotal duration of pathway phases ( H= 15.92; P< 0.01 & H= 19.11;P< 0.001), number of potential drops ( H= 21.26; P< 0.001), time ofphloem phase ( H= 13.23; P< 0.01), total duration of phloem phase(H= 20.41; P< 0.001), total duration of xylem ingestion ( H= 15.52;P< 0.05).The number of probes was signiﬁcantly lower for R. padi com-pared to A. fabae and M. persicae (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05)but not compared to B. brassicae . The stylet activities within planttissues (over the 8-h recording) ranged from 42% for B. brassicae to74% for R. padi . The Poaceae specialist R. padi exhibited the longestduration of probing and B. brassicae , the shortest one, whereas thetwo polyphagous species exhibited intermediate durations of totalprobing.The number of pathway phases was signiﬁcantly higher for M.persicae (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05). The total duration of thisphase was signiﬁcantly longer for the cereal aphid R. padi thanfor B. brassicae and M. persicae (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05).R. padi , performed twice as many potential drops as B. brassicae(Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05) and the other two aphid speciespresented intermediate values (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05).As for the phloem phase parameters, R. padi and M. persicaetook signiﬁcantly less time to access phloem vessels than A. fabae(Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05). The total duration of the activitywithin phloem vessels (E1 + E2) was weak for all aphids (less than6% of the 8-h recording). Nevertheless, this phase was signiﬁcantlylonger for M. persicae and R. padi than for B. brassicae and A. fabae(Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05). All the species exhibited phloemsap ingestion but the total duration of this phase, which was not sig-niﬁcantly different between species ( H= 3.71; P> 0.05), was trivialand represented less than 4% of the 8-h recording for all species.Finally, the total duration of xylem sap ingestion (G) performedby B. brassicae was signiﬁcantly shorter than when it was per-formed by A. fabae and R. padi (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05),but not signiﬁcantly so when it was performed by M. Persicae . Thetotal duration of stylet derailment phase (F) was not signiﬁcantlydifferent between aphid species ( H= 7.40; P> 0.05).3.2.2. Aphid performance on M. ×giganteusKruskal–Wallis statistical analysis showed an aphid specieseffect on all parameters presented in Table 3 : adult survival(H= 25.73; P< 0.05), fecundity ( H= 71.75; P< 0.05), nymph survival(H= 26.52; P< 0.05). Inter-speciﬁc pairwise comparisons showedthat the adult survival was signiﬁcantly shorter for B. brassicae(ca. 50%) compared to all other species of aphid (Mann–WhitneyUtest, P< 0.05).

Concern-ing the nymph performance study, none of the individuals reachedthe adult stage. In addition, the nymph survival was longer for R.padi in comparison to B. brassicae and M. persicae (Mann–WhitneyUtest, P<0.05).3.3. Bioassay 2: feeding behavior and performance of R. padi onthe three Miscanthus species3.3.1. Electrical penetration graph studiesThere was a signiﬁcant effect of the plant species on the totalduration of probing ( H= 13.97; P< 0.001) and the total duration ofphloem sap ingestion ( H= 8.58; P< 0.05) (Fig 1 ). The total durationof probing was signiﬁcantly shorter on M. sinensis in comparisonto the two other plant species (Mann–Whitney Utest, P < 0.05).Indeed, R. padi spent 60% of the recorded time in plant tissue (versusat least 69% for the two other plant species). The total duration ofphloem sap ingestion was more than four times higher on M. sac-chariﬂorus (16.5% of the time over the 8 h duration of recording)than on M.×giganteus (3.7% of the time over the 8 h recording)(Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05).3.3.2. R. padi performances on the three Miscanthus speciesConcerning the aphid performance study presented in Table 4 ,Kruskal–Wallis statistical analysis showed a plant species effect onR. padi adult survival ( H= 41.20; P< 0.001), fecundity ( H= 20.11;P< 0.05) and nymph survival ( H= 12.55; P< 0.01). When aphidswere reared on M. sacchariﬂorus , nymphs survived twice longerthan when they were reared on the two other plant species(Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05), but only 3 nymphs out of the 31individuals tested reached the adult stage. Similarly, adult survivalwas signiﬁcantly longer on M. sacchariﬂorus. The fecundity was neg-atively affected for aphids reared on M. sinensis (Mann–Whitney Utest, P< 0.05).4. DiscussionOur study demonstrated that none of the four aphid species con-sidered as the main crop pests in Northern France (FREDON PicardiePest Monitoring Network), which were also abundantly trappedM.×giganteus ﬁelds, were able to achieve their life cycle on thisplant because their progeny did not reach the adult stage. EvenifM.×giganteus did not represent a reservoir for these commonaphid pests of northern France, some differences in the suitabilityof this plant appeared regarding to the aphid degree of specializa-tion toward Poaceae. The Poaceae specialist aphid R. padi , whichperformed better on M.×giganteus than the other aphid species,was able to achieve its life cycle on M. sacchariﬂorus .4.1. M. ×giganteus colonization ability by the four main aphidpest speciesHost plant selection by alate aphids is achieved through asequence of several steps deﬁned by Niemeyer (1990) andPowellet al. (2006) : (1) pre-alighting behavior, (2) landing, (3) probing theepidermis, (4) stylet pathways activity in the mesophyll, (5) sieveelement puncture and salivation, (6) phloem acceptance and sus-tained sap ingestion and ﬁnally, and (7) survival and reproduction.Our ﬁeld study showed that the trapped aphid species were theones that are most frequently found in the main crops of the north-ern France and this, regardless of their potential relationship withPoaceae. Indeed, aphids have little control over the direction of theirﬂight and the pre-alighting step appears to have negligible effecton the host-plant selection ( Dixon, 1998 ). Aphids do not exhibitclear discrimination between host and non-host plants before theyhave landed and inserted their stylets ( Kennedy and Booth, 1961;Kennedy et al., 1959a,b). The two main trapped species were twopolyphagous species, M. persicae and A. fabae. These species are con-sidered to be the main pests of northern France crops as their hostTable 4Mean ( ±SEM) performance parameter values of Rhopalosiphum padi on the three miscanthus species ( Miscanthus ×giganteus, Miscanthus sacchariﬂorus , and Miscanthussinensis ).Kruskal–Wallis test Miscanthus ×giganteus Miscanthus sacchariﬂorus Miscanthus sinensisAdults H(P) n=2 8 n=2 5 n=2 7Survival (days) 41.20 (***) 4.18 ±0.26 b 9.28 ±0.76 a 4.04 ±0.27 bFecundity 20.11 (***) 6.75 ±0.68 a 8.88 ±0.85 a 3.67 ±0.65 bNymphs n=3 2 n=3 1 n=2 5Survival (days) 12.55 (**) 2.69 ±0.17 b 4.71 ±0.7 a 2.4 ±0.16 bAsterisks indicate a signiﬁcant difference :*P < 0.05 ,* *P < 0.01 , *** P < 0.001 associated with H(Kruskal–Wallis test); within a row, different letters indicate signiﬁcantdifferences (pairwise comparisons using Mann–Whitney Utest).108 A. Ameline et al. / Industrial Crops and Products 74 (2015) 103–110plant spectrum comprises a wide range of plant species belongingto a large number of plant families including Poaceae ( Blackmanand Eastop, 2000 ). Surprisingly, the Brassicaceae specialist B. bras-sicae was extensively trapped in 2011 whereas the two cerealspecialists R. padi and S. avenae were much less frequently trapped.The analysis of EPG parameters such as frequency, duration,and sequence of different waveforms, is considered as valuableindicators for deﬁning plant suitability or probing interference bychemical and/or physical factors in plant tissues ( Mayoral et al.,1996 ). In the present EPG study, the total duration of pathwayphases, the total duration of activity within phloem vessels, andmore generally the total activity of the recorded time in plant tis-sues were the highest for the Poaceae specialist R. padi , the lowestfor the Brassicaceae specialist B. brassicae and intermediate for thetwo polyphagous species. Aphids usually have a low number ofprobes when feeding on suitable hosts ( Cole, 1997 ). This was thecase for R. padi on M.×giganteus in our study. Moreover, the time toreach phloem vessels was the shortest for R. padi and the longest forB. brassicae . Therefore, as expected, the suitability of M.×giganteusvaried according to the degree of specialization toward Poaceaeof each aphid species. And indeed, the Brassicaceae specialist cab-bage aphid, B. brassicae , usually feeds on plants that accumulateglucosinolates, which stimulate its feeding and oviposition ( Ahujaet al., 2010; Wittstock et al., 2004 ). The lack of such secondarymetabolites in miscanthus plants could also explain its weak per-formances, i.e., feeding behavior, survival, and reproduction of B.brassicae compared to the other aphid species. Conversely, R. padiwas the aphid species that performed the best on M.×giganteus ,although it performed less well than it did on barley, its conven-tional host plant ( Chesnais et al., 2015; Schliephake et al., 2013 ).The relatively weak performances of R. padi onM.×giganteus couldresult from the different photosynthetic pathways occurring in itscommon C3 host plant and in the C4 miscanthus. Indeed, Weibull(1990) demonstrated a preference of R. padi for grasses with a C3-metabolic pathway. He hypothesized that R. padi, having evolved inthe Palearctic region, is not well adapted to C4-grasses that mainlygrow in warmer regions. The polyphagous species A. fabae and M.persicae exhibited intermediate performances in comparison to thetwo specialist aphid species. This is in accordance with Tosh et al.(2003) who found that, during the host plant selection phases 4–6(see above, Powell et al. (2006) ), aphid specialists reject more easilyand efﬁciently non-host plants than generalists do.Chesnais et al. (2015) evaluated the intrinsic rate of increase ofthe same four aphid species as the ones tested in this study and itclearly appeared that M.×giganteus was less suitable for each aphidspecies than their respective rearing host plants. Accordingly, theirfeeding behavior was also drastically affected on M.×giganteus incomparison to what is reported in the literature when they feed ontheir host plant ( Boquel et al., 2012; Gabrys et al., 1997; Powell andHardie, 2001; Slesak et al., 2001). The unsuitability of M.×giganteusis also supported by the presence of stress indicators such as a highxylem sap consumption and the occurrence of stylet derailments(Prado and Tjallingii, 1997; Sauge et al., 2002 ).4.2. Suitability of the three Miscanthus species to R. padiTwo main basic modalities of plant resistance to insects havebeen deﬁned by Panda and Khush (1995) and Painter (1951) :antixenosis affects insect behavior by deterring or reducing thecolonization process whereas antibiosis affects insect life historytraits (survival, development, and fecundity). Our study revealedthat M.×giganteus and M. sinensis exhibited a higher resistancelevel to R. padi than M. sacchariﬂorus thanks to a combination ofboth resistance mechanisms.Indeed, on a susceptible host plant such as H. vulgare , the highpopulation rate of increase of R. padi was associated with a highduration of phloem feeding (58% of the 12 h recording) ( Schliephakeet al., 2013 ). Compared to such data obtained on susceptible plants,our study suggested the occurrence of an antixenosis resistancemechanism through a drastic reduction of phloem sap inges-tion of R. padi on M. sinensis , and M.×giganteus , and to a lesserextent on M. sacchariﬂorus , (9.3, 3.7, and 16.5% of the 8-h record-ing, respectively). This data was consistent with the demographicperformance results which showed a high antibiosis resistancemechanism when R. padi was reared on M.×giganteus and M. sinen-sis.Accordingly, Huggett et al. (1999) demonstrated that R. padi wasunable to reproduce and exhibit prolonged feeding on M. sinensis.In our study, M. sacchariﬂorus was a more susceptible host for R.padi than M.×giganteus and M. sinensis. However, the suitability ofM. sacchariﬂorus toR. padi remained moderate as only three R. padinymphs out of the 31 individuals tested reached the adult stage.In contrast, Pointeau et al. (2014) demonstrated that R. maidis wasable to develop and reproduce and exhibited long phases of phloemsap ingestion on the three Miscanthus species (23–40% of the timeover the duration of probing depending on the Miscanthus species).This could be explained by the fact that, contrary to R. padi , the cornleaf aphid R. maidis is also adapted to feed on C4-plants ( Blackmanand Eastop, 2000 ).4.3. Epidemiologic and agronomic implicationsThe inability of A. fabae ,M. persicae ,B. brassicae , and evenR. padi to produce nymphs that could reach the adult stage onM.×giganteus does not allow conferring to this plant the status ofreservoir as deﬁned by Spencer and Raghu (2009) .M.×giganteushas therefore to be considered as a “transitional plant” that wouldallow the aphids to survive through the consumption of xylem sapand low quantities of phloem sap. The existence of such refugeperennial plants is crucial for aphid pests that use annual plantcrops that are harvested in summer. Moreover, as the four aphidspecies, studied cannot complete their life cycle on M.×giganteus ,they can be considered as non-colonizing or transient species(Fereres and Moreno, 2009; Irwin et al., 2007 ). In the context ofplant virus spreading, transient aphid species alighting on non-hostplants are known to transmit non-persistent viruses before takingoff in search of a suitable host plant ( Boquel et al., 2012; Gray et al.,2010; Radcliffe and Ragsdale, 2002 ). Our EPG study clearly showedthat the four aphid species performed the brief intracellular punc-tures (potential drop waveforms) which are directly involved in thetransmission of non-persistent viruses ( Martín et al., 1997 ). To ourknowledge, only the work by Grisham et al. (2012) reported thatM. sinensis could be infected by the non persistent Sorghum mosaicvirus (SrMV) which is not present in Europe.The observation of sustained phloem ingestion phase, particu-larly for R. padi , also makes the transmission of persistent virusestheoretically possible ( Martín et al., 1997 ).Christian et al. (1994)and Huggett et al. (1999) demonstrated that M. sinensis could besusceptible to some persistent viruses such as the barley yellowdwarf virus (BYDV), and could therefore be a perennial reservoirof phytoviruses. However, another study by Drechsler et al. (2014)shows that different M.×giganteus cultivars were resistant to thepersistent maize streak virus (MSV).Thus, the introduction of miscanthus in the north of France couldnot only have an effect on the spread of phytoviruses related toPoaceae but also on those related to the other conventional crops.Indeed, Miscanthus spp. could constitute a tall barrier which mayreduce potential virus dissemination by aphid vectors when aphidvectors migrate between crops. Hooks and Fereres (2006) proposethat barrier plants may act as a sink for non-persistent viruses. Afterlanding on the barrier crop, the viruliferous aphid loses its virus“charge” by making a few brief probes on the plant. Consequently,a virus-free aphid entering an area with susceptible primary cropsA. Ameline et al. / Industrial Crops and Products 74 (2015) 103–110 109will no longer be able to transmit a viral disease. For example,Fereres (2000) studied the use of sorghum and maize as barriercrops to protect pepper plants against the potato virus Y (PVY) andthe cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). He concluded that these tall bar-rier plants did not reduce the number of vectors entering in pepperhabitats but protected the pepper plant by acting as a natural sinkfor non-persistent viruses. In Picardy, the agricultural landscapebeing mainly dominated not only by cereal crops but also by cropssuch as rapeseed, potato, legumes (typically beans and peas), sugarbeet, turnips, carrots, and lettuce, attention should be paid to wheremiscanthus is being planted. Miscanthus could be used as a virussink to prevent the dissemination of non persistent viruses of Bras-sicaceae (e.g., Cauliﬂower mosaic virus, CaMV, the Turnip yellowmosaic virus, TuMV), Solanaceae (Potato virus Y, PVY) and Cucur-bitaceae (Cucumber mosaic virus, CMV). However, it should notbe planted as a barrier crop nearby arable crops such as wheat ormaize, as in this case, it could possibly act as a reservoir for theBYDV.5. ConclusionDespite the probable modiﬁcation of the equilibrium of localagrosystems, the introduction of miscanthus in northern Francemay not contribute to creating a new reservoir for aphid pestsissued from susceptible crops. Moreover, its possible role as abarrier crop could also limit aphid movements between crops,reducing the risk of virus spreading. Our work also demon-strates that, the most interesting species for biomass production,M.×giganteus, is also the species which exhibited the highest levelof resistance toward R. padi in comparison to its parents M. sinensisand M. sacchariﬂorus .In the future, ﬁeld surveys should continue to be used to pre-dict aphid pest problems before they develop in the miscanthuscrop. Indeed, our study did not take into account the genetic vari-ability of R. padi . Within the same geographic location, Lushai et al.(2002) revealed two genetic proﬁles of the grain aphid, S. avenae(Fabricius) that exhibited different levels of specialization towarddifferent grasses and cereals. Therefore, some other natural popula-tions of R. padi may be adapted to feed and reproduce on Miscanthusspp. Otherwise, even if R. maidis populations are negligible in thenorthern France, their abundance is likely to increase in coolerregions in response to climate warming ( Harrington, 2007 ), whichcould in turn enhance its pest status of Poaceae such as Miscanthusspp.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to acknowledge the ﬁnancial support from thePicardie region (research project MISCPIC).
