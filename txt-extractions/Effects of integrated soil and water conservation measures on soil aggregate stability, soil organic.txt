Fifteen disturbed composite and 15 undisturbed soilsamples were collected from cropland sites treated with ISWC measures, SWC structures aloneand no SWC measures (NSWC). Results revealed that mean values of stability index (SI) andstability quotient (SQ) are: 15 and 712 for sites with ISWC measures, 8 and 268 for sites withSWC structures alone and 6 and 187 for sites with NSWC measures. The SOCS (t ha-1) and SOMcontents are: 12.7 and 1.7% for sites with ISWC, 8.0 and 1.2% for SWC alone and 6.3 and 0.7%for NSWC. SI, SQ SOCS and SOM content are signi ﬁcantly higher (p <0.01) for cropland sitestreated with ISWC compared to those with SWC alone and NSWC. However, there areinsigni ﬁcant differences (p >0.05) in SI, SQ and SOCS, between sites with SWC alone and NSWC.This study strongly suggests that, application of ISWC measures has considerable potential toenhance SAS, SOCS and SOM content.KEYWORDSSoil organic matter content;soil aggregate stability; soilorganic carbon stock;integrated soil and waterconservation measures andcropland1. IntroductionLand degradation in developing countries such asEthiopia has been a serious concern for its negativeimplications for the livelihood of the rural communityand the environment on whi ch they largely depend.Its immediate consequence is reduced crop yield, fol-lowed by economic decline and social stress [ 1]. Highseasonal rainfall intensity together with ruggedtopography and low vege tation cover caused byovergrazing and deforestation as well as low soilorganic matter (SOM) content increases soil suscepti-bility to water erosion in the Ethiopian highlands[Haile et al. 2006 2;3–5]. Soil erosion and rapid soildegradation affect soil pro perties, undermine agricul-tural production and reta rd the economic develop-ment of the region. Moreover, several researchﬁndings con ﬁrmed that soil degradation, especiallysoil erosion and associated soil nutrient depletion, isthe major cause of the decline of agricultural produc-tion in Ethiopia [Nyssen et al . 2004 [ 6];7–9]. Hence,soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in thecountry aim not only to control soil erosion but alsoto sustain agriculture an d economic development ofthe country at large [ 10].Soil erosion by water is a severe problem in the cul-tivated lands of the Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia,where population density is high, climate is relativelydry 9 to 10 months in a year (semi-arid climate) andagriculture is intensive due to population pressure [ 11;Nyssen et al. 2004]. Though the reported soil loss ratevaries over a wide range, the average estimated soilerosion rate from cropland of the humid central Ethio-pia highlands is 42 t ha¡1y¡1[10,12]. To address soilerosion challenges, the regional government of Tigrayand local and international development agencieshave invested in substantial resource managementand in [ 6] promoting soil conservation practices toimprove soil fertility and ensure sustainable agriculturalproduction. Several SWC technologies with differentimplementation approaches such as food for work,cash for work, a safety net program and, more recently,based on free labor contribution by the local farmershave focused on the highlands of the country wherethe problem is more threatening to the sustainabilityof agriculture and the natural resources [ 10].The implemented SWC measures improve soilproperties such as soil aggregate stability (SAS), soilorganic matter (SOM) content and soil organic carbonstock (SOCS) [ 13,14]. However, most of the SWC meas-ures implemented in croplands, with a few excep-tions, are only physical structures –mainly stonebunds, soil bunds and trenches in the study area.CONTACT Shimbahri Mes ﬁn shimbahri.mes ﬁn@mu.edu.et© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCARBON MANAGEMENT, 2018VOL. 9, NO. 2, 155 –164https://doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2018.1443641Most farmers invest in SWC measures for short-termbene ﬁts, while most of the implemented physicalmeasures yield relatively long-term agricultural bene-ﬁts such as increased production and environmentalbene ﬁts such as restoration of soil fertility, reducedsiltation and increased recharge to the ground water(Adgo et al. [15]).In view of this one may ask questions related to theshort-term environmental bene ﬁts of integrated soiland water conservation (ISWC) measures (a combina-tion of physical and biological measures) being imple-mented together on the same cropland at the studyarea. ISWC measures signi ﬁcantly reduce the soil ero-sion rate [ 16] and thereby improve soil properties forenhanced agricultural productivity [ 17,18]. However,the effects of stone bunds and trenches integratedwith fodder species such as Leucaena leucocephala andSesbania sesban on soil properties in cropland is lessunderstood in the semi-arid Tigray region of NorthernEthiopia. It is hypothesized that the implementation ofISWC measures leads to increase in SOM content, SASand SOCS attributed to the control of wind and watererosion, enhanced inputs of SOM content, structuralstability, and carbon sequestration in the form ofSOCS. Therefore, this study aims to assess and betterunderstand the effects of ISWC measures on SAS, SOMcontent and SOCS compared to those with SWC struc-tures alone and without soil and water conservationmeasures (NSWC).2. Methods2.1. Study areaThe study was conducted from December to June 2015in Werie Leke district, which is located in the Tigrayregion of Northern Ethiopia. The district is located at164 km from Mekelle, the capital city of Tigray region,to the north ( Figure 1 ). It is geographically situated at13/C143805200N (lat.) and 39/C141301500E (long.). Topographyis rugged, and mountainous with an altitude thatranges from 1450 to 2350 m asl. The agro-climate ofthe study area is a semi-arid type locally called ( kola)comprising about 84% and the rest is dry sub-humid(weyna-dega , 16%).The annual rainfall ranges from 340 to 800 mm withan average annual rainfall depth of 570 mm and meanmonthly temperature of 21/C14C. Due to this high tem-perature, the annual potential evapotranspiration israther large, signi ﬁcantly reducing crop water availabil-ity. The geologic formation of the study site is latePaleozoic –Triassic: Edaga Arbi Glacial (tillites), redAdigrat sandstone, shale and conglomerates [ 19,20].The dominant soil types are Cambisol, Regosol, Luvisol,Vertisol and Arenosol [ 19]. The distribution of soil typesis strongly in ﬂuenced by topography and parent mate-rials [ 21]. The largest part of the study area is coveredby soils with sandy loam texture and the remainingsmall part is covered by soils with clay, clay loam,loamy and loamy sand textures. Topsoil is continuouslyFigure 1. Location of the study area: A, Ethiopia, B, Tigray indicating Werie Leke district, C, Werie Leke indicating Zongui sub-district, and D, Zongui sub-district.156 S. MESFIN ET AL.eroded, by surface runoff during the rainy season andby wind during the dry season. Steep slopes of up to33% are common in the study area, whereas the slopeof cultivated land ranges from 3 to 8%. Recently,increased population pressure and the correspondingincreased demand for additional croplands are increas-ing the rate of land-use change, with very steep slopesand marginal areas also being brought undercultivation.The farming system of the study area is character-ized as mixed, with crop production and livestock hus-bandry being the dominant components of thesystem. The interaction between the components issigni ﬁcant, with the crop component providing residuewhile the livestock component provides manure anddraft power. Crop production is mainly a rain-fed andsmall-scale subsistence system. The majority of thecroplands are cultivated to annual food crops in a rota-tion, including cereals such as teff ( Eragrostis tef ), barley(Hordeum vulgare ), wheat ( Triticum sp.) and ‘Hanfets ’(amix of wheat and barley grown together in the sameﬁeld) and maize ( Zea mays ); pulses like beans andsome vegetables and fruits in the irrigated land arealso important components. Croplands are tilled withardplow meharesha pulled by a pair of oxen, with till-age frequency ranging from 1 to 4 times per croppingseason depending on available draft power and croptype [ 22].The types of livestock in the study area are cattle,goats, sheep, equines, poultry and bee colonies. Thedominant tree and shrub species are Faidherbia albida ,Acacia etbaica ,Dichrostacys cihareal ,Dodonaea angusti-folia,Euclea schimperi ,Ziziphus spinachristi ,Acacia lahai ,Croton macrostachyus ,Luceana lucocephla and Sesba-nia sesban .Luceana lucocephla and Sesbania sesban arecommon fodder species planted in the farmland inte-grated with SWC structures, whereas Faidherbia albidais grown naturally in cropland as scattered trees (park-land agroforestry).2.2. Sampling techniques and experimentalproceduresZongui sub-district was purposely selected based onthe availability of different SWC measures integratedwith agroforestry fodder tree species (i.e. ISWC meas-ures). Moreover, the selected area is best representa-tive of different ISWC measures in the region and ofSWC measures alone. A preliminary transect survey inthe study area was conducted in 2015 to identify sam-pling plots with different treatments: plots with ISWCmeasures, plots with only physical SWC structures, andsites with NSWC measures implemented ( Figure 2 ).Information regarding the history of cultivation andage of the implemented SWC measures was obtainedfrom land users and complemented with informationfrom Bureau of Agriculture and Natural Resources.These three sites –a site with ISWC measures, a sitewith SWC alone and a site with NSWC measures –aresimilar with respect to tillage history, fertilizerFigure 2.

However,they differ in the type of SWC measures implementedto control soil erosion rates and restore soil fertility.The two treated sites (i.e. the site with ISWC measuresand the site with SWC structures alone) were treated inthe 1998 soil and water conservation campaign of theregion. However, there can be some minor differencesin the methods and timing with which these SWCmeasures are being maintained, and in the croppingsequence and rotation.A detailed description and technical standards ofthe implemented SWC measures (stone bunds or stonebunds and trenches) are reported by Taye et al. [5].Brieﬂy, a description of the different SWC treatments isprovided as follows: ISWC measures comprise croplandsites treated with contour stone bunds and trencheswhere fodder tree species are planted between conse-cutive trenches in a row ( Figure 2 ). In this combination,trenches were installed immediately upslope of thestone bunds for intercepting surface runoff and sedi-ment. SWC structures alone are cropland sites treatedwith stone bunds and trenches. These are similar tothe sites with ISWC measures but without fodder spe-cies planted between trenches. The cropland site with-out soil and water conservation interventions (NSWC)is similar to the other two sites in terms of slope gradi-ent and land use but without SWC measures applied(Figure 2 ).In order to understand the effect of SWC measureswith and without fodder tree species on SAS, SOM con-tent and SOCS, ﬁve disturbed composite samples werecollected based on ﬁve auguring points from the top20 cm soil depth at each site ( Figure 2 ). The ﬁve col-lected samples were mixed thoroughly and one com-posite sample was taken for each of the ﬁve auguringpoints ( Figure 2 ). Accordingly, a total of 15 compositesoil samples were collected from the three sites (ISWC,SWC and NSWC) for soil laboratory analysis. In addition,15 undisturbed soil samples were also collected fromeach site to determine soil bulk density (BD) using acore sampler.2.3. Soil laboratory analysis2.3.1. Determination of SASSAS to a depth of 20 cm was determined using the dryand wet sieving methods as described by De Leenheerand De Boodt [ 23] and Kemper and Rosenau [ 24]. Thisis because the soil aggregate stability is different underdry and wet soil moisture conditions. The mean weightdiameter (MWD) on both a dry and a wet sieving basisis used to have a good understanding of the responseof the soil aggregate or its stability at different soilmoisture conditions. Soil samples collected from theﬁeld were air-dried and 200 g of each was sieved usingsieves with mesh sizes of 8.00, 4.0, 2.8, 2.00, 1.00, 0.50and 0.053 mm, treating the soils with and withoutwater to obtain the aggregate-size distribution underboth dry and wet soil moisture conditions. SAS wasexpressed using MWD, which is given by MWD ¼Pni¼1Xi/C3Wi, SI; SI¼1MWD dry /C0MWD wet ðand by SQ,where SQ¼SI/C3%aggregates >2mm, where MWD ismean weight diameter, n is the number of size frac-tions, Xi is the mean diameter of each sieve fraction,given by xi¼highest diameter þsmaller diameter2, Wi is theproportion of the total sample weight occurring in theithsize fraction (Wi = weight of sample in each sieve tototal sample weight ratio), SI is the stability index andSQ is the stability quotient.2.3.2. Determination of soil SOM contentSoil organic carbon content was determined by theWalkley and Black method through wet oxidation oforganic carbon with potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)in sulfuric acid [ 25]. The percentage of SOM contentwas obtained by multiplying the percentage of organiccarbon by a factor of 1.724 [ 26] which is based on theassumption that organic carbon constitutes 58% of thesoil organic matter.2.3.3. SOCS estimationSOCS is dependent on the content of organic carbon,BD, coarse fragment percentage and soil depth [ 27]. Tocalculate SOCS, the proportion of the coarse fragment(f>2 mm) content was determined by weighing thecoarse fragments remaining on a sieve [ 28]. Hence, thetotal SOCS of each studied cropland plot was deter-mined using measured soil depth (i.e. 20 cm), BD(g cm¡3), organic carbon (%) and the sampled soilexcluding the coarse fragment, as follows:SCS t ha/C01/C0/C1¼d/C3BD/C2SOC/C31/C0proportion of coarse fragmentðÞwhere d is sampling depth (i.e. 20 cm), BD is soil bulkdensity (g cm¡3), SOC is soil organic carbon (%), andthe proportion of coarse fragment was calculated bydividing the coarse fragment weight (g) by the totalweight of the sample (g) multiplied by 100. The coarsefragment has little or no contribution to the bindingand retention of SOM content; hence, its proportionwas excluded from the calculation of SOCS.2.4. Data analysisStatistical analyses of the data were conducted usingSPSS software (IMB SPSS statistics version 20) to testthe in ﬂuence of ISWC and physical SWC measures onthe selected soil properties compared to the contribu-tion without SWC measures. The differences amongcropland sites treated with ISWC, SWC and NSWC withrespect to soil aggregate size distribution, SAS, SOMcontent and SOCS were assessed using multiple158 S. MESFIN ET AL.comparisons of variance. Signi ﬁcance differencesbetween treatment means were separated using LeastSigni ﬁcant Difference (LDS) test at ( p<0.05) signi ﬁ-cance level. The Pearson correlation test was also usedto analyze the relationship among soil aggregate sizedistribution, BD, SAS, SOM content and SOCS.3. Results and discussion3.1. Soil textureThough there are differences in proportions of sand,silt and clay, soil textural classes of the cropland sitestreated with different SWC measures (i.e. ISWC, SWCand NSWC) were found to be the same ( Table 1 ). Theresults indicate that there is no signi ﬁcant difference inthe proportion of soil separates (% sand, % silt and %clay; p>0.09) among the cropland sites treated withISWC, SWC and NSWC measures. This is also due to thefact that cropland sites were situated on the same geo-logical unit and slope gradients (i.e. 3 –8%), which putthem in the same soil textural classes. This suggeststhat the different SWC measures did not have effectson the soil texture of the study area. Since texture is aninherent soil property derived from the parent mate-rial, it is not surprising to see no in ﬂuence of land man-agement practices such as SWC treatments on soiltexture in such a short period of time. However, thehighest percentage of silt and clay were recorded forsites treated with ISWC, compared to cropland sitestreated with SWC alone and NSWC. This is due to theabsence of selective removal of ﬁne particles by over-land ﬂow and to the accumulation of silt and clay incropland sites treated with different SWC measures.The results ( Table 1 ) show greater sand contents in theﬁne earth for the cropland site with NSWC measurescompared to sites with ISWC and SWC, which is due toselective removal of clay, silt and organic matter byoverland ﬂow from the site where no conservationmeasures are installed. Similarly, Tibebu et al. (2017)[29] reported high clay and silt content in soils of crop-land sites compared to the contents in pasture and for-ested areas.3.2. Soil BDThough there is no signi ﬁcant ( p>0.61) difference insoil BD among the cropland sites treated with differentSWC measures, higher mean BD values are recordedfor the cropland sites treated with SWC alone and sitestreated with NSWC measures ( Table 2 ). The lowest BD,of the cropland site treated with ISWC measures, is dueto the presence of fodder species which modify soil BDthrough increased addition of organic matter, and alsoto the increased soil porosity due to root actions. Thisstudy is similar to that of Tadesse et al. [30] whoreported mean BD values of 1.21 g cm¡3for croplandtreated with ISWC measures, 1.34 g cm¡3for croplandtreated with SWC structures alone and 1.37 g cm¡3forcropland with NSWC measures in the same geologyand slope gradient. Moreover, the results of the studyconducted by Demelash and Karl [ 31] in South Gonder,northwestern highlands of Ethiopia, foud lower soil BDvalues for croplands treated with ISWC and SWC meas-ures than for the cropland site with NSWC activities.This is attributed to the reduced soil erosion rate andincreased SOM and clay contents of the soil.Table 1.

Aggregate size distribution and SASThe MWD values of the aggregate for both dry and wetsieving are presented in Table 2 . These results showthat aggregate size distribution is signi ﬁcantly differentfor mean dry sieving ( p<0.05) and for mean wet siev-ing ( p<0.01) in cropland sites treated with ISWCmeasures ( Table 2 ). However, a non-signi ﬁcant differ-ence in aggregate-size stability distribution for dry-sieving ( p>0.09) and for wet-sieving ( p>0.05) wasobserved between the cropland sites treated with SWCalone and NSWC ( Table 2 ). The dry MWD of the soilfrom cropland sites treated with ISWC measures, SWCalone and NSWC ranges from 2.05 to 2.42 mm, from1.67 to 1.90 mm, and from 0.84 to 1.96 mm, respec-tively. In contrast, the wet MWD of the soil from crop-land sites treated with ISWC measures, SWC alone andNSWC ranges from 2.03 to 2.37 mm, from 1.49 to1.80 mm and from 0.68 to 1.77 mm, respectively(Table 2 ). The MWD in both dry and wet sieving indi-cated that aggregate size distribution for cropland sitestreated with ISWC measures is the highest among thethree cropland sites followed by the cropland sitetreated with SWC structures alone. Though the resultsfor MWD of both dry and wet sieving in this study arevery similar, considering the MWD of the soil in bothdry and wet conditions helps to create a good under-standing of the response of the soil aggregate at differ-ent moisture conditions. Wet aggregate stability showsthe resistance of soils against raindrops and watermovement in the soil such as erosion and in ﬁltration,whereas the dry aggregate stability shows the resis-tance of soils against external forces such as wind ero-sion and compaction [ 32].The results showed that the SI and SQ for sitestreated with ISWC measures are signi ﬁcantly higher ( p<0.01) than for the cropland sites treated with SWCalone and NSWC. However, a non-signi ﬁcant difference(p>0.76) for SI and ( p>0.80) for SQ was foundbetween cropland sites treated with SWC and croplandsites with NSWC measures ( Table 2 ). The SAS of crop-land sites treated with ISWC is the highest among thethree sites, followed by the cropland site treated withSWC structures alone. This high SAS proves that soilsfrom cropland sites treated with ISWC measures aremore stable compared to soils of cropland sites treatedwith SWC alone or NSWC measures. This better soilaggregation for sites treated with ISWC measures isdue to the relatively high SOM content of the topsoilfrom the planted fodder species, and the lower soil BD(Table 2 ). The results of this study are similar to theresults reported by Lee et al. [33], who suggested thatSOM content is important in soil aggregation, soilaggregate-size distribution and aggregate stabilitybecause of its cohesive and binding properties. More-over, the higher clay content of soils from the croplandsite treated with ISWC measures ( Table 1 ) providedpotential for the stabilization of the soils by associationand binding effects of organic materials with clay min-erals, and the formation and stabilization of organicmaterials within aggregates [ 34]. In contrast, the lowersoil aggregation for the soils in cropland sites withNSWC is due to the high proportion of sandy texture,water erosion, low vegetation cover, low SOM contentand high soil compaction.3.4. SOM contentThe results presented in Table 2 show that mean SOMcontent is signi ﬁcantly ( p<0.01) different among thecropland sites treated with ISWC, SWC alone, andNSWC measures. The highest value of SOM content(1.73%) is found in the cropland site treated with ISWC,followed by the cropland sites treated with SWC alone(1.16%) and with NSWC (0.66%) ( Table 2 ). The higherSOM content is due to the consequences of ISWCmeasures that involve the addition of organic matterfrom the planted fodder tree species. The percentageof SOM content in the cropland site treated with ISWCmeasures increased by 49% compared to the corre-sponding cropland site with SWC alone. Similarly, forthe cropland site treated with ISWC measures, theSOM content increased by 162% compared to thecropland site with NSWC measures, whereas the SOMcontent for the cropland site treated with physicalSWC measures alone increased by 76% compared tothe cropland site with NSWC measures. Litter fall fromthe planted fodder plant species together with thephysical SWC measures have the best effect in enhanc-ing SOM content. This result is in line with previousresults of Amezketa [ 35] and Tadesse et al. [30]who reported a mean SOM content of 2.13% for crop-land treated with integrated soil bund, 1.47% forcropland treated with only soil bund and 0.85% forcropland without SWC measures.Although there is a signi ﬁcant difference among thesoils of the different experimental sites with respect toSOM content, all the experimental sites have low SOMcontent which is below the optimum level proposedby Barber [ 36]. The results indicate a moderately lowmean SOM content in cropland sites treated with ISWC(1.73%) and SWC structures alone (1.16%), and a lowmean SOM content in the NSWC site (0.66%) ( Table 2 ).The low SOM content for the cropland site treatedwith ISWC is due to long-term cultivation, soil erosionbefore the conservation measures were implemented,the short time period after implementation of ISWCmeasures, and poor soil fertility management practicessuch as less manure and compost application and freestubble grazing after harvest. The low mean SOM con-tent of the cropland site treated with SWC structurealone is also due to the lack of plant litter decomposi-tion, and poor soil fertility management practices such160 S. MESFIN ET AL.as low manure and compost application and free stub-ble grazing after harvest. In contrast, the very lowmean values of SOM content of cropland sites withNSWC measures may be due to the lack of plant litteraddition, leaching of decomposed materials, poor soilfertility management practices, free stubble grazingand lack of deposition of materials coming fromupland areas.The signi ﬁcant difference and relatively high meanSOM content in the cropland treated with ISWC is dueto litter fall and decomposition of dead roots from theplanted fodder species, which adds organic matter tothe soil continuously and causes the accumulation ofsediments near the ISWC structures. This ﬁnding agreeswith Am /C19ezketa [ 35] who reported that SOM contentresults from litter fall, and dead root decomposition isan indicator of recovery from degradation of soil andecosystem. Once the SOM is depleted, soil productivitydeclines because of the degraded soil structure anddepletion of nutrients; this causes poor soil aggrega-tion and soil compaction [ 37].3.5. Soil organic carbon stockThe SOCS in the topsoil (0 –20 cm) of the studied crop-land sites treated with ISWC is signi ﬁcantly higher ( p<0.01) than in the cropland sites treated with SWC struc-tures alone or NSWC. However, a non-signi ﬁcant differ-ence ( p>0.08) is observed between the cropland sitestreated with SWC alone and NSWC measures ( Table 2 ).The SOCS ranges from 10.21 to 15.50 t ha¡1for thecropland site treated with ISWC, from 7.30 to 9.72 tha¡1for the cropland site treated with SWC alone, andfrom 5.82 to 7.21 t ha¡1for the cropland site withNSWC measures ( Table 2 ). The highest mean value ofSOCS in the cropland was found in the site treatedwith ISWC and the lowest was found in the croplandsite with NSWC.The SOCS in the soil of the cropland site treatedwith ISWC was improved through appropriate landmanagement practices that integrate fodder specieswith physical SWC measures. This integrated interven-tion also increased the conservation of SOM contentthrough reduced erosion rates, which helps to seques-ter more carbon and plant nutrients and recycle theminto the soil through decomposition of plant residues.This ﬁnding is in line with Li et al. [38] who suggestedboth concentration and stocks of carbon are signi ﬁ-cantly higher in croplands with agroforestry speciesthan in cropland sites without agro-forestry. Tadesseet al. [30] found a mean SOCS of 12.48 t ha¡1for acropland site treated with integrated soil bund, 10.47 tha¡1for a cropland site treated with soil bund alone,and 4.7 t ha¡1for cropland without SWC measures. Ingeneral, the low carbon sequestration in soils of thecropland with NSWC measures is due to erosion andlow organic matter addition to the soil by the farmersfor fertility management and free stubble grazing afterharvest.3.6. Relationships among BD, SOM content, soilaggregate-size distribution, SAS and SOCSSoil BD is negatively correlated with SOM content, SIand SQ ( Table 3 ), with a signi ﬁcant correlation ( p<0.01). However, BD has a weak correlation with dryaggregate size, wet aggregate size and SOCS ( Table 3 ).These results agree with those reported by Tadesseet al. [30] that suggested BD is negatively correlatedwith SOM and SOCS, based on studies using croplandsoils of Tigray, North Ethiopia. This is because increasedsoil organic matter content and related biological activ-ities in the soil reduce soil compaction, contributingtoward aggregate stability and increasing the macro-porosity of the soils. It is important to consider man-agement conditions that maintain the stability of thesoil structure, porosity and a good distribution of poresize, which are crucial for soil water, air and nutrientdynamics [ 39].SOM content is positively correlated with dry aggre-gate size (r = 0.85**), wet aggregate size (r = 0.87**), SI(r = 0.70**), SQ (r = 0.78** and SOCS (r = 0.75**);Table 3 ), with signi ﬁcant correlation ( p<0.01). This isbecause increasing SOM content increases SAS asorganic matter and its decomposition products arebinding agents during the genesis of soil structure.This is in line with the ﬁndings of Tisdall and Oades[40], Graham et al. [41] and Lee et al. [33] who alsoreported a positive correlation among SOM content,SAS and SOCS. The SOCS is also strongly correlatedTable 3. Pearson correlation among soil bulk density (BD), soil organic matter content (SOM) content, soil aggregate stability(SAS) and soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) for the different cropland sites treated with Integrated soil and water conservation(ISWC) physical soil and water conservation measures alone (SWC) and with no soil and water conservation (NSWC) measures.BD MWD dry sieving MWD wet sieving SI SQ SOCSSOM content ¡0.62** 0.85** 0.87** 0.70** 0.78** 0.75**BD ¡0.39 ¡0.42 ¡0.67** ¡0.67** ¡0.35MWD dry sieving 0.99** 0.54* 0.66** 0.77**MWD wet sieving 0.63** 0.73** 0.83**SI 0.96** 0.75**SQ 0.81****Correlation is signi ﬁcant at the 0.01 level.*Correlation is signi ﬁcant at the 0.05 level.CARBON MANAGEMENT 161with dry aggregate size (r = 0.77**), wet aggregate size(r = 0.83**), SI (r = 0.75**) and SQ (r = 0.81**) ( Table 3 ),with signi ﬁcant correlation ( p<0.01).In general, the higher carbon sequestration poten-tial of the soils of cropland sites treated with ISWCmeasures is due to a continuous addition of organicmatter from litter fall, roots and plant residue of thefodder tree species and SOM accumulated by the ISWCdue to reduced erosion which also enhanced the SASof the site. This strong relationship of SOCS and soilaggregation is an indicator of the different land man-agement roles that enhance productivity, water andnutrient holding capacity, and the overall ecosystemhealth. The SOCS in the topsoil achieved through con-servation of nutrients and planting of trees helps toenhance SOM content through addition and conserva-tion mechanisms. This ﬁnding implies that ISWC ena-bles the incorporation of organic matter into the soil.As a result, these effects contribute to enhanced SOMcontent, improved SOCS and aggregate stability. Theseeffects are similar to those found by Tadesse et al. [30],who suggested that soil organic carbon increased dueto the addition of organic matter, and conservation.They are also in line with Zhou et al. [42] who reportedthat physical SWC integrated with biological measureshas positive effects on preventing soil degradationthrough modifying soil properties, thereby inducingpositive effects on soil aggregation. The organic mate-rials of the fodder plant species added to the soil alsopromote good soil aggregate formation [ 43,44]. Soiland water conservation measures implemented inTigray region signi ﬁcantly reduce the soil erosion rate[5,17,18]. This study also reported that ISWC measuressigni ﬁcantly increase SOM content and SOCS, which inturn contribute toward soil quality improvement andreduction of soil erosion, and enhance agriculturalproductivity.4. ConclusionIn this study, we evaluated the effects of integrated soiland water conservation measures (physical soil andwater conservation integrated with fodder tree spe-cies) on soil aggregate stability, soil organic mattercontent and soil organic carbon stocks of smallholderfarmlands in a semi-arid area of Ethiopia. The resultsrevealed that soil organic matter content, soil aggre-gate stability and soil organic carbon stocks are signi ﬁ-cantly affected by integrated soil and waterconservation measures, whereas soil texture and soilbulk density are not signi ﬁcantly affected by integratedsoil and water conservation measures. Soil organic car-bon content is signi ﬁcantly increased as a result of soiland water conservation measures alone. However,though there is no signi ﬁcant difference in soil aggre-gate stability and soil organic carbon stocks betweenthe cropland site treated with SWC alone and thecropland site treated with NSWC measures, higher val-ues were found in cropland treated with SWC meas-ures alone. Soil organic matter content is positivelycorrelated with soil aggregate stability and soil organiccarbon stock. This study strongly indicates that inte-grated soil and water conservation measures have aremarkable potential to increase soil organic mattercontent, soil aggregate stability and soil organic carbonstock. Even though restoration of degraded soils is avery slow process in dry-land environments, this studyhas shown that soil and water conservation measuresthat integrate physical soil and water conservationwith fodder tree species contribute signi ﬁcantly to soilquality improvement. Carbon sequestration indegraded soils has double advantages: primarily itenhances food security though increased agriculturalproductivity; and it also sequesters carbon, contribut-ing toward mitigating the build-up of atmospheric car-bon. Therefore, this study provides insight forimproved land management in dry lands of the studyarea and other similar environments.AcknowledgementsWe thank Mekelle University for ﬁnancial and material sup-port during data collection and analysis.
