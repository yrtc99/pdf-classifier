Update on SymbiosisCarbon Metabolism and Transport inArbuscular MycorrhizasBerta Bago1, Philip E. Pfeffer, and Yair Shachar-Hill*United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center,Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038 (B.B., P.E.P.); and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, New MexicoState University, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88001 (Y.S.-H.)Colonization of the land by plants some 400 millionyears ago was associated with the colonization oftheir primitive roots by soil-borne filamentous fungi(Nicolson, 1975; Simon et al., 1993; Taylor et al.,1995). Today, 90% to 95% of land plants still maintainsome type of mycorrhizal association so that “mycor-rhizas, not roots, are the chief organs of nutrientuptake by land plants” (Smith and Read, 1997). Ofthe several mycorrhizal symbioses, arbuscular my-corrhizas are much the most abundant. These areformed by a very wide variety of host plants (includ-ing angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, andsome mosses, lycopods, and psilotales) and a com-paratively small group of aseptate filamentous fungi,the Glomales.The study of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungihas fundamental and practical importance. First be-cause in most environments “root biology” is actu-ally “mycorrhizal biology”, and second because ofthe practical importance of AM in fields as diverseas sustainable agriculture, horticulture, reforesta-tion, and ecosystem management (Bethlenfalvay andSchu ¨ epp, 1994; Barea and Jeffries, 1995). There havebeen a number of reviews and at least one excellenttext (Smith and Read, 1997) in recent years cover-ing various aspects of the AM symbiosis. These in-clude: development and morphology (Smith andSmith, 1997; Barker et al., 1998; Azco ´n-Aguilar et al.,1999; Bago, 2000), molecular and cellular biology(Gianinazzi-Pearson et al., 1995; Harrison, 1999), andphysiology and nutrient transfer at symbiotic inter-faces (Cooper, 1984; Smith and Smith, 1990; Koideand Schreiner, 1992; Azco ´n-Aguilar and Bago, 1994;George et al., 1995; Jakobsen, 1999). A current re-source on mycorrhizal research worldwide is main-tained at www.mycorrhiza.ag.utk.edu. Here we re-view the biochemistry of carbon metabolism andtransport in the AM symbiosis. Progress in this areahas been significant thanks to the use in recent yearsof diverse methods including molecular biology,cytology, in vitro AM cultures, microscopy, and nu-clear magnetic resonance (Bago et al., 2000).THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CARBON FLUXES ANDMETABOLISM IN ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZASAM fungi derive most, if not all, of their carbonfrom the host plant (Jennings, 1995). Interest in car-bon handling has been spurred because this is afundamental aspect of the symbiosis, because of thelarge amounts of carbon handled by the symbiosis,and because of the importance of carbon nutrition inattempts to grow the AM fungus axenically (withouthost plants). The AM symbiosis usually increasesplant biomass and photosynthesis and directs theflow of a significant fraction of the host plant’s pho-toassimilate. Estimates vary, but plants have beenshown to direct 4% to 20% more photoassimilate tomycorrhizal root systems (Douds et al., 2000; Gra-ham, 2000). The AM symbiosis therefore determinesthe flow of huge quantities of carbon worldwide—anestimate of 5 billion tons of carbon annually may bereasonable. The cost-benefit analysis (for review,see Douds et al., 2000) and underlying mechanismsare thus of no small ecological and agriculturalimportance.The difficulties of studying an obligate symbiontand the practical goal of mass-producing AM fungalinnoculum have motivated considerable efforts overseveral decades to culture AM fungi axenically.Much of the attention in this (hitherto unsuccessful)endeavor has centered on the search for more or lessexotic forms or combinations of carbon substrates(Azco ´n-Aguilar et al., 1999). Although some of thesecarbon sources succeeded in somewhat prolonginggrowth of germinating spores or hyphae, (Hepper,1984; Be ´card and Piche ´, 1989; Azco ´n-Aguilar et al.,1999) none induced the fungus to complete its lifecycle. Other studies have sought evidence for lesionsin carbon metabolic capability that might explain therecalcitrance to axenic culture (Hepper, 1984).DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURESThe life cycle of AM fungi begins when fungalpropagules (resting spores, Fig. 1A, or separated in-traradical or extraradical hyphae) start to grow.

This mobilizationfuels the development of coenocytic germ tubes andprovides carbon skeletons for anabolism, includingthe de novo synthesis of the chitinous cell wall thatsurrounds all the fungal structures pictured in Figure1 (Bonfante-Fasolo and Grippiolo, 1984; Bonfante-Fasolo et al.; 1990; Bago et al., 1996). Asymbioticgrowth is maintained for 1 or 2 weeks, during whichgerm-tube development may reach several centime-ters. However if symbiosis is not successfully estab-lished within this limited period, AM fungi arresttheir growth. Arrest of growth is accompanied bygerm-tube septation and nuclear autolysis (Bago etal., 1998c), after which fungal propagules re-enter astate of dormancy and have the ability to regerminateseveral times (Koske, 1981; Hepper, 1984). Growtharrest before complete depletion of carbon storesmay be a strategy to increase the chances of findingan appropriate root to colonize.If and when the asymbiotically growing AM fun-gus does contact a host root (Fig. 1B), a series ofFigure 1. Morphological characteristics relevant to AM fungal metabolism. A, Soil-borne spores have a limited “saprophy-tic” growth, being unable to complete their life cycle unless they find a host root to colonize. B, After successfulcolonization, the AM fungus differentiates intraradically forming different structures, the most representative being arbus-cules (C). At the same time the fungus profusely develops an extraradical mycelium with different characteristics structures:BAS (D), BAS-spores (E), and resting spores (E and F), thus closing its life cycle.Bago et al.950 Plant Physiol. Vol. 124, 2000Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/124/3/949/6097492 by guest on 15 April 2023signaling events occurs between the partners, whichleads to the “acceptance” by the host root of the AMfungus as a symbiont (Giovannetti et al., 1994; Smithand Read, 1997; Blee and Anderson, 2000; Lambais2000; Shaul et al., 2000). The fungus then developsextensively between and within root exodermal andcortical cells, and forms intraradical structures (forreview, see Bonfante-Fasolo, 1984), including arbus-cules (Fig. 1C) and lipid-rich vesicles.Arbuscules consist of hyphae that branch dichoto-mously and profusely within root cortical cells. Ar-buscules and other fungal structures do not penetratehost cell membranes, but invaginate them (Bonfante-Fasolo, 1984). For the arbuscules this results in a hugeincrease in plant-to-fungal contact surface area,which leads to the assumption that the bidirectionaltransfer of nutrients in AM probably occurs at theperiarbuscular interfaces (Gerdemann, 1968; Harleyand Smith, 1983; Bonfante-Fasolo, 1984). This para-digm has been supported by indirect data for thesupply of phosphorus to the host by the fungus(Smith and Read, 1997). However, whether arbus-cules are the site of root-to-fungus carbon transfer isa matter of debate (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al., 1991;Smith and Read, 1997; Smith and Smith, 1997; Bago,2000).Root colonization is accompanied by the develop-ment of an extraradical mycelium that includes char-acteristic branched structures (BAS; Fig. 1D; Mosseand Hepper, 1975; Bago et al., 1998a, 1998b). Thesemay be involved with the uptake of mineral nutrientsby extraradical hyphae (Bago et al., 1998b). The ex-ternal spores develop on some of these BAS (Fig. 1E;Bago et al., 1998b) completing the fungal life cycle.During the AM fungal sporulation phase large num-bers of these propagules are formed (Fig. 1F)—asmany as 14,000 to 38,000 per root have been esti-mated in monoxenic cultures (C. Azco ´n-Aguilar, per-sonal communication; St-Arnaud et al. , 1996). Be-cause 45% to 95% of the AM spore carbon pool isneutral lipid (TAG; Beilby, 1983; Jabaji-Hare, 1988;Be ´card et al., 1991), these constitute a major sink forthe carbon provided by the host plant.CARBON FLOWS IN THE AM SYMBIOSISFigure 2 shows a working model for primary flowsof carbon in the AM symbiosis. Emphasis is on up-take, storage, and translocation and on metabolicfluxes for which there is experimental evidence. Inthe following sections, studies that directly underpinthe different features of the model are discussed andremaining questions are reviewed.Uptake of Carbon by the FungusFollowing the demonstration of significant carbonflow from plant to fungus (Ho and Trappe, 1973;Bevege et al., 1975) arguments from analogy withsaprophytic and other symbiotic fungi (Lewis andHarley, 1965a, 1965b; Smith et al., 1969) made sugarsstrong candidates for the form(s) of carbon trans-ferred. Woolhouse (1975) proposed that host rootcortical cells may release sugars to the symbioticplant-to-fungal interfaces by passive efflux thatmight be stimulated by the presence of the fungus.Evidence for altered host plasma membrane perme-ability has been mixed (for review, see Harrison,1999), and no plant transporters involved in suchcarbon efflux (Sauer et al., 1994) have yet been iden-Figure 2.

Vol. 124, 2000 951Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/124/3/949/6097492 by guest on 15 April 2023tified (Harrison, 1999). Studies using isotopic label-ing with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy inAM roots (Shachar-Hill et al., 1995) and radiorespi-rometry measurements on isolated intraradical hy-phae (Solaiman and Saito, 1997) have shown that thefungal symbiont can take up and use hexose withinthe root. In contrast, within the root there is nosignificant uptake by the extraradical mycelium ofGlc, Fru, mannitol, or succinate (Pfeffer et al., 1999).The finding of modest utilization of Suc by in-traradical hyphae (Solaiman and Saito, 1997) raisesthe possibility that this might also be taken up,though indirect arguments based on fractional en-richments make this less probable in vivo (Shachar-Hill et al., 1995). The presence of elevated levels ofhost extracellular (acid) invertase activity in diversebiotrophic associations, including AM (Dehne, 1986;Farrar and Lewis, 1987; Snellgrove et al., 1987) is alsoconsistent with hexose as the dominant form takenup. Nonetheless further direct evidence is desirableto conclusively demonstrate whether host Suc is hy-drolyzed before uptake. Convincing data from exper-iments on uptake of, and competition between sugarsin a powdery mildew/wheat association has recentlyallowed Sutton et al. (1999) to show that Suc in thatsystem is indeed hydrolyzed before uptake. Suc uti-lization of the ectomycorrhizal fungi Amanita musca-riaand Hebeloma crustuliniforme also depends on thecell wall invertase activity of their host spruce (Salzerand Hager, 1991). Similar experiments on an arbus-cular mycorrhiza would be valuable.Molecular characterization of sugar transporters infungus and host would contribute to the understand-ing of transferred forms, illuminate the mechanisminvolved, and open the door to studying regulationof uptake. Fungi can have active and passive sugartransport systems (Blumenthal, 1976; Lagunas, 1993)and there is no direct evidence as to which of theseoperate in AM fungi. Fungal carbon uptake at theinterface might be passive with a concentration gra-dient maintained by rapid conversion of carbontaken up, as proposed by Bevedge (1975) and consis-tent with the observed conversion of hexose to tre-halose and glycogen (Shachar-Hill et al., 1995). Analternate manner, or together with such a porter, maybe active transport. H1-hexose cotransport by fungiis well known (Sanders, 1988) and such a transporterhas been reported in an ectomycorrhizal species(Wiese et al., 2000).Metabolism in the Mycorrhizal RootRoot carbohydrate pools are substantially alteredin AM compared with uncolonized plants (for re-view, see Douds et al., 2000). For example, starchlevels are lower or even absent in arbuscule-containing cortical cells, and labeling in Suc wasabout four times less when13C-Glc was provided tocolonized roots compared with non-colonized roots(Shachar-Hill et al., 1995). At the level of gene expres-sion, Harrison (1996) demonstrated increased expres-sion of a hexose transporter that is probably involvedin uptake in cortical cells near intraradical hyphae(Harrison, 1999). Blee and Anderson (2000) reportchanges in the expression of invertase in cells con-taining arbuscules. Respiration in mycorrhizal rootsis substantially higher than in non-mycorrhizal ones(Shachar-Hill et al., 1995; Douds et al., 2000; Graham,2000). These observations are consistent with thetransfer of carbohydrate to the fungus and with my-corrhizal roots as a stronger sink for photosynthatethan non-mycorrhizal ones (for review, see Douds etal., 2000).Trehalose and glycogen were found to be the firstsubstantial fungal carbon pool labeled from hexosetaken up by the intraradical mycelium (Shachar-Hillet al., 1995). In contrast to observations in the ecto-mycorrhizal symbiosis (Martin et al., 1985, 1998), theacquired Glc is directly incorporated by the AM fun-gus into trehalose and glycogen without detectablelabel scrambling via mannitol or other metabolicturnover. Glycogen and trehalose are both turnedover in the intraradical (Shachar-Hill et al., 1995) andin extraradical mycelium and germinating spores(Bago et al., 1999; Pfeffer et al., 1999), which may beassociated with buffering cytoplasmic hexose levels.Cytoplasmic hexose is also metabolized via the pen-tose phosphate pathway (Pfeffer et al., 1999), a find-ing consistent with the known presence of Glc phos-phate dehydrogenase (Saito, 1995). Several glycolyticand tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities havebeen demonstrated in intraradical hyphae (Mac-Donald and Lewis, 1978; Saito, 1995). A phospho-glycerate kinase gene of Glomus mosse expressed intomato root systems has recently been characterized(Harrier et al., 1998).The synthesis of storage lipids is also a substantialsink for carbon in the intraradical hyphae. Lo ¨sel andCooper (1979) showed that the lipid component ofmycorrhizal onion roots became labeled when plantsphotosynthesized in the presence of14CO2, or weresupplied with labeled Suc, acetate, or glycerol. TAGsare the most abundant form of lipid in AM fungi(Cooper and Lo ¨sel, 1978; Beilby and Kidby, 1980;Nagy et al., 1980; Beilby, 1983; Jabaji-Hare, 1988;Gaspar et al., 1994, 1997a, 1997b). Cis 11,12 hexade-cenoic acid is the predominant fungal fatty acid (FA)in all of the Glomus species (Graham et al., 1995).Labeling of fungal triacylglycerol from13C-labeledsubstrates supplied to the mycorrhizal root suggeststhat a substantial fraction of hexose taken up is usedfor lipid synthesis (Pfeffer et al., 1999). The13C-labeling pattern of the glycerol and FA moieties ofthe triacylglyceride molecule is consistent with thehost-derived hexoses being metabolized (via glycol-ysis) to triose and acetyl coenzyme A (CoA). Afterthis, FA would be synthesized (via acetyl CoA car-boxylase and the FA synthase complex), elongatedBago et al.952 Plant Physiol. Vol. 124, 2000Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/124/3/949/6097492 by guest on 15 April 2023and/or desaturated, and finally assembled with aglyceryl moiety via acyltransferases of uncertain sub-cellular localization (Murphy, 1991).In oleogenic fungi, the acetyl CoA used for triacyl-glyceride synthesis is derived from citrate, which, ina biochemical mechanism unique to these type offungi, is transported from the mitochondrion to thecytosol, then cleaved by a cytosolic citrate lyase (EC4.1.3.8) to acetyl CoA and oxalacetate (Murphy,1991). Such a cytoplasmic citrate lyase may also existin AM fungi.Translocation by the FungusSince hexose is taken up by the fungus within theroot and converted to trehalose and glycogen (seeabove), carbohydrates are obvious candidates to bethe form(s) of carbon translocated to the externalmycelium (for example, see Gaspar et al., 1997a).TAG in the extraradical structures would then besynthesized from carbohydrate in the extraradicalmycelium. However, Pfeffer et al. (1999) concludedfrom their analysis of2H labeling of lipids after sup-plying D2O to either mycorrhizal roots or to theexternal mycelium that the FA moieties in the storageTAG of extraradical hyphae had been previouslysynthesized by the intraradical mycelium and ex-ported. A substantial flux of lipid bodies wouldtherefore be expected along the AM fungal hyphaeand there is some support for this; Olsson et al. (1995)observed that the concentration of storage lipids inthe extraradical mycelium of an AM fungus de-creased relative to phospholipid concentration 1week after disconnecting the hyphae from the hostroot, indicating that the neutral lipids were metabo-lized by the external hyphae, but not replaced. Invivo microscopy indicates that there is indeed a sub-stantial flow of lipid bodies along fungal hyphae (B.Bago, unpublished data). This does not exclude theexport of both carbohydrate and lipid, and our recentresults on labeling patterns in glycogen after uptakeof13C Glc in the mycorrhizal root suggest that gly-cogen is also exported to the extraradical mycelium(B. Bago, unpublished data). We are as yet com-pletely ignorant about the regulation of carbon ex-port and indeed about the mechanism of lipidtranslocation.Metabolism in the Extraradical MyceliumGlycolytic enzyme activities assayed in extraradi-cal mycelium have been found to be low or absent(MacDonald and Lewis, 1978; Saito, 1995). Labelingpatterns in carbohydrates in the extraradical myce-lium when acetate was provided is consistent with asubstantial gluconeogenic flux fueled by the glyoxy-late cycle (Pfeffer et al., 1999). These two observationsare consistent, since the simultaneous operation ofglycolysis and gluconeogenesis would represent afutile cycle. The finding that isocitrate lyase andmalate synthase are expressed in the extraradicalmycelium (J. Jun, unpublished data) provides furtherevidence that the glyoxylate cycle is active. Sincelipid is translocated to the extraradical mycelium, themodel of Figure 2 shows the use of this for anabolismin the extraradical mycelium. Lipid is also likely to bethe main respiratory substrate since the tricarboxylicacid cycle is active in the external mycelium (Mac-Donald and Lewis, 1978; Pfeffer et al., 1999; Bago etal., 1999). Since glycolytic activity seems to be low,carbohydrates are probably not a major source ofacetyl CoA. Pentose phosphate pathway activity alsoappears to be substantial in the extraradical myce-lium, with enzyme activity measurements (Saito,1995) and isotopic labeling data (Pfeffer et al., 1999),suggesting higher flux through this pathway than inthe intraradical phase.Implications for Gene ExpressionThe literature demonstrates and Figure 2 embodiesthe idea that carbon flows in the AM are organizedand highly polarized. Although there is evidence forsome heterogeneity among the several thousand nu-clei in a spore (Sanders et al., 1995), the genetic poolof the fungus is presumably very largely the samethroughout the coenocytic fungus. Therefore the dis-tinct metabolic and transport fluxes in intraradicaland extraradical mycelia require that metabolic geneexpression must be regulated spatially and tempo-rally to form a “metabolic bipole.” Such differentialgene expression has been demonstrated for phos-phate transporters (Harrison and van Buuren, 1995),but little is known about genes involved in carbonflows. The signals for this differentiation remain un-identified. It is also unknown if such a fungal differ-entiation is a programmed sequence triggered by oneor several signals or whether it requires a continuousinput by the plant to be maintained.Is There a Transfer of Carbon from Fungus toRoot in the AM Symbiosis?Simard et al. (1997) recently reported that there wasa net transfer of carbon between plants linked byectomycorrhizal hyphal networks (see also Finlayand Read, 1986). This result suggests that the direc-tion of carbon transport in mycorrhizas might bereversible.13C abundance analysis indicates that 0%to 10% (sometimes more) of the carbon of an AM rootcan be derived from another plant linked to theformer by AM fungal hyphae (Watkins et al., 1996;Graves et al., 1997). However, Fitter et al. (1998)found that carbon transported between AM-linkedplants remains in the roots of the “recipient” mycor-rhizal plant—even when the shoots are removed andallowed to regrow so that carbon flows from roots tothe shoots of that plant. This suggests that carbonC Metabolism and Transport in Arbuscular MycorrhizasPlant Physiol. Vol. 124, 2000 953Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/124/3/949/6097492 by guest on 15 April 2023apparently transferred between connected root sys-tems remains in the fungus (Fitter et al., 1998; Rob-inson and Fitter, 1999). In accordance with this, theseauthors propose that the fungus acquires carbonfrom the root(s) in which it has arbuscules and hy-phae, and translocates carbon along extraradical hy-phae according to fungal needs, storing the acquiredcarbon in extraradical spores and older infectionunits where vesicles are developing. Fitter et al.(1998) found a positive correlation between theamount of carbon transferred and the density of AMfungal vesicles in the roots of the recipient plant,which fits with the export of lipid by the fungus (Fig.2). Furthermore, supplying labeled permeant sub-strates (acetate, glycerol, and CO2) to the extraradicalhyphae results in labeling of fungal, but not hostcarbohydrate (Pfeffer et al., 1999; B. Bago, unpub-lished data). In accordance with this, we view themodel as supporting the conclusion (Robinson andFitter, 1999) that carbon translocated by the fungusbetween plant root systems probably does not con-tribute significantly to host carbon nutrition. How-ever, the transfer of nitrogen from fungus to host canbe significant (Frey and Schu ¨ epp, 1992; Johansen etal., 1993) and depending on the form transferred, thisis likely to entail a significant carbon flux (for exam-ple as amino acids) under some conditions.CARBON FLOWS IN THE ASYMBIOTIC FUNGUSA model for the metabolism of the asymbiotic AMfungus is shown in Figure 3. This stage of fungaldevelopment exhibits characteristics of intraradicaland extraradical symbiotic hyphae. As is the case inthe extraradical mycelium, germinating spores havesubstantial gluconeogenic flux mobilizing lipid(TAG) stores to sustain growth (Bago et al., 1999).Enzymatic assays indicate activity of glycolysis (Mac-Donald and Lewis, 1978; Saito, 1995), the tricarboxy-lic acid cycle (Hepper et al., 1988; Saito, 1995), and thepentose phosphate pathway (Saito, 1995). Labelingexperiments confirm significant carbon fluxes throughthese pathways and through the glyoxylate cycle, non-photosynthetic one-carbon metabolism, and the syn-thesis of Glu and Arg (Bago et al., 1999). Germinatingspores also take up hexose, though to a lesser extentthan intraradical hyphae. Despite evidence for label-ing of lipids from14C acetate (Beilby, 1983), our13C labeling experiments indicate that the synthesisof storage FAs in the asymbiotic phase is not a signif-icant flux (Bago et al., 1999). Because TAG is the majorcarbon storage compound in AM fungal spores, it istempting to speculate that it is the absence of FAsynthesis that prevents the asymbiotic fungus fromforming new propagules, making it an obligatesymbiont.FUTURE DIRECTIONSFigures 2 and 3 illustrate what we know about themain fluxes of carbon; by omission, they also embodyour ignorance. Among the topics requiring attentionare: (a) completing the identification of metabolicpathways active in the different phases of the fungus,(b) molecular characterization and in situ localizationof plant and fungal carbon transporters, and (c) iden-tification of the enzymes governing flux through thedifferent metabolic pathways, and molecular charac-terization of the fungal genes encoding them. Knowl-edge in these areas will provide the context and toolsfor tackling the most important questions about car-bon flows in the AM symbiosis—these concern thespatial and temporal regulation of carbon flows bydevelopment, signaling, and environment.Received March 22, 2000; accepted June 21, 2000.Figure 3.
