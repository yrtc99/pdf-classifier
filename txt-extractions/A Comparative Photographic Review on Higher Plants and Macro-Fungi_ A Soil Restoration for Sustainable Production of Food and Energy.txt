There are a lot ofsimilar characteristics between mushrooms and higher plants, but there are also many differencesamong them, especially from the human health point of view. The absences of both chlorophyllcontent and the ability to form their own food are the main differences between mushrooms andhigher plants. The main similar attributes found in both mushrooms and higher plants are representedin their nutritional and medicinal activities. The ﬁndings of this review have a number of practicalimplications. A lot of applications in different ﬁelds could be found also for both mushrooms andhigher plants, especially in the bioenergy, bioreﬁnery, soil restoration, and pharmaceutical ﬁelds, butthis study is the ﬁrst report on a comparative photographic review between them. An implicationof the most important ﬁndings in this review is that both mushrooms and plants should be takeninto account when integrated food and energy are needed. These ﬁndings will be of broad useto the scientiﬁc and biomedical communities. Further investigation and experimentation into theintegration and production of food crops and mushrooms are strongly recommended under differentenvironmental conditions, particularly climate change.Keywords: phytoremediation; food crops; energy crops; polluted soils; plant mineralnutrients; phytomedicine1. IntroductionA great challenge faces humanity in producing edible plants, which should containenough amounts of mineral nutrients, and are required for human nutrition [ 1]. Althoughboth plants and humans require, in general, the same mineral elements for their healthygrowth and development, the ideal future crops for human nutrition should not includetoxic elements in the edible parts [ 2,3]. Mineral elements in the soil are taken up by theplant roots and transported to the edible parts for human consumption through variousdifferent transporters. Therefore, several studies focus on the edible plants from differentpoints of view for human health, including ( i) studies of plant functional traits for humanhealth, especially unconventional edible plants [ 4–6]; (ii) producing biofortiﬁed plantswith a focus on the malnutrition/medicinal attributes [ 7–12], (iii) nutritional aspects ofplant-based diets for human diseases [ 13–15], (iv) studies of plant secondary metabolitesSustainability 2022 ,14, 7104. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14127104 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 2 of 33and their extraction as bioactive compounds [ 16,17], (v) anti-nutrients of major plant-basedfoods [ 18], (vi) food security and plant nutrition under problems of climate change [ 19],and ( vii) using mushrooms as bioindicators for pollution and its risks to health [20].The production of enough food for the global population needs more efforts to exploitevery inch to cultivate and produce foods, as well as energy at the same time, because foodand energy are essential components for human life and sustainable development [ 21].The production of food and energy gives rise to competition for cultivated soil. Thearable land that is already used for the cultivation of foods should be increased for morefood production, without any deducted lands for energy production. There is a difﬁcultequation concerning the energy–food nexus, which should be solved as reported in manystudies on the energy–food nexus from different points of view, such as the productionof biofuel based on the water–food–energy nexus [ 22], rice production and its nexus offood–energy–emissions [23], the scarcity risk of the energy–food nexus [ 21], and sustainabledairy farming under the security of energy, food, and water [ 24]. New non-exploited areassuch as polluted or marginal soils for energy production through soil restoration areconsidered sustainable solutions for producing energy [25].Higher plants and macro-fungi (mushrooms) are important species, which have manycommon attributes (e.g., the nutritional and medicinal ones), although they have many dif-ferences. Higher plants can form their own food (which contains chlorophyll as autotrophic)from sunlight, water, and CO 2, whereas mushrooms as saprophytes can biodegrade deadorganic matter by extracting enzymes [ 26]. Fungi are considered, in general, decomposers,pathogens, parasites, or mutualists [27].Therefore, this review is a comparative study between mushrooms as macro-fungiand higher plants from mainly the human health point of view. This review includes alsophytomedicine and its potential for human health, the unconventional foods derived fromplants and mushrooms, soil degradation and its restoration by plants and mushrooms, theintegrated production of food and energy, and ﬁnally the agro-integration between foodcrops and mushrooms.2. Methodology of the ReviewThis review depended on collecting available published materials from the mainwebsites of major publishers such as Frontiers, Elsevier (ScienceDirect), Springer, Multi-disciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) journals, medical publications at the U.S.National Institute of Health’s National Library of Medicine (PubMed Central or PMC), etc.The main keywords were higher plants and macro-fungi, with the search broadened to in-clude the words “sustainability”, “plant nutrition”, “unconventional food”, “mushrooms”,“soil restoration”, “food crops”, and “energy crops”. The main steps used in this reviewincluded the building of a table of contents after intensive reading, searching suggestedtitles or sections, sorting the collected published materials (original articles, reviews, books,and chapters) based on the reputation of both authors and the journal, and then startingto write down the manuscript. At least ﬁve essential components of a successful reviewshould be found; (1) the update and clear idea, (2) harmony and logical arrangement oftheir contents, (3) survey studies concerning some selected sections in the review throughsome comprehensive and very update tables, (4) photos and drawing ﬁgures are importantin delivering the idea of the review faster than words, and (5) cited literature reviews, usedin this review. This is the ﬁrst report on a comparative photographic study on mushroomsand plants, which included many photos and drawing ﬁgures in this context.3. Plant and Human Nutrition for SustainabilityNutrition in plants and human presents many similarities and differences. It is theprocess of obtaining or providing the organism with food necessary for its growth and health.Several differences in the nutrition of plants and humans can be listed in Table 1. This nutritionhas a strong link to Sustainable Development Goals as a part of the global public agenda,which can contribute to the structuring of global sciences and research [ 28]. Not surprisingly ,Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 3 of 33considering the lessons learned from Covid-19, the required scientific studies should focus onthe area of sustainability and human health [ 28,29]. Richardson and Lovegrove [ 29] reportedon the nutritional status of some micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Se, and Zn, and vitamin D, A, Bvitamins, and vitamin C) and their possible and modifiable risk factor for COVID-19, whichsupport the normal functions of the human immune system. They confirmed that avoidingdeficiencies in the intakes of these micronutrients in patients could strengthen their resilienceto the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally , a number of important nutrients need to be consideredthat could be found in vegetables, fruits, or edible plants (Figure 1).Table 1. The main difference between the nutrition of both plants and humans.Comparison Item Plant Nutrition Human NutritionForming own food They can because of chlorophyll They cannotMain requirements for nutritionPlants need sunlight, CO 2and wateras autotrophicThey metabolize large food molecules asheterotrophicFinal product from nutrition Mainly glucose, energy, and oxygenAmino acids, monosaccharides, fattyacids, and glycerolMain organs involved in the nutritionLeaves, including their components(chloroplasts, xylem, and phloem)Mouth, esophagus, stomach, smallintestine and the large intestineAmino acids formingUptake of N, converted to NH 3, form aminoacids and then proteinsAmino acids can be obtained from thebreakdown of proteinsGetting energyBoth photosynthesis and respiration can beused for forming energy (ATP)Only the respiration process can produceenergy (ATP)Storage of carbohydrates Plants can store glucose in the form of starchHumans can store glucose in the formof glycogenEnzymes involvedDuring nutritional processes, many enzymes:amylase, cellulase, lipase, phosphatase,phytase and ureaseDuring metabolism, the main nutrientsare carbohydrates, forming glucose,lipids (fatty acid) & proteins(amino acids)Essential elements for bothplants/humansC, H, O, N, P , K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cl,Mo, Ni, ZnC, H, O, N, P , K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu,Cl, Mo, Ni, ZnSuggested as essential Al, Co, Se, Si, Na As, F, Si, V , Cr, Sn, NiEssential element (only) B Na, Co, I, SeSources: [2,30–33].Due to healthy nutrition being the backbone for human health, there is an urgent needto explain the advances in nutrition science during the next years under the “One Health”initiative [ 34]. Food supply chains should follow a sustainable food system (by reducingfood wastes and losses) in vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms under a circular economystrategy [ 35–37]. The most important nutrition issues and their role in sustainabilityincluded the potential of functional food for human health, attaining sustainable foodsystems, the global crisis of production of healthy and sustainable proteins, nutrigenomicsand personalized nutrition, immunometabolism and nutritional immunology, performancenutrition, managing old/new pandemics such as obesity and COVID-19, human gutmicrobiomes and nutrition, nutrition and brain functions, fasting and identifying alternativedietary strategies, human nutrition types (i.e., basic, applied, and clinical nutrition), andnutritional aspects of emerging technologies [ 18,28,38,39]. Therefore, several books havebeen published recently on the role of medicinal plants and human health, such as Frazierand Matthew [ 40], Goyal and Ayeleso [ 41], Suleria and Barrow [ 42], Goyal et al. [ 43], Goyaland Chauhan [44], Suleria et al. [45], Goyal et al. [46], and Masoodi and Rehman [14,15].Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 4 of 33Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 4 of 33   Figure 1.

All photos by El-Ramady . As an important component of the human diet, proteins derived from plants are con-sidered more sustainable sources compared to protein-derived from animals, because plant proteins have many eco-benefits including higher eco-sustainability to maintain eco-stability, greater food safety , fulfilling higher consumer needs, food affo rdability, and combating of "protein–energy malnutrition" [ 47]. Several studies have been published on plant-based proteins as a good source of many essential amino acids (serine, glycine, va-line, alanine, cysteine, etc.), vital macro-nutrients, and are sufficient to achieve complete protein nutrition to sustain a better life for humans [19,48–51]. Along with providing amino acids in foods, protein can play a potential role in food formulations due to their distinguishing properties, including emulsification, water holding, gelling, foaming, thickening ability, and fat absorption capacity [52,53]. The main sources of plant-based proteins include many crops such as cereals (wheat (9.3–12.3%), rice (5.8–11%), maize (9–11%), barley (12%), and sorghum (11%)), le gumes (chickpea (19–27%) pea (23–31%), soy-bean (37–44%), kidney bean (22–32%), faba bean (31%), lentil (23–36%), lupin (32–55%), and cowpea (28%)), pseudo-cereals (amarant h (14.5%), buckwheat (14.8%), and quinoa (13%)), nuts (peanuts (25–29%), almonds (29.9%),  cashew nut (22.7%), Brazil nuts (19.7%)), and seeds (cottonseeds (38–45 %), flax seeds (21–26%), su nflower (21–32%), pumpkin seeds (36.5%), and sesame se eds (18%)) [19,54,5 5]. Besides seaweed as a sustainable aquatic plant-based protein [3], and the previous non-traditional sources, there are many alternative plant-based proteins as reported in many publications [56–59]. These alterna-tives may include pea protein isolate (86%) [60], pulse protein ingredients [55], and using Figure 1.

There is also an ongoing need for global abundant sourcesof high-quality proteins for human nutrition. The plant’s nutritional quality is controlledby several factors as presented in Figure 2. These factors include soil, plant climate, andenvironmental conditions. These factors may also control the kind of protein in manycrops such as cereal proteins, which are low in their contents of amino acids (e.g., lysine,tryptophan, and threonine), whereas the proteins of vegetables and legumes have a loweramount of S-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine [47].Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 5 of 33  proteins of lentil and quinoa alternative proteins in dairy [61].

Phytomedicine and Human Health The science of producing medicines from herbs or medicinal plants could be defined as phytomedicine. The historical background of this science may date back to early in human evolution or several thousand years ago, when humans isolated, extracted and purified many drugs from medicinal plants in ancient times for human health [62]. Phy-tomedicine also involves all clinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and toxicity-based studies of medicinal plan ts besides the exploring of different mechanisms of herb extracts [63]. Medicinal plants are in a continuous process of exploration, resulting in the unearthing of novel plant-based pharmaceut icals to understand the molecular mecha-nisms of conventional medication and its active ingredients, which may help the Figure 2.

Phytomedicine may in-clude several issues such as using medicinal plants as wound healing agents [ 64,65], naturalanti-microbials from plants [ 66], herbal therapy or remedies [ 67], herbal cosmeticology [ 68],phytopharmaceuticals [ 69,70], phyto-pharmacology [ 71] using the herbal bioactivities indrug delivery systems like the ocular [ 72], pulmonary [ 73], transdermal [ 74], and vaginaland rectal drug delivery systems [ 75]. Therefore, it is very important to know exactly whatwe eat to stay healthy for a long time as conveyed by the term “nutraceuticals” [ 76]. Thisterm was coined by Stephen De-Felice, who referred to pharmaceuticals and nutrients.There are many different kinds of nutraceuticals, such as dietary supplements, functionalfoods, dietary ﬁbers, medical foods, prebiotics, and probiotics. Nutraceuticals can improvehuman health through enhancing the absorption of nutrients, supporting the micro-ﬂora ofthe gastrointestinal system, and increasing detoxiﬁcation. Nutraceuticals may have somelimitations, including their slow mode of action and lack of strict control over the qualityand concentration of ingredients [76].Chinese herbal medicines are very common and widely used for treating severaldiseases in Chinese people as a source of bioactive ingredients, which have been extractedfrom herbs for therapeutic properties. The most well-known example of this medicine isthe use of artemisinin to inhibit malaria by Nobel laureate Youyou Tu in 2015 [ 77]. Manymedicinal plants can produce essential oil, which is considered a rich product of bioactivessuch as royal jasmine ( Jasminum grandiﬂorum L.) and orange trees ( Citrus aurantium L.)(Figure 3). Several bioactive ingredients have already been extracted from many naturalmedicinal plants such as ailanthone, artesunate, berberine, baicalin, curcumin, corylin, ori-donin, triptolide/triptonide, shikonin, paeoniﬂorin, paeoniﬂorin, and soybean isoﬂavones(Figure 4).

In Table 2, the most common bioactivecompounds in some medicinal plants and their pharmacological activities could be noticed.These bioactives may include main groups (i.e., phenolic compounds, flavonoids, carbohy-drates, proteins, and terpenes), which have distinguished pharmacological activities such asantimicrobial, antidiuretic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory , analgesic and hypolipidemic activi-ties. The main differences among these medicinal plants may be represented in the commonkind of bioactives, such as phenolic compounds (i.e., gingerols, paradols, and shogaols) inginger, tannic acid and alkaloids (e.g., salvadorine) in miswak, and others (Table 2).It is well known that plants have been consumed by humans for thousands of yearsas a source of daily necessities and food supply. Plants also have been applied in severalﬁelds, including infrastructure, papermaking, production of perfumes and spices as wellas applications for the treatment and prophylaxis of various diseases [ 94]. Therefore,traditional herbal medicine can be expressed as the use of plants or herbs as remediesin medicine in the following forms of herbal materials, herbs, herbal preparations, andﬁnished herbal products containing active ingredients derived from plants/plant materials,according to the deﬁnition of the WHO [ 94]. Nano-formulated herbal bioactive could beapplied for treating many human diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, which canbe nano-formulated using curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol, rutin, piperine, gallic acid,ferulic acid, and selenium [ 95]. There are many systems for delivering herbal bioactive-based nano-drugs, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, niosomes, phytosome, polymericmicelles, nanoparticles, nanogels/hydrogel, and other novel drug delivery systems herbalformulations [87].5. Higher Plants and Mushrooms: A General ComparisonHigher plants have many similarities and differences to macro-fungi (mushrooms)as presented in Figure 6A,B. Both higher plants and mushrooms are living organismsbelonging to one domain (Eukarya) and are considered, in general, vegetarian as wellas both of them possessing distinguishing attributes for human health. High plants arelocated in the Kingdom of Plantae, but mushrooms are in the Kingdom of Fungi. They canalso be used as edible sources for medicinal activities.There are also many differences between them, especially the nutrition mode, whichdepends on their content of pigments or chlorophyll, as well as the reproduction method,and the main structure of each one. From this point, mushrooms are fungi organisms thathave no chlorophyll; thus, they cannot form their own food, but they are saprophytes (canrelease some enzymes to biodegrade organic matters and convert them into simple com-pounds to obtain their necessary foods). The main method for reproduction of mushroomsis by spores, and not all mushrooms can be cultivated like plants [ 26,96,97]. Some speciesof both higher plants and mushrooms have nutritional and medicinal attributes, and arecalled medicinal plants or mushrooms. There are several kinds of mushrooms, which canin general be categorized into edible, medicinal and poisonous mushrooms, as reportedby El-Ramady et al. [ 36]. More dimensions for the sustainable applications of mushroomscould be found in Elsakhawy et al. [ 98] and El-Ramady et al. [ 99] whereas the sustainableproduction of medicinal plants is a great challenge, especially under the adverse conditionsreported in detail by Aftab [100].Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 11 of 33Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 11 of 33                                            ( A) Figure 6.

(A) This is the first part of a comparison between higher plants  and mushrooms from different points of view, such as taxonomy (using Jerusalem artichoke as an example of a higher plant and champignon as a mush room), structure, nutrition,  reproduction and growth. ( B) This is the second part of a comparison between higher  plants and mushrooms including more different points of view such as the pi gments, cultivation and their nutritional/medicinal attributes. 6. Unconventional Foods of Plants and Mushrooms There are several classificati ons of plants, which depend on a specific categories such as higher and lower plants based on the exis tence of flowers or vascular system; common and unconventional edible plants; traditional and modern wild edible plants [101]; culti-vated and wild edible plants [37], and conventi onal and unconventional food plants [102]. The common attributes that can be existed in edible mushrooms and edible plants are being consumable foods and having a nutritional value, such as desirable content of pro-teins, carbohydrates, or vitamins. Many st udies on unconventional foods derived from plants or mushrooms have been published in  different locations all over the world for plants [102–104] or mushrooms [105,106]. Increasing attention has been noticed to this group of underutilized plants, which have many different terms such as unconventional vegetables or traditional vegetables, alternative food plants, famine foods, wild edible plants, and plants for the futu re [103,107]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for uncon-ventional medicinal/food plants with consider ation of their potential under the initiative of “from flask to patient” and “from field to fork” [108].

Unconventional Foods of Plants and MushroomsThere are several classiﬁcations of plants, which depend on a speciﬁc categories suchas higher and lower plants based on the existence of ﬂowers or vascular system; commonand unconventional edible plants; traditional and modern wild edible plants [ 101]; culti-vated and wild edible plants [ 37], and conventional and unconventional food plants [ 102].The common attributes that can be existed in edible mushrooms and edible plants arebeing consumable foods and having a nutritional value, such as desirable content of pro-teins, carbohydrates, or vitamins. Many studies on unconventional foods derived fromplants or mushrooms have been published in different locations all over the world forplants [ 102–104] or mushrooms [ 105,106]. Increasing attention has been noticed to thisgroup of underutilized plants, which have many different terms such as unconventionalvegetables or traditional vegetables, alternative food plants, famine foods, wild edibleplants, and plants for the future [ 103,107]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for unconven-Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 13 of 33tional medicinal/food plants with consideration of their potential under the initiative of“from ﬂask to patient” and “from ﬁeld to fork” [108].There are many innovative technologies in food production acting as food frontiers,which can achieve eco-sustainability and the security of global food, seeking for moresustainable future. These food frontiers may include controlled-environment agricul-ture [ 109], climate-driven northern agricultural expansion [ 110], cellular agriculture [ 111],entomophagy [ 112] and seaweed aquaculture [ 3,113,114]. Based on the single-cell pro-tein in macro-fungi/mushrooms, many possibilities exist to use agricultural residues andwastes because of their fast growth, high cell densities, long history of use, and simplereactor design. However, they have many challenges, including a need for non-food carbonsubstrates and a possibility for existing mycotoxins [ 111]. The main target that attractsseveral scientists all over the world is how to ﬁnd “plant protein-based meat and dairyanalogues” especially under climate change [ 115–117], and single-cell proteins derivedfrom mushrooms as reported by Stephan et al. [ 118] in Table 3. Mushrooms contain manybioactive compounds (e.g., phenolics, polysaccharides, polyketides, steroids, triterpenoids,etc.), are considered nutraceuticals, a vegan protein source (up to 45%), and food ﬂavoragents for the food industry [ 119]. The protein content in mushrooms depends mainlyon the mushroom species and the edible part of the mushroom (i.e., fruiting body andmycelium), where the most common mushrooms Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus biosporus , andLentinus edodes (Berg) have protein (%) in fruiting body and mycelium as follows (36 and25.70), (45.9 and 47.1), and (23.5 and 17%), respectively in fruiting body and mycelium [ 119].Table 3. Some examples of plant protein-based meat and dairy analogues and their sources.Source of Proteins (the Country, if Any) Sources of Plant Proteins Refs.Dairy-based protein alternatives (general study) Quinoa and lentil are considered high-digestibility proteins [61]Meat analogues including steak, burgers, meatballs,and cutlets (Italy)Plant steaks, burgers, meatballs, and cutlets [120]Fibrous meat analogues (Poland) Pea protein isolate and oat ﬁber concentrate [121]Innovative approaches for meat production Strategy of adding quinoa or chia to meat products [122]Dairy cheese analogs (the USA) Plant-based cheese analogs [123]Fermented meat sausages (Span and Italy) Plant-based alternatives includes ﬂavor of plant protein isolates [124]Applied binders in meat product (sausages) processing Quinoa ﬂour could be applied as binder in beef sausage production [125]Producing beef burgers formed from ﬂour of quinoa and buckwheatFlour of both quinoa and buckwheat along with soy protein inbeef burgers[126]Meat co-products as a meat replacer (general study) Crops or seaweeds can be replaced by 20% in meat protein [127]Boiled meat sausages (Germany) Pleurotus sapidus as protein in a vegan boiled sausage analog [118]On the other hand, many plants are considered plant-based foods that are rich in theircontent of proteins such as legumes, grains (mainly quinoa), nuts, and certain fruits likeapricots, avocados, guavas, peaches, and raspberries [ 116]. Quinoa, as a pseudo-cereal crop,is considered important protein crop because of its amino acidic profile, gluten-free, highantioxidant content, bioactive properties, high nutrient content (i.e., Ca, P , B, Fe, K, Mg) andvitamins like B1, B2, B3, B6, and E [116]. Quinoa can also be used as an alternative for vegandiets, including in quinoa-based gels [ 128,129], quinoa protein isolates [ 130,131], to producehigh-quality protein and low-cost enriched pasta [ 132], and quinoa protein fortification [ 133].7. Soil Restoration by Plants and MushroomsIt is well known that soil is one of the essential components of all life, and ourlife mainly depends upon it. Soil, as a non-renewable resource, can sustain our life onthe Earth by supporting about 95% of global food production [ 134]. Soils have someessential ecosystem services, such as ﬁltration of pollutants, puriﬁcation of water, biomassproduction, and transfer of energy and mass between spheres [ 134]. In his wonderfulbook “ The Soil–Human Health Nexus ”, Lal [ 135] stated that human health is indivisible, andhas a very strong link to the health of the soil, plants, animals, and the entire ecosystem,Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 14 of 33based on the initiative of “One Health”. He added this ancient proverb “ When food isright, medicine is of no need; when food is wrong, medicine is of no use ”. Therefore, there is astrong need and a global consensus to implement a “ soil protection policy ”, enact the “Soilquality act” and respect the “Rights of soil” [ 135]. Due to misuse of soil resources and soilmismanagement, soil degradation has become a global issue, which impacts the entireenvironment or ecosystems and human health as well. Thus, the soil–human health nexusis considered a very important global issue that can never be over-emphasized.Soil is usually formed under different soil forming factors (i.e., time, topography,organisms, climate and parent material), and forming processes. Based on the kind of parentmaterial, the type of formed soil is determined to form sandy, loamy, clayey, calcareous soil,etc. (Figure 7). Several soils suffer from deterioration, which leads to degraded soil andresults from many human activities such as urbanization, industrialization and civilization(Figure 8). Degraded soils are generally common under different conditions, which arerepresented in the decline of soil organic matter, soil acidiﬁcation and its compaction,the toxicity of pollutants such as heavy metals, intensive use of chemical fertilizers andpesticides, low vegetation, and nutrient deﬁciency (Figure 9). These conditions may changethe dynamics of plant–soil interactions and their outcomes.According to FAO [ 136], the term land degradation is preferable compared to soildegradation and soil erosion, because it has a wider scope, covers all negative changes inthe ecosystem capacity, and provides different services and goods from biological, socialand economic aspects. In this section, soil degradation and its restoration by plants andmushrooms (Figure 10) are discussed. There are many human activities that lead to soildegradation all over the world; for example, in the European Mediterranean region [ 134],chemical degradation resulting from heavy metals in China [ 137], waterlogging and soilsalinity in India [ 138], or pesticides [ 139], physical degradation resulting from soil com-paction [ 140], or environmental degradation due to invasive alien plants [ 141]. Severalstudies have been reported about different strategies for remediation of pollutants or othercauses of soil degradation, which differ using plants or mushrooms. In the case of plants,remediation strategies depend on the type of pollutants (organic or inorganic) and theconcentration. These strategies include bio-electrokinetic remediation [ 142], physicochem-ical remediation methods (such as chelate-assisted phytoextraction), phytohormones orplant growth regulators (e.g., auxins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene,gibberellins, jasmonic acid, polyamines, and nitric oxide), microbe-assisted remediation,plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, inorganic/organic amendments such as biochar,compost, manure for immobilization pollutants in soils, as well as genetic strategies [143].It is well known that environmental pollution was resulted from many anthropogenicactivities such as speedy urbanization, agricultural practices, and rapid industrializa-tion [ 144]. Several pollutants are involved in these activities, including metalloids, heavymetals, agrochemicals, radionuclides, ﬂy ash, and organic compounds [ 145,146]. Phytore-mediation is considered an environmentally and economically favorable technique usinggreen plants to detoxify pollutants from contaminated water and soil. Phytoremediationhas several mechanisms to remove, degrade, or immobilize the pollutants, such as ac-cumulation (by phytoextraction or rhizoﬁltration), degradation (by rhizo-degradation orphytodegradation), dissipation (phytovolatilization), and immobilization by hydrauliccontrol and phytostabilization [ 144]. This mechanism depends upon the type of pollutant,and plant species, which may utilize one or more of these mechanisms [ 147]. Phytore-mediation of metals in polluted soil could be enhanced by using soil earthworm andarbuscular mycorrhizae [ 148]. The main mechanisms that plants can be used in remedia-tion process may include bioremediation, phytoremediation, as reported by many studiessuch as Elallem et al. [149] Bhat et al. [ 150], Oladoye et al. [ 151], Gavrilescu [ 152], andWang et al. [148].Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 15 of 33Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 15 of 33   Figure 7.

The main difference between reme-diation by plants and mushrooms is represented in the mechanism of this process, whichmainly needs enzymes to be achieved in case of mushrooms, but in the case of plants,needs different approaches (Figure 10). The commonality between myco-remediation andphyto-remediation is that both are considered eco-friendly and capable of sustainableremediation of polluted soils as well as having many eco-beneﬁts. The most importantSustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 17 of 33beneﬁts of myco-remediation are the possibility to produce biodiesel or bioenergy, enzymesand biofertilizers after the biodegradation process [36].Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 17 of 33   Figure 9.

The main differences between energy and food crops are listed, along with their limitations as well as different generations of biofuels with some examples. Sources:  Saha et al. [155], and Goria et al. [156]. 7.1. Integrated Production of Food and Energy A great challenge faces the world to produc e enough food for feeding the increasing population, especially under the limitations of global arable lands. This problem has a serious dimension if we need to answer this question: what is the main purpose of global land cultivation: biofuel production from en ergy crops or food production from food crops? This is a very difficult balance, whic h requires us to find and explore new lands, as-yet uncultivated, to cultivate and produce mo re food for the expected larger population in the future [157]. These lands are mainly problematic soils, which suffer from restrictions or obstacles preventing their productivity through the restoration processes such as pol-luted soils, marginal, waterlogged, submerged,  degraded and salt-affected soils. The com-parative items that are needed to identify the positive and negative points of each option may include a large variety of economic, environmental, social , and sustainability aspects. Many suggestions could be applied as strategies and/or alternative choices for green en-ergy supply, sustainability, and enough nutrit ion for the global growing population [157]. It is well known that the global population may reach 10 billion by 2050, which will lead to an increase in the global need for food, water, and energy (Figure 11). Along with energy, there is an urgent need to save suff icient quantities of clean water for different Figure 10.

Along withenergy, there is an urgent need to save sufﬁcient quantities of clean water for differentnatural ecosystems and human societies [ 158]. Why is the integrated production of foodand energy needed? Due to both food and energy being essential for human life and thelimitation of land and water resources, the production of both should be integrated, wherethere is no life without all of them. It is logical to search for non-exploited lands for energyproduction while saving the arable lands for food production, especially under the amazingtechnologies in vertical expansion for both production systems to avoid the conﬂict of“food vs. fuel”. Thus, many dimensions of the food–energy nexus have been explainedin Table 4, which includes different factors that impact this nexus from different pointsof view. The importance of this nexus is increased when associated with water to be thefood–energy–water nexus.Table 4.

Lignocellulosic biomass, as the most abundant bio-renewable materials in the world, can be produced from water and atmos-pheric CO2 through photosynthesis using sunlight energy [173]. This biomass may repre-sent forest residues, crop residues, industrial  wastes, wood crops, municipal solid wastes, and food wastes [172]. The ma in herbaceous energy crops, which are considered the major sources of lignocellulosic biomass, include canary grass ( Phalaris canariensis ), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum ), Miscanthus  (Miscanthus giganteus ), giant reed ( Arundo donax ), alfalfa (Medicago sativa ), and Napier grass ( Pennisetum purpureum ) (Table 5).

The future of renewable fuel re sources and biofuel crops is the main target of climate change for several nations, such as China [174]. As is well known, each energy crop has certain growth conditions starting fr om the growing seeds or tubers till flowering and getting the harvested plant to produce the bioenergy as shown in Figure 12. The grow-ing stage definitely differs from the processing stage for energy production, which de-pends on the plant species. Figure 11.

There isno subject discussed and reports on energy as published during 2022 (till 11 May 2022) byScienceDirect about “ Crop and Energy ” 13,833 published materials, and a similar number(13,957) by SpringerLink. The future of renewable fuel resources and biofuel crops isthe main target of climate change for several nations, such as China [ 174]. As is wellknown, each energy crop has certain growth conditions starting from the growing seeds ortubers till ﬂowering and getting the harvested plant to produce the bioenergy as shownin Figure 12. The growing stage deﬁnitely differs from the processing stage for energyproduction, which depends on the plant species.Table 5.

Integrating Food Crops and MushroomsIntegration in agricultural sectors is very important as a general target for sustainableagriculture, in particular the production of food and energy. Mushrooms represent animportant source of non-traditional food for human nutrition. So, the marketing of mush-rooms includes cultivated edible (54%), medicinal mushrooms (38%), and wild mushrooms(8%) [ 183]. Mushrooms are also being considered as second-generation biofuels, and thisdoes not compete with the production of foods; the cultivation of mushrooms and theirwaste recycling should be exploited for a circular bioeconomy [ 184]. Agro-wastes couldbe also bio-converted and composted with wastes of dairy foods during the cultivationof mushrooms [ 185]. Cultivation of edible and/or medicinal mushrooms is a sustainablefood–energy production system because they can mainly cultivate agro-wastes and/oragro-industrial residues as well as the wastes of their cultivation (spent mushroom sub-strate or SMS) themselves, which can be used in bioenergy production. Therefore, thiscombination of food–energy production by mushrooms is considered an integrated formof production as reported in the case of production of mushrooms and tomatoes underthe circular bioeconomy approach [ 186]. The co-cultivation of plants (e.g. vegetables) andSustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 23 of 33mushrooms has been reported in many studies, which leads to higher yields and higherbiomass production, due to the impacts of mushroom hyphae in increasing the availabilityof water and minerals around plant roots [186,187].Sustainability  2022 , 14, 7104 22 of 33   I.

General DiscussionA variety of applications of mushrooms in the agricultural, medicinal, and pharma-ceutical ﬁelds are well known. Although this review focuses on the comparison betweenmushrooms and higher plants, the ﬁndings will have a bearing on the co-cultivation ofmushrooms and cultivated plants as an agro-sustainable approach. Returning to the mainquestions posed at the beginning of this study, it is now possible to state that the answer tothe previous questions could be mentioned in brief as follows:What is the preferable for soil restoration food crops or energy crops, or mushrooms?In general, energy crops (especially non-edible crops) are preferable plants for problematicsoils, since they have the ability to reclaim these soils, are tolerant to stressful conditions inthese soils, and could save arable soils for food production. Mushrooms have many beneﬁtsin the respiration of degraded soils through many biochemical processes resulting from theenzymatic activities of mushrooms, such as decomposition, biodegradation, bio-weathering,bioconversion, and biosorption. Mushrooms also have the ability to increase soil aggregates,promote biodegradation of pollutants, and enhance the nutrient bioavailability in soil [ 194].What is the possibility for sustainable production of both food crops and mushrooms?The sustainable agriculture for both mushrooms and cultivated plants could be achievedunder the co-cultivation of mushrooms and vegetables as an integrated system for foods andmushrooms production. This approach will prove useful in expanding our understandingof how the cultivated mushrooms can support the growth and productivity of co-cultivatedvegetables at the same time. Co-cultivation of mushrooms and lettuce can reduce theaccumulated CO 2emission into the air by 80.6%, due to the ability of mushrooms tosupport cultivated lettuce by CO 2resulting from the respiration of mushrooms. Thiscontinuous cultivation system of both mushrooms and lettuce can reduce CO 2emissionsinto the air and achieve sustainable agriculture [ 195]. The circular bioeconomy approachcould be realized for the integrated production of foods and mushrooms. Different agro-Sustainability 2022 ,14, 7104 25 of 33industrial residues could be managed in a sustainable approach through motivating the useof these residues for the production of both vegetables and mushrooms or fungi culture.9. Conclusions and Future PerspectivesThis is the ﬁrst study to report a photographic comparison between mushrooms andplants. This comparison that we have identiﬁed therefore assists in our understanding ofthe role of both mushrooms and cultivated plants especially towards the circular biore-ﬁnery approach. The ﬁndings from this study make several contributions to the currentliterature. First, several similar and differences are be noticed between mushrooms andplants. Second, the most important difference lies in the fact that plants have the abilityto make their own food (autotrophic), due to the existence of chlorophyll, whereas mush-rooms are saprophytic organisms. Third, the co-cultivation of mushrooms and vegetablesis an integrated and sustainable production system. Fourth, mushrooms are considered asustainable solution for bioenergy and bioreﬁnery. Although the study has successfullydemonstrated that mushrooms and plants could be integrated in many different agricul-tural, medicinal, and pharmaceutical practices, it has certain limitations in terms of theharmony between mushrooms and cultivated crops. It is suggested that the association ofthese factors is investigated in future studies to make precise criteria for this co-cultivationof mushrooms and plants. It is suggested that before the generalization is introduced, manyco-attributes between mushroom and plants should be carried out on the phytomedicinaland ecotoxicological attributes. This review also focused on the phytomedicine and itspotential for human health, the unconventional foods derived from plants and mushrooms,soil degradation and its restoration by plants and mushrooms, the integrated productionof food and energy, and ﬁnally the agro-integration between food crops and mushrooms.This review may open new windows concerning the urgent strategy for producing foodand energy at the same time.Author Contributions: J.P . and H.E.-R. developed the idea and outline of the review.
