Paired carbon and nitrogen metabolism by ammonia-oxidizingbacteria and archaea in temperate forest soils. Ecosphere 6(10):176. http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00299.1Abstract. Nitrification is a biologically mediated nutrient transformation, which influences theavailability of inorganic nitrogen to other microorganisms and plants and mediates mobility of nitrogenin the environment. Ammonia oxidation, the rate-limiting step of nitrification, is performed by two groupsof microbes: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) that couple this process with thechemoautotrophic fixation of carbon. Due to the energetic constraints on these organisms, both AOA andAOB likely oxidize large amounts of ammonia to fix relatively small amounts of carbon in naturalenvironments. Here we sought to investigate paired carbon and nitrogen metabolism by AOA and AOB inforest soils. To accomplish this objective, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) toquantify changes in AOA and AOB ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA ) genes during in situincubations. We then used qPCR data alongside AOA and AOB community profiles at each site to convertchanges in amoA gene copy number to carbon accumulation by each group. Finally, we regressed group-specific carbon accumulation values against observed values of NO3/C0accumulation to establish cross-siterelationships between ammonia oxidation and carbon accumulation by each group. By this procedure weestimated that forest soil AOA oxidized 59.8 lg of ammonia-N to add 1 lg of carbon to biomass, whileforest soil AOB oxidized 58.2 lg of ammonia-N to add 1 lg of carbon to biomass. These findings representthe first field-based estimates of paired carbon and nitrogen metabolism by these organisms, and could beused to inform microbially explicit models of nitrification in forest soils.Key words: ammonia oxidation; archaea; bacteria; forest soil; nitrification.Received 2 September 2014; revised 19 January 2015; accepted 30 March 2015; published 16 October 2015.Corresponding Editor: M.

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)were first isolated in the late 1800s and were longthought to be the only organisms capable ofoxidizing ammonia in natural systems. However,the first ammonia-oxidizing archaeon (AOA) wasisolated in 2005 (Ko Â¨nneke et al. 2005) and theseorganisms were soon found to co-occur withAOB in soils from a range of temperate biomes(Leininger et al. 2006). Both AOA and AOB usethe energy they acquire from ammonia oxidationto fuel chemoautotrophic growth. The lowenergy yield of this process likely means thatthese organisms must oxidize large quantities ofammonia to fuel small amounts of carbonvwww.esajournals.org 1 October 2015 vVolume 6(10) vArticle 176fixation. Here we sought investigate the explicitlinks between carbon and nitrogen metabolism innatural temperate forest soil AOA and AOBduring in situ net nitrification incubations.Estimating how much carbon each group accu-mulates from ammonia oxidation in the fieldallowed us to assess the relative importance ofeach group to this ecosystem-level process andinvestigate group-level differences in pairedcarbon and nitrogen metabolism in temperateforest soils.Several studies have investigated paired car-bon and nitrogen metabolism of AOA and AOBby incubating soils in the lab, and comparingobserved rates of ammonia oxidation to eithergrowth of AOA and AOB as estimated by qPCR(e.g., Di et al. 2009, 2010, Jia and Conrad 2009,Schauss et al. 2009, Gubry-Rangin et al. 2010,Onodera et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2010), orinorganic carbon assimilation by AOA andAOB as measured by stable isotope probing(SIP; e.g., Jia and Conrad 2009, Zhang et al. 2010,2012, Pratscher et al. 2011). Both approaches relyon incubations conducted at constant tempera-ture, moisture, and oxygen concentrations, whichare not characteristic of actual field conditions.Furthermore, many of these studies often includethe addition of ammonium, which likely favorsthe growth of AOB (Martens-Habbena et al.2009). Here we estimated carbon accumulationby AOA and AOB along with nitrate accumula-tion during buried-bag incubations, in which un-amended soils are divided into polyethylenebags and incubated in the ground from whichthey were collected (sensu Eno 1960), in severallong-term temperate forest study sites at theCoweeta Hydrological Laboratory, in Otto, NC,USA. This field-based approach ensured thatAOA and AOB were exposed to environmentallyrelevant temperature regimes, nitrogen concen-trations, moisture conditions, and dissolvedoxygen concentrations during incubation. Wethen used multiple linear regression and a modelselection procedure to link carbon accumulationby each group to the total amount of nitrateaccumulation across incubations.We predicted that AOA would be the domi-nant ammonia oxidizers in temperate forest soilecosystems, because these soils are generallyacidic and contain low levels of ammonium;conditions that have been shown to favor AOArather than AOB activity (e.g., Nicol et al. 2008,Martens-Habbena et al. 2009). Furthermore, wepredicted that we would find group leveldifferences in paired carbon and nitrogen metab-olism between AOA and AOB due to group-leveldifferences in ammonia uptake affinities andmechanisms for ammonia capture (e.g., Mar-tens-Habbena et al. 2009, Gorman-Lewis et al.2014).METHODSSite selectionThis study was conducted at Coweeta Hydro-logic Laboratory, a Long Term Ecological Re-search site located in the Appalachian Mountainsof North Carolina, USA. Coweeta is a humid,temperate forest system, with a history ofexperimental watershed-level manipulations(Swank and Vose 1997). This variation in land-use history has contributed to significant varia-tion in soil chemistry and watershed-level nitro-gen export within the Coweeta Basin (Swank andVose 1997; Adams et al. 2014).Three sampling positions were located alongstream-to-hillslope transects within each of fourexperimental watersheds (WS) at Coweeta, for atotal of 12 sampling sites. We chose sites withinthe following watersheds at Coweeta: WS18, areference watershed that has no history ofdisturbance since 1927; WS7, which was clearcut in 1977 using cable-logging; WS6, which wasclear-cut, burned, limed, and fertilized from1965-1967; and WS17, which was clear cut, thenreplanted in white pine in 1956. These differencesin land use history have resulted in differences innitrogen export as well (Swank and Vose 1997),with WS 18 exhibiting the lowest level ofnitrogen export (0.09 kg inorganic nitrogen-N/hectare 3year), followed by WS 7 (0.64 kginorganic nitrogen-N/hectare 3year), WS 17 (1.00kg inorganic nitrogen-N/hectare 3year), andfinally WS 6 with the highest level of nitrogenexport (7.09 kg inorganic nitrogen-N/hectare 3year). By performing incubations in these water-sheds we hoped to sample the breadth ofnitrogen availability and soil pH in this system;changes in these conditions were expected tocontribute to differences in habitat suitability forAOA and AOB (sensu Nicol et al. 2008, Martens-Habbena et al. 2009).vwww.esajournals.org 2 October 2015 vVolume 6(10) vArticle 176NORMAN ET AL. 21508925, 2015, 10, Downloaded from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00299.1 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

The number in the site namerefers to the watershed in which the samplingsite was located as discussed above. The letterrefers to the position of the site along the stream-to-hillslope sampling transect as follows: A refersto 5 m from the stream, B refers to 10 m from thestream, C refers to 25 m from the stream.Buried-bag incubationsAt each site, we collected approximately 1 kgof soil from the top 5 cm of the soil profile. Thesoil was then sieved to remove small rocks andfine roots, and the sieved soil was then dividedinto sterile Whirl-Pak bags containing ;100 g soileach. Three replicate bags from each site werestored at 4 8C prior to processing and analysis ofday 0 soil conditions (day 0 soils), and threereplicate bags were incubated in the ground forapproximately 1 month (day 30 soils) to estimatenet rates of total ammonia oxidation by NO3/C0accumulation (sensu Eno 1960) along withgrowth of AOA and AOB by AOA and AOBcarbon accumulation. Day 30 bags from one sitein WS 7 were damaged in transport, and this site(7C) was excluded from further analysis.NO 3/C0accumulation measurementsNO 3/C0accumulation was measured as an indexof ammonia oxidation in each bag. While otherfluxes including heterotrophic nitrification, deni-trification, and nitrate uptake could have affectedNO 3/C0accumulation rates during incubation,buried-bag estimates of nitrification assume thatthese fluxes are minor in comparison to theactions of nitrifying microorganisms. The meth-ods we applied to measure NO 3/C0capture soilNO 2/C0as well and therefore NO 3/C0accumulationserves as an estimate of ammonia oxidationregardless of the activity of nitrite oxidizingbacteria.We measured soil water content along with theconcentration of NO 3/C0from each day 0 and day30 bag and then used the numbers to calculateNO 3/C0accumulation rates per gram dry weight(dw) of soil as follows. Soil water content wasmeasured as weight loss from 10 g of soil afterovernight incubation at 105 8C. Inorganic nitro-gen, including NO3/C0, was extracted from soils in2M KCl (Bundy and Meisinger 1994). Extractswere filtered, and NO 3/C0was measured using aLachat Quickchem flow injection autoanalyzer(Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado, USA).Values were reported as lgN O 3-N/g dw soil,respectively. NO 3/C0accumulation was calculatedper g dw of soil in each day 30 bag by Eq. 1.NO/C03accumulation Â¼day 30 NO/C03=g dw soil/C0avg:day 0 NO/C03=g dw soil Ã°1ÃCarbon accumulation by AOA and AOBBy excluding plant demand for ammoniagenerated by mineralization, conditions createdduring buried-bag incubations can increase theabundance of ammonia oxidizers, even withoutnutrient amendment (Norman and Barrett 2014).AOA carbon accumulation and AOB carbonaccumulation were estimated as metrics of netprimary production by each group. We calculat-ed AOA and AOB carbon accumulation byextracting DNA from soils, estimating the abun-dance of group-specific ammonia monooxygen-ase subunit A ( amoA ) genes in DNA extracts fromeach day 0 and day 30 bag using quantitativePCR (qPCR), converting these numbers to esti-mates of biomass carbon based on communitystructure data and culture-based estimates, andusing these numbers to estimate rates of carbonaccumulation as follows.DNA extraction and qPCRWe extracted DNA from each bag of soil usingPowerSoil DNA isolation kits (MO BIO Labora-tories, California, USA). Kit protocols werefollowed, except that the final elution step alteredto include two separate additions of 75 lLo fsolution C6, designed to maximize DNA extrac-tion efficiency. A Nanodrop spectrophotometer(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachu-setts, USA) was used to measure the 260/280 ratioof each extract. This ratio exceeded 1.8 in everyextract, indicating that DNA was of high qualitywith low humic contamination.AOA and AOB amoA abundances were esti-mated in day 0 and day 30 samples using SYBR-green based qPCR with Domain-specific primers,including amoA-1F (Stephen et al. 1998) andamoA-2R (Rotthauwe et al. 1997) for AOB, andCrenamoA23f and CrenamoA616r (Tourna et al.2008) for AOA.

Standard curve r2valuesranged between 0.998 and 0.999 for AOB and0.984 and 0.995 for AOA; standard curveefficiency values ranged between 81 %and 85 %for AOB and 84 %and 89 %for AOA. Standardcurve efficiency values could not be improvedwithout increasing the amplification of non-specific products in some samples as assessedby melt curve analysis and verified by agarosegel electrophoresis.Fifty microliter reactions contained 25 lLo fQuantitect SYBR green PCR mix (Qiagen, Venlo,Netherlands), 0.2 mg/mL BSA, and 0.5 lMo feach primer for AOB amoA enumeration, or 1.5lM of each primer for AOA amoA enumeration.We initially added 50 ng of template DNA inboth AOA and AOB reactions, but had to re-runall AOB reactions for one site with 250 ngtemplate DNA in order to achieve a detectionlimit of .10 copies per reaction, and had to re-run all AOA reactions for another site with 1.25ng of template DNA in order to eliminate theformation of non-specific PCR products. Thoughwe did not intentionally test for PCR inhibition insamples or differences in reaction efficiencybetween unknown samples and standards (asrecommended most-recently by Hargreaves et al.2013), we obtained similar estimates of amoA /gdw of soil within samples during testing foroptimization of template concentrations acrossthe ranges of template addition tested (1.25â250ng per reaction) when samples were not belowdetection. This indicates both a lack of PCRinhibition and that sample reaction efficiencieswere similar to unknown reaction efficiencies.The use of 50 lL reactions (the maximum volumeallowed in the thermocycler) was also designedto dilute out any PCR inhibitors that soil DNAextracts may have contained. The thermal proto-col for both AOA and AOB was 95 8Cf o r1 5minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 8C for 15seconds, 53 8C for 30 seconds, 72 8C for 1 minute.All values were reported as either AOA or AOBamoA /g dw soil.Converting gene copy number estimatesto carbon accumulationWe estimated AOA and AOB carbon accumu-lation by each group by converting values ofAOA and AOB amoA for day 0 and day 30 soilsto AOA and AOB carbon using literature-basedestimates, and then calculating carbon accumu-lation in each day 30 bag by Eqs. 2 and 3.AOA carbon accumulationÂ¼Ã°day 30 AOA carbon =g dw soil Ã/C0Ã°avg:day 0 AOA carbon =g dw soil ÃÃ°2ÃAOB carbon accumulationÂ¼Ã°day 30 AOB carbon =g dw soil Ã/C0Ã°avg:day 0 AOB carbon =g dw soil ÃÃ°3ÃThe factors we used to convert amoA valuesobtained by qPCR to estimates of AOA and AOBcarbon relied on three key pieces of informationfor each group: (1) the average number of amoAcopies per cell, (2) average cell volume, and (3)average cell carbon content. Since these valueslikely vary among AOA and AOB taxa, it wasnecessary to examine AOA and AOB communitystructure prior to estimating carbon conversionfactors. We therefore measured communitystructure of AOA and AOB at each site bypyrosequencing of amoA PCR amplicons fromeach site using group specific primers (pyrose-quencing and sequence-processing methods areoutlined in the Appendix) and used thesefindings to inform group-specific amoA to carbonconversions.Greater than 90 %of the AOB sequences werecovered belonged to operational taxonomicunits (OTUs) most closely related to isolates ofthe genus Nitrosospira . We therefore based ourAOB amoA to AOB carbon conversion factor onavailable information for isolates from the genusNitrosospira including Nitrosospira multiformis andNitrosospira briensis .N. multiformis is the onlymember of the genus Nitrosospira for which wecould find genomic data and this organism has 3vwww.esajournals.org 4 October 2015 vVolume 6(10) vArticle 176NORMAN ET AL. 21508925, 2015, 10, Downloaded from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00299.1 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

We based AOB cell sizeestimates on N. briensis , an AOB common to soilwhich Watson (1971) described as tightly coiledspirals, best represented as cylinders 1.5â2.5 lmin length and 0.8â1.0 lm in width. Using anaverage of these dimensions, we assumed anAOB cell volume of 1.27 lm3.Of the AOA amoA sequences we recoveredacross sites, 85 %belonged to a single operationaltaxonomic unit (OTU) most closely related toNitrosotalea devanterra , an acidophilic soil AOAisolate (Lehtovirta-Morley et al. 2011), and wetherefore based AOA amoA to AOA carbonconversions on N. devanterra when informationfor this isolate was available. While the numberofamoA amplicons in the N. devanterra genomeremains unknown, genome sequences from otherAOA isolates show a single copy of amoA percell. We therefore assumed that AOA amoA copynumber per gram of soil was equivalent to thenumber of AOA cells per gram of soil. Lehto-virta-Morley et al. (2011) described N. devanaterracells as straight rods with an average length of0.89 lm and an average width of 0.33 lm. Weused this information to an estimate averageAOA cell volume of 0.067 lm3.No data were available for biovolume tocarbon conversions for single AOA and AOBtaxa, nor were these data available for archaea ingeneral. All biovolume to carbon conversionswere therefore based on Eq. 4, which is abiovolume to carbon conversion formula forgeneral bacteria as suggested by Romanova andSazhin (2010)fg carbon per cell Â¼Ã°133 :754Ã3Ã°cell biovolume0:438Ã:Ã°4ÃUsing the aforementioned biovolume esti-mates for AOA and AOB with Eq. 4 yieldedrespective AOA and AOB carbon contents of 40.9femtograms (fg) carbon/cell and 148.5 fg carbon/cell. Since AOA were assumed to have one amoAgene copy per cell, we assumed a final amoA genecopy to carbon conversion value of 40.9 fgcarbon/AOA amoA . Since AOB were assumed tohave three amoA genes per cell, we assumed afinal amoA gene copy to carbon conversion factorof 49.5 fg carbon/AOB amoA copy, whichrepresents 1/3 of the AOB carbon/cell estimategiven above. We therefore converted AOA andAOB amoA /g dw soil estimates generated byqPCR to estimates of AOA and AOB carbon/gdw soil by Eqs. 5 and 6.AOA carbon =g dw soilÂ¼Ã°40:9 fg carbon =AOA amoA Ã3Ã°AOA amoA =g dw soil ÃÃ° 5ÃAOB carbon =g dw soilÂ¼Ã°49:5 fg carbon =AOB amoA Ã3Ã°AOB amoA =g dw soil ÃÃ° 6ÃModel selectionWe used multiple linear regression to explorethe links between observed NO 3/C0accumulationand AOA and AOB carbon accumulation acrosssites. We converted negative carbon accumula-tion values to zeros prior to performing thisanalysis since these values represent net celldeath, which should not contribute to nitrateproduction by either organism. The equationfrom this analysis was used to assess pairedcarbon and nitrogen metabolism by each groupacross sites as explained in the discussion sectionof this paper. We assessed the validity of theresulting multiple linear regression equationusing a stepwise model selection procedurebased on the Akaike information criterion (AIC)values (function ââstepAIC, ââlibrary ââMASS, ââtheR Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,Austria). This was done to determine whethercarbon accumulation by both AOA and AOB wasnecessary to explain patterns in NO3/C0accumula-tion, or whether NO 3/C0accumulation was relatedto the carbon accumulation by a single group inparticular.RESULTSAOA and AOB amoA abundancesand general soil characteristicsDay 0 and day 30 estimates of AOA and AOBamoA /g dw of soil are presented in Fig. 1a and b,respectively.

However, wedid find a significant positive linear relationshipbetween NO3/C0accumulation and AOA carbonaccumulation ( P,0.05, R2Â¼0.30), while no suchrelationship existed between NO 3/C0accumulationand AOB carbon accumulation.DISCUSSIONHere we used buried-bag incubations toinvestigate paired carbon and nitrogen metabo-lism by ammonia oxidizing microbes in temper-ate forest soils. Buried-bag incubations are oftenused to estimate background rates of nitrificationby excluding plant demand for NO3/C0andthereby allowing for NO 3/C0accumulation; indeedwe saw positive values of NO 3/C0accumulation atall 11 sites at which we were able to acquire data.However, we suspected that unamended netnitrification incubations would lead to growth ofAOA and AOB as well due to the increasedammonium availability to these organisms (Nor-man and Barrett 2014 showed that this occurredin one soil from a reference watershed at Cow-eeta). Consistent with this prediction, we sawincreased gene copy numbers of AOB amoA /g dwsoil at every site and increased numbers of AOAamoA /g dw soil at 7 out of 11 sites that wesampled.Interestingly, our results show that AOB arecapable of growth during buried-bag incubationsin acidic low ammonium soils, which is surpris-ing since AOB isolates do not readily grow inthese conditions in pure culture (Hatzenpichler2012 and references therein). However, detect-able AOB activity has been shown in soils belowpH 5 (Nicol et al. 2008), and AOB growth duringburied-bag incubations has been shown in asimilar soil from Coweeta previously (Normanand Barrett 2014). Soils are likely heterogeneousat the microscopic scale, and it is possible that theAOB growth we observed occurred in less-acidicmicrosites with high ammonia availability. Fur-thermore, many AOB express urease, whichallows them to obtain substrate in acidic soils(Pommerening-Ro Â¨ser and Koops 2005), and formbiofilms that serve as a means of pH protection(Allison and Prosser 1993).Converting amoA gene copy estimates to lgcarbon allowed us to assess the relationshipsbetween carbon accumulation by AOA and AOB,a proxy for primary production by each group,and NO3/C0accumulation, which serves as a proxyfor ammonia oxidation by both groups. Sincethere is no way to determine which proportion ofthe NO3/C0accumulation at each site was due to byactivity of each group, we used a model selectionprocedure to assess statistical relationships be-tween carbon accumulation by both groups andNO 3/C0accumulation across sites. Our modelselection procedure showed that carbon accumu-lation by both AOA and AOB best explainedvariation in NO 3/C0accumulation across sites andwe interpret this finding to show that bothgroups have a role in ammonia oxidation in theforest soils we sampled in line with ourpredictions.Eq. 7 was generated from the aforementionedmultiple linear regression procedure and isillustrated by the regression plane in Fig. 2.When solved for NO3/C0accumulation (as present-ed in Eq. 7), this regression equation essentiallypredicts NO 3/C0accumulation values based onAOA and AOB carbon accumulation.

While the estimates of AOA andAOB NO 3/C0accumulation generated by Eq. 7 maynot be particularly accurate for a given site, webelieve that the aforementioned coefficients fromthis equation provide insight into cross-sitepatterns of paired carbon and nitrogen metabo-lism by AOA and AOB. If one assumes that thecarbon accumulation observed by each groupresults from carbon fixation driven by ammoniaoxidation, these coefficients can be thought of asgroup-specific cross-site estimates of ammoniaoxidation efficiency; that is, these coefficientsrepresent the amount of ammonia oxidation eachgroup must accomplish to fix 1 lg of carbon.Using the coefficients from Eq. 7, we cantherefore estimate that AOA must oxidize 59.8lg of ammonia-N to add 1 lg of carbon tobiomass, while AOB must oxidize 58.2 lgo fammonia-N to add 1 lg of carbon to biomass inthis system.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensethat AOA must oxidize ;51 molecules ofammonia for every molecule of carbon they addto biomass, while AOB must oxidize ;50molecules of ammonia for every molecule ofcarbon they add to biomass.What is most striking about these estimates ishow similar they are despite the physiologicaldifferences, including the use of different carbonfixation pathways and the large phylogeneticdistance, between AOA and AOB (Hatzenpichler2012). Perhaps conditions in temperate soilenvironments dictate certain energetic con-straints requiring similar ratios between ammo-nia oxidation and carbon fixation by each group.Winogradsky (1890) estimated that Nitrosomonaseuropaea oxidized 35 molecules of ammonia permolecule of carbon fixed in pure culture. Painter(1970) summarized known values of economiccoefficients, defined as the weight of dried cellsproduced per weight of nitrogen oxidized, forammonia oxidizing bacteria ranging from 0.04 to0.13. This given range of economic coefficientscorresponds to values of ;52 and ;16 moleculesof ammonia oxidized per carbon added tobiomass by fixation, respectively. The estimatewe provide of ;50 molecules of ammoniaoxidized per carbon added to biomass by AOBtherefore falls within the range observed in pureculture. This estimate is on the low end ofobserved efficiency for AOB in pure culture,which is unsurprising due to the additionalstresses associated with growth in the field ratherthan in the laboratory, including imperfectenvironmental factors and competition for am-monia.However, certain assumptions went into theproduction of our model, the accuracy of whichcannot be verified from our data. For instance, asno field data were available, we relied on cellbiovolume estimates from culture-based studies.Cell biovolumes may differ in field conditionsand accurate estimates of AOA and AOB cellvolumes would improve carbon accumulationestimates in the future. Also, we assumed that allcarbon accumulation was due to chemoauto-trophc carbon fixation, while both groups couldbe using organic carbon to supplement theirbiomass carbon demand. Furthermore, we as-sumed that positive carbon accumulation valuesrepresented only AOA and AOB growth ratherthan the difference between growth and death.However, while AOA and AOB cells likely diedduring buried-bag incubations, our qPCR assaycould still detect dead cells as long as the DNAfrom these cells had not degraded. Also, as withall nitrification estimates from buried-bag incu-bations, we assumed that the NO3/C0accumulationvalues were primarily due to the activity ofnitrifying microorganisms, and were not affectedby other processes such as NO 3/C0uptake ordenitrification.Despite these caveats, we feel that this studyprovides important information about ammoniaoxidation as a process in temperate forest soils.Evidence from our model selection proceduresuggests that both AOA and AOB are involved inammonia oxidation at the landscape scale,though participation by each group varies fromsite to site. Furthermore, we believe that this isthe first study to explicitly investigate pairedcarbon and nitrogen metabolism by ammoniaoxidizers in a field setting. We give remarkablysimilar estimates for the amount of ammoniaoxidation each group must accomplish to addcarbon biomass across sites but we feel that thisis merely a first step for research on pairedcarbon and nitrogen metabolism in AOA andAOB. Future work on this matter could employstable isotope-based techniques to explicitly trackcarbon fixation by each group in addition togrowth, and investigate whether estimates ofpaired carbon and nitrogen cycling by AOA andAOB are constant at the group level or taxonlevel, whether they differ by environment, andwhether individual organisms can change theirefficiency in response to ammonia availability orother environmental factors.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors would like to thank several members ofthe Virginia Tech Stream Team, most notably JacksonWebster, who gave advice on sampling at Coweetaand reviewed portions of this manuscript, and BobbieNiederlehner, who performed much of the analyticalchemical analyses described here.
