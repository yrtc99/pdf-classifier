Ftradeisagainofcarbonbyaregionifitimportsmorethanitexportsor a loss if otherwise (Supplementary Fig. 1). InEquation (1), the sign convention is that NEE isnegative when a region removes CO 2from theatmosphere, /Delta1C is negative when carbon storageincreasesinthatregion, FriversisalwayspositiveandFtradecan be positive (net export) or negative(netimport).We estimated /Delta1C in each region based onpublications from the REgional Carbon Cycle As-sessmentandProcesses(RECCAP)project[ 7–14]completed by other data sources (SupplementaryTable 1). The nine RECCAP regions cover theentirelandsurfaceexcepttheMiddleEast,Ukraine,Belarus,KazakhstanandNewZealand.Theselatterregions,giventheirsurfaceareaand/ortheirsparsevegetation,representonlyasmallfractionofglobal/Delta1C(SupplementaryTable1).Forhumidforestsintropical South America and Africa, /Delta1Co fb i o m a s swas provided from long-term forest-plots data[8,12], but there were no such data for SoutheastAsiaandSouthAsia.Tofillthisgap,weusedbiomass/Delta1Cfromremote-sensingdatacombiningLidarandoptical measurements [ 17]. This remote-sensing-based estimate of biomass /Delta1C is consistent withdatafromforestplotsinSouthAmericaandAfrica,giving support to using it for Southeast Asia andSouthAsia(SupplementaryFig.2).Further,unlikeforotherregionswhereregionaldataonsoil-carbon-stockchanges,albeituncertain,wereavailable,soil-carbon /Delta1Cwasignoredinthetropicalregionswherenodataexistwithadequatecoverage.Weestimatedfromglobalcarbon-modeloutputthatignoringsoilcarbon in our estimate of tropical /Delta1C could leadto an average underestimate of 26%, which is stillwithin the range of uncertainties (SupplementaryText1andTable2).Toassess Ftrade,weusedstatis-ticsofthewoodandcrop-productstradeconvertedintocarbonunits[ 18].Toassess Frivers,wecalculatedthetotalexportoffluvialcarbontotheoceansusingdata from references [ 19] and [20] and subtractedthe fraction of fluvial carbon that originates fromweathered carbonate minerals, which represents atransferfromthelithospheretotheoceanthatdoesnotinvolveacontemporaryatmosphericCflux(see‘Methods’ section). Error propagation was appliedto each term of Equation (1) to quantify regionalNEEuncertainties.A NEW GLOBAL ESTIMATION OFLAND–ATMOSPHERE NET CARBONEXCHANGEWe obtained a bottom-up anthropogenic NEE of–2.2±0.6 PgC yr−1, totally independently of thevalue derived from the global CO 2budget [5]o f–2.4±0.7PgCyr−1butremarkablyconsistentwithit. Our bottom-up estimate is calculated from thesumofalltheregionalNEEvalues(SupplementaryTable 1) plus NEE from regions not coveredby the RECCAP publications being a sink of–0.4PgCyr−1(SupplementaryText2andTable3).This gives a net uptake of atmospheric CO 2equalto –2.8 ±0.7 PgC yr−1for the period 2000–2009(Fig.1a). This estimate includes the sum of theanthropogenic sink linked to the human-inducedperturbation of the global carbon cycle and thebackground natural CO 2sink associated with thefact that there is always a fraction of atmosphericCO2absorbed on land by the vegetation, which isleachedtoriversandtransferredtotheocean[ 21].In contrast, the NEE calculated from the globalCO2budget [5] only quantifies the anthropogenicland-CO 2uptake. We thus subtracted from ourbottom-upNEEvaluethebackgroundsinkfromref-erence[21]toderiveourbottom-upanthropogenicNEEestimate.The contributions of each region to the globalbottom-up NEE differ in magnitude.

In Europe, however, NEE is a smallerCO2sink than /Delta1C because trade imports exceedriverine-carbonexports,giventhefactthatimportedproducts are oxidized by humans and animals,releasingCO 2intotheatmosphereinthesetwore-gions.InAfrica,SoutheastAsiaandSouthAmerica,inventoriesshowareductionincarbonstocks(pos-itive/Delta1Cvalues inFig. 1)because of deforestation,butNEEisstillasmallnetsinkofatmosphericCO 2from the atmosphere, due to strong lateral exportsfrom rivers and trade. These regional differencesbetweenNEEand /Delta1Cclearlydemonstratethattheresultsoftop-downatmosphericinversionsestimat-ingNEEarenotcomparabletobottom-upcarbon-stock change /Delta1C from inventories at the regionalscale.Wethusrecommendthatstock-change-basedregional carbon budgets should be corrected forlateralfluxestobeproperlycomparedwithinversionresults [11]. At the scale of smaller regions thatexchange a lot of carbon by trade circuits, such ascrop-production basins, plantation areas exportingcarbon products or populated areas importing andconsuming those products, differences betweeninversions NEE and /Delta1C are expected to be evenlargerinrelativevalue.DEDUCING SHR CO 2EMISSIONS FROMNET ECOSYSTEM CARBON EXCHANGESHR is one of the largest and arguably the mostuncertainfluxofthegloballand-carboncycle.Here,we combined our new bottom-up NEE estimateswith other component fluxes exchanged with theatmosphere to infer SHR (‘Methods’ section andSupplementary Fig. 3). Regional values of netprimaryproductivity(NPP)weretakenfromthreesatellite-based products [ 22–24] and a globalland-carbon-cycle data-assimilation system [ 25].These products based on different approachesand different satellite sensors give a global NPP of–50 PgC yr−1with an interquartile range (IQR)of –57 to –44 PgC yr−1over all RECCAP regions(Monte-Carlo standard deviation across the fourNPPestimatesandtheuncertaintyofeachestimate;see‘Methods’section).ThosefourdifferentNPPes-timatesarealsoconsistentwitheachotherforeachindividualregion,withintheirrespectiveuncertain-ties (Supplementary Fig. 4). Once fixed by NPP,carbonturnsoverinecosystempoolsandisreturnedbacktotheatmospheremainlybySHR,butalsobyland-use-change emissions; fires; livestock grazingand the harvest wood and crop products subse-quentlyoxidizedbyhumansandanimals;outgassingofcarbonbylakes,rivers,andestuaries;andbiogenicemissionsofreduced-carboncompoundsincludingmethane and biogenic volatile organic compounds(Supplementary Fig. 3). All these gross fluxes andtheir uncertainties were estimated for each regionusing observational data sets, considering wher-ever possible different independent estimates forconsistency checking (‘Methods’ section and Sup-plementaryTable1).Then,SHR,whichisthelargestsinglefluxofCO 2lostbythelandtotheatmosphere,wascalculatedforeachregionasaresidual,namelyas the difference between NEE, NPP and all othernon-SHR carbon exchanges. Uncertainties of SHRwere obtained using a Monte-Carlo approach,sampling different estimates and their individualuncertainties(SupplementaryTable1).Among individual sources of carbon to theatmosphere that are not from SHR, we found thatthelargestfluxistheoutgassingbyrivers,lakesandestuaries[ 26,27]rangingfrom0.8to2.3PgCyr−1.Thisfluxisfollowedbycarbonemissionsfromfires(1.6PgCyr−1),theconsumptionofharvestedcropproducts (1.5 PgC yr−1), land-use-change emis-sions (1.0–1.2 PgC yr−1), emissions from grazing(1.0PgCyr−1),biogenicreduced-carbonemissionssuch as methane and volatile biogenic compounds(0.8PgCyr−1)andthedecayandburningofwoodproducts (0.7 PgC yr−1). Altogether, these fluxesrepresent a globally large source of carbon to theatmosphere of 8.3 ±0.9 PgC yr−1. From thesedata combined with NPP (and our bottom-upNEE estimates), we infer a global median valueof SHR equal to 39 PgC yr−1with an IQR of33–46 PgC yr−1and a non-Gaussian uncertaintydistribution obtained from a Monte-Carlo analysisacrossdifferentavailabledatasetsandtheirinternaluncertainty (Fig. 2). This new global value ofSHR is significantly lower than the estimate of∼50PgCyr−1giveninpreviousglobalassessments[28,29]. To obtain an independent verificationof this lower SHR estimation, we upscaled datafrom 455 site-level measurements of SHR froma global database [ 30] (see ‘Methods’ section)into regional SHR budgets using two approaches.The first approach is a machine-learning algorithm(Supplementary Text 3) and the other one isan empirical model based on functions of soilmoisture and soil temperature fitted to the sitedata [31] (‘Methods’ section and Supplemen-tary Fig. 7). The two estimates of SHR obtainedfrom site-data upscaling agree well with ourvalue deduced from regional carbon budgets, atboth regional and global scales (Fig. 2a), whichleads to high confidence that SHR amounts to∼40PgCyr−1.Page4of14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/2/nwaa145/5868251 by National Cheng Kung University user on 18 February 2023NatlSciRev ,2021,Vol.8,nwaa145(a)048121620NorthAmericaEuropeSouthAsiaEastAsiaSoutheastAsiaSouthAmericaAfricaSHR (PgC yr−1)This study (mass balance)Climate−based semi−empirical upscalingRandom forestRussia Australia00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91SHR / NPP(b)MeanMedianNorthAmericaEuropeSouthAsiaEastAsiaSoutheastAsiaSouthAmericaAfrica Russia AustraliaFigure 2.(a)Regionalestimatesofsoilheterotrophicrespirationfromthisstudyinblueandfromtwootherestimatesobtainedusinganindependentapproach from upscaling a global data set of site-level field measurements [ 38] by reference [ 31].

OSCAR wascalibrated to reproduce the same pre-industrial re-gional carbon stocks and NPP, the same sensitivityofNPPtoCO 2andtemperature,andthesamesen-sitivityofsoil-carbondecompositiontotemperatureas sevenof the Earth System Models(ESMs)fromthe 5th IPCC Assessment Report. This calibrationensures that, when run for a future scenario withimposedfossilCO 2emissions,OSCARgivesresultssimilartoeachoriginalESMmodelforfutureCO 2and temperature but at much lower computationalcosts.WerantwosensitivitysimulationswithOSCAR,both forced by fossil CO 2emissions from theRCP8.5 pathway [ 34]. Those emissions lead to anintensive warming and high future CO 2concen-tration, and can be viewed as an extreme test toexamine the effect of overestimating βsoilandγsoil.Inthefirstsimulation(SIM-1),SHRwassimulatedaccordingtoeachoriginalESMmodel(Supplemen-taryText4).Inthesecondsimulation(SIM-2),weprescribedcropandwoodharvest,landuse,firesandgrazing CO 2emissions as a fraction of future NPPin order to reproduce our estimate of present-daySHR-to-NPPratiosforeachregion(SupplementaryText4).Forthefutureevolutionofriverine-carbonexportandoutgassing,weconstructedanempiricalmodel of this flux based on relationships estab-lished by reference [ 26]. The set-up for SIM-2is a compromise that avoids a detailed—anduncertain—mechanistic,complexrepresentationoftheriverexport,harvestandgrazing.Yetitprovidesplausible magnitudes for future changes in thosefluxesrelativetoNPP(SupplementaryTable6).Thevaluesof βsoilandγsoilcalculatedbyOSCARfromSIM-1andSIM-2areshowninFig. 3foracom-bination of seven different ESMs and 32 estimatestoaccountforuncertaintyintheSHR-to-NPPratiosforeachregion.Asexpected, βsoilis3%–31%lowerinSIM-2thaninSIM-1,confirmingthanSIM-2sys-tematicallyreducessoil-carbonstorage.Conversely,γsoilis3%–26%lower(lessnegative)inSIM-2thanin SIM-1 because there is less carbon in the soilexposed to warming. Although partially cancellingone another out, the reduction of βsoilin SIM-2versusSIM-1dominatesoverthereductionof γsoil,leading to higher atmospheric CO 2in the range of5–41ppmin2100,asshowninFig. 3c.Similarly,theincrease of temperature in 2100 is larger in SIM-2thaninSIM-1,by0.03–0.22◦C(Fig.3d).TheSIM-2simulationshouldbeseenasconser-vativebecauseincreasingfuturewooddemandandlivestock production in the RCP8.5 storyline [ 34]should enhance the human appropriation of NPPmorethanweassumedintheset-upofthissimula-tion.Theriver-outgassingfluxincreasessignificantlyinSIM-2,by61%in2100comparedto2000–2009in response to increased temperature, populationand NPP. The development of reservoirs wasignored, which could also lead to both additionaloutgassing and carbon burial [ 35]. Presumably,other scenarios such as the RCP2.6, with its vastareas of bio-energy crops and harvested residues,shouldalsosignificantlyaffect βsoilandγsoil.CONCLUSIONWeconcludethatsoilcarbonistemporallyandspa-tially decoupled from NPP by lateral carbon fluxesfrombiomassharvest,grazingandcarbonexporttorivers, as well as by emissions of reduced biogeniccarboncompounds.Thesefluxesarealreadyimpor-tanttodayinregionswithhighhumanappropriationofNPPandastrongleachingofsoilcarbontorivers.The current generation of land-carbon modelslack a representation of these lateral fluxes and theunderpinning processes, and of their responses toclimate change and human pressure. These fluxesareafirst-ordereffectforestimatingcarbon-climatefeedback and we thus recommend incorporatingthem in the next generation of ESMs and usingspatiallyexplicitdatasetsofharvestandgrazingformodel evaluation [ 36]. Likewise, national, regionaland global carbon budgets used for the purpose ofreporting progress towards targets in climate mit-igation all need to account for lateral carbon flowsand their consequences for the vertical exchangeof carbon between the land biosphere and theatmosphere[ 37].METHODSBottom-up NEEFor each region, NEE is the net flux of carbon ex-changed with the overlying atmosphere, excludingfossil-carbon emissions given by Equation (1) inwhich the total carbon-stock change during theperiod 2000–2009 ( /Delta1C) is the sum of inventory-based estimates of carbon-storage changes in cropproducts δ1; in wood products, including productsPage7of14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/2/nwaa145/5868251 by National Cheng Kung University user on 18 February 2023NatlSciRev ,2021,Vol.8,nwaa145decaying in landfills δ2; in biomass, litter and soilpoolsδ3; and in inland-water pools correspondingtothecarbonburialinsediments δ4.Thelithogeniccarbon-storage decrease in carbonate rocks fromweathering δ5is not counted in /Delta1C because itdoes not contribute to NEE as it does not involvean exchange with the atmosphere, and it wassubtractedfromthetotalriverineexportofcarbon.Forδ1, we used data reported by the RECCAPpublicationsinEurope[ 16]andAustralia[ 15]andassumed zero elsewhere, this storage term beingnevertheless very small. δ2was taken as reportedfrom RECCAP publications [ 7–14] or calculatedby a wood-product-pools bookkeeping model withinputbeingwoodproductsusedineachregionfromreference [ 39] and decay functions from reference[40].δ3was taken from the RECCAP publications[1–18] based on inventories for forest-biomassanddata-drivenmodelsforsoil-carbonchanges,forinstancemodelscalibratedusingsoil-carboninven-tory data. Those inventories have generally a largeuncertainty for soil, litter and dead-wood carbonstocks [41]. For the four tropical regions, changesin soil carbon were ignored and the magnitude ofthis bias on /Delta1C is estimated using global models(Supplementary Text 1). Extensive forest-biomassinventoriescovernorthern-hemisphereregionsandtherearedatafromresearchplotsinSouthAmericaand Africa. The primary biomass inventory dataare similar to those synthesized over 2000–2007by reference [ 42] with some updates to cover theperiod 2000–2009. In South Asia and SoutheastAsia, we used satellite-based estimates of biomassstock changes from Lidar and optical observations[17]updatedforthisstudytoaglobalcoverageandaveraged over the period 2003–2009 to maximizeoverlapwiththeperiodcoveredbyRECCAP.One-sigma uncertainties of /Delta1C were taken as reportedbytheoriginalRECCAPpublications(alldatagivenin Supplementary Table 1). Supplementary Fig. 3presents a comparison of /Delta1C between RECCAPinventories and the remote-sensing product [ 17]for each region. Although the remote-sensingestimates of /Delta1C were only used to fill the gap ofmissinginventorydatainSouthandSoutheastAsiaregions, the two independent estimates are withintheirrespectiveuncertaintyforalltheotherregions,exceptforRussia,whereinventoriesindicatealargercarbon-storage increase. δ4is the burial of carbonin freshwater sediments in lakes and reservoirs,reportedintheoriginalRECCAPpublicationsonlyforNorthAmerica(20TgCyr−1),Europe(41TgCyr−1)andRussia(20TgCyr−1)andherecompletedbydatafromreference[ 43]forotherregions.The bottom-up estimate of NEE was calculatedusing Equation (1), which requires lateral fluxesfrom trade and river exports of carbon to oceans,obtainedasexplainedbelow.Ftradeis the net lateral flux of crop and woodproducts related to trade across the boundaries ofeach region, calculated as the sum of the exportand import fluxes of crop and wood products. Byconvention, this flux is positive if a region is a netexporter. For crop products, we considered allproducts, directly and indirectly, thus covering abroader spectrum of processed crop products thanappears in the FAOSTAT database. The carbon incrops is estimated based on FAO crop-productionstatisticswithstandardconversionfactorstoadjustforwaterandthencarboncontent[ 18].Thelateralfluxofwoodproductsiscalculatedinasimilarman-ner, based on reference [ 18] for different forestryproducts.Forroundwood(FAOcode1861),FAO-STAT data [ 44] were used and, for the productsprocessedfromroundwoodandpotentiallyenteringinternational trade, the GTAP-MRIO data [ 45]were used. This approach considers all productscontaining roundwood, directly and indirectly,and covers a broader spectrum of processed woodproductsthanappearsintheFAOdatabase.Friversis the net export of biogenic carbon byinland waters to the ocean, including dissolvedorganic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon(POC),anddissolvedinorganiccarbon(DIC).Thisbiogenic carbon export is in fact from atmosphericorigin as it was fixed by NPP (predominatelyterrestrial). The border between inland waters andthe ocean is the end of estuaries. The mask of theRECCAP regions is such that there is no rivercarbonflowingfromoneregionintoanother,sothatimports/export between regions can be ignored.FriverswascalculatedspecificallyforthisstudyusingDOC, POC and DIC at 0.5-degree resolutionaggregated into each region, based on the GLOB-ALNEWS model [ 19] and data from reference[20].FollowingResplandy etal.[46],whorecentlyre-estimated fluvial exports of DOC and POC andshowed that these fluxes were underestimated bytheGLOBALNEWSmodel,weusedtheirestimatesto rescale spatial explicit estimates from GLOBAL-NEWS.OnlyafractionofDICtransportedbyriversisbiogenic,therestbeingfromthelithosphere.Thefraction of river DIC from the lithosphere varies ineach region because the weathering of carbonatemineralsconsumes1/2moleofatmosphericcarbonpermoleofDICtransportedbyrivers,whereastheweathering ofsilicate mineralsconsumes1moleofatmospheric carbon per mole of DIC transportedby rivers. The biogenic and lithogenic propor-tions of river DIC exports were calculated for thisstudy based on reference [ 20] and the lithogeniccomponentwassubtractedfrom Frivers.Page8of14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/2/nwaa145/5868251 by National Cheng Kung University user on 18 February 2023NatlSciRev ,2021,Vol.8,nwaa145To determine SHR from bottom-up estimatesof NEE, we used a mass balance equation, whosetermsaredetailedbelow:SHR =NEE−NPP−Fcrop products−Fwood products −Fgrazing−Ffires−FLUC−Freduced−Foutgas rivers +lakes−Foutgas estuaries . (2)Uncertainties of SHR were obtained by errorpropagation from uncertainties of each term fromEquation(2),whichareindependentofeachother(see below). A Monte-Carlo approach was used torandomly sample different empirical estimates ofcomponent fluxes when available, assuming thateach estimate has an equal probability, and thensampling the internal Gaussian uncertainty of eachestimate. Different estimates reported in Supple-mentaryTable1includefourestimatesofNPP,twoestimates of Ffires, two estimates of FLUCand twoestimates of Foutgas rivers +lakes. Other fluxes have asingle estimate and only their internal uncertaintywasconsidered.Itisimportanttonotethattheerrorin SHR is positively correlated with the error inNPPandotherfluxes,sothattheuncertaintyoftheSHR-to-NPP ratio is lower than that of each fluxseparately.ThisisaccountedforbytheMonte-Carloapproach used to calculate this ratio and showntheoretically(SupplementaryText5).NPPwasestimatedusingfourdifferentempiricalproducts averaged over each region: the MODISproduct[22,47]evaluatedagainstsitedata[ 48]re-portinganaccuracyof ≈20%,theGIMMSproductbasedonAVHRRandMODISsatellite-vegetation-absorbedradiationfraction[ 24],theBETHY/DLRproduct based on SPOT-VEGETATION satellitealbedo and LAI data [ 49] and the CARDAMOMcarbon-cycledata-assimilationproduct[ 25].Thosefour NPP products are based on different methodsand different sensors. GIMMS and MODIS-NPPuse a calibrated light-use-efficiency model whileBETHY assimilates vegetation indices in a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere model. CARDAMOMdoesnotusesatelliteobservationsofNPP.Supple-mentaryFig.4showsthatthefourlargelyindepen-dentNPPproductsgiveconsistentestimatesineachregion, following the Global Climate ObservingSystem definition of consistency [ 50]: ‘when theindependent measurements agree to within theirindividual uncertainties.’ The global NPP fromthe four empirical products is also consistent withempirical estimates compiled by references [ 51]and [52]. We performed a Monte-Carlo analysisby sampling the four different NPP products andassuming for each product a Gaussian uncertainty[48] derived from MODIS-NPP because MODIS-NPP is the only product with a formal uncertaintyestimation [ 48] (relative std. dev. ≈20%). ThisgivesaglobalmedianNPPof–50PgCyr−1withanIQR of –57 to –44 PgC yr−1for the area of all theRECCAPregions(SupplementaryTable1).Fcrop products is the carbon emission to the atmo-sphere from the consumption of crop products,calculated as the sum of domestically harvestedproducts minus net export minus storage ( δ1)i neach region [ 18] from FAO data. Crop productsare consumed by animals and humans and nodistinction was made between these two groups.Digestion of crop products by ruminants emitsCH4-carbon counted in Fcrop products and hence notinFreducedtoavoiddoublecounting.Thefractionofconsumed products channeled to sewage systemsand lost to rivers instead of being emitted to theatmospherewasignored,asthisfluxisgloballysmall[21] (100 TgC yr−1). The 1-sigma uncertainty ofFcrop productscouldnotbeformallyestablishedintheabsenceofglobaltrade-statisticsdataindependentlyfromFAOandwassetto20%.Fwood products is the carbon emission from thedecay and burning of wood products. The termFwood products decay wascalculatedusingabookkeepingmodelforcedbyinputsfromthedomesticharvestofnon-fuelwood [ 39] minus net export plus imports,to simulate pool changes and losses using decayfunctionsfromreference[ 40].Thesmallfractionofproductwastegoingtosewagewatersandriverswasignored. The term Fwood products decay was calculatedin carbon units, including carbon lost to the atmo-sphere as CH 4in landfills. The uncertainty of thisfluxwassetto20%. Fwood products burning wascalculatedfrom statistics of fuelwood consumption [ 44] andcarbon-emission factors (including CO 2, CO andCH4)compiledinreference[ 53]andupdatedtoin-cludethefractionofcarbonemittedasblackcarbon[54].Thisfluxincludescommercialfuelwood,fuel-woodgatheredlocallyandburnedasafuelinhouse-holds and industrial fuelwood. The uncertainty ofthis flux was estimated by accounting for uncertainfuel-consumptionandemissionfactors[ 53].Fgrazingisthecarbonemissionfromthedigestionofherbagegrazedbyanimalsandthedecompositionof manure, here only from grass digestion, becausemanure from crop-products digestion is alreadyincluded in Fcrop products. The grass requirement byanimals was derived from a grass-biomass-use dataset [55] for the year 2000. The evolution of grazedbiomass during the period 2001–2009 was calcu-lated based on changes in the total metabolizableenergy (ME) of ruminants [ 56,57]. Actual grassintakewasmodeledbytheORCHIDEE-GMglobalPage9of14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/2/nwaa145/5868251 by National Cheng Kung University user on 18 February 2023NatlSciRev ,2021,Vol.8,nwaa145model of pasture ecosystems [ 56] constrainedby data from reference [ 55] including grazingand cut-and-carry forage intake. FgrazingincludesCH4-carbon emissions from manure and entericfermentation from reference [ 58], CO2respirationduring grazing and emissions from the use of milkandmeat.Animalandmanureproductsareassumedtodecayin1year.Theuncertaintyof Fgrazingmainlycomes from the grass-biomass-use data [ 55], ob-tained from an IPCC tier 3 digestion-metabolismmodel [59,60] and livestock-population statistics,diet composition and feed quality from databasesandsurveys.Theevolutionofthegrass-biomassusewas estimated based on livestock-population andIPCC tier 2 methods for ME. Uncertainty associ-ated with livestock populations should be <20%and uncertainty of digestibility, a key parameterdescribing feed quality, is also <20%. Because theuncertaintyofthedigestion-metabolismmodelwasnot estimated, we used the upper-bound uncer-taintyofthetwoaboveinputdatasourcestoassessarelativeuncertaintyof Fgrazingof20%.Ffiresis the carbon emission from fires includingCO2,C O ,C H 4and black carbon, separated intoemissions from crop-residues burning and emis-sions from other fire types. The residues-burningoccurs though small-scale fires that are underes-timated by global burned-area products. Further,some residues are burned out of the field and theiremissions are missed by satellites. Ffirescropresidueswas calculated from fuel-consumption and carbon-emission factors [ 53] updated to include blackcarbon [54]. Its uncertainty was estimated using aMonte-Carlo method accounting for uncertaintiesof fuel-consumption and emission factors [ 53].Emissionsfromotherfires Ffires otherswereestimatedusingtwodifferentsatellite-baseddatasets:GFED4(www.globalfiredata.org ) based on burned areas[61]andGFASbasedonfireradiativepower[ 62].GFED4 is an update of the GFED3 product [ 63]with updated burned area [ 61] completed by adata set of small fires [ 64]. In tropical regions,deforestation causes fires and those emissions,being already included in FLUC, were subtractedfromFfires othersusing reference [ 63] to minimizedouble accounting. Because the uncertainty ofFfires otherswas not formally established, we diag-noseditfromtheinterannualstandarddeviationofannualemissionsineachregionduring2000–2009.We verified that this estimate of uncertainty isconsistent with formal uncertainties reported forGFED3 [ 63]. Supplementary Fig. 8 comparesGFED4andGFASfireemissionsineachregion.FLUCis the net land-use-change carbon fluxincludinggrossdeforestation,secondaryecosystemregrowth,soilCO 2emissionsafterland-usechangeand forest-degradation emissions, with the latterestimatedonlyforAfrica(SupplementaryTable1).FLUCcanbepositiveornegative,dependingontheregionconsidered. FLUCresultsfromtheimbalancebetween NPP, SHR and deforestation fires overareashistoricallyaffectedbyland-usechange.IntheabsenceofNPPandSHRmeasurementsoverthoseareas,FLUCwastreatedasaseparatefluxcomponentofNEE,sothatSHRinEquation(2)isnotincludinglegacy heterotrophic respiration after LUC, butonly respiration on natural and managed lands.We used two different estimates of FLUC.Th efi r s testimatewasbasedonestimatesfromregionaldataprovided by the RECCAP publications, except forSouthAsiaandAfrica,forwhichtheresultsfromtheglobal bookkeeping model of Houghton et al.[65]were used. The uncertainty of FLUCwas taken asreportedinthosepublications.ThesecondestimateofFLUCisfromthe‘BookkeepingofLandUseEmis-sions’ (BLUE) model described by reference [ 66],which tracks changes in soil- and biomass-carbonstocks following land-use conversion and due tomanagement practices (e.g. shifting cultivation)using biome-specific carbon densities and expo-nential response curves. The LUC-transition mapsapplied were those from LUH2v2.1h [ 67] from1850 to 2017. In BLUE, key uncertainties relateto land-use-change areas and carbon densities. Weperformed sensitivity simulations using differentversionsofthemodeltoestimatetheuncertaintyofFLUCfrom the BLUE model. For land-use-changeinput data, the largest uncertainties for the period2000–2009 (when FAO data and remote sensingentertheLUH2land-useforcing)arisefromshiftingcultivation and the allocation of extensive grazing(‘rangelands’) on natural vegetation types, whichare both hard to monitor in satellite imagery andinventories.Weaddedandsubtractedthedifferenceofsimulationswithandwithoutshiftingcultivation[66] and used two simulations that respectivelyclear natural vegetation for rangeland expansion orkeep natural vegetation intact under this process,thelatterasinreference[ 68].Forcarbondensities,we used the original carbon densities of BLUEand an alternative lower map of carbon densities[66]. The standard deviation of the five sensitivityrunsplusthedefaultrunforeachgridcellwasusedto quantify uncertainty assessment. BLUE datawere extrapolated by the last available year (2012in reference [ 66] and 2016 in reference [ 68]).Supplementary Fig. 9 compares RECCAP andBLUEestimatesof FLUCineachregion.Freducedistheemissionofreducedcarbon,includ-ing biogenic CH 4, non-methane biogenic volatileorganiccompounds(BVOC)andbiogenicCO,ex-cludingfirestominimizedoublecounting.BiogenicPage10of14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/8/2/nwaa145/5868251 by National Cheng Kung University user on 18 February 2023NatlSciRev ,2021,Vol.8,nwaa145CH4emissionsfromwetlands,termites,rice-paddyagricultureandthesmallsinkinsoilswereestimatedusing atmospheric inversions from reference [ 69].CH4emissions from crop and wood products inlandfills are already counted in Fcrop products andFwood products and CH 4from animals and manureinFcrop products. The uncertainty of Freducedwascalculated from the standard deviation of 11 inver-sions [69]. CH4emission from rice paddies wasestimatedbyassumingafractionof18%ofthetotalCH4emissionfromtheagricultureandwastesourcefrom inversion results [ 69]. For biogenic carbonemissions BVOC and CO, we used the CLM-MEGAN2.1 gridded product [ 70] converted intounits of carbon mass. CLM-MEGAN2.1 estimatesbiogenic emissions of CO and of ∼150 BVOCcompoundswiththemaincontributionsbeingfromterpenes, isoprene, methanol, ethanol, acetalde-hyde, acetone, α-pinene, β-pinene,t-β-ocimene,limonene, ethene and propene. The uncertainty ofthat flux was estimated as a percentage of the totalflux for each region following sensitivity tests andmulti-model comparisons [ 71], assuming the samerelativeuncertaintyinpercentageforallspecies.Theregional uncertainties are: forNorthAmerica21%;Europe35%;Russia33%;SouthAsia,EastAsiaandSoutheast Asia 30%; South America 22%; Africa35%;andAustralia40%.Theglobalemissionrelativeuncertaintyis22%.Foutgasrivers +lakesis the outgassing of carbonfrom lakes and rivers. We used two recent spatiallyresolved estimates of this flux [ 26,27] calculatedusing the GLORICH river pCO 2database, butwith different data-selection criteria and upscalingtechniques.Theoneofreference[ 27]wasmadefortheCOSCATgroupsofwatersheds,re-interpolatedto the RECCAP regions. Foutgasrivers +lakesfromreference [ 26] produced on a 0.5◦×0.5◦globalgriddoesnotincludelakes(lakeswereaddedfromreference [ 27]). River outgassing from reference[26] amounts to half the value of reference [ 27]duetolowerestimatesofaverageriverpCO 2forthetropicsandSiberiaresultingfromamorerestrictivedata-selection process and additional averaging ef-fectsfromthestatisticalmodelappliedinreference[26].ForestimatingSHR(Equation2),weassumedthat carbon emitted by Foutgasrivers +lakesoriginatesentirely from terrestrial NPP. In reality, a fractionof this flux may originate from autotrophic carbonfixation in inland waters [ 72] and autotrophicrespirationfromfloodedplants[ 73].UncertaintyofFoutgasrivers +lakeswastakenfromoriginalpublications[26,27]. It ranges from 20% to 50% of the mean,dependingupontheregion.Foutgasestuaries istheoutgassingofCO 2fromestu-aries[74]calculatedbasedonacompilationoflocalfluxmeasurementsandaglobalsegmentationofthecoastalzoneintoMARCATSunits,whichaggregateCOSCAT regions. The estimation also accountsfor different estuarine types (small deltas, tidalsystems, lagoons, fjords). A fraction of Foutgasestuariesmay originate from autotrophic C fixation in tidalwetlands [ 75], which was ignored. The uncertaintyofFoutgasestuaries was set to 50%, based on expertjudgment.Other SHR estimates from site-level dataTwo independent estimates of SHR were obtainedtobecomparedwiththeoneobtainedfromregionalcarbon data (Fig. 2). The first estimate of SHR is agriddedproductfromtheextensionoftheapproachofHashimoto etal.[29],whichestimatessoilrespi-ration (SR) (including live-root respiration) usingnon-linearfunctionsofclimatevariablesandusingaglobal relationship between annual soil respirationand SHR [ 29,76]. Here, we use the version of thisapproach by Konings et al.[31], for which theparameters of both the climate–SR and SR–SHRrelationships were recalculated using site-leveldata of SR and SHR from the most recent versionof the Soil Respiration Data Base [ 77]( S R D B )(v20180216). These parameters were fitted to SRdata from 1979 sites instead of the original 1638sitesinreference[ 38].Similarly,362measurementsites of SHR distributed across all biomes wereused—a much larger data set than the original 53measurementsinthepreviousversionoftheSRDBdatabaseusedbyHashimoto etal.[29].ThesecondSHRgriddedproductwasproducedfor this study using site-level data from the sameSRDB data set upscaled but with a random forest(RF) machine-learning algorithm (SupplementaryText 3). We used 455 site-year observations intotal after data filtering (Supplementary Fig. 5)from the following criteria: (i) removing recordswithout complete temporal, coordinates informa-tion and annual SHR information; (ii) excludingobservations from manipulation experiments andsoda-lime-application experiments, which wouldunderestimate soil-CO 2fluxes [78]. The RF algo-rithm applied here is composed of an ensemble ofregression trees from bootstrapped training data[79].WetrainedRFmodelswithpredictorvariablesincluding annual temperature, precipitation, soilmoisture and radiation, gross primary productivity(GPP), nitrogen deposition, soil-carbon (depthsof0–30and30–100cm)andsoil-nitrogencontent(Supplementary Table 4).
