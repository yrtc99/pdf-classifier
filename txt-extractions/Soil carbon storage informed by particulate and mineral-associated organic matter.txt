Sequestration of carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM) is considered one of those strategies2. It can also bring important co-benefits such as improving soil health and providing soil services3. Temperate forest and grassland soils occupy a vast land surface area4, are often managed and can store large amounts of C5. Thus they can play a critical role in future soil C management.Organic C in soil is stored in a myriad of different chemical com -pounds, many of which contain nitrogen (N) and/or are formed through microbial activity that demands N. Furthermore, SOM requires more N per unit C than does plant biomass. Thus, the abil-ity of soils to store C is linked to N availability. Increasing soil C storage without increasing N fertilization or immobilizing N in soil and thus impacting plant productivity is a major challenge for soil C sequestration strategies6,7. Soil C/N ratio has been suggested as an indicator for the potential of soils to store C, with systems character -ized by a higher soil C/N ratio being able to accrue more C per unit N8. Following this logic, it has been suggested that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) systems, characterized by a higher C/N ratio, have a higher potential for C storage than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) systems8. However, the effect of N availability on soil C storage remains con -troversial, and both increased and decreased soil C storage have been observed as a result of long-term N additions9,10. Recent frame -works11–13 suggest that soil C accrual, persistence and response to N availability can be better described if SOM is broadly divided into a particulate organic matter (POM) and a mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) pool. POM, being predominantly of plant origin, contains many structural C compounds with low N content14 and persists in soil through inherent biochemical recalcitrance, physi -cal protection in aggregates and/or microbial inhibition. MAOM is largely made of microbial products richer in N and persists in soil because of chemical bonding to minerals and physical protection in small aggregates15. These two fractions can be analytically separated by size and/or density and show consistent differences in turnover times, with POM being more vulnerable to disturbance and cycling faster than MAOM16,17. In this study we used size separation and defined MAOM as the SOM fraction <53 μm and POM as the SOM fraction 53–2,000 μm (refs. 17,18).Because of the contrasting nature of these two SOM pools, we posit that soil C/N ratio and C sequestration potentials can be better understood through a framework based on the separation between POM and MAOM. For soil C/N ratio, for example, we can apply a mass balance approach described as:C=N SOM¼C=N MAOM ´fMAOM þC=N POM´1�fMAOM ðÞwhere C/NSOM, C/NPOM and C/NMAOM  are the C/N ratios of the total SOM, POM and MAOM, respectively, and fMAOM  is the MAOM proportion of the total SOM. The proportion of POM is 1 – fMAOM . Given that MAOM accrual is expected to be limited by mineral surface availability18,19, we posit that variation in soil C/N ratio and the ability of soils to sequester C is related to fMAOM , C/NPOM and C/NMAOM . Elucidating their drivers and impact on soil C storage can provide a useful guidance for soil C sequestration strategies.We used the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database20 to determine topsoil C and N storage in European for -ests and grasslands on 9,415 georeferenced points. We limited our analyses to soils with an organic C content lower than 12% to avoid organic soils. The LUCAS survey is restricted to the topsoil (0–20 cm), which represents 40–50% of the total soil C along the profile of grasslands and forest soils worldwide5.

Francesca Cotrufo   1*, Maria Giovanna Ranalli2, Michelle L. Haddix1, Johan Six3 and Emanuele Lugato   4Effective land-based solutions to climate change mitigation require actions that maximize soil carbon storage without generat -ing surplus nitrogen. Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without  considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more per -sistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter,  which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil car -bon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.NatuRE GE oSCiENCE | VOL 12 | DECEmbER 2019 | 989–994 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 989Articles NaTUrE GEosciENcEwe separated SOM into POM and MAOM by size (53 μm) and measured their C and N content. We used these measured data to predict the MAOM and POM fraction share of the SOM and their C and N content for the full dataset using the random forest (RF) approach (Supplementary Figs. 2–7). We assessed the role of land cover and plant–mycorrhizal associations on the relative contribu-tion of MAOM and POM to SOM and their C/N ratios. We used coniferous, mixed and broadleaved forests and wood-encroached, sporadic and pure grasslands as categories for land cover. For broad-leaved and mixed forests, we identified tree species composition and their mycorrhizal associations by coupling the LUCAS database with a high-resolution pan-European tree occurrence dataset21. Finally, we used path analyses, based on the 186 samples for which we had independent measured values, to investigate drivers of soil C stocks as affected by fMAOM , C/NPOM and C/NMAOM  (Methods).Soil organic C and N storageTop mineral soil (0–20 cm) organic C and N storage varied geo -graphically and by land-use cover (Fig. 1). Overall, mixed and conif -erous forests had the highest average organic C stocks compared with broadleaved forests and grasslands. Pure grasslands had the highest average N stocks. However, these differences among land covers may also be due to the generally higher proportion of soil organic carbon (OC) in the topsoil (0–20 cm) of forests (50% of their total OC stock) compared with grasslands (42%)5.Soil C/N ratio was relatively well constrained in European forest and grassland top mineral soils. The overall soil C/N average was 15.0 ± 6.5, which is within the distribution of C/N averages (9.9 to 25.8) found for world soils22. Coniferous and mixed forest soils had the highest and more variable soil C/N (22.5 ± 7.1 and 20.0 ± 6.2, respectively), while broadleaved forests (13.8 ± 4.0) and pure  grasslands (11.0 ± 2.1) had lower and more constrained C/N than coniferous and mixed forests (Fig. 2), as shown by their smaller standard deviations. Soil C/N ratio decreased with increasing fMAOM  across all land-use classes and, as expected, increased with increasing C/NPOM and C/NMAOM  (Fig. 2). Overall, the C/N of MAOM (12.6 ± 4.7) was lower and less variable than that of POM (22.1 ± 14.9; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7). While plants vary substantially in their C/N ratio, both among and within different plant species and plant organs and in response to environmental stressors23, soil microbes have a much more constrained C/N ratio, with fungi C/N ratio typically ranging between 4.5 and 15 and bac -teria C/N ratio ranging between 3 and 5 (ref. 24). It is thus expected that POM, consisting largely of partly decomposed plant material, has a more variable C/N ratio than MAOM (Fig. 2), which is mostly of microbial origin. Because woody inputs are characterized by high C/N and persistence in POM25 and are degraded by fungi, forests have generally higher C/N in soil, POM and MAOM relative to grasslands (Fig. 2). In forests, the C/NMAOM  exceeds the microbial range, indicating a higher contribution of plant-derived OM to the MAOM fraction in these systems, probably through ex vivo micro-bial transformations of plant inputs26 or occlusions of plant-derived particulate structures in small (<53 μm) aggregates27.The type of mycorrhizal associations may also be an important driver of soil C/N and fMAOM , due to the different degradability of their own tissues and their differential ability to degrade organic matter and release mineral N. ECM fungi produce lytic enzymes28, while arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi depend on saprotrophic organic matter decay and production of mineral N29. At a global scale, soils of ecosystems dominated by ecto- and erycoid mycorrhiza con -tained more C per unit N than soils in ecosystems dominated by arbuscular mycorrhiza8. However, in the framework of the plant economic spectrum, plant traits directly control the decompo -sition of plant residues, thus impacting C and N cycling in soil30.

Therefore, mycorrhizal effects on SOM and its C/N ratio are better assessed within the same land-cover class; broadleaved forests offer this opportunity since their trees may associate with either ecto- or arbuscular mycorrhiza32. When we compared soil C/N, C/NPOM,  C/NMAOM , fMAOM  and C stocks in MAOM and POM across broad -leaved and mixed forests for which we had mycorrhizal associa -tion, we observed on average 24% lower soil C/N in soils with AM compared with ECM (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). This was associated with a decrease in C/NMAOM  and an increase in fMAOM   (Fig. 3) and overall higher C stocks in MAOM (Supplementary Table 2). These findings confirm and generalize recent observa -tions of microbial residue accumulation, resulting in higher soil N in MAOM in AM-dominated temperate forests compared with temperate forests dominated by ECM33, which store more C in POM (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, these differences between ECM and AM broadleaved forest soils resulted in higher aver-age soil organic C stocks in ECM compared with AM systems (Supplementary Fig. 8), in line with global trends8. However, the difference in soil C stocks between ECM and AM was not statisti -cally significant (Supplementary Table 3). This study assessed only mineral soils (soil organic C < 12%). It is likely that ECM forests would accumulate more POM in their organic soil layer, resulting in overall more soil C in these forests8.implications for soil C sequestrationAverage soil C stocks in European grasslands and forest soils varied between 46 and 84 Mg C ha−1, with the highest stocks in coniferous or mixed forest (Fig. 1 ). This information, however, does not allow us to project the additional C storage capacity of these systems, which can be better informed by the relative distribution of C between MAOM and POM. In fact, across all sites, C storage in MAOM and POM fractions showed different dynamics with increasing total soil C content (Fig. 4 ). Storage of C in MAOM dominates in soils with relatively low C content. However, it saturates19, at which point addi -tional C storage is only realized through POM accrual. Across the entire soil organic C range, grasslands systems consistently have pro-portionally more MAOM and less POM than forests, in particular compared with coniferous forests (Fig. 4  and Supplementary Table 1). Independent of land cover, the majority of the sites (80%) are below the flex point in the relationship of MAOM to soil organic C (at 50 g soil organic C kg−1 soil), indicating a very large capacity for C accrual. We conducted a path analysis to understand whether typical environmental control of soil C storage3 affects it directly or through fMAOM , C/NPOM and C/NMAOM  variables. Because of C satu -ration, soil C stocks are highly and inversely related to fMAOM  (Fig. 5). A highly significant positive relation exists between C/NMAOM  and soil C stocks, probably because MAOM is the dominant SOM pool (that is, fMAOM  > 50%; Fig. 2) in most soils, while, surprisingly, C/NPOM appeared to be less important and negatively related to soil C stocks (Fig. 5). This finding demonstrates that at the continental scale, the N efficiency of C sequestration, (the amount of N required to sequester a unit of C) depends on the share between MAOM and POM, and their C/N ratios, as previously shown for broadleaved forests in the United States33. In another study conducted in a few European grass -lands and forest soils34, POM was identified as a strong predictor for both organic C and N, indicating a significant role of this largely plant derived and relatively vulnerable fraction for C storage in these eco-systems. In addition to land cover, soil edaphic factors (for example, soil texture and pH) control C storage through affecting fMAOM  and  C/NMAOM  (Fig. 5  and Supplementary Table 4). Of interest are the neg -ative correlations between C/NMAOM  and pH and between C/NMAOM  and silt and clay, possibly suggesting lower bacteria-derived organic matter contribution to MAOM in coarse-texture acidic soils35.Implementation of soil C sequestration strategies requires clear science-based guidelines that consider site-specific soil and eco -system properties, including the relative distribution of SOM into MAOM and POM. Here, we show that C sequestration in grasslands is highly persistent but requires a lot of N and saturates because of the dominance of MAOM-C in these systems.

Forests, however, have a greater plasticity in how soil C may be accrued because they can store more C in the less persistent and more vulnerable POM fraction. Afforestation for soil C sequestration should be designed on the basis of the soil properties (for example, silt and clay content, pH), C deficit and N availability and should use AM or EMC-associated tree species to maximize C accrual.online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa-tion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0484-6.Received: 11 January 2019; Accepted: 8 October 2019;  Published online: 18 November 2019References 1.

Soil data were extracted from the LUCAS database20. LUCAS is a land-use/cover survey consisting of 200,000 georeferenced points selected from a regular 2 km grid covering the European Union land. A Latin hypercube stratified random sampling was applied to select ∼20,000 soil sampling locations representative of European landscape features. Within each georeferenced location, a first subsample was taken by sampling the topsoil, after removal of the litter layer, to a depth of 20 cm. Four other similar samples were then taken at a distance of 2 m from the original sample, following the four cardinal directions. The five subsamples were subsequently composited, and 500 g of the composite was taken as the final sample. All samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh to remove organic fragments and analysed for coarse fragments (%), particle size distribution (% clay, silt and sand), pH, soil OC (SOC, g kg−1), carbonates (CaCO3, g kg−1), total N (g kg−1), available phosphorus (P , mg kg−1), extractable potassium (K, mg kg−1) and cation exchange capacity (CEC, cmol(+) kg−1) using International Organization for Standardization protocols.For this study, we restricted the analyses to the forest and grassland land-cover data and considered only mineral soils, defined as soils with an organic C concentration smaller than 120 g kg−1 (ref. 20), for a total of 9,415 points.In the database, forest and grassland sites are each separated in three land-cover categories assigned by the surveyor when visiting the site according to a predefined classification. No parameters regarding stand characteristics (numbers of stems, basal area and so on) were taken. Land-cover categories are coniferous (n = 1,713), mixed (n = 1,399) and broadleaved (n = 1,617) forests and wood-encroached (n = 635), pure (n = 3,533) and sporadic (n = 518) grasslands.Tree species and mycorrhiza data in broadleaved and mixed forests. For the broadleaved and mixed forests, we used a high-resolution pan-European tree occurrence dataset (European Forest Data Center; http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/efdac/) to assign tree species cover to the LUCAS points. The tree occurrence refers to the presence at the level of tree species over centroids of the ‘INSPIRE compliant’ 1 km2 European grid. Tree occurrence is intended as the verified presence of a given tree in a given area (in this case, 1 km2). First, we extracted from this database the tree species closest to the LUCAS points and compiled a tree species list for each point for which species data were obtained. Then we assigned to each tree species a mycorrhizal associate (ECM, AM or either (if a tree could associate to both)) using published plant-specific mycorrhizal associations37. In case of multiple mycorrhizal associations at the LUCAS point, we classified it as ‘not determined’ (ND) because it was impossible to define a unique association (ND = 1,078 points).SOM fractions and their C/N ratio. To determine the relative contribution MAOM versus POM fraction to total SOM and the C/N ratios of the two fractions, a representative (Supplementary Fig. 1) subset (n = 186) of the LUCAS soil samples, which included 95 grassland sites and 72 forested sites, was fractionated by size (53 μm) after full soil dispersion16. Briefly, soils were sieved to 2 mm, and 5 g oven-dried soil was shaken in dilute (0.5%) sodium hexametaphosphate and beads for 18 h to completely disperse the soil. The dispersed soil was then rinsed onto a 53 µm sieve and the fraction passing through (<53 µm) was collected as MAOM; the fraction remaining on the sieve was collected as POM. This fractionation approach was chosen as the most appropriate to separate SOM into two meaningful fractions (POM versus MAOM) with different characteristics and dynamics while being a convenient approach for high throughput16. Since the approach defines POM by size (>53 μm), very small amounts of very fine POM are recovered in the MAOM fraction, but this does not lead to different interpretations or conclusions regarding the overall functioning of the MAOM versus POM fraction17,18.After drying to constant weight in a 60 °C oven, each fraction was analysed for C and N concentration in an elemental analyser (LECO TruSpec CN). A few of the measured soils contained inorganic C, which was removed from the sample by acid digestion38 before elemental analyses.The measured MAOM C and N (n = 186) were used to estimate MAOM and POM C and N for the remaining 9,229 soils of the LUCAS database, using the RF approach (Supplementary Fig. 2), and estimated MAOM C and N were compared with the measured data for verification (Supplementary Fig. 3), as described in the data analyses section that follows. In our analyses, soil organic C is used as a proxy for SOM, avoiding the use of conversion factors.Climate, net primary productivity and N deposition data. For each data point, long-term mean annual temperature (MAT, °C) and annual precipitation (cm) were obtained from the high-resolution WorldClim dataset (version 2), which has average monthly climate data for minimum, mean and maximum temperature and for precipitation for 1970–2000 (http://worldclim.org/version2).An estimate of the yearly net primary production of LUCAS locations was derived overlaying those points with the 10 yr average Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 2000–2010 at 1 km resolution (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod17a3).The average N depositions for the period 2006–2010 were derived from  the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model (rv 4.5)  (ref. 39), providing wet and dry deposition spatially distributed across coniferous and deciduous forests and semi-natural areas (including all grassland).Statistical analyses.  The ‘RandomForest’ library of R core (https://www.r-project.org/)  was used to predict the measured C and N in the MAOM fraction (g C kg−1 soil and g N kg−1 soil, respectively) from the following predictors: silt + clay content, pH, total SOC, total soil N, N deposition, MAT, land cover, extractable potassium. Those variables were selected among all the variables available to represent soil, climate and land-use characteristics, although only a few of them explained most of the variance (Supplementary Fig. 2). The RF explained 86.0 and 90.8 of the variance in predicting C and N in the MAOM fraction, respectively, with high agreement between measurements and predictions (Supplementary Fig. 3). We performed a cross-validation for the predictions of the C and N in MAOM by splitting the measured dataset in different thresholds of training and testing data (Supplementary Fig. 4). The model-training performances were very good with R2 > 0.8 for all runs.After the RF training, the model was used to predict the C and N in the MAOM fraction for the 9,229 LUCAS points without fractionation measurements, using the same covariates. The C and N in the POM fractions were calculated as a difference from the total soil organic C and N, respectively. In a few LUCAS points, the estimated C (n  = 109) and N (n  = 176) in the POM fraction were negative (Supplementary Fig. 5) and were excluded as considered model failure. With this approach, we are being conservative on the potential to store C in the MAOM fraction. As some points were overlapping, a total of 222 were excluded, representing only 2% of the entire dataset. The points measured spanned the full range of the estimated points. However, only a few were on the high end of the SOM values (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, to evaluate the significance of the curvature in the relationship between SOC stocks and MAOM, which is at the base of the saturation concept, we fitted a generalized additive model (GAM) with P-splines smoother using the GAM function of the ‘gamm4’ R library. The estimated curve uses 2.84 d.f. if all points are included, or 2.61 d.f. if the last two are removed. In either case, the approximate significance of the smooth term is very high (P  < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 6), confirming C saturation of the MAOM fraction (Fig. 4 ).We used 1,000 bootstrap replicates to obtain a measure of the uncertainty of the  predicted means for C and N in the MAOM and in the POM fractions by land use  and mycorrhizal association obtained with RF. Given that the 186 measured sample  points were representative of the overall population of LUCAS points, we implemen-ted a direct finite population bootstrap that is a mixture of a simple random sampling without replacement and a one–one design (algorithm 3, ref. 40). Given the natural unbalance between mycorrhizal types, mycorrhizal distribution has been considered a classification variable. The effect of the different sample sizes has been incorporated into the 95% confidence intervals in Supplementary Table 2, obtained using the bootstrap distribution. This analysis confirmed the significantly lower soil C/N ratio and higher MAOM fraction in the AM forests compared with ECM forests (Fig. 3 ).We conducted a path analysis on the 186 measured soil samples to assess the direct and indirect effects on SOC stocks of silt + clay content, pH, MAT, N deposition, net primary production, forests and grasslands. In particular, we fitted a structural equation model with observed variables using maximum likelihood and including fMAOM , C/NPOM and C/NMAOM  as mediation variables. To this end, we have used the structural equation model function of the ‘lavaan’ R library41. The final set of factors was assessed by retrieving only those with a P  < 0.05 in at least one regression. We limited this analysis to the 186 measured soil samples to avoid circularity in our reasoning and have this analysis entirely independent of the RF analyses.Data availabilityData from the LUCAS database can be accessed at http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/lucas-2009-topsoil-data.
