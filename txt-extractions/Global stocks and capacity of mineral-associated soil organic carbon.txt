Torn17,18Soil is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon and is central for climate changemitigation and carbon-climate feedbacks. Chemical and physical associations of soil carbonwith minerals play a critical role in carbon storage, but the amount and global capacity forstorage in this form remain unquanti ﬁed. Here, we produce spatially-resolved global esti-mates of mineral-associated organic carbon stocks and carbon-storage capacity by analyzing1144 globally-distributed soil pro ﬁles. We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depthof 1 m in non-permafrost mineral soils. Although this constitutes 66% and 70% of soil carbonin surface and deeper layers, respectively, it is only 42% and 21% of the mineralogicalcapacity. Regions under agricultural management and deeper soil layers show the largestundersaturation of mineral-associated carbon. Critically, the degree of undersaturationindicates sequestration ef ﬁciency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from theirmineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of theircapacity. Our ﬁndings provide insights into the world ’s soils, their capacity to store carbon,and priority regions and actions for soil carbon management.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 OPEN1Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94551, USA.2Department of Earth System Science,Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.3Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.4Precourt Institute forEnergy, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.5Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, Antwerp 2000, Belgium.6Institute for EnvironmentalStudies, Charles University, Prague 128 01, Czech Republic.7Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l ’Environnement, Gif-sur-Yvette F-91191, France.8Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA.9Deptartment of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science,Lund University, Lund SE-22100, Sweden.10Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 10081, China.11U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA 94035, USA.12Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EA, UK.13CambridgeConservation Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EA, UK.14Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Temple, TX76502, USA.15Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.16Granular, Inc, San Francisco,CA 94103, USA.17Climate and Ecosystem Sciences, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.18Energy and Resources Group,University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.✉email: georgiou1@llnl.govNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3797 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an integral component of ter-restrial ecosystems and plays an important role in ecosys-tem resilience and productivity. Soil organic matter containsnutrients that support plant growth and yield, retains water andreduces runoff, and resists erosion1. Globally, SOC contains morecarbon than the atmosphere and vegetation combined2–4. Cli-mate- and land-use-induced changes to soil may alter SOCcycling and drive large terrestrial carbon sinks or sources; indeed,human land-use and land-cover change have resulted in a sig-niﬁcant net loss of soil carbon over the past two centuries5–7.Improved soil management practices that promote soil carbonsequestration, especially in stable carbon pools, are needed toreverse this trajectory and mitigate climate change8,9.Field observations suggest that more than half of soil organiccarbon is chemically or physically associated with soilminerals10,11(Supplementary Fig. 1). These interactions limitmicrobial access to otherwise decomposable substrates12,13and,consequently, mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) canhave turnover times up to 1000 times longer (reaching100–10,000 years) than particulate organic carbon (POC) at thesame depth14,15. Thus, increasing MOC may be a key to lastingcarbon sequestration in soils16. However, despite its unique role,it is still unclear how much MOC presently exists, and how muchcould be accrued, in soils globally across depths and geographicregions. The capacity of soils to store MOC and other persistentforms of SOC will in ﬂuence the long-term trajectory of the ter-restrial carbon sink. Furthermore, it is unknown whether theproximity of a given soil to its carbon-storage capacity willinﬂuence the rate of C accrual, and thus the ef ﬁcacy of soil Csequestration efforts. These knowledge gaps hinder climatechange mitigation pathways and soil management initiatives, andlimit long-term projections of Earth system models.Soil organic matter decomposition, and its response andfeedback to climate, depends on the physico-chemical form of theorganic matter. To improve projections of long-term soil-climatefeedbacks, it is imperative to predict the amount, distribution, anddynamics of MOC17. Yet, little attention has been afforded to theexplicit representation and parameterization of mineral-organicassociations in Earth system models18. Organic matter andminerals form associations via myriad mechanisms, includingligand exchange, hydrophobic interactions, and cation bridging19,and the appropriate —representative yet tractable —mathematicalformulation of MOC dynamics in these models is still the subjectof research20,21. Nevertheless, existing and candidate approachesrequire a means to constrain the maximum mineralogical capa-city (MOC max). This MOC max is a property of the soilmineralogy22,23. A data-driven approach to convert readilymeasured soil mineralogical variables to MOC maxis thereforeneeded to achieve advances in modeling and to enable robustestimates of carbon sequestration capacity.Here we synthesized MOC observations from 1144 soil pro ﬁlesspanning diverse biomes, soil types, and climates worldwide. Oursynthesis included soils with a wide range of clay plus silt mineralcontent (CS; 1.5 –100%), mean annual temperature (MAT;−2.9–29 °C), and mean annual precipitation (MAP;79–3806 mm yr−1), as well as different vegetation types and land-uses (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). We leveraged these obser-vations, with insights from theory and process-based models, anddemonstrated that MOC maxcan be inferred as an emergentproperty from readily measured soil mineralogical variables. Weexplored the variability of observed MOC and used a machinelearning approach to elucidate the role of environmental vari-ables, including climate and vegetation, in driving the observeddepartures from mineralogical saturation. We categorized sitesinto natural/less-managed (forest and grassland) and intensivelymanaged (cropland) ecosystems to further investigate the effectsof vegetation type and management on the degree of MOCundersaturation across soil depths. Finally, to explore how thisundersaturation affects the sequestration ef ﬁcacy of soils overdecadal timescales, we examined 103 carbon-accrual measure-ments spanning management interventions globally.Results and discussionCarbon capacity of low- and high-activity mineral soils . Studieshave presented con ﬂicting results on the importance of clay plussilt content (CS) as a single linear predictor of MOC24–26, withmany of these analyses focusing on the prediction of bulk SOC,which contains additional pools of non-mineral-associatedorganic carbon (e.g., POC). As we present here, theory andmodel insights, as well as our extensive global data analysis, allsuggest that there is no universal linear relationship betweenMOC (or SOC) and CS (Supplementary Figs. 4 –6). Rather, thisrelationship depends, to a ﬁrst-degree, on the combined effect ofthe C loading on minerals (g C m−2mineral) which is a functionof environmental conditions and management practices27, andthe effective mineral area on which C can bind (m2g−1mineral)which is a function of the type of mineral22,28,29. However, sinceMOC maxis driven primarily by the amount (g mineral kg−1soil)and type of mineral23,28, we hypothesized that if soils were par-titioned based on their dominant mineral type, CS would emergeas a signi ﬁcant predictor of MOC maxglobally.To test this hypothesis, we classi ﬁed soils according to theirmineral type and explored whether the upper quantiles ofobserved MOC form distinct boundaries for different mineralcategories, i.e., whether a distinct MOC max speciﬁc to eachmineral type arises (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Here, weclassi ﬁed soils as containing high- or low-activity minerals (HMor LM, respectively) based on their primary composition of high-activity (illite, smectite, vermiculite, chlorite) and low-activity(kaolinite, gibbsite) clays29–31(see “Methods ”for the robustnessof results to additional categories).Indeed, our data synthesis quanti ﬁes and supports thishypothesis, demonstrating that a robust MOC maxestimate canemerge as a function of only CS and the type of mineral (Fig. 1;and irrespective of vegetation type, Supplementary Fig. 8). Weobtained a conservative estimate of MOC maxas the 95th quantileof MOC values for each mineral type, resulting in MOC maxestimates of 86 ± 9 and 48 ± 6 mg C g−1mineral for HM and LM,respectively (Fig. 1; slope ± 90% con ﬁdence interval, following aunit conversion). These data-derived estimates of MOC maxprovide a maximum carbon potential for a given CS and mineraltype, which can be used to inform the location and managementpractices of soil restoration and sequestration efforts (Supple-mentary Discussion). These values broadly agree with regionalstudies that have included high-activity minerals at comparablesoil depths28,32,33, but are signi ﬁcantly greater than studies thathave omitted mineral activity24,34–37. Given the important role ofmineralogy (Supplementary Fig. 4), our data-driven MOC maxestimates are also a notable update to regional studies that havereported a maximum carbon potential across European soils (e.g.,45–50 g C kg−1soil based on model-predicted values in ref.11).While it may be dif ﬁcult for soils to reach MOC maxin practice,the proximity of a given soil to its maximum capacity is animportant factor for determining its effectiveness in sequesteringadditional carbon (see Supplementary Fig. 9 for a conceptualschematic)38,39and, consequently, underestimating MOC maxcanhave signi ﬁcant implications for estimates of carbon de ﬁcit andpotential accrual.Vegetation and management controls on carbon under-saturation across depths . Our analysis suggests that many soilsARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-92 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3797 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsare substantially below their mineralogical capacity (Fig. 1). Thismineralogical undersaturation may be attributed to environ-mental (e.g., climate and plant C inputs) limitations on MOCstorage and decomposition, management practices that result inMOC losses, or both. To explore where and why soils contain lessMOC than they could based on their mineralogy alone, we cal-culated the mineralogical % C saturation for a given soil as theratio of observed MOC to MOC max(see “Methods ”; Supple-mentary Fig. 10). Across all sites, soils averaged 40 ± 2% Csaturation (±95% con ﬁdence interval of the mean). Land-usechange and/or poor management practices that degrade soils candecrease MOC, a result evident in the shift of C saturation dis-tributions from less-managed to more intensively managed eco-systems (Fig. 2a). The former (namely, grasslands and forests),which we refer to here as natural ecosystems for brevity, had onaverage higher levels of C saturation than did agricultural systems(p< 0.0001; Fig. 2a). Indeed, whereas soils in natural ecosystemsaveraged 46 ± 3% C saturation, agricultural systems averaged only31 ± 2% C saturation. This contrast suggests that restoringdegraded or intensively managed lands could push their soilstowards higher C saturation levels (i.e., their highest attainableMOC given the site-speci ﬁc environmental factors that limitstocks below MOC max) and allow them to serve as a substantial Csink.We also observed that deeper soils were further from Csaturation than were surface soils ( p< 0.0001; Fig. 2b). Onaverage, surface soils (0 –30 cm) were 43 ± 2% C saturated, ascompared to 19 ± 3% C saturation for deeper soils (30 –120 cm).This difference is likely due, in part, to lower rates of C inputswith depth40,41. The location and type of C inputs are alsoimportant, as a higher proportion of plant C is retained in SOCfrom belowground root inputs than from aboveground litterinputs42–44. We may then expect a difference in C saturationlevels between grasslands and forests, which have different rootdepth distributions45.

This pattern con ﬁrms that root pro ﬁles and rates of Cinputs in ﬂuence the achieved MOC levels. This is an additionalreason to expect that deeper-rooted vegetation may be moreeffective in sequestering C, and should thus be examined forrestoring degraded lands and selecting cover crops41,46.Climate controls on mineral-associated organic carbon . Cli-mate also affects the achieved MOC in soil and its departure fromsaturation. However, MOC does not vary linearly with extrinsicfactors such as temperature, but rather its response is governed by‘pedogenic thresholds ’and nonlinearities47. We thus used amachine learning approach to determine the signi ﬁcance of keycovariates and reveal emergent relationships of each variable, aswell as variable interactions, on MOC (i.e., partial dependenceplots; see “Methods ”). This approach illuminates not only theoverall sensitivity of MOC to individual variables but also theconditional relationship and rate of change with respect to a givenvariable (i.e., the partial derivative), without imposing a particular(e.g., linear) relationship. Speci ﬁcally, we optimized a randomforest (RF) model using key environmental covariates (see“Methods ”;R2=0.60, Supplementary Fig. 11). We then calcu-lated partial dependence relationships of MOC as a function ofeach variable alone (Supplementary Fig. 12), as well as condi-tional on interactions between variables (Fig. 3).Clear predictive relationships emerged for MOC as a functionof each variable. We found a linear partial dependence relation-ship between MOC and CS (Supplementary Fig. 12a), which canbe attributed to an underlying increase in total mineral surfacearea and pore space22,48. This result supports studies that ﬁndcorrelations between MOC and CS, but illustrates the importanceof controlling for the variability introduced by environmentalcovariates. With POC, we observed a saturating relationship inMOC (Fig. 3a), corresponding to an increase in C loading up toan effective saturation of mineral surfaces48,49. Although not all ofthis POC may be able to sorb onto mineral surfaces, it emerged asa signi ﬁcant variable in our analysis (Supplementary Figs. 11 and12), likely as an indicator of rapidly decomposing material andthe production of microbial necromass and dissolved organiccarbon. In contrast, machine learning predictions of theconditional relationship between MOC and aboveground litterinputs showed a weaker dependence, consistent with otherﬁndings that aboveground productivity and litterfall are often notgood proxies for carbon inputs to mineral soils42.We observed a decline in MOC with MAT (Fig. 3b andSupplementary Fig. 12c) which is consistent with increasedrelative desorption with increasing temperatures50,51, and sug-gests a potential global vulnerability of MOC to warming. Thisdecline with MAT also emerged across different ranges of POC,but interestingly, with signi ﬁcant differences in magnitude(Fig. 3b); low POC regimes (which are furthest from MOCsaturation; Fig. 3a) exhibited greater temperature sensitivitiescompared to high POC regimes (soils closer to saturation;Fig.3a). Distinct temperature-dependence regimes of saturatingsorption curves are corroborated by theory (SupplementaryFig. 6) and experiments52. Speci ﬁcally, when available carbonconcentrations are low, MOC depends on the equilibriumconstant Keq¼fðTÞ(i.e., the ratio of adsorption to desorptionrate constants; Supplementary Fig. 6) which is a strong functionof temperature, whereas when concentrations are high, MOCapproaches MOCmax≠fðTÞand hence exhibits a weakertemperature dependence. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest thatrestoring degraded soils towards their mineralogical capacitythrough improved land management may not only contribute tocarbon sequestration efforts53but also impart a greater resiliencyof soils to future warming.Finally, we leveraged a machine learning approach to predictcurrent MOC globally, excluding tundra, peatlands, and deserts (see“Methods ”;R2=0.79, Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). Weestimated that MOC stocks total 899 Pg C (5 –95% range: 668,1074 Pg C) to a depth of 1 m, with 448 Pg C (296, 536) in topsoils(0–30 cm) and 451 Pg C (372, 538) in subsoils (30 –100 cm) (Fig. 4and Supplementary Fig. 15; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).Globally, MOC made up a smaller proportion of total SOC intopsoils (0.66 ± 0.13; mean ± s.d.) compared to in subsoils(0.70 ± 0.17) (0.69 ± 0.15 to a depth of 1 m; Supplementary Fig. 16).Soils had a smaller proportion of MOC to SOC in boreal regionsthan in tropical and temperate regions, suggesting a largerproportion of non-protected carbon (i.e., POC) at high latitudest h a tm a yb ev u l n e r a b l et ow a r m i n g54(Supplementary Discussion).Our global estimates of MOC stocks, and as a fraction of total SOC,are to our knowledge the ﬁrst such spatially- and depth-resolveddata products, providing a crucial link for understanding soil carbonvulnerability, benchmarking soil carbon models17, and assessing themineralogical potential for carbon sequestration globally.10203001 0 2 0 3 0POC (g C kg−1soil)Predicted MOC (g C kg−1soil)1020300 5 10 15 20 25MAT ( °C)Predicted MOC (g C kg−1soil)b aHMLH M LFig. 3 Data-driven predictive relationships of mineral-associated organic carbon as a function of individual controlling factors and interaction s.Arandom forest model was used to disentangle the signi ﬁcance and emergent relationships of individual covariates, using partial dependence relationshipsthat describe the marginal effect of each variable on the predicted mineral-associated carbon (MOC) response (see “Methods ”).aPredicted MOC as afunction of particulate organic C (POC).

We used the sameclassi ﬁcation of mineral types from our observational synthesis tomap high- and low-activity minerals (HM and LM, respectively;see“Methods ”, Supplementary Fig. 14). Together with a globalmap of CS and our derived relationships for MOC maxin HM andLM soils, we calculated the corresponding MOC maxglobally(Fig. 4and Supplementary Fig. 17). This spatially explicit anddepth-resolved global product provides insights into the capacityof the world ’s soils to store MOC. Globally, we estimate that thesoil mineralogical C capacity is 1443 ± 141 Pg C and 3153 ± 312Pg C in topsoils and subsoils, respectively, totaling 4596 PgC ± 453 Pg C to a depth of 1 m (excluding tundra, peatlands, anddeserts; Supplementary Table 1). Many sites in temperate andsubequatorial zones show the greatest mineralogical C de ﬁcit(MOCmaxminus MOC), and thus potential for additional MOCstorage, in part because of the prevalence of agricultural soilsthere (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Figs. 18 –20). Indeed, we esti-mate that the mineralogical C de ﬁcit of croplands is 184 Pg C(5–95% range: 148, 225) and 509 Pg C (439, 569) in topsoils andsubsoils, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). While reachingMOC maxis dif ﬁcult and strongly limited by climate (Fig. 3), ifthese soils achieved the average %C saturation levels of naturallands (Fig. 2), this potential sequestration would total nearly 104Pg C to a depth of 1 m (62 and 42 Pg C in topsoils and subsoils,respectively) (Supplementary Table 1). Grazing lands also show alarge mineralogical C de ﬁcit covering a large expanse globally, butwill require tailored strategies for soil C restoration, especially inarid and semi-arid regions that are additionally limited by climate(e.g., the Southwestern United States and Ustyurt Plateau). Ourmaps reveal hotspots of mineralogical C de ﬁcit, often associatedwith long-standing cropping and grazing lands (Fig. 4and Sup-plementary Figs. 20 and 21), and highlight priority regions for soilC restoration efforts.Current MOC stocks correspond to global average C saturationlevels of 42% (5 –95% range: 24%, 61%) and 21% (14%, 30%) intopsoils and subsoils, respectively (Fig. 4c and SupplementaryFigs. 18 and 19; Supplementary Table 2). However, asexplained earlier, reaching C saturation is not necessarily feasible(given climate limitations, for example) or a recommended target.Rather, the potential lies initially in restoring the natural %Csaturation in managed areas (Supplementary Figs. 18 –22; Sup-plementary Table 1) and, especially, those furthest from %Csaturation (Supplementary Fig. 9; Supplementary Discussion).We identify geographic locations with the most promise (namely,temperate and subequatorial zones in the northern hemisphere;Fig. 4c) and highlight the potential bene ﬁt of practices thatsequester C deeper in the soil pro ﬁle, where soil minerals arefurther from %C saturation (Supplementary Figs. 18 –20). Inaddition to practices that leverage deeper-rooted vegetation41,recent studies have indicated that new approaches to deepploughing55or other practices resulting in topsoil-subsoilﬂipping56may lead to considerable overall C sequestration,02460 50 100 150 200%C saturationC accrual (t ha−1yr−1)a bd cFig. 4 Global soil mineralogical carbon capacity, mineral-associated carbon stocks, and potential for carbon accrual. a Mineralogical carbon capacity(MOC max;k gCm−2soil), bmineral-associated organic carbon (MOC; kg C m−2soil), and cpercent mineralogical carbon saturation (%C saturation) intopsoil (0 –30 cm) at 0.5° resolution, excluding tundra, peatlands, and deserts.

Our global estimate of MOC maxconstitutes an effectivepotential for sorption on minerals, unlike that derived fromlaboratory DOC sorption experiments alone57,58. Laboratoryassays tend to underestimate maximum sorption potential,especially if they use native soil which already has some carbonloading on mineral surfaces57,58. Moreover, microbial necromassand residues contribute substantially to MOC measured in theﬁeld59, and thus, our estimates have the potential to uniquelyimprove model parameterizations beyond those obtained fromlaboratory measurements.Carbon sequestration implications and future perspectives .Geographic regions with higher C de ﬁcit can be used to inform soilC sequestration efforts, such as the “4 per 1000 ”initiative60,61andother nature-based climate solutions62,63. Soils with higher de ﬁcit(Supplementary Fig. 20), and thus lower %C saturation (Fig. 4c,Supplementary Fig. 18), may provide greater C sequestration ef ﬁ-cacy (Supplementary Fig. 9), through C accumulation rates that arelarger and can be sustained for years to decades until a new steady-state is reached39. We synthesized studies that measured C accrualrates following management interventions intended to promote Cstorage ( n=103, ranging from 2 to 65 years; SupplementaryFigs. 23 and 24) and found that soils furthest from their miner-alogical capacity (i.e., lowest %C saturation) achieve the highestrates of C accrual (Fig. 4d). In fact, carbon accrual rates were onaverage three times higher in soils from sites with <10% Csaturation compared to sites with 50% C saturation (Fig. 4d). Thisresult is critical for identifying global regions that, in addition to asigniﬁcant capacity for C storage, may also provide greater Csequestration ef ﬁcacy (Supplementary Fig. 9; Supplementary Dis-cussion). Indeed, many of these potential sequestration hotspotsare located in extensive cropping regions (e.g., Midwestern UnitedStates and India; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22) thatcould be incentivized to sequester C, with additional co-bene ﬁts forsoil productivity and food security64,65.Estimates of global potential soil C sequestration rates varyconsiderably, but recent reviews suggest the annual technicalpotential of individual practices (e.g., no-till agriculture and agro-forestry) applied globally is on the order of 2 –5P gC O 2yr−1(0.5–1.4 Pg C yr−1)62,66,67; implementation potentials giveneconomic considerations fall at the lower end of this range68,while nutrient limitations may further limit achievablesequestration69,70. While the implementation of soil managementinterventions across the world ’s >500 million active farms posesformidable socioeconomic challenges71,72, actionable valuation ofsoil C accumulation may incentivize restorative soil managementin targeted areas73,74, with enduring co-bene ﬁts for soilproductivity64,65. Despite the many challenges of such interven-tions, if the average C accrual rates from our synthesis (Fig. 4d)were achieved globally over all croplands (Supplementary Fig. 22),we estimate that soil C sequestration efforts could store over 1 PgCy r−1given current stocks, on par with the bottom-up estimatesof soil C sequestration potential for agricultural lands62,66,67.W ediffer, however, in the duration that such carbon uptake ratescould be maintained. Effective C sequestration would push soilstowards higher %C saturation (Fig. 4d), thereby lowering their Csequestration ef ﬁciency over time.While many soil C sequestration initiatives are centered onimproved management of current croplands60,61(which oftenshow more modest C accrual rates and %C saturation;Supplementary Figs. 20 –22 and 23b), the potential for soil Csequestration is relevant across nature-based climate solutionsmore broadly62,63. For example, there are growing efforts inquantifying the potential for C sequestration on abandonedpastures and croplands75–79, as well as restoring degradedrangelands80–84. Though agricultural lands are still expandingin some parts of the world, nearly 90 million hectares ofagricultural lands were abandoned between 1985-2005 in NorthAmerica, Europe, Oceania, and South Asia85(and up to 472million hectares have been abandoned globally over the last fewcenturies86). Many of these lands are in regions with low %Csaturation, where our synthesis suggests that revegetation andrestoration interventions have the potential to achieve high ratesof C accrual (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Figs. 23 –25, SupplementaryTable 4). Finally, we note that given the considerable departure ofmost current and abandoned agricultural lands from theirrespective mineralogical capacities (Figs. 1,2, SupplementaryFigs. 20 –22) (following losses in soil C content5), incentives thatencourage widespread soil C sequestration efforts are crucial forscaling and achieving mitigation targets.Our study provides a spatially explicit global estimate of themineralogical capacity of the world ’s soils to store carbon and animproved understanding of the factors —natural and managed —that drive soils below their capacity. While MOC constitutes themajority (69%) of total SOC in the top meter of non-permafrostmineral soils (totaling 899 Pg C), we ﬁnd that this represents lessthan half of the mineralogical carbon-storage capacity. Theunderstanding of how climate and vegetation affect MOC stocks,and the pronounced undersaturation in managed lands, inparticular, suggests that there is signi ﬁcant potential for restoringor enhancing MOC storage. Our estimate of MOC maxcan bereﬁned in future studies as scientists collect more data onadditional mineral types, but already provides a data frameworkto inform ESMs, paleo reconstructions of soils, and policies forsoil carbon sequestration. Long-term changes in C inputs mayhave lasting effects on MOC that are particularly pertinent forland management decisions that seek to sequester carbon87.Other soil modi ﬁcation options —e.g., adding more clay toexisting sandy soils88—to sequester more MOC may also beplausible, but require substantial research to investigate the gains,co-bene ﬁts, and potential consequences. Our ﬁndings shed lighton potential responses and vulnerabilities of MOC to novelnatural or managed conditions and emphasize that it is critical toconsider the whole system when comparing policies andpractices.MethodsObservational synthesis of mineral-associated carbon . In the present study, weaimed to quantify the maximum capacity of soils to stabilize mineral-associatedorganic carbon as a function of soil mineralogy, and to resolve the underlyingvariability due to climate, vegetation, and management. We hypothesized that themaximum mineralogical capacity (MOCmax) of soils is a function of the amount (%clay+silt; CS) and type (high- or low-activity; HM or LM, respectively) of mineral,while the achieved mineral-associated carbon (MOC) is additionally a function ofclimate, vegetation, and management:MOCmax¼f1mineral amount ;mineral type/C0/C1ð1ÞMOC ¼f2MOCmax ;climate ;vegetation ;management ;¼/C0/C1ð2ÞTherefore, we performed an observational synthesis from studies that includedMOC (as measured by size and density fractionation, retaining information aboutthe size and density cutoffs), independent particulate organic carbon (POC) andsoil organic carbon (SOC) measurements, as well as auxiliary data that includedmean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), clay and silt(CS), mineral type and soil order, vegetation type and carbon inputs, total, parti-culate, and mineral-associated nitrogen, and a variety of mineralogical soilARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-96 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3797 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsproperties (e.g., cation exchange capacity, iron, and aluminum content, amongothers), where available. To locate studies, we searched Google Scholar for com-binations of the keywords “soil carbon ”,“mineral-associated ”,“clay”,“silt”,“sizefractionation ”,“density fractionation ”, and “carbon saturation ”. We found thatstudies that measured MOC by both size and density fractionation (e.g., refs.89–91)were consistent and within the limit of MOC maxfor each mineral type, and thatboth methods concluded similar ranges of MOC to SOC ratios10(SupplementaryFig. 1). These ﬁndings support the use of either fractionation method for the goalsof our particular study.The observational synthesis totalled 1144 mineral soil pro ﬁles from 78 studiesthat reported fractionation and bulk measurements of carbon and nitrogen acrossdepths. Speci ﬁcally, the dataset included: 359 (<2 μm; clay fraction only) and 1451(<63 μm; clay and silt fraction) MOC measurements, 1107 POC measurements,and 1432 SOC measurements, as well as corresponding MAT, MAP, CS, soil order,mineral type, and vegetation type (see section “Deﬁning and evaluating ecosystemcategories ”for classi ﬁcation details). We also collected other auxiliary soilproperties, including dithionite- and oxalate-extractable iron (Fe dand Fe o,respectively), oxalate-extractable aluminum (Al ox), cation exchange capacity(CEC), speci ﬁc surface area (SSA), and total reserve bases (TRB), though thesemeasurements were sparse across the collected studies. A complete list of studiesand their location, climate, and vegetation is provided in Supplementary Table 3.Studies in our synthesis spanned intensively managed (e.g., crop) to natural/less-managed (e.g., grassland, forest) ecosystems across diverse climates and soiltypes (Fig. 1and Supplementary Fig. 2). We obtained a representative mix of MOCmeasurements from managed ( n=559 pro ﬁles) and natural ( n=585 pro ﬁles)lands. We focused on the current management status herein, but note that futurestudies may consider information on historical management, where available.Within natural lands, there was a greater representation of temperate ecosystems,as opposed to tropical and boreal ecosystems (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, and 14) —especially when including the European LUCAS database11,92(SupplementaryFig. 2b, d), but our model and results were robust to its exclusion. Furthermore,measurements in tundra and deserts were limited, highlighting the need for studiesin these regions (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Nevertheless, ourobservational synthesis spanned diverse climates and soil types: MAT ranged from−2.9 to 29 °C, MAP from 79 to 3806 mm yr−1, and CS from 1.5 to 100%, acrossdifferent mineral and vegetation types (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Fig. 2).Indeed, our synthesis spanned the majority of the climate-edaphic covariate spaceencompassed by the world ’s soils in WoSIS (World Soil Information Service)93(Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). We further illustrated the global representativeness ofour synthesis within a multi-dimensional covariate space using a principalcomponent analysis (PCA) and comparing to randomly sampled WoSIS pro ﬁles(Supplementary Fig. 3c). We note that even WoSIS soil pro ﬁles showed a greaterrepresentation in temperate ecosystems compared to tropical and borealecosystems94(Supplementary Fig. 3b), further highlighting the need for additionalmeasurements in these regions.Deﬁning and evaluating ecosystem categories . Here we classi ﬁed soils into twobroad categories of mineral type and activity; namely, low-activity minerals (LM)and high-activity minerals (HM). We used soil order from each individual studyand, when provided, details on clay composition to categorize the soil of each site.Phyllosilicate clay minerals —composed of tetrahedral silicate sheets and octahedralhydroxide sheets —are composed of either 1:1 (one tetrahedral and one octahedralsheet) or 2:1 (one octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets)clays. 1:1 clays are prevalent in kaolinitic soils and generally have a lowerSSA14,28,29,95; therefore, such soils generally exhibit a lower capacity to stabilizecarbon and can be characterized as LM. In contrast, 2:1 clays are present insmectitic (e.g., montmorillonitic) and illitic soils and can be characterized as HM,on account of their high SSA10,14,28,29. Finally, soils with amorphous, poorlycrystalline minerals and mineraloids (e.g., allophane) also depicted high stabiliza-tion (described in greater detail below) and were grouped with HM.Soil orders (USDA taxonomy) represented in this study include Al ﬁsols,Andisols, Aridisols, Entisols, Gelisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Oxisols, Spodosols,Ultisols, and Vertisols; we excluded organic soils in wetlands and peat, and, thus,Histosols were not considered. When detailed information on mineral composition(e.g., the dominant presence of 2:1 vs. 1:1 clays) was not explicitly stated in theoriginal studies, the following categorization was used based on the primarymineral composition by soil order31: Oxisols and Ultisols at all depths were LM;and Al ﬁsols, Aridisols, Gelisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, and Vertisolswere HM. Andisols and Entisols were HM in the topsoil (0 –30 cm) and LM in thesubsoil (30 –100 cm). We note that, in future studies, allophanic soils with largeamounts of amorphous minerals (i.e., Andisols) could be treated as a third categorydue to their propensity to form stable Al- and Fe-complexes and accumulateSOC14,32; however, we did not observe a signi ﬁcant difference in their MOC ascompared to HM soils in our synthesis. Furthermore, there are complexities,including the amount and type of metal oxides and hydroxides, that can make thedistinction between low- and high-activity minerals dif ﬁcult in certain soils29,96(and can also complicate the comparison of soil clays and “reference ”or syntheticclays97), the classi ﬁcation of LM and HM soils has been widely used andsupported23,28,29and emerges from our data globally (Fig. 1and SupplementaryFigs. 7 and 8). Indeed, the MOC patterns were consistent within our classi ﬁcationsand, thus, these categories were deemed suf ﬁcient for the scope of this global-scale study.We retained the classi ﬁcation of vegetation type, and all details on managementpractices or lack thereof, reported in the original studies and assigned one of eightland cover types (Fig. 1b–c). Land cover types included boreal forest, temperateforest, tropical forest, grassland, savanna, shrubland, and cropland (SupplementaryFig. 14). To further compare managed and natural lands, we grouped sites intobroad categories of forests, grasslands (including savannas), and croplands. Weobserved stark differences between natural or less-managed ecosystems (namely,forest and grassland) and more intensively managed (crop) ecosystems (Fig. 2). Wecalculated the %C saturation of soils (as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 10) tocompare ecosystems and management practices.Boundary line analyses . To estimate the mineralogical carbon capacity (MOCmax)as a function of soil mineralogy, we conducted a boundary line analysis across thefull range of clay and silt (CS) for each mineral category (LM and HM, see section“Deﬁning and evaluating ecosystem categories ”; Supplementary Fig. 26). Speci ﬁ-cally, we explored the relationship of MOC (y-axis; g C kg−1soil) as a function ofCS (x-axis; %) and ﬁt the 95th quantile for natural ecosystems of each mineral typeto obtain maximum boundary-line slopes for HM and LM (Fig. 1; quantile sen-sitivity analysis in Supplementary Fig. 7). We chose the 95th quantile as a con-servative approximation of this boundary line, given existing experimentaluncertainty of individual observations (i.e., total % recovery of C from size frac-tionations ranged from ~80 to 120% among studies). We used MOC observationsfrom clay and silt (<63 μm) size classes to derive MOCmax(Fig. 1) and note that ourresults were robust to the choice of particle size (e.g., <20 μm or <63 μm; Sup-plementary Fig. 5). The 63 μm silt size threshold chosen is also that used in globaldatasets and mapped products of soil clay and silt4,98. We also note that ourestimates of MOC maxfor HM and LM were robust across topsoils and subsoils.Both topsoils and subsoils approached MOC max(Fig. 2b), and thus, a separateMOC maxfor each depth was not theoretically or empirically warranted. While it ismore dif ﬁcult to reach MOC maxin subsoils due to lower carbon inputs, MOC maxisan intrinsic property of the soil mineralogy and constitutes a theoretical upper limitthat is independent of depth; indeed, this depth-independence is important forcapturing MOC stocks and ages in process-based soil carbon models99,100. Ourestimates of MOC maxfor HM and LM were also robust across vegetation types(Supplementary Fig. 8), which corroborates studies showing that microbial pro-cessing and reactive minerals act as effective ﬁlters that lessen chemical differencesin organic matter inputs59,101. Theory and models further support this ﬁnding andsuggest that, while litter quality may affect the approach of a given soil to itsmineralogical capacity, the value of MOC maxis independent of vegetationtype28,102. Regressions for both mineral types were ﬁt with a forced interceptthrough the origin, since, by de ﬁnition, no clay- and silt-associated organic carbon(i.e., MOC) can exist without clay and silt minerals present. While some sizefractionation studies report MOC in sandy soils with very low amounts of clay andsilt minerals92, further exploration is needed to understand the relative contribu-tion of ﬁne POC and DOC in such soils16.Statistical modeling and predictive relationships . Due to potential nonlinearrelationships between MOC and environmental variables, we used an ensemblemachine learning method —namely, Random Forest (RF) —to identify key pre-dictors and their effects on MOC. This method has been shown to reduce over-ﬁtting to a training dataset compared to other machine learning methods, and doesnot suffer from multi-collinearity (i.e., the linear dependence among predictorvariables), as do multiple regression analyses103. We used the RandomForestpackage in R for RF analyses103,104. We used an ensemble of 300 independentlytrained RF models (using a 75 –25% train-test split; 400 decision trees each) withbootstrapped sampling to robustly assess model performance105—mean absoluteerror (MAE) and mean-squared error (MSE) to quantify the model error and R2toestimate the proportion of variance in MOC explained by the model (Supple-mentary Fig. 11). Our aim was to: (i) elucidate key variables by assessing theirrelative contribution to the MSE of test-set predictions when removed or permuted,(ii) calculate the total variance explained by selected predictors, and (iii) predict theresponse of MOC to a given variable while controlling for all other variables.RF is often used to rank the importance of each variable in a regression throughpermutations of the data103, as implemented herein. After preliminaryinvestigation to select the most important variables, while also consideringvariables that were measured in suf ﬁcient studies to retain the greatest number ofcomplete observations, we identi ﬁed CS, MAT, MAP, and POC as key continuouspredictors and vegetation (land cover) and mineral type as key categoricalpredictors (Supplementary Fig. 11; R2=0.60 ± 0.06). Speci ﬁcally, variables wereranked from most to least important, where the most important variables showedthe highest increase in MSE of test set predictions when permuted in the model.We then investigated the underlying relationship of MOC to key variables(Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. 12). RF allowed us to explore the effect of eachindividual variable on MOC, by integrating the predicted response over thecontribution of all other variables (i.e., partial dependence plot)106. That is, for avariable xsand complement set of all other variables xC, the general model functionisfxs;xC/C0/C1and depends on all input variables. The partial dependence function ofxs, denoted ^fxsxs/C0/C1, then describes the marginal effect of xson the prediction, and isNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3797 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7estimated as:^fxsxs/C0/C1¼1n∑ni¼1fxs;xCðiÞ/C0/C1ð3ÞThis was calculated for each predictor variable over the full range of the otherpredictor variables (Supplementary Fig. 12), and also over relevant subsets of theother predictor variables to explore conditional partial dependencies and visualizetwo-way variable interactions (e.g., Fig. 3). For the case of MAT and POC, weexplored the temperature sensitivity of MOC (i.e., the partial dependencerelationship with MAT) conditional on low (L), medium (M), and high (H) valuesof POC that corresponded to different saturation regimes —unsaturated, medium,and saturated (Fig. 3a). The breakpoints for these three regimes were selected as themedian and third quartile of the POC distribution (namely, 4 and 10 g C kg−1soil,respectively), which also correspond to approximate saturation thresholds in thepartial dependence plot of POC (Fig. 3a).Our approach permits us to disentangle the role of each controlling variable andtwo-way interactions on the response variable of interest (here MOC) and uncoversemergent (linear, monotonic, or nonlinear) relationships, providing unique insightsfor MOC response to future climate and management interventions (e.g.,increasing POC or CS). For comparison, we also repeated the above analysis with ageneralized linear model (GLM) and ﬁnd qualitatively similar, though linearized,trends between MOC and the individual environmental predictors.Global mineral-associated carbon predictions and uncertainty . Following theexploration of underlying climatic and edaphic properties, we trained a RF modelon our observational synthesis to predict MOC globally. Speci ﬁcally, we trained theRF model to predict MOC from MAT, MAP, CS, SOC, vegetation type, andmineral type (Supplementary Fig. 26). We note that a global map of POC valuesdid not exist to be used as an explanatory variable, as was used in the attributionanalyses (Supplementary Fig. 11); rather, global POC values can be derived as aproduct of this study.The Scikit-learn Library in the Python environment was used for globalpredictions and Matplotlib Basemap for global mapping. We again used anensemble of 300 independently trained RF models (using a 75 –25% train-test split;400 decision trees each) with bootstrapped sampling to rigorously assess modelperformance105. For these RF models that included SOC, a comparison ofpredicted and observed MOC on the independent test datasets across the ensembleyielded an R2=0.79 ± 0.05 (mean ± s.d.; Supplementary Fig. 13). We note that,while the predictability of SOC is often lower across large global datasets4,107, thepredictability of MOC is generally high given readily measured SOC, climate, andedaphic variables (e.g., see refs.11,92on a regional scale). Indeed, the R2wasconsistently high across the ensemble cross-validation (Supplementary Fig. 13b).We also performed a spatially buffered leave-one-out cross-validation108to ensurethat spatial auto-correlation did not signi ﬁcantly compromise the RF model.Namely, for each leave-one-out test data point, all data within a given buffer radius(0–150 km) were excluded from the training set; i.e., only data points outside thebuffer zone were used to train each RF model. R2values did not vary with bufferradius (regression slope not statistically different from zero; p=0.81) and were inagreement with the ensemble cross-validation approach (Supplementary Fig. 13c).Furthermore, we also used a hold-out (or block) cross-validation109on the basis ofsoil order to assess extrapolation performance and con ﬁrm the robustness of ourRF estimates across soil types —i.e., all soil pro ﬁles from a given soil order werecompletely withheld from the training dataset and then used to independently testthe resulting RF model. Model performance was consistently high across the out-of-sample test datasets ( R2=0.75 ± 0.11; mean ± s.d. across soil orders); onlyAndisols (which span ~1% of the ice-free land surface) were more dif ﬁcult topredict when completely withheld from the training dataset ( R2=0.40), and weencourage more measurements in these soils (see section “Deﬁning and evaluatingecosystem categories ”). Hold-out cross-validation on the basis of individual studiesalso con ﬁrmed the robustness of our RF estimates to additional data (e.g., ourresults were insensitive to adding the independent LUCAS dataset92;Supplementary Fig. 2). We rigorously demonstrate the RF model performance andprovide uncertainty ranges for the 90% prediction intervals, derived from the 5thand 95th quantiles (Supplementary Fig. 13a).The climatic and edaphic driver variables used for the global predictions wereall re-gridded to 0.5° × 0.5° resolution (Supplementary Fig. 14). Mean annualtemperature (MAT) was estimated from the CRU data set (version 3.10)110, andmean annual precipitation (MAP) from the GPCC dataset111, both as 30-yearannual averages. Clay and silt (CS) content was obtained from the HarmonizedWorld Soil Database (HWSD)98. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was obtained fromboth the HWSD and SoilGrids4,98, and also as the average of the two gridded dataproducts112(Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 2). Land cover(vegetation type) was obtained from the MODIS MCD12C1 product113, and the 16categories were combined into 10 for consistency with those reported in theobservations (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Fig. 14 for details). The primarymineral type was calculated from global estimates of mineral composition31(Supplementary Fig. 14; see section “Estimating the global soil mineralogicalcarbon capacity ”). We focused our analysis on mineral soils, and thus excluded gridcells containing a majority of organic soils (i.e., >50% Histosols and Gelisols)114,115.Tundra and deserts were also excluded, due to data limitations in these regions(Supplementary Figs. 2 and 14). We used two depth intervals for SOC, CS, andprimary mineral type, namely topsoil (0 –30 cm) and subsoil (30 –100 cm).The predictive RF model ( R2=0.79 ± 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 13), trained onthe observational data, was then used to predict MOC globally for each depthinterval to 1 m (Supplementary Fig. 15; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 summarizeresults for all SOC data products). We include MOC uncertainty ranges for the90% prediction intervals (5th and 95th quantiles) globally (Supplementary Fig. 15;Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, we note that the distributions of MOC andSOC (and %C saturation) from our globally distributed observational dataset mostclosely agreed with SOC and predicted MOC (and %C saturation) from theaveraged data product (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19; Supplementary Table 2),whereas the distribution of SOC (and %C saturation) from SoilGrids was higherand HWSD was substantially lower (Supplementary Fig. 19; SupplementaryTable 2). We focus here on reporting results using the averaged SOC data product,as a conservative estimate of MOC stocks given the uncertainty and range betweensoil carbon data products, and note that more accurate estimates and consensus oncurrent soil carbon stocks are critical for improved predictions116.Leveraging our global MOC predictions, we calculated the proportion of SOCthat is mineral-associated globally (Supplementary Fig. 16). Our global estimates ofMOC/SOC ratios agree with those observed in our observational synthesis andconﬁrm the dominant contribution of MOC to soil carbon at the global scale(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 16). Furthermore, our predictions suggest that high-latitudes have a lower fraction of MOC/SOC globally, and thus a higher fraction ofparticulate organic carbon (POC), but data limitations of mineral-associatedcarbon measurements at high-latitudes warrant further exploration of thesepatterns.Estimating the global soil mineralogical carbon capacity . To estimate thespatially explicit mineralogical carbon capacity (MOCmax) globally, we used globaldata products of clay and silt content (CS), soil order and mineral composition, andbulk density (BD), together with our derived relationship for MOC max(Eq. 1;Fig.1). Global maps of % clay, % silt, and BD were obtained from the HWSD98.Amap of soil mineral composition31was used to generate a corresponding map ofprimary mineral type (Supplementary Fig. 14; see section “Deﬁning and evaluatingecosystem categories ”). Our focus here was on mineral soils, and thus, we excludedorganic soils (grid cells with >50% Histosols and Gelisols) from the estimation ofglobal MOC storage potential. Tundra and deserts were also excluded due to datalimitations (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 14). We calculated CS content and appliedour MOCmaxrelationship (Fig. 1; slope ± 90% con ﬁdence intervals) for eachmineral type (HM and LM) globally to obtain MOC max(gC kg−1soil) at 0.5° × 0.5°resolution. For a global total (in Pg C; 1 Pg =1015g), we used BD to calculateMOC maxstocks (in kg C m−2soil) and then summed over all grid cells containingmineral soils (Supplementary Tables 1, 2).The mineralogical capacity MOC max(Supplementary Fig. 17) was thencompared to predicted MOC stocks (Supplementary Fig. 15) to calculate themineralogical C de ﬁcit (by subtracting MOC from MOC max) and %C saturation(by dividing MOC/MOC max) globally (Fig. 4; Supplementary Figs. 18 –20). We notethat this limit is based on mineralogy alone, and many lands may be further limitedby climate. Thus, in addition to the C de ﬁcit relative to the mineralogical capacity(MOC max), we also estimated the C de ﬁcit relative to an environmental limitcalculated using the natural land average %C saturation (i.e., average MOC/MOC max) observed in our MOC synthesis at each depth (Fig. 2; i.e., 51 and 19% fortopsoil and subsoil, respectively). These results are summarized in SupplementaryTable 1. We note that our estimates of C de ﬁcit and %C saturation using SoilGridsare the most conservative for potential accrual, given their higher current SOC (andconsequently MOC) stocks (Supplementary Table 2). However, our estimates usingthe averaged soil carbon data product agree with the distributions of MOC stocksand %C saturation in our observational synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 19;Supplementary Table 2), and provide a robust estimate that incorporates the rangeof current soil carbon stocks.Our spatially explicit, depth-resolved global estimates highlight regions wherelarger C de ﬁcits (lower %C saturation) can be targeted for soil restoration and Csequestration efforts, especially on managed lands (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Figs. 21and 22). While environmental conditions may make carbon accumulation moredifﬁcult in some regions than in others (Supplementary Fig. 12), this estimateconstrains MOCmaxfor a given soil mineralogy and provides a starting point forareas to focus on management (Supplementary Discussion). Furthermore, whiledeep soils have the largest C de ﬁcit, surface soils in lands already dominated bymanagement may be the most cost-effective areas on which to focus.Observational synthesis and analysis of carbon accrual . Here we aimed toquantify the ability of topsoils ranging in mineralogical carbon saturation to furtheraccrue carbon. We hypothesized that soils further from their mineralogical capacity(i.e., lower MOC saturation) would accrue carbon faster than soils closer to theircapacity. To this end, we performed an observational synthesis from manipulationand chronosequence studies that included initial and ﬁnal carbon stocks or con-centrations to calculate these stocks, bulk density, experimental duration, andedaphic properties; namely, clay and silt content, texture class or soil series toestimate these contents and soil classi ﬁcation or other information that wouldallow us to assign the soil to a high- or low-activity mineral type.ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-98 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3797 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31540-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsFor each entry (a pair of initial and ﬁnal carbon stocks), we calculated themaximum mineralogical capacity (MOC max) using the data-derived relationships(Fig. 1) with an amount (% clay +silt; CS) and type (high- or low-activity; HM orLM, respectively) of mineral in each soil layer and used respective bulk densities tocalculate the layer MOC maxstocks (t C ha−1) which were then summed across theconsidered depth to obtain the pro ﬁle MOC maxstock (t C ha−1). In cases whereinitial and ﬁnal soil pro ﬁles differed in clay and silt content, their average was used.However, if the difference resulted in these soil pro ﬁles falling into different textureclasses, they were excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, to calculate initialandﬁnal stocks, we considered initial and ﬁnal pro ﬁles that were taken at equaldepths, which ranged between 10 and 40 cm across studies. Where necessary, initialandﬁnal SOC stocks were standardized to equal depths using the maximum depthof the shallower pro ﬁle as a cutoff ranging between 30 and 39 cm ( n=5 pro ﬁles).We calculated the mineralogical %C saturation as the initial MOC stock dividedby the initial MOC maxstock. Because MOC was not measured in all accrual studies,we used the measured SOC and CS values to calculate the corresponding MOCusing our random forest model trained on the MOC synthesis data with analogousSOC and CS predictors ( R2=0.70 ± 0.06; using Scikit-Learn in Python, see section“Global mineral-associated carbon predictions and uncertainty ”).Carbon accrual (t C ha−1y−1) was calculated as the difference between ﬁnal andinitial C stock divided by the time period between the repeated samplings ( n=32),the duration of the experiment in the case of a paired plot experimental design(n=30), the age difference between two sites of a chronosequence ( n=24), thetime span at which a regression across multiple samplings was used to obtain anaverage rate for a chronosequence ( n=10), or the time of soil formation afteremergence of a SOC-free parent material ( n=7).Accrual studies spanned crop, pasture, grassland, and forest ecosystems acrossdifferent climates and soil types (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 23).We focused on studies in which carbon inputs were manipulated or land-use wasaltered in a way that carbon accrual could be expected. These included improvedagriculture (cover cropping, no till, crop-livestock rotation, deep ploughing, grazingreduction), land use change (conversion of cropland to grassland or forest),doubled litter or wood input from the DIRT (Detrital Input and RemovalExperiment) network, and natural revegetation and mine reclamation (formerlydegraded lands or newly exposed land surfaces as a result of mining, landsliding,alluviation, or marine terrace uplift, where soil C accrual can be expected as aconsequence of natural or human-accelerated revegetation and soil formation). Wenote that most studies did not explicitly quantify C inputs over time, especiallythose where changes in C inputs stemmed from downstream impacts onvegetation, and we strongly urge the reporting of C input estimates in futurestudies. After the initial compilation, pro ﬁles were excluded in which the studiedsoil depth was lower than 15 cm ( n=2) and in which organic amendments wereapplied annually, in an initial one-time application higher than 20 t ha−1without acontrol plot or at unknown intensity ( n=11).Our accrual synthesis included 103 observations from 34 studies, with depthsranging between 15 and 40 cm (mean =29 cm). The synthesis included soils withboth high-activity minerals ( n=84), especially Entisols ( n=41) and Al ﬁsols(n=20), and low-activity minerals ( n=19), belonging to Oxisols ( n=10) andUltisols ( n=9). There was a greater representation of temperate climates,highlighting the need for additional studies in poorly represented regions includingtropical and boreal climates in future work. However, globally, our study suggeststhat the greatest potential for accrual (i.e., lowest %C saturation) often occurs inthese temperate regions (Fig. 4b) and was thus a focus of our work.While most soils in the C accrual synthesis fell below 100% C saturation, wenote that MOCmaxwas derived as a conservative estimate from the 95th quantile ofour MOC synthesis (Fig. 1; see section “Boundary line analyses ”) and therefore, bydeﬁnition, soils can fall near or above this maximum. Indeed, in our MOCsynthesis, ~200% C saturation values were observed for soils with low values ofMOC and MOC max. Of the 103 accrual measurements, one sandy soil (i.e., lowMOC and MOC max) displayed seemingly high %C saturation, yet still withinexpected ranges (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, this soil was categorized as an Andisol,which could be treated as a third category in future studies (see section “Deﬁningand evaluating ecosystem categories ”), due to its propensity to form stable Al- andFe-complexes and accumulate carbon14. Nevertheless, removing this individualmeasurement, or even all Andisols ( n=6) in the C accrual synthesis, did notchange the ﬁtted model.Furthermore, we note that the reclaimed mine soils in our dataset constitutedtwo major categories of abandonment and regeneration —those with and withouttopsoil application (Supplementary Fig. 23b). Mine reclamation that employs theapplication of topsoil (usually a 30 cm layer, originally excavated before mining andstored in stockpiles; n=31) is, in terms of management procedures, comparable tothe conversion of cropland (disturbed by tillage and/or erosion) to grassland orforest. Reclamation can involve some mechanical preparation of soil, application offertilizer or other organic amendments, and planting vegetation. This reappliedtopsoil is sampled as a baseline and subsequent sampling in the following years isused to monitor C accrual. In reclamation without topsoil application ( n=13),vegetation either spontaneously establishes itself or is planted directly into theparent material. Such conditions represent early stages of soil formation and areparallel to the restoration of soils heavily impacted by erosion that has led to thecomplete loss of topsoil with only the infertile parent material left behind. Whilemine soils are well-described systems suitable for the study of soil management,included in previous syntheses of soil carbon dynamics after land-usechange117,118, the ﬁtted model and observed negative trend in C accrual with %Csaturation were robust to their exclusion (Supplementary Fig. 23c).Statistical analyses were conducted using the ‘nls’package in R to ﬁt a nonlinearasymptotic relationship between carbon accrual rates and the mineralogical percentsaturation of the respective soil pro ﬁles. Speci ﬁcally, we used a three-parameterself-starting asymptotic regression model (SSAsymp) on the 103 ratemeasurements ( R2=0.18; Fig. 4d). The same approach was also used to ﬁt the10th and 90th quantiles (Fig. 4d). There was substantial variability in observedaccrual rates for a given %C saturation, due to differences in climate and land useacross sites (Supplementary Fig. 23). However, most of this variability appeared insoils furthest from C saturation, where environmental and management factorsalso play a role in observed accrual rates. In soils closest to saturation, thisvariability was far lower as carbon accrual rates tended towards zero, illustratingthe importance of the mineralogical limit. Our focus here was on constraining anaverage empirical rate of carbon accrual as a function of %C saturation andinvestigating whether soils furthest from C saturation achieve higher carbonaccrual rates. We also note that the variability in C accrual rates was betterexplained by %C saturation ( R2=0.18) than by initial SOC ( R2=0.04-0.10;Supplementary Fig. 24), further demonstrating the relevance of themineralogical limit.We used the nonlinear asymptotic regression to provide a spatially explicitglobal estimate of potential C accrual rates in topsoils dominated by management(Supplementary Fig. 22). While such accrual rates would be dif ﬁcult to achieveeverywhere, our spatially explicit estimates of potential C accrual rates highlightpriority regions for future soil restoration and C sequestration initiatives andprovide an independent estimate of global soil C sequestration potential.Data availabilityThe globally gridded maps of mineral-associated carbon and mineralogical carboncapacity derived in this study are freely available and archived at Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6539765 ).
