of BCMA2 (Fig. 4) and visualized the locationsof variations in the BCMA1 and BCMA3 proteinsthat might explain their altered catalytic func-tions. G134L, one of the two residues showingevidence for accelerated molecular evolution,occurs in substrate recognition site SRS1 near theheme (Fig. 4) and is predicted to alter the catalyticsite space in the region closest to the heme. Theother, P536K, occurs five amino acids upstreamfrom their C termini and is predicted to alterelectrostatic interactions of this flexible tail re-gion. Mapping of the two positions varying be-tween the BCMA3-MT and BCMA3-CO allelesindicates that Val148→Leu occurs in a regionpotentially affecting interactions with electrontransfer partners, and that Met268→Val occursin a SRS3 region predicted to affect the volumeof the upper catalytic site and/or substrate access(fig. S6). However, determining the biochemicaleffects of these changes is beyond the scope ofthis study.We have shown how the BCMA QTL affectsplant chemistry and insect resistance, and thusfitness, in a quantitative manner. In Boechera ,t h eBCMA2 locus retains ancestral activity and synteny,whereas BCMA1 andBCMA3 have evolved novelcatalytic activity. The resulting polymorphicMet-GS and BC-GS show heterogeneous effectson host plant resistance against diverse enemiesacross a range of environments. In the Montanapopulation, homozygotes at BCMA produceBC-GS and show greater resistance to damageby a diverse community of herbivores (tables S4and S6). Further evidence that these compoundshave environment-dependent consequences comesfrom transgenic Arabidopsis , where BC-GS causeincreased resistance to the pathogen Erwiniacarotovora (6), and from other herbivores, whereBC-GS cause increased susceptibility to Trichoplusiani(10). However, BCMA has no effect on insectdamage in Colorado (tables S4 and S6), whereother loci control resistance (table S6). On thebasis of this study, we conclude that heteroge-neous responses to diverse biotic interactionsin the context of selection by herbivores likelycontribute to the genetic diversity of BCMA .References and Notes1.

Booker,2,3Cong Tu,1Kent O. Burkey,2,3Lishi Zhou,1,4H. David Shew,1Thomas W. Rufty,3Shuijin Hu1†The extent to which terrestrial ecosystems can sequester carbon to mitigate climate changeis a matter of debate. The stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) by elevatedatmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) has been assumed to be a major mechanism facilitating soilcarbon sequestration by increasing carbon inputs to soil and by protecting organic carbon fromdecomposition via aggregation. We present evidence from four independent microcosm andfield experiments demonstrating that CO 2enhancement of AMF results in considerable soil carbonlosses. Our findings challenge the assumption that AMF protect against degradation of organiccarbon in soil and raise questions about the current prediction of terrestrial ecosystem carbonbalance under future climate-change scenarios.Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF),which form associations with roots of~80% of land plant species, obtain car-bon (C) from their host plants in return for mineralnutrients ( 1,2). AMF utilize a large proportion(up to 20%) of net plant photosynthates underambient atmospheric CO 2(aCO 2)(3,4), depositslow cycling organic compounds such as chitinand glomalin ( 1,5), and protect organic matterfrom microbial attack by promoting soil aggre-gation ( 6). AMF thus play a critical role in theglobal C cycle. Atmospheric CO 2enrichment of-ten increases plant photosynthate allocation toAMF and stimulates the growth of AMF ( 3,7–9),leading to a proposition that global soils maysequester more C through mycorrhizal symbiosesunder future scenarios of elevated CO 2(eCO 2)(3,5,7–12). This hypothesis, however, does notconsider the effect of AMF on decompositionunder eCO 2. Indeed, AMF growth can result inenhanced decomposition of complex organic ma-terial and alter plant N uptake ( 13–15).We conducted four independent but comple-mentary experiments to investigate how CO 2stim-ulation of AMF affects organic C decompositionin soil and the subsequent N dynamics in the plant-soil system by combining dual13C/15N labelingand hyphae-ingrowth techniques ( 16). We firstascertained the effect of eCO 2[main plot, n=4 ;ambient at 380 versus elevated at 580 parts permillion by volume (ppmv)] and N addition (sub-plot; control at 0 versus added at 5 g N m−2)o n1Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State Uni-versity, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.2United States Department ofAgriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Re-search Unit, Raleigh, NC 27607, USA.3Department of CropScience, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695,USA.4State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and EnvironmentalChange, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences,Xiangshan, Beijing 100093, China.*Present address: Department of Ecosystem Science and Man-agement, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park,PA 16802, USA.†To whom correspondence should be addressed.

S1). Thehigh levels of CO 2and N used in our experimentcorrespond to projected atmospheric CO 2concen-trations and N deposition rates in North Americaduring the 21st century ( 17). We chose A. fatua ,an annual C 3grass native to Eurasia, because it hasinvaded many temperate grasslands and is con-sidered one of the worst weeds in agriculturalfields in North America.After incubation for 10 weeks, AMF en-hanced decomposition within hyphae-ingrowthbags ( P< 0.001, Fig. 1A; also see13Ci nf i g .S2A). eCO 2had no impact on total soil C in theabsence of AMF (NAMF) ( P>0 . 1 ,F i g .1 A ) ,b u tsignificantly reduced it by 9% in the presence ofAMF ( P< 0.01, Fig. 1A; see13Ci nf i g .S 2 A ) ,consistent with the CO 2stimulation of AMFinfection of plant roots ( P< 0.05, fig. S3A). No-tably, the CO 2effect on AMF-mediated decom-position mainly occurred under the N amendment,with a reduction in total C in hyphae-ingrowthbags of 19% in soil (AMF+S) and 10% in quartzsand (AMF+Q) (Fig. 1A; see13Ci nf i g .S 2 A ) .Emerging evidence shows that AMF speciesmay differ in their capabilities in acquiring Nfrom decomposing residues ( 13). However, it isunknown whether the nature of AMF species orcommunities influences the CO 2effect on residuedecomposition. We investigated the effect of threeindividual AMF species and two AMF assem-blages (subplot) on residue decomposition withtheir host plant A. fatua exposed to two atmo-spheric CO 2levels (main plot, n= 4; 380 versus580 ppmv) ( 16). One AMF assemblage consistedof three species and the other a total of eightspecies (table S1).AMF enhanced decomposition in hyphae-ingrowth cores in comparison with the NAMF(P< 0.001, Fig. 1B; see13C in fig. S2B), partic-ularly under eCO 2. Across five AMF treatments,eCO 2on average increased AMF infection ofplant roots by 28% ( P< 0.05, fig. S3B) andreduced total C by 15% within hyphae-ingrowthcores ( P< 0.05, Fig. 1B; see13Ci nf i g .S 2 B ) .T h emagnitude of the CO 2effect on decompositiondiffered among the three individual AMF species(P< 0.05), with the high effect found for bothGigaspora margarita andGlomus clarum andthe low for Acaulospora morrowiae , but wascomparable between the two AMF assemblages(P> 0.1). Taken together, these microcosm ex-periments indicate that CO 2stimulation of AMFin general enhances organic C decomposition insoils with low N availability.We also conducted a field study to examinethe AMF effect on decomposition in a long-termCO2(380 versus 560 ppmv) and O 3[20 versus60 parts per billion by volume (ppbv)] experiment(2 × 2 factorial, n= 4) in a no-till wheat-soybeansystem ( 16,18).

How-ever, eCO 2significantly increased both AMFcolonization of fine roots collected from root-ingrowth bags ( P< 0.001, fig. S3C) and the ex-ternal AMF biomass as indexed by the biomarkerfatty acid 16:1 w5c in the bulk soil ( P< 0.05, fig.S3D). Concurrently, eCO 2significantly increasedtotal C losses within hyphae-ingrowth bags acrossthe three sampling points ( P< 0.01, Fig. 1C; see13C in fig. S2C). The instantaneous fractionalloss rates for C ( k=1 –Xt/X0,w h e r e XtandX0are the organic C content at time tand time 0,respectively) induced by the hyphae-ingrowtheffect under eCO 2were 29, 41, and 80% higherthan those under aCO 2, respectively, at weeks 5,1 0 ,a n d1 5( F i g .1 C ) ,i n d i c a t i n gt h a tt h eC O 2ef-fect on AMF-mediated decomposition did not di-minish over time.To examine whether CO 2enhancement ofAMF-mediated decomposition was accompaniedwith increased plant uptake of N released fromdecomposing residues, we determined15Nb o t hin plants and hyphae-ingrowth bags and cores.eCO 2substantially reduced the total15Nw i t h i nhyphae-ingrowth bags and cores in the presenceof AMF in all three experiments (fig. S4) andincreased AMF-mediated plant15N uptake in themicrocosms (fig. S5). These results provide directevidence of CO 2enhancement of mycorrhizal Ntransfer from decomposing organic material tohost plants.We also examined the effect of eCO 2on soilavailable N pools [ammonium (NH 4+) and nitrate(NO 3–)]. In microcosms where N was limitingand AMF were present, eCO 2reduced soil NH 4+in both experiments ( P< 0.01, Fig. 2A; P< 0.05,Fig. 2B), but did not affect levels of soil NO 3–(P>0 . 1 ,f i g .S 6 D ; P> 0.1, fig. S6E). In the fieldwhere soil N was ample (mainly NO 3–,f i g .S 6 F ) ,eCO 2did not affect soil NH 4+(P> 0.1 for each ofthree soil layers, fig. S6C) but significantly in-creased both potential N mineralization ( 18)a n dsoil NO 3–(P< 0.05 for each of three soil layers,Fig. 2C). These results suggest that eCO 2maydifferentially affect plant acquisition of soil NH 4+and NO 3–.We subsequently conducted a meta-analysis(16) of 38 studies that quantified the concentra-tions of soil NH 4+and NO 3–and/or the capacityof plant use of NH 4+and NO 3–under eCO 2(tableS2). These studies encompassed more than 58species of crop, grass, and tree species ( 16). eCO 2reduced the capacity of plant NO 3–use by 16.2%and increased soil NO 3–by 26.7% (Fig. 2D). Bycontrast, it had no impact on the capacity ofplants to use NH 4+but decreased soil NH 4+by7.9% (Fig. 2D). These differential CO 2effects onsoil NH 4+and NO 3–agreed with our results andwere consistent qualitatively with recent discov-eries of eCO 2effects on plant N utilization ( 19,20).Together, these results suggest that plants undereCO 2m a yh a v et or e l ym o r eo ns o i lN H 4+for Nnutrition, and a high demand for NH 4+may playa major role in mediating the AMF effect on or-ganic C decomposition.If CO 2-induced high-plant demand for NH 4+is a primary driver in mycorrhizally mediateddecomposition, high soil NH 4+may partiallyoffset this effect. To test this possibility, weassessed the effect of AMF on decomposition bymanipulating soil N transformations with a nitri-fication inhibitor (dicyandiamide) ( 21) in ourlong-term field CO 2and O 3study in the wheatseason of 2011 ( 16). Dicyandiamide had no ef-fect on plant growth and AMF infection of roots(P> 0.1). In the no-dicyandiamide control, eCO 2significantly increased AMF-mediated decompo-sition ( P< 0.05, Fig. 3), consistent with theprevious field experiment (Fig. 1C). In the dicyan-diamide treatment, however, eCO 2did not affectorganic C decomposition in the hyphae-ingrowthbag ( P> 0.1, Fig. 3), indicating that the nitri-fication inhibitor largely offset the impact ofeCO 2on AMF-mediated organic C decompo-sition. These results provide supporting evidencethat enhanced plant demand for soil NH 4+maybe the primary driver for CO 2enhancement ofAMF-mediated decomposition.Based on this set of investigations, we there-fore propose that eCO 2enhancement of plant Ndemand prompts plants to invest more C andenergy to structures (mainly roots and their as-sociated mycorrhizae) that best garner NH 4+from soil ( 22), while stimulating NH 4+releasefrom organic materials and reducing NH 4+sub-strate for nitrification (Fig. 4). Two unique AMFproperties enable host plants to compete betteragainst nitrifying microbes for NH 4+in the fine,discrete decomposing hotspots: (i) external AMFhyphae are at least two orders of magnitudelonger and three orders of magnitude thinner thanroots ( 1,15) and can exploit a much larger soilvolume and finer soil microsites; and (ii) AMFpossess a special N transfer pathway ( 22,23)t h a tcan transport soil N from external to internalhyphae and to their hosts preferentially as NH 4+with minimal C loss ( 23). Because AMF generallyFig. 3. A nitrification inhibi tor (dicyandiamide)offset the CO 2effect on organic C decompositionwithin hyphae-ingrowth bags after 10 weeks ofincubation in the field.

Theletters a and b represent a significant differencebetween two CO2levels under the no dicyandi-amide treatment.

First,AMF likely grow preferentially toward ( 15), andthus facilitate saprotrophs ’access to, new organicpatches ( 24). Second, AMF slowly release labileC for saprotrophs at relatively low concentrations(3), likely engendering a larger priming effect ondecomposition than roots (fig. S7) ( 25–27). Andthird, rapid removal of newly released NH 4+byAMF likely releases saprotrophs from metabolicrepression ( 28).Our findings indicate that CO 2enhancementof AMF may alter terrestrial ecosystem C dy-namics by stimulating decomposition of soilorganic C in AMF-active zones. This effect willlikely occur in its interplay with other controllingfactors such as temperature and plant speciescomposition ( 29). In many agro- or grasslandecosystems where AMF dominate ( 1), but noaboveground C pool with an annual incrementalincrease exists, CO2stimulation of AMF and or-ganic C decomposition will mainly facilitate Cturnover belowground, rather than ecosystem Csequestration ( 30). Even in forests with abundantAMF (e.g., tropical forests) ( 1), eCO 2stimulationof AMF, although creating a transient C sink inplant biomass by facilitating N transfer from soilto plants and partially alleviating N limitation onplants ( 31), is likely to reduce the largest carbonstocks (soil C) in the system. Also, our resultssuggest that the form, rather than just the totalamount, of soil N might play a major role inmediating belowground C turnover and plant Nacquisition under eCO 2, thus offering a theoret-ical foundation for management of microbial Ntransformations in soil and plant N utilization tofacilitate ecosystem C sequestration under futureCO2scenarios.References and Notes1.

McCormick,5L. Mahadevan1,2,4,5†The helical coiling of plant tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries, yet the underlyingmechanism remains elusive. Moreover, despite Darwin ’s widely accepted interpretation of coiledtendrils as soft springs, their mechanical behavior remains unknown. Our experiments on cucumbertendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction of an internal fiberribbon of specialized cells. Under tension, both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibittwistless overwinding rather than unwinding, with an initially soft response followed by strongstrain-stiffening at large extensions. We explain this behavior using physical models ofprestrained rubber strips, geometric arguments, and mathematical models of elastic filaments.Collectively, our study illuminates the origin of tendril coiling, quantifies Darwin ’s originalproposal, and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanicalresponses.The transformation of a straight plant tendrilinto a helically coiled shape has inspirednumerous studies since the 1800s ( 1–8),both from mechanistic and functional perspec-tives. Tendrils serve climbing plants by providinga parasitic alternative to building independentlystable structural supports, allowing the plant towend its way to sunlight and numerous eco-logical niches ( 9). During climbing, an initiallystraight tendril first finds and attaches to a support(fig. S1 and movie S1). Once tethered, the tendrilcoils by forming two oppositely handed helicesconnected by a “perversion ”( F i g .1 ,Aa n dB ) ,which was recognized by Darwin as a topologicalnecessity given the clamped boundary conditionsat each end of the tendril ( 3). This helical coilingaxially shortens the tendril, hoisting the plant to-ward the attachment point (fig. S1 and movie S1).Despite the long history of studying tendrils,the basic mechanism of tendril coiling has re-mained elusive. Historically, experimental studiesof diverse tissues [reaction wood ( 10), hypocotyls(11), twining stems ( 12,13), and leaves ( 14)] haveaddressed aspects of curvature generation, whereas1S c h o o lo fE n g i n e e r i n ga n dA p p l i e dS c i e n c e s ,H a r v a r dU n i v e r -sity, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.2Wyss Institute for Biolog-ically Inspired Engineering, Ha rvard University, Cambridge, MA02138, USA.3Department of Physics, Harvey Mudd College,Claremont, CA 91711, USA.4Department of Organismic andEvolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138,USA.5Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge,MA 02138, USA.*These authors contributed equally to this work.†To whom correspondence should be addressed.

DOI: 10.1126/science.1224304A Fungal Culprit to Carbon LossIn some ecosystems, such as in the layer of soil containing plant roots, fungi, and bacteria, increased levels of CO 2should stimulate more efficient aboveground photosynthesis, which in turn should promote increased sequestrationof organic carbon in soil through the protective action of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, in a series of fieldand microcosm experiments performed under elevated levels of CO 2 thought to be consistent with future emissionsscenarios, Cheng et al. (p. 1084; see the Perspective by Kowalchuk ) observed that these fungi actually promotedegradation of soil organic carbon, releasing more CO 2 in the process.View the article onlinehttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1224304Permissionshttps://www.science.org/help/reprints-and-permissionsDownloaded from https://www.science.org at National Cheng Kung University on April 16, 2023
