To investigate whetherglobal warming has affected the r ecent evolution of inequality, wecombine counterfactual historical tem perature trajectories from a suiteof global climate models with exten sively replicated empirical evi-dence of the relationship between historical temperature fluctuationsand economic growth. Together, these allow us to generate proba-bilistic country-level estimates of the influence of anthropogenicclimate forcing on historical economic output. We find very highlikelihood that anthropogenic clim ate forcing has increased economicinequality between countries. For ex ample, per capita gross domesticproduct (GDP) has been reduced 17 –31% at the poorest four deciles ofthe population-weighted country-level per capita GDP distribution,yielding a ratio between the top a nd bottom deciles that is 25% largerthan in a world without global warming. As a result, althoughbetween-country inequality has decreased over the past half century,there is ∼90% likelihood that global warming has slowed that de-crease. The primary driver is the parabolic relationship between tem-perature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth incool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries. Althoughthere is uncertainty in whether historical warming has benefited sometemperate, rich countries, for most poor countries there is >90% likeli-hood that per capita GDP is lower today than if global warming hadnot occurred. Thus, our results show that, in addition to not sharingequally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countrieshave been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthycountries ’energy consumption.economic inequality |global warming |climate change attribution |CMIP5Detection of impacts caused by historical global warming hasincreased substantially in the past decade, including docu-mented impacts on agriculture, human health, and ecosystems (1).Quantifying these historical impacts is critical for understandingthe costs and benefits of global warming, and for designing andevaluating climate mitigation and adaptation measures (1).The impact of historical warming on economic inequality is ofparticular concern (2). There is growing evidence that poorercountries or individuals are more negatively affected by a changingclimate, either because they lack the resources for climate protection(3) or because they tend to reside in warmer regions where additionalwarming would be detrimental to both productivity and health (4 –6).Furthermore, given that wealthy c ountries have been responsible forthe vast majority of historical greenhouse gas emissions, any clearevidence of inequality in the impac ts of the associated climate changeraises critical questions o f international justice.More broadly, measuring and understanding the past andpresent evolution of global economic inequality is an area ofactive research and policy interest, with ongoing disagreementabout the nature and causes of observed inequality trends (7 –10). Quantifying any climatic influence on these trends thus hasimplications beyond climate risk management.Recent research has identified pathways by which changes inclimate can affect the fundamental building blocks of economicproduction (11, 12). Empirical work has included sector-specificanalyses of agriculture, labor productivity, and human health (12),as well as analyses of aggregate indicators such as gross domesticproduct (GDP) (4, 13). A key insight is the nonlinear response ofmany outcomes to temperature change, with the coolest regionsoften benefitting in warm years, and warmer regions beingharmed. As a result, empirical evidence combined with projectionsof future climate change suggests that, although some wealthycountries in cooler regions could benefit from additional warming,most poor countries are likely to suffer (4, 14).Efforts to apply empirical approaches to explicitly quantify thespatial pattern of aggregate impacts have primarily focused onfuture climate change (4 –6, 14), with quantification of historicalimpacts being limited to specific economic sectors and outcomes(e.g., ref. 1), or to global GDP (12). Likewise, although a number ofresearchers have noted that the most robust regional warming hasgenerally occurred in lower-latit ude regions that are currently rel-atively poor (e.g., refs. 15 –19), these analyses have not attempted toquantify the distributional impacts of historical temperature change.Here, we build on past work linking economic growth andfluctuations in temperature (4, 14) to quantify the impact ofhistorical anthropogenic climate forcing on the global distribu-tion of country-level per capita GDP ( Materials and Methods andFig. 1). We use the Historical and Natural climate model simu-lations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP5) (20) to quantify the temperature trajectory of differentcountries in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. We then com-bine these counterfactual country-level temperature trajectoriesSignificanceWe find that global warming has very likely exacerbated globaleconomic inequality, including ∼25% increase in population-weighted between-country inequality over the past half cen-tury. This increase results from the impact of warming onannual economic growth, which over the course of decadeshas accumulated robust and substantial declines in economicoutput in hotter, poorer countries —and increases in manycooler, wealthier countries —relative to a world without an-thropogenic warming. Thus, the global warming caused byfossil fuel use has likely exacerbated the economic inequalityassociated with historical disparities in energy consumption.Our results suggest that low-carbon energy sources have thepotential to provide a substantial secondary developmentbenefit, in addition to the primary benefits of increasedenergy access.Author contributions: N.S.D. and M.B. designed research, performed research, contrib-uted new reagents/analytic tools, analyzed data, and wrote the paper.The authors declare no conflict of interest.This article is a PNAS Direct Submission.

Finally, we use those counter-factual country-level economic trajectories to calculate the impact ofhistorical anthropogenic forcing on population-weighted country-level economic inequality, accoun ting for both uncertainty in therelationship between temperatu re and economic growth and uncer-tainty in the climate respon se to historical forcing.ResultsThe estimated parabolic relationship between temperature andeconomic growth means that long-term warming will generallyincrease growth in cool countries and decrease growth in warmcountries (Fig. 1). For example, for cooler countries such asNorway, warming moves the country-mean temperature closer tothe empirical optimum (Fig. 1 B), resulting in cumulative economicbenefits (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, for warm countries such as India,warming moves the country-mean temperature further from theoptimum (Fig. 1 B), resulting in cumulative losses (Fig. 1 D).As a result, anthropogenic climate forcing has decreased eco-nomic growth of countries in the low latitudes and increased eco-nomic growth of countries in the high latitudes (Fig. 2). The medianlosses exceed 25% for the 1961 –2010 period (relative to a worldwithout anthropogenic forcing) over large swaths of the tropics andsubtropics (Fig. 2 A), where most countries exhibit very high likeli-hood of negative impacts (Fig. 2 CandD), including >99% likeli-hood ( SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 1 ). The median gains can be at least aslarge in the high latitudes, where many countries exhibit >90%likelihood of positive impacts. Many countries in the middle lati-tudes exhibit median impacts smaller than ±10%, along with greateruncertainty in the sign of the response (particularly in the northernhemisphere). Thus, the global-scale pattern is of cool countriesbenefitting and warm countries suff ering, with temperate countriesexhibiting the greatest uncertainty.Although this global pattern could be expected from the con-cave structure of the empirical temperature –growth relationship(Fig. 1 B), such an outcome is not determined for historical climateforcing, because internal climate variability creates uncertainty inthe sign and magnitude of regional temperature change (e.g., refs.21 and 22). However, because the mean temperature response ispositive across all land areas (Fig. 1 A), and because the differencesin temperature change between countries (Fig. 1 A) are smallcompared with the range of country-mean temperatures (Fig. 1 B),the median economic response is that countries that are currentlywarmer than the median optimum have experienced losses, whilecountries that are currently colder than the median optimum haveexperienced benefits (Fig. 3 A).Consistent with the strong spatial correlation between tempera-ture and GDP (23), we find a positive relationship between currentGDP and impact from historical warming, with lower per capitaGDP generally associated with more negative impacts (Fig. 3 B).Furthermore, at a given level of wealth, warmer countries havetended to experience more negative impacts, while cooler countrieshave tended to experience less negative —or in some cases morepositive —impacts. Because the majority of the world ’sw a r m e s tcountries are poor (Fig. 3 AandB), the majority of large negativeimpacts have been concentrated in poor countries (Fig. 3 AandB). Likewise, because the majority of the world ’s richest countriesare temperate or cool, the median likelihood is that the majorityof rich countries have benefited.Consistent with the strong relationship between wealth, energyconsumption, and CO 2emissions (24 –26), we also find a positiverelationship between per capita cumulative emissions and impactfrom historical global warming (Fig. 3 CandSI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ).For example, over the 1961 –2010 period, all 18 of the countrieswhose historical cumulative emissions are less than 10 ton CO 2percapita have suffered negative economic impacts, with a medianimpact of −27% (relative to a world without anthropogenic forcing)(Fig. 3 C). Likewise, of the 36 countries whose historical emissionsare between 10 and 100 ton CO 2per capita, 34 (94%) have sufferednegative economic impacts, with a median impact of −24%. Incontrast, of the 19 countries who se historical emissions exceed 300ton CO 2per capita, 14 (74%) have benefited from global warming,with a median benefit across those 14 countries of +13%.The net effect of these economic impacts is that country-levelinequality has very likely increased as a result of global warming(Fig. 4). For example, the ratio between the top and bottompopulation-weighted deciles [a common measure of economicinequality (9)] has become 25% larger (5th to 95th range of −6%to+114%) during the 1961 –2010 period compared with a worldchange in temperature fromanthropogenic forcing˚C0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6−0.15−0.10−0.050.00mean temperature (°C)change in ln[GDP per capita (USD)]Observed temperatureNatural temperatureNORDEUCHNAUSMEXBRAUSASDNIND01 0 2 0 3 0AB1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010Norway (NOR)1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 20100+101960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010India (IND)1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 20100+10growth rate (%)% change inGDP per capita 0CDGCM range of cumulative impactGCM medianGCM range of cumulative impactGCM medianGCM range of impacton growth rateactual growth rateGCM range of impacton growth rateactual growth rateQuantifying the country-level economic impact of historical global warming+1000+100Fig. 1.

Likewise, the ratio between the top and bottompopulation-weighted quintiles [another common measure (9)] hasbecome 45% larger (5th to 95th range of +10% to +99%), with∼99% likelihood that the ratio has increased. As a result, althoughoverall between-country inequality has decreased substantially overt h ep a s th a l fc e n t u r y( F i g .4 A,r e f s .9a n d1 0 ) ,i ti s “very likely ”(27)that global warming has slowed that decrease (Fig. 4 AandC).The increase in inequality between countries has resultedprimarily from warming-induced penalties in poor countries,along with warming-induced benefits in some rich countries(Figs. 2 A,3B, and 4 B). We find that the poorest half of thepopulation-weighted country-level economic distribution hasbecome relatively more poor over the 1961 –2010 period, in-cluding a median impact of −17% at the poorest decile, and−30% to −31% at the next three poorest deciles (Fig. 4 B). Incontrast, the top half of the population-weighted country-leveleconomic distribution has likely suffered much less —and has amuch higher likelihood of having benefited —than the bottomhalf of the distribution (Fig. 4 B).DiscussionAlthough some canonical uncertainti es in quantifying future economicimpacts are largely removed when focusing on the historical period —such as future discounting uncerta inty (e.g., refs. 14, 28, and 29) andthe limits of accounting for future changes that fall well outside ofhistorical experience (14) —other uncertainties must be considered.For example, uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the tem-perature optimum creates uncertainty in the sign of the historicalclimate impact in some countries (Fig. 2 Cand SI Appendix ,Table S1 ). However, the sign of the impact on inequality is ro-bust (Fig. 4 C), primarily because the mean temperature of somany poor countries lies in the extreme warm tail of uncertaintyin the optimum (Fig. 3 Aand B). For these countries, it is “verylikely ”(27) that historical warming has reduced economic growthand lowered per capita GDP (Fig. 2 CandSI Appendix ,T a b l eS 1 ).As a result, although uncertainty in the magnitude of the response ofregional temperature to historica l forcing creates uncertainty in them a g n i t u d eo fi m p a c ta tag i v e nd e c ile of the country-level economicdistribution (Fig. 4 B), the sign of the impact on the lower deciles(Fig. 4 B)—and therefore on inequality (Fig. 4 C)—is robust.from 1991−2010 from 1961−2010percent change in GDP per capitafrom 1991−2010 from 1961−2010AB0 +20 +40 -20 -40CD0.9 0.5 0.1 0.7 0.3probability of economic damageCountry-level economic impact of historical global warmingFig. 2.

Lagged responses cancompensate the gro wth effects of temperature fluctuations, leadingto decreases in both the growth benefit in cool countries and thegrowth penalty in warm countries (4). These lagged responses re-duce the calculated magnitude and probability of warming-inducedincreases in economic inequality. However, even with a 5-y lag, thereis still 66% likelihood that historical warming has increased country-level inequality.The availability of socioeconomic data also creates uncer-tainty. Because growth effects cumulate, the length of time overwhich economic impacts are evaluated can meaningfully affectresults (4, 12, 14). However, data availability creates an inherenttradeoff between evaluating fewer countries over a longer periodand evaluating more countries over a shorter period. We repeatour primary analysis using a larger, shorter sample. Overall, thepattern of impact is robust, but the cumulative magnitude is largerover the longer period (Figs. 2 and 3 and SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ). Thisexpansion over longer periods suggests that the full impact ofwarming since the Industrial Revolution has been even greater thanthe impact calculated over the past half century.Our approach to quantifying the impact of global warming oneconomic inequality is also limited by its reliance on country-level relationships between temperature and economic growth.Our analysis focuses on country-level data because their wideavailability (in both space and time) allows us to use empiricalrelationships to quantify how historical temperature changeshave affected economic outcomes around the world. The impactof climate change on the evolution of within-country inequality isa critical question (e.g., ref. 2), but would require either strongassumptions about how within-country income distributions re-spond to aggregate shocks at the country level, or comprehensivesubnational data on incomes (which are currently unavailable formost country-years around the world). Although our populationweighting provides some indication of global-scale individual-level inequality (9), documenting the impact of global warmingon within-country inequality remains an important challenge.Many countries in our sample have experienced rapid urbaniza-tion and economic development for reasons unrelated to climate,and such trends could plausibly alter how economies respond tosubsequent climate change. Because past work did not find statis-tically significant evidence that higher incomes reduce temperaturesensitivities (4), we do not attempt to model this moderating effecthere. However, if increasing urbanization or economic developmenthas reduced the temperature sensitivity of economies over our studyperiod, this effect will be implicitly included in our estimated impactof temperature on GDP growth and inequality —that is, we haveestimated the effect of temperature on growth for economies thatare rapidly urbanizing. Explicitly quantifying the role of thesemoderating influences is an important avenue for future work, as itwill be critical for understanding how future climate change willaffect the level and distribution of global income.Trade between countries has likely already influenced the im-pacts of global warming on population-weighted inequality. First, alarge part of the reduction in historical inequality during our sampleperiod has been due to the unprecedented growth in incomes inEast Asia [and particularly Chin a (9, 10)], much of which was builton critical trading relationships with high-income countries.

Thus, because of China ’s large population and small sensitivityto historical warming (Fig. 2), repeating our analysis in a no-tradecounterfactual would likely resul t in smaller reductions in per capitaGDP in the lower deciles of the population-weighted income dis-tribution (Fig. 4 B). However, trade can also serve as a buffer againstclimate shocks, particularly in poor countries (e.g., ref. 30). Thus,the economic impacts of global warming —which has substantiallyincreased the occurrence of extremes (e.g., ref. 21) —would likelyhave been even greater in poor count ries in a no-trade counterfactual,amplifying the impact on between-country inequality.ConclusionsIt has been frequently observed that wealthy countries havebenefited disproportionately from the activities that have causedglobal warming, while poor countries suffer disproportionatelyfrom the impacts (e.g., refs. 16, 17, 19, 25, and 26). Our resultsshow that, in addition to the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, manywealthy countries have likely been made even more wealthy by theresulting global warming. Likewise, not only have poor countriesnot shared in the full benefits of energy consumption, but manyhave already been made poorer (in relative terms) by the energyconsumption of wealthy countries. Given the magnitude of thewarming-induced growth penalties that poor countries have al-ready suffered, expansion of low-carbon energy sources can beexpected to provide a substantial secondary development benefit(by curbing future warming-induced growth penalties), in additionto the primary benefits of increased energy access.Materials and MethodsClimate Model Experiments. We compare the Historical and Natural climatemodel simulations from the CMIP5 archive (20). As in Burke et al. (14), we analyzethe subselection of CMIP5 realizations analyzed by the Inter governmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC) (31). For the Natural experiment, this includes onerealization each from 21 of the particip ating global climate models, which arepaired with the 21 corresponding Historical realizations. Note that although thesocioeconomic data are available throug h 2010, the CMIP5 expe rimental protocolfor the Historical and Natural experime nts ends in 2005. Thus, as in Burke et al.(14), we use the IPCC ’s 20-y historical b aseline period (1986 –2005) as the baselineperiod for climate model bias correction.For each country, we create 21 counterfactual historical temperaturetimeseries TNoAnthro , which remove the influence of anthropogenic forcingsimulated by each of the 21 climate models. Our approach to creating thecounterfactual timeseries follows the widely applied “delta method ”ofclimate model bias correction, in which the model-simulated change in themean is applied to the observed timeseries. For each country c, we firstcalculate the observed country-level population-weighted mean annualtemperature timeseries TObsfor the 1961 –2010 time period covered by thesocioeconomic data, following Burke et al. (14). Then, for each country candclimate model m, we calculate the difference in country-level population-weighted mean temperature between the Historical and Natural CMIP5simulations, both for the 20-y period centered on the beginning of the so-cioeconomic data (1951 –1970), and for the 20-y historical baseline periodused by the IPCC (1986 –2005). We then linearize the difference between theHistorical and Natural simulations over the 1961 –2010 period, such that thedifference in 1961 is equal to the difference in the Historical and Naturalmeans during the 20-y period centered on 1961 (1951 –1970), and the dif-ference in 2010 is equal to the difference in the Historical and Natural meansduring the IPCC ’s 20-y baseline period (1986 –2005). Finally, for each year tinthe 1961 –2010 observed temperature timeseries, we add the linearizedNatural minus Historical difference ΔTfor that year:TNoAnthro ½t/C138=TObs ½t/C138+ΔT½t/C138.This process generates, for each country, an ensemble of 21 counterfactualtimeseries TNoAnthro . This 21-member ensemble reflects a combination ofuncertainty in the climate response to external forcings and uncertaintyarising from internal climate system variability, but removes biases in theclimate model simulation of the absolute temperature magnitude and ofthe interannual temperature variability. [The TNoAnthro timeseries corre-sponds to the counterfactual timeseries used in Diffenbaugh et al. (21) tocalculate the contribution of the observed trend to the extreme eventmagnitude, except that in this case the magnitude of the counterfactualtrend is calculated from the CMIP5 Natural forcing simulation.]Impact of Historical Temperature Change on Economic Growth. Burke et al.(4, 14) used historical data to quantify the empirical relationship betweenvariations in country-level temperature and country-level annual growth inper capita GDP, allowing for the marginal effect of annual temperaturedeviations to vary nonlinearly as a function of country-level mean temper-ature. As described in detail in Burke et al. (4, 14), the equation for the panelfixed-effects model is as follows:Δlog ðYitÞ=β1Tit+β2T2it+λ1Pit+λ2P2it+μi+υt+θ1it+θ2it2+«it,where Yitis per capita GDP in country iin year t,Tis the average temper-ature in year t,Pis the average precipitation in year t,μiare country-fixedeffects, υtare year-fixed effects, and θ1it+θ2it2are country-specific linearand quadratic time trends.In the current study, we repeat the primary regression calculation de-scribed in Burke et al. (14), using historical data from 1961 to 2010, andbootstrapping with replacement to estimate a separate response functionfor each of 1,000 resamples, which we denote fb. The uncertainty in themagnitude of the temperature optimum (Fig. 1 B) creates uncertainty inexactly which countries are likely to benefit or be penalized at differentlevels of warming, and is the largest source of uncertainty in the response ofGDP growth to elevated levels of global climate forcing (14).We quantify the uncertainty in economi c damages arising from uncertainty inthe temperature optimum (e.g., Figs. 2 and 4 and SI Appendix , Table S1 ), as wellas the uncertainty arising from lagged r esponses to temperat ure fluctuations(SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 2 ). We also explore additional a spects of the relationshipbetween temperature and GDP growth. Fo r example, we find that historicaltemperature fluctuations explain on av erage 8.6% of the overall variation incountry-level annual income growth fluctuations during our study period ( SIAppendix ,F i g .S 2 ). Likewise, given the shape of the temperature –growth re-sponse function (Fig. 1 B), temperature fluctuation s around a stable mean willinduce a negative trend in per capita GDP . However, we find that the magnitudeof this effect is small compared with the impact of long-term warming ( SI Ap-pendix ,F i g .S 3 ).Whereas Burke et al. (4, 14) projected economic impacts under futureemissions scenarios, we calculate the accumulated economic impacts ofhistorical temperature change. For each country cin each year t, we compareeconomic growth under historical observed temperatures ( TObs) with pre-dicted growth under counterfactual temperatures ( TNoAnthro ). We repeat thiscomparison for each climate model mand each bootstrap j, yielding morethan 20,000 realizations of the impact of anthropogenic forcing on eco-nomic growth in each country.We first initialize the analysis in each country with the observed per capita GDPfrom the starting year t=0 of the socioeconomic data (e.g., GDPcap Obs[1961]).Then, for each year tand using the temperature –growth response func-tions festimated above, we calculate the difference in growth rate be-tween the observed temperature an d the counterfactual temperature(Fig. 1 Cand D):ΔGrowth ½t/C138=fðTNoAnthro ½t/C138Þ−fðTObs ½t/C138Þ.We then add that difference ΔGrowth [t] to the actual observed growth rateGrowth Obs[t] to calculate the counterfactual growth rate Growth NoAnthro [t]:Growth NoAnthro ½t/C138=Growth Obs ½t/C138+ΔGrowth ½t/C138.We then multiply this counterfactual growth Growth NoAnthro [t]b yt h ea c c u m u -lated counterfactual per capita GDP in the previous year ( GDPcap NoAnthro [t−1])to calculate current-year counterfactual per capita GDP:GDPcap NoAnthro ½t/C138=GDPcap NoAnthro ½t−1/C138+ðGDPcap NoAnthro ½t−1/C138*Growth NoAnthro ½t/C138Þ.We repeat this process through the last year of the socioeconomic data(2010), for each country in the GDP dataset.Finally, we calculate the percent diffe rence between the actual observed percapita GDP ( GDPcap Obs) and the per capita GDP calculated for the counterfactualtemperature timeseries ( GDPcap NoAnthro ) in the last year of the socioeconomicdata (2010):ΔGDPcap =½ðGDPcap Obs ½2010 /C138–GDPcap NoAnthro ½2010 /C138Þ=GDPcap NoAnthro ½2010 /C138/C138×100%.For each country c, we calculate GDPcap NoAnthro and ΔGDPcap for each of the1,000 bootstrapped response functions fb, applied to the counterfactualtemperature timeseries TNoAnthro from each of the 21 global climate models9812 |www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1816020116 Diffenbaugh and BurkeDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on March 10, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.(thus yielding more than 20,000 values of GDPcap NoAnthro and ΔGDPcap foreach country).Our primary analysis is focused on quantifying the impacts that historicalglobal warming has had during the full period for which socioeconomic dataare available (1961 –2010). However, because the socioeconomic data do notextend to 1961 for a large number of countries, we repeat our analysis for the1991 –2010 period. For all analyses that start in 1961, we analyze only thosecountries that have continuous socioeconomic data from 1961 through 2010(n=86); for all analyses that start in 1991, we analyze only those countries thathave continuous socioeconomic data from 1991 through 2010 ( n=151). Ob-served and estimated counterfactual temperatures and growth rates are thesame for the years that overlap between the two periods, but growth rates arecumulated over 30 more years in the longer period, yielding larger (in absolutevalue) impacts on economic outcomes by the end of the period (Fig. 2).Quantifying the Impact of Historical Global Warming on Economic Inequality. Anumber of measures of economic inequality have been developed (9). Given thelimited availability of long timeseries of subnational economic data, investiga-tions of changes in global ine quality often rely on country-level metrics (e.g., refs.9 and 10). However, when using country-level metrics, weighting by country-level population is critical to accurately capture trend s in global inequality (9).We measure global economic inequality using the ratio of the top andbottom decile ( “90:10 ratio ”) and top and bottom quintile ( “80:20 ratio ”)o fthe population-weighted country-level per capita GDP distribution. Bothmetrics are included among “eight of the most popular ”indexes of incomeinequality identified by Sala-i-Martin (9). According to Sala-i-Martin (9), “Thetop-20-percent-to-bottom-20-percent is the ratio of the income of the personlocated at the top twentieth centile divided by the income of the corre-sponding person at the bottom twentieth centile. A similar definition appliesto the top-10-percent-to-bottom-10-percent ratio. ”Because of the lack ofavailability of long timeseries of subnational economic data, we calculatethese ratios using the respective percentiles of the population-weighted em-pirical CDF of country-level per capita GDP values ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 ).We first calculate the percent difference in per capita GDP for each decileof the population-weighted country-level GDP distribution. To do so, wecalculate the deciles of country-level population-weighted per capita GDP,using the countries in the 1961 –2010 dataset. For each year tin the observedcountry-level per capita GDP dataset ( GDPcap Obs), we calculate the pthpercentile population-weighted GDP as the country-level per capita GDPbelow which the sum of the country-level populations represents ppercentof the total population of countries in the 1961 –2010 dataset ( SI Appendix ,Fig. S4 ). For example, we calculate the 10th percentile population-weightedGDP as the country-level per capita GDP for which the total population ofcountries with lower per capita GDP is 10% of the total population ofcountries in the 1961 –2010 dataset, and so on for each decile.Next, we calculate the deciles of country-level population-weighted per capitaGDP in each year tof each bootstrap jand climate model mof the counterfactualworld without anthropogenic climate forcing ( GDPcap NoAnthro ). Then, for the year2010 in each bootstrap jand climate model m, we calculate the percent differencebetween the observed population-weighted decile value and the counterfactualpopulation-weighted decile value (as described for ΔGDPcap above). For thedifferences in each population-weighted de cile, we calculate the density distri-bution across all 1,000 bootstrap regressions from all 21 climate models, as well asthe median value across the 1,000 bootstra p regressions for each climate model.Finally, we quantify the between-country population-weighted economicinequality GDPcapHigh:Low as the ratio between the higher percentile (e.g.,90th) and lower percentile (e.g., 10th) population-weighted per capita GDP. Wefirst calculate GDPcapHi gh:Low in each year tof the observations ( GDPcapHigh:Low Obs) ,a n di ne a c hy e a r tof the counterfactual world without anthropogenicclimate forcing ( GDPcapHigh:Low NoAnthro ). Then, for each bootstrap jand cli-mate model m, we calculate the percent diffe rence between the observedpopulation-weighted inequality GDPcapHigh:Low Obsand the counterfactualpopulation-weighted inequality GDPcapHigh:Low NoAnthro in the year 2010:ΔGDPcapHigh:Low =½ðGDPcapHigh:Low Obs ½2010 /C138–GDPcapHigh:Low NoAnthro ½2010 /C138Þ=GDPcapHigh:Low NoAnthro ½2010 /C138/C138×100%.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
