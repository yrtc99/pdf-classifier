However, it is still not known whether dark microbial CO2 fixation substantially con -tributes to the C balance of soils and what factors control this process. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantitate dark microbial CO2 fixation in temperate forest soils, to determine the relationship between the soil CO2 concentration and dark microbial CO2 fixation, and to estimate the relative contribution of different microbial groups to dark CO2 fixation. For this purpose, we conducted a 13C-CO2 la-beling experiment. We found that the rates of dark microbial CO2 fixation were posi -tively correlated with the CO2 concentration in all soils. Dark microbial CO2 fixation amounted to up to 320 µg C kg−1 soil day−1 in the Ah horizon. The fixation rates were 2.8–8.9 times higher in the Ah horizon than in the Bw1 horizon. Although the rates of dark microbial fixation were small compared to the respiration rate (1.2%–3.9% of the respiration rate), our findings suggest that organic matter formed by microorganisms from CO2 contributes to the soil organic matter pool, especially given that microbial detritus is more stable in soil than plant detritus. Phospholipid fatty acid analyses indicated that CO2 was mostly fixed by gram-positive bacteria, and not by fungi. In conclusion, our study shows that the dark microbial CO2 fixation rate in temperate forest soils increases in periods of high CO2 concentrations, that dark microbial CO2 fixation is mostly accomplished by gram-positive bacteria, and that dark microbial CO2 fixation contributes to the formation of soil organic matter.KEYWORDSanaplerotic reactions, carbon cycle, chemoautotrophic bacteria, CO2 concentration, dark microbial CO2 fixation, fungal–bacterial interactions, microbial carbon pump, microbial soil carbon processing, soil organic matter formation1 |  INTRODUCTIONSoils have mostly been studied as a source of CO2 during the last de-cades, and organic carbon (C) in soil is assumed to have been fixed by photosynthesis (Bond-Lamberty, Bailey, Chen, Gough, & Vargas, 2018; Carey et al., 2016; Schlesinger & Andrews, 2000). However, soil micro-organisms also fix CO2 in the dark, and transform it into organic C (Krebs, 1941; Miltner et al., 2004, 2005; Nowak et al., 2015; Šantrůčková et al.,     |  1927SPOHN et al.2018). Yet the contribution of dark, that is, nonphototrophic, microbial CO2 fixation in soils to the C cycle, and the factors that control dark microbial CO2 fixation in soils are still not well understood.It has been reported recently that dark CO2 fixation rates in arc -tic tundra soils amounted to 0.4%–16.0% of the respiration rates (Šantrůčková et al., 2018). If dark microbial CO2 f i x a t i o n  i n  s o i l  reaches up to 16% of respiration, the process contributes substan -tially to C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and needs to be taken into account for calculating soil C balances. However, currently it is difficult to estimate the importance of dark soil microbial CO2 fixa -tion for the C balance of soils, because there are only a few studies on microbial dark CO2 fixation, and many of them analyzed indica -tions of CO2 fixation, such as the abundance of certain gene mark -ers (Beulig et  al., 2015; Liu et  al., 2018; Yuan, Ge, Chen, O'Donnell, & Wu, 2012) or isotopic labeling of specific compounds (Ge et al., 2016), but most studies did not quantitate the proper fixation rates.There are indications that dark soil microbial CO2 fixation occurs in a large range of soils, including Mediterranean soils (Nel & Cramer, 2019), semiarid desert soils (Liu et al., 2018), arctic tundra soils (Šantrůčková et al., 2018), temperate peatland soils (Beulig et al., 2015; Nowak et al., 2015), paddy soils (Ge et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2012), temperate meadow soils (Šantrůčková et al., 2005) as well as cropland soils (Miltner, Richnow, Kopinke, & Kästner, 2004). Thus, the process might occur ubiquitously in soils, and if quantitatively important, might affect the global C cycle. Yet, little is known about CO2 fixation in temperate forest soils, and more importantly, proper CO2 fixation rates have only been quantified in just a few soils so far (Miltner, Kopinke, et al., 2005; Šantrůčková et al., 2018).Microbial fixation of CO2 in the absence of light can be accom -plished by a wide variety of microorganisms using different meta -bolic pathways. First, chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea use CO2 as the only C source (Berg et al., 2010; Saini, Kapoor, Kumar, Siddiqi, & Kumar, 2011). Second, a wide spectrum of heterotro -phic bacteria and fungi employ carboxylases to replenish the citric acid cycle through anaplerotic reactions (Erb, 2011; Kornberg & Krebs, 1957). Still, little is known about the contribution of differ -ent microbial groups to dark CO2 fixation in soil. Šantrůčková et al. (2018) indicated that CO2 in arctic tundra soils was mostly fixed by gram-negative bacteria and to a lesser extent by gram-positive bac -teria and fungi. However, aside from the evidence provided by this study, hardly anything is known about the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to dark CO2 fixation in soils.The factors that control dark microbial CO2 fixation in soil are not completely known, but there is scattered evidence that the CO2 con-centration might affect dark microbial CO2 fixation. The CO2 con -centration in soils is much higher than in the atmosphere, and ranges typically between 1% and 2%, but can get as high as 13% (Amundson & Davidson, 1990). Thus, the high CO2 concentration in soil might facilitate dark microbial CO2 fixation. Krebs (1941) reported that heterotrophic CO2-fixing propionic bacteria grew submerged in agar, where the CO2 concentration was high, and only in experiments, in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration was increased, they grew on the surface of the agar. More recently, Šantrůčková et al. (2005) reported that dark microbial CO2 fixation was higher in alkaline than in acid soils, and the authors explained this by the higher HCO−3 con-centration in these soils. Aside from these two studies, nothing is known about the relationship between the CO2 concentration and dark microbial CO2 fixation, to our knowledge.The objective of this study was (a) to quantitate dark micro -bial CO2 fixation in three temperate forest soils that are typical for Central European forests; (b) to determine the relationship between the CO2 concentration and dark microbial CO2 fixation rate; and (c) to estimate the relative contributions of different microbial groups to dark CO2 fixation. We hypothesized that (a) dark microbial CO2 fixation in temperate forest soils contributes substantially to C cy -cling and the C balance of temperate forest soils; (b) the microbial CO2 fixation rate increases with the CO2 concentration in soil; and (c) CO2 is mostly fixed by prokaryotes and not by fungi in these tem -perate forest soils. In order to test these hypotheses, we conducted an incubation experiment, in which we determined the dark micro-bial CO2 fixation rate under four different CO2 concentrations using 13C-CO2. In addition, we estimated and visualized the contribution of different microbial groups to dark microbial CO2 fixation based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS).2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  | Study sites, sampling, and sample preparationWe selected three forest sites for this study that are typical for Central Europe (Baritz, Seufert, Montanarella, & Ranst, 2010). The three sites belong to the Bavarian forestry monitoring program and the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests and have been monitored for sev-eral decades. The site Bad Brueckenau (BB) is situated in the Rhoen Mountains (50°21′N, 9°55′E) at 809 m a.s.l. and hosts a mature Fagus sylvatica L. forest. The mean annual rainfall amounts to 1,031 mm and the mean annual temperature is 5.8°C. The parent material is ba-salt, and the soil type is a dystric skeletic Cambisol (FAO). The site Mitterfels (M) is situated in the Bavarian Forest (48°53′N, 12°53′E) at 1,023 m a.s.l. and hosts a mature F. sylvatica L. forest. The mean annual rainfall amounts to 1,299 mm and the mean annual tempera-ture is 4.8°C. The parent material is paragneiss, and the soil type is a hyperdystric chromic Cambisol (FAO). The site Rothenkirch (R) is situ -ated in the Franconian Forest (50°27′N, 11°21′E) at 670 m a.s.l. and hosts a mature Picea abies  forest. The mean annual rainfall amounts to 1,070 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6.3°C. The parent material is greywacke, and the soil type is a podzolic Cambisol (FAO). All three soils are acidic and carbonate free (Table 1). At each site, we sampled three depth increments of a soil profile, namely 0–5 cm (Ah horizon), 30–40 cm (Bw1 horizon) and 60–70 cm (Bw2 horizon) in September 2018. The soil samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory of the University of Bayreuth, where all soil samples were sieved (<2 mm) and roots were removed. 13652486, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14937 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

For this purpose, 18.0 g of each sample was weighed into incubation jars in eight rep-lications for the Ah and Bw2 horizons, and in 20 replications for the Bw1 horizons. The incubation jars had a volume of 1,057 ml and were equipped with a septum that allowed for removal of gas samples with a syringe. Incubation jars with a large headspace volume with respect to the soil mass were chosen because we wanted the CO2 concentra-tion and its isotopic signature to change as little as possible during incubation. The water content of all samples was adjusted to 60% of their field capacity. Subsequently, we preincubated the jars at 15°C in a dark incubation chamber for 10 days. After preincubation, all jars were re-opened for several minutes to allow the CO2 concentration to equilibrate with the ambient CO2 concentration. Four replicates of each soil horizon were kept with air as 13C natural abundance (n.a.) control treatment. In the other jars, the CO2 concentration was adjusted using 99.99 at% 13C-labeled CO2 (Sigma-Aldrich). For this purpose, air from the closed jar was removed using a gas-tight sy-ringe, and the same volume was replaced by pure 13C-labeled CO2. Four replicates of all horizons were incubated under an atmosphere of 2.50 (v/v) % CO2. In addition, the Bw1 horizons of the three forest soils were incubated at 1.00, 4.70, and 6.10 (v/v) % CO2, each in four replications. The reason for choosing the Bw1 horizon for the experi-ment with the CO2 gradient is twofold; first, the CO2 concentration tends to be higher in the subsoil than in the Ah horizon in many soils, second, the Bw1 horizon has a higher microbial biomass and micro-bial activity than the Bw2 horizon. After the CO2 concentration was adjusted, all incubation jars were incubated at 15°C in the dark for 165 hr (7 days). At the very end of the incubation experiment, the jars were opened. The soil was divided, and one part of each soil sam-ple was immediately used for the determination of microbial biomass carbon (MBC), one part was freeze dried and ground using a ball mill (Retsch GmbH), one part was frozen at −14°C for subsequent DNA and PLFA extraction, and one part was chemically fixed for NanoSIMS measurements.2.3 | Respiration, microbial biomass, and DNAThe (net) respiration rate was determined based on measurements of the CO2 concentrations in the glass jars performed at the beginning and at the end of the incubation experiment using a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C; SRI Instruments Europe GmbH) equipped with a flame ioniza -tion detector. Gas samples were taken from the headspace of the jars using a syringe and then injected directly into the gas chromatograph.In order to determine the MBC and its delta 13C signature, we used the chloroform-fumigation-extraction method (Vance, Brookes, & Jenkinson, 1987). For this purpose, each soil sample was divided into two parts. One part was fumigated for 24  hr with chloroform in a desiccator before being extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4, while the other part was directly extracted in 0.5 M K2SO4. The dissolved C concen -tration of the extracts was determined using a total organic carbon (TOC)/TN analyzer (Multi N/C 2100S; Analytik Jena AG). The total MBC was calculated using the conversion factor of 2.22 (Joergensen, 1996). All extracts were freeze dried for isotope analysis.DNA was extracted from 400 mg of moist soil using a DNA ex -traction kit (FastDNA™ SPIN Kit for Soil; MP Biomedicals) with small modifications as in Spohn, Pötsch, et al. (2016). The DNA extract was dried in silver capsules at 60°C overnight before isotope analysis.2.4 | Isotope analysesThe δ13C signature of the TOC, of the MBC, and of the DNA of each soil sample was determined at the Center for Stable Isotopes (KOSI) at the University of Göttingen. Samples were analyzed on a Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) interfaced to a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer Euro EA 3000 (EuroVector S.p.A).2.5 | Phospholipid-derived fatty acidsPhospholipid-derived fatty acids were extracted from 2.0 g soil fol -lowing the procedure described by Frostegård, Tunlid, and Bååth Soil HorizonSoil depth (cm)TexturepHH2OTOC (g/kg)TN  (g/kg)Sand (%)Silt (%)Clay (%)BB Ah 0–5 8 56 36 3.9 159.4 9.7Bw1 30–40 24 50 26 4.6 30.0 2.2Bw2 60–70 29 51 20 5.2 12.2 1.0M Ah 0–5 48 33 20 3.7 137.3 7.8Bw1 30–40 58 34 8 4.8 33.5 1.9Bw2 60–70 56 36 9 4.9 17.7 1.1R Ah 0–5 28 42 30 3.9 79.3 4.5Bw1 30–40 32 45 23 4.6 15.5 1.3Bw2 60–70 40 43 17 4.6 10.5 1.0TABLE 1 Soil chemical properties, including texture, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) of the three horizons of each of the three forest soils Bad Brueckenau (BB), Mitterfels (M) and Rothenkirch (R) 13652486, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14937 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

Lipid fractionation and subsequent estimation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were performed according to Kramer, Marhan, Haslwimmer, Ruess, and Kandeler (2013). For determination of the 13C signature in FAMEs, an HP 6890 Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Inc.) coupled via a combustion III Interface (Thermo Finnigan) with a Delta Plus XP mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan MAT) was used according to the procedure de -scribed by Müller et al. (2016). In total, 30 PLFA peaks were detected with gas chromatography – flame ionization detector, but during gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry analy -ses not all peaks were baseline separated because of either low con -centration or weak separation of single fatty acids. The PLFAs i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0, and 18:1 ω9 were used as biomarkers for gram-positive bacteria, cy19:0 as biomarker for gram-negative bacteria, and 18:2 ω6,9 as a biomarker for fungi (Frostegård & Bååth, 1996; Frostegård, Bååth, & Tunlid, 1993; Zelles, 1999). The 13C values of all FAMEs were corrected for the addition of a methyl group using a mass balance equation (Denef et al., 2007). The methanol used for methylation had a δ13C value of −43.99‰.2.6 | Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometryBulk soil samples were chemically fixed using Karnovsky fixative (Karnovsky, 1965) and dehydrated in graded ethanol series and dried via critical point drying (Quorum K850; Quorum Technologies Ltd). Dried samples were prepared on conductive graphene film (Plano) placed on brass stubs (10 mm diameter) suitable for scanning elec -tron microscopy (SEM) and NanoSIMS. Briefly, 1  mg of dry soil mate -rial was placed on the graphene film, the nonsticking material was blown off using compressed clean air, yielding a layer of microag -gregates, particulate organic matter and hyphae. To avoid charging, a coating with Au/Pd (ca. 5 nm for SEM, ca. 30 nm for NanoSIMS, Polaron Emitech SC7640 sputter coater) was applied prior to SEM and NanoSIMS analyses. Prior to NanoSIMS measurements, the samples were examined using SEM (Jeol 7200 F) in order to deter -mine regions of interest for subsequent NanoSIMS measurements (Mueller et al., 2013).The samples were examined using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50L. The Cs+ primary ion beam was used, having a primary ion impact energy of 16 keV. Prior to the NanoSIMS measurement, contaminants and the Au/Pd coating layer were locally sputtered away using a high primary beam current (presputtering). During this presputtering stage, the re-active Cs+ ions were implanted into the sample in order to enhance the secondary ion yields, until the secondary ions reached a steady state. Charging on mineral soil particles was additionally compen -sated using the electron flood gun of the NanoSIMS. The primary beam (ca. 2 pA) was focused at a lateral resolution of ca. 150 nm and was scanned over the sample, with 16O−, 12C−2, 12C13C−, 12C14N−, 32S−, 27Al16O−, and 56Fe16O− secondary ions collected on electron multipli -ers with an electronic dead time fixed at 44 ns. To accurately separate mass isobars, for example, 13C12C− and 12C21H− at mass number 25, a suitable mass resolution was achieved with appropriate slits and ap-ertures (D1_3, ES_3, AS_2). The secondary ions were recorded using a dwell time of 1 ms/pixel, with 256 × 256 pixels for a 30 × 30 μm field of view with 40 planes per scan. Thus, each pixel corresponded to a size of ~117 nm × 117 nm. To localize the isotopic enrichment, we used open multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry plugin in ImageJ and computed the 12C13C−/12C−2 ratio, which is doubled compared to 13C−/12C−. The n.a. at the instrument settings used translates into a ratio of 220 on the color scale used in the figures (Figure 4c,f).2.7  | Calculations and statistical analysesThe isotope ratio of the MBC was calculated based on the ex -tracts of the fumigated and the nonfumigated soil sample as follows:The amount of C that was fixed in the soil and in the MBC pool was calculated from the isotope ratio of the labeled sample and the n.a. sample, as follows:where C is the C concentration of the respective pool. The 12C/13C ratio was obtained from the δ13C based on the 13C/12C ratio of the V-PDB standard that amounts to 0.0111802 as follows:The C fixation rates for the total soil pool and the MBC pool were cal-culated by dividing the amount of fixed C (see Equation 2) by the in-cubation time. The rate of CO2 fixation in the microbial biomass pool was normalized by the concentration of MBC. δ13C enrichments were calculated for DNA and PLFAs by subtracting the δ13C value of the n.a. sample from the δ13C value of the labeled sample. The respiration rate was calculated by dividing the amount of CO2-C respired during the incubation by the incubation time. We plotted linear models of CO2 fixation as a function of the CO2 concentration and calculated Pearson correlation coefficients. Normal distribution of the CO2 fixation rates, the 13C enrichment of the PLFAs as well as the abundance of PLFAs was tested using the Shapiro test. Rates of CO2 fixation in the soil and in the soil microbial biomass were compared separately across the three soils. This analysis was conducted separately for all Ah, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons across all three soils by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. The 13C enrichment of the PLFA in the Bw1 horizons was compared separately for the three Bw1 horizons by Kruskal test fol-lowed by pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test. In addition, the abundance of different PLFAs was compared across all three Bw1 horizons by (1)δ13C=/parenleft.s1δ13Cfum×Cfum−δ13Cnon−fum×Cnon−fum/parenright.s1/parenleft.s1Cfum−Cnon−fum/parenright.s1 .(2) Cfixed (mg∕kg )=/parenleft.s313C12C/parenright.s3labeled×C(mg∕kg )−/parenleft.s313C12C/parenright.s3n.a.×C(mg∕kg ),(3)13C12C=/parenleft.s3δ13C1,000+1/parenright.s3×0.0111802. 13652486, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14937 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

In all tests, differences with a p < .05 were considered as statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, 2013).3 |  RESULTSThe rates of dark microbial CO2 fixation were highest in the Ah ho -rizons, and reached up to 320 µg CO2-C kg−1 soil day−1 in the Ah horizon of soil M (Figure 1A). The fixation rates were 5.8, 8.9, and 2.8 times higher in the Ah horizon than in the Bw1 horizon of soils BB, M, and R, respectively (Figure 1A). Normalized on the soil TOC concentration, the dark microbial CO2 fixation rates ranged between 1.1 and 5.3 µg CO2-C g−1 TOC  day−1. The fixation rates in the MBC pool per unit MBC were significantly higher in the Bw1 horizon of soil R than in the Bw1 horizon of the other two soils (Figure 1B). In addition, the fixation rates in the MBC pool per unit MBC were also significantly higher in the Bw2 horizon of soil R than in the Bw2 ho -rizon of the other two soils.The rates of dark microbial CO2 fixation were positively cor -related with the CO2 concentration in the Bw1 horizon in all three soils ( R2 = .79, .87, and .87 in soil BB, M, and R, respectively, all p < .001; Figure 2a). The CO2 fixation rates per unit soil increased by a factor of 1.74, 1.73, and 1.73 in the soil BB, M, and R, respec -tively, when the CO2 concentration was increased from 1.0% to 6.1% CO2 (Figure 2a). Similarly, the fixation rates in the MBC pool were also positively correlated with the CO2 concentration in all soils (Figure 2b).The MBC concentration was 5.8–8.3 times higher, and respi -ration rates were 6.7–11.5 times higher in the Ah horizon than in the Bw1 horizon in the three soils (Table 2).

The δ13C enrichment of the DNA pool was higher in the Ah horizon than in the two Bw horizons in all three soils (Table 3). The δ13C enrich -ment of the PLFAs showed a consistent pattern across all three soils. The δ13C enrichment was significantly highest in PLFA 18:1 ω9c in all three soils, reaching up to 133‰ δ13C (Figure 3). The PLFAs i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, and i17:0 that are produced by gram-positive bacteria were also enriched in 13C in all three soils. The PLFA 18:2 ω6,9 which is produced by fungi showed only a very low 13C enrichment in all three soils, between 0.4‰ and 3.0‰ δ13C. The PLFA cy19:0 that is produced by gram-negative bacteria was more weakly enriched than the PLFAs i15:0 and i17:0 that are produced by gram-positive bac -teria. The 13C enrichment in 18:1 ω9c as well as in i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, and i17:0 increased from soil BB, to soil M, and was highest in soil R (Figure 3). The PLFA 18:1 ω9c, which was most strongly enriched in 13C, was significantly more abundant in soil R than in the other two soils (Table S1).The NanoSIMS measurements revealed 13C-enriched micro-patches, presumably bacterial cells, in the soils that had a size of about 585 nm × 585 nm (Figure 4). The 13C-enriched cells were associated with fungal hyphae (Figure 4b), although the hyphae themselves were not enriched in 13C (Figure 4c). Furthermore, we observed that 13C-enriched micropatches were associated with par -ticulate organic matter (Figure 4e).Soil Horizon MBC (mg/kg)Respiration (mg CO2-C kg−1 soil day−1)Dark CO2 fixation  (% of respiration)BB Ah 1,419 ± 332 19.08 ± 1.11 1.2 ± 0.1Bw1 170 ± 5 1.67 ± 0.13 2.4 ± 0.2Bw2 108 ± 11 1.18 ± 0.29 3.9 ± 0.8M Ah 1,333 ± 64 13.19 ± 0.54 2.4 ± 0.2Bw1 165 ± 23 1.50 ± 0.25 2.4 ± 0.1Bw2 86 ± 9 0.95 ± 0.14 1.7 ± 2.6R Ah 740 ± 22 9.06 ± 0.60 1.5 ± 0.4Bw1 127 ± 24 1.50 ± 0.25 2.7 ± 0.1Bw2 106 ± 12 1.55 ± 0.02 3.6 ± 1.0Note: Numbers depict means ± SD s (n = 4).TABLE 2 Soil microbial properties, including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), respiration, and dark microbial CO2 fixation as percentage of respiration in three horizons of each of the three forest soils Bad Brueckenau (BB), Mitterfels (M) and Rothenkirch (R)TABLE 3 δ13C enrichment of the total soil DNA pool in the soils Bad Brueckenau (BB), Mitterfels (M), and Rothenkirch (R) after labeling with 13C-CO2 at different CO2 concentrations in relation to the natural abundance samplesCO2 (%) Soil Horizonδ13C enrichment of DNA (‰)2.5 BB Ah 4.0 ± 2.7Bw1 1.2 ± 0.6Bw2 2.1 ± 0.8M Ah 4.6 ± 3.0Bw1 1.2 ± 0.6Bw2 2.1 ± 0.4R Ah 4.5 ± 3.0Bw1 1.4 ± 0.6Bw2 1.8 ± 0.91.0 BB Bw1 0.6 ± 0.4M Bw1 1.1 ± 0.4R Bw1 1.5 ± 0.44.7 BB Bw1 0.7 ± 0.4M Bw1 0.0 ± 0.3R Bw1 0.4 ± 0.46.1 BB Bw1 0.9 ± 0.7M Bw1 1.4 ± 0.2R Bw1 1.5 ± 0.3Note: Numbers depict means ± SD s (n = 4).FIGURE 3 δ13C enrichment of nine phospholipid fatty acids in the Bw1 horizon of the soils Bad Brueckenau (BB), Mitterfels (M), and Rothenkirch (R) after labeling with 13C-CO2 in an atmosphere with 6.1% CO2 in relation to the natural abundance samples.

The CO2 concentration in soils is highly dynamic and can increase to up to 13% of the soil air (Amundson & Davidson, 1990). In this light, our results indicate that more CO2 is fixed in soils in periods of high soil CO2 concentration and in soil microsites that have a high CO2 concentration. The linear rela-tionship between the CO2 concentration and the dark microbial CO2 fixation rate indicates that the process is controlled by the partial pres-sure of CO2. Reactions that lead to the fixation of CO2 are carboxyla-tion reactions that are catalyzed by carboxylases in microorganisms. Carboxylases catalyze carboxylation as well as decarboxylation of or -ganic compounds and the equilibrium of the reaction depends on the concentrations of all compounds involved in the reaction, according to Le Chatelier's principle. An increase in the CO2 concentration moves the equilibrium of the reaction toward the product of the carboxyla-tion reaction, and thus to an increase in CO2 fixation. Our findings show that the carboxylation reaction in soil microorganisms is very sensitive to changes in the CO2 concentration. We found that the CO2 fixation rate and the CO2 concentration were linearly correlated in the concentration range between 1.0% and 6.1% CO2. It could be that at a higher CO2 concentration, a saturation is reached and the fixation rate increases less with the CO2 concentration than below a CO2 concentration of 6.1%. However, CO2 concentrations beyond 6.1% do likely not occur very frequently in many soils (Amundson & Davidson, 1990).Our results suggest that in periods, in which large amounts of CO2 are respired, a larger percentage of CO2 is fixed by soil microorgan -isms, leading to a negative feedback of the CO2 concentration on soil net CO2 emission. However, it has to be taken into account that the FIGURE 4 Image analyses of locations of dark soil microbial CO2 fixation, including micrographs gained by scanning electron microscope with red squares indicating area measured using NanoSIMS (a and d), composite images derived from NanoSIMS measurements showing organic matter (12C14N−) and mineral particles (16O−; 56Fe16O−; b and e), and hue–saturation–intensity (HSI) maps of the ratio of 12C13C−/12C−2,  where the black line in the color bar indicates the ratio of 12C13C/12C2 at natural abundance (c and f).

Hence, the negative feed -back that the CO2 concentration exerts on the overall soil CO2 emis -sion due to its positive effect on dark microbial CO2 fixation is small.Although the rates of dark microbial fixation in the temperate for -est soils studied here were small compared to the respiration rates, our findings indicate that organic matter formed by microorganisms from CO2 contributes to the soil organic matter pool. Dead microbial biomass (microbial necromass) is a very important source of soil or -ganic matter since it is relatively stable in soil compared to plant de -tritus (Liang, Amelung, Lehmann, & Kästner, 2019; Miltner, Bombach, Schmidt-Brücken, & Kästner, 2012; Schimel & Schaeffer, 2012). Thus, C that enters the soil through the microbial biomass pool likely re -mains much longer in soil than C that enters the soil as plant detritus and mostly leaves the soil again in the form of CO2 after only a few years (Sierra, Hoyt, He, & Trumbore, 2018). Hence, dark microbial CO2 fixation might substantially contribute to the formation of soil organic matter in temperate forests. Furthermore, the NanoSIMS im -ages indicate that labeled bacteria were associated with organic mat -ter in microaggregates, which are assumed to be relatively stable in soil (Figure 4 lower panel). This finding provides additional evidence that CO2 that is fixed in soils by bacteria directly enters relatively sta -ble pools of organic matter in soil. Our results are in accordance with the emerging understanding that the microbial biomass is an import -ant contributor of organic matter in soils (Kallenbach, Frey, & Grandy, 2016; Schimel & Schaeffer, 2012; Spohn, Klaus, Wanek, & Richter, 2016). To what extent dark microbial C fixation contributes to the formation of soil organic matter that remains in soil for a long period of time depends ultimately on the persistence of microbial necromass in soil. Thus, a full evaluation of the contribution of dark microbial CO2 fixation to the formation of stable organic C in soil would require detailed information on the turnover of microbial necromass in soil.We found that the dark microbial CO2 f i x a t i o n  r a t e s  i n  r e -lationship with the respiration rate were in a similar range as in Miltner, Kopinke, et  al. (2005) who reported that dark microbial CO2 fixation rates in temperate cropland soils amounted to 0.3%–1.1% of the respiration rate. Also the absolute rates in Miltner, Kopinke, et al. (2005) were similar to our study and amounted to 420 µg C kg−1 soil day−1. The rates found here are also in accordance with Nowak et al. (2015) who reported that dark microbial fixation rates in organic grassland soils on natural CO2 vents amounted to 20–400 µg C kg−1 soil day−1. However, the rates of dark microbial CO2 fixation found here are much smaller than the rates reported by Šantrůčková et  al. (2018) for arctic permafrost soils. They found that the CO2 fixation rate across all studied soils amounted to up to 14.6 µg C g−1 TOC  day−1 (i.e. up to 16% of the respiration rate). The reason for the much larger rates of dark microbial CO2 fixation measured by Šantrůčková et al. (2018) might be the very special conditions in arctic permafrost soils. Our data and the data of simi -lar previous studies indicate that C flux calculations based on natu -ral C isotope signatures may be misleading since microbial fixation of CO2 that has the isotopic signature of atmospheric CO2 strongly increases the δ13C value of soil OC.Microbial dark CO2 fixation was higher in the Ah horizon than in the Bw1 horizon of all three soils (Figure 1A). This finding is in accor -dance with Nowak et al. (2015) and Ge et al. (2016), showing that dark microbial CO2 fixation was highest in the topsoils of grasslands on natural CO2 vents and in the top of paddy soils. The reason for this might be the high concentrations of microbial biomass (Table 2) and the high concentrations of TOC (Table 1) in the Ah horizons. The latter is supported by the NanoSIMS results, revealing that microbial cells that fixed CO2 were associated with organic matter (Figure 4). The interpretation that microbial CO2 fixation depends on organic C is in accordance with Šantrůčková et al. (2018) and Miltner, Kopinke, et al. (2005), showing that the dark CO2 fixation rates increased due to organic matter addition to soils. The observation that dark CO2 fix-ation is associated with the presence of organic C might suggest that dark microbial CO2 fixation is mostly catalyzed by heterotrophic mi-croorganisms. However, it could also be that dark microbial fixation is high in soils in the presence of large amounts of labile organic, because large amounts of labile organic matter are usually associated with high CO2 production in soil. In the present experiment, the availability of or -ganic C for microorganisms was low since root exudation and leaching of dissolved organic C from the organic layer into the mineral soil were excluded. If dark microbial C fixation is carried out mostly by hetero-trophic bacteria, as discussed above, it can be expected that the fix -ation rates are higher if organic C availability is increased. In addition, it could also be that some microbial groups, including gram-negative ones, that are little active under starvation conditions, become more active if more organic C is available.The PLFA analysis revealed that CO2 was fixed by the same group of microorganisms in all three soils although the soils and the study sites differed in many properties including parent material, domi-nant tree species, soil texture, soil TOC content (Table 1), and PLFA abundance (Table S1). Our results indicate that CO2 was mainly fixed by gram-positive bacteria and only to a much smaller extent by fungi and gram-negative bacteria (Figure 3). The dominant role of bacteria over fungi in dark CO2 fixation is in accordance with Šantrůčková et al. (2018). However, in contrast to Šantrůčková et al. (2018), we found only a small enrichment of 13C in the PLFA cy19:0 that is produced by gram-negative bacteria but relatively high enrichments in PLFAs that are produced by gram-positive bacteria. This difference between Šantrůčková et al. (2018) and our study can likely be attributed to the difference in soils, since they investigated arctic permafrost soils that host a different microbial community than the temperate forest soils studied here. However, both studies agree in the finding of a dominant role of bacteria over fungi in dark CO2 fixation. The NanoSIMS measure-ments confirmed that dark microbial CO2 fixation was accomplished by bacteria and not by fungi. In addition, we observed that CO2-fixing bac -teria were closely associated with fungal hyphae (Figure 4 upper panel). One might speculate that CO2-fixing microorganisms grow preferen-tially on fungal hyphae because they benefit from the CO2 respired by the fungus. This speculation is supported by the finding of Krebs (1941) that CO2-fixing propionic bacteria grow preferentially at microsites with high CO2 concentration. However, there might be other reasons why CO2-fixing prokaryotes grew preferentially on fungal hyphae; they  13652486, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14937 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2023].

The reason for this might be, first, that the four nucleotides that form DNA are not completely decomposed and newly synthesized in the cell but are (at least partly) re-used, in con -trast to PLFAs that are newly synthesized (Nelson, Cox, & Häcker, 2009). Second, CO2 fixed through anaplerotic reactions enters the microbial cell through the citric acid cycle and is incorporated into citrate, which is an important precursor of fatty acids, while the pentose that contains a large part of the C in DNA is not built up from compounds of the citric acid cycle in heterotrophic organisms (Nelson et al., 2009). Our results are in accordance with Miltner et al. (2004), observing that amino sugars were much less enriched with 13C than amino acids after incubating soil from a cropland with 13C-CO2. The findings that sugar-containing compounds are less en -riched in CO2-derived C indicate that dark microbial CO2 fixation is mostly accomplished by heterotrophic microorganisms.Significantly more CO2 was fixed in the microbial biomass in the Bw1 horizon of soil R than in the Bw1 horizon of the other two soils (Figures 1B and 2b) and also some PLFAs were more strongly en -riched with 13C in soil R than in the other two soils (Figure 3). This is especially noteworthy given that the respiration rates of the three Bw1 horizons were very similar (Table 2), indicating that the over -all microbial activity did not differ between the three soil horizons. The reason for the significantly higher CO2 fixation rate in the upper subsoil of the spruce forest soil (horizon Bw1 of soil R) might be a dif -ferent microbial community that fixes more CO2 compared to the cor -responding horizon in the two beech forest soils. This is supported by the finding that the PLFA 18:1 ω9c, which was most strongly enriched in 13C (Figure 3) was significantly more abundant in soil R than in the other two soils (Table S1). The difference in the microbial community might be caused by the difference in forest type (beech forest at sites BB and M, and spruce forest at site R) since tree species affect the microbial community composition in temperate forest soils (Hackl, Pfeffer, Donat, Bachmann, & Zechmeister-Boltenstern, 2005).In conclusion, our study shows that dark microbial CO2 fixation rates increase linearly with the soil CO2 concentration, indicating that more CO2 is fixed in periods or microsites with high soil CO2 concentrations. In addition, our findings show that dark CO2 fixation in temperate forest soils is mostly accomplished by gram-  positive bacteria and not by fungi. Although the rates of dark microbial fix -ation were small compared to the respiration rates, our findings suggest that organic matter formed by microorganisms from CO2 contributes to the soil organic matter pool, especially given that microbial detritus is more stable in soil than plant detritus.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSM.S. thanks Renate Krauß for technical assistance in the lab, Gerhard Müller for assistance in the field, and Per-Marten Schleuss for help with the gas valve.
