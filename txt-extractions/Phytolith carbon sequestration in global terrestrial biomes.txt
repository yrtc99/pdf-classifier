Here, we estimate phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes. We used biome data including pro-ductivity, phytolith and silica contents, and the phytolith stability factor to preliminarily determine the size anddistribution of the phytolith C sink in global terrestrial biomes. Total phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrialbiomes is 156.7 ± 91.6 Tg CO2yr−1. Grassland (40%), cropland (35%), and forest (20%) biomes are the dominantproducers of phytolith-based carbon; geographically, the main contributors are Asia (31%), Africa (24%), andSouth America (17%). Practices such as bamboo afforestation/reforestation and grassland recovery for economicand ecological purposes could theoretically double the above phytolith C sink. The potential terrestrial phytolithC sequestration during 2000 –2099 under such practices would be 15.7 –40.5 Pg CO2,e q u i v a l e n ti nm a g n i t u d et othe C sequestration of oceanic diatoms in sediments and through silicate weathering. Phytolith C sequestrationcontributes vitally to the global C cycle, hence, it is essential to incorporate plant-soil silica cycling in biogeochem-ical C cycle models.© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionMotivated by rapid increases in global emissions of carbon dioxide(CO 2), many scientists have recently focused on terrestrial carbon (C)sequestration ( Heimann and Reichstein, 2008; Pan et al., 2011; Peterset al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2016 ).

Althoughaccumulation of phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) in soils is slowon an annual-decadal scale, it may contribute ~15 –37% of the globalmean long-term (10,000 years) soil carbon sequestration rate ( Parrand Sullivan, 2005 ). Based on these calculations, it has been suggestedthat occlusion of C within phytoliths is an important biogeochemicalcarbon sequestration mechanism ( Parr and Sullivan, 2005; Parr et al.,2010; Song et al., 2012a, 2012b ).A wide range of vascular land plants produce phytoliths that occludecarbon ( Smith and White, 2004; Strömberg et al., 2016 ). Soils contain400–1000 times more PhytOC than the aboveground biomass for mostecosystems, demonstrating that PhytOC is highly resistant to decompo-sition and may accumulate in soils and sediment for several hundreds orthousands of years ( Meunier et al., 1999; Parr and Sullivan, 2005;Blecker et al., 2006 )—if not millions of years ( Prasad et al., 2005;Strömberg, 2011 ). Previous work has estimated the amount of PhytOCproduced from leaf litters within grassland ( Song et al., 2012a ), forest(Parr et al., 2010; Song et al., 2013a ) and cropland ( Zuo and Lü, 2011 )ecosystems of a country (China), within different ecosystems of a region(the Chinese Loess Plateau) ( Zuo et al., 2014 ), and within cropland eco-systems across the world ( Parr and Sullivan, 2011; Rajendiran et al.,2012; Song et al., 2013b ). However, the magnitude and potential of phy-tolith C sequestration at a global scale and relative to C sequestration asa whole, and how it varies among continents remain unknown.Here, we present estimates of how much C is sequestered in plantsilica within the world's terrestrial biomes based on data of above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of silicon (Si)-rich tissues,phytolith content of vegetation on average in biomes, C contents ofphytoliths, and the PhytOC stability factor for terrestrial ecosystemswithin 100 years (PSF100) estimated from phytolith turnover time(PSF 100=1 –100 / phytolith turnover time) ( Materials andmethods ). Because phytoliths are mainly produced from the above-ground parts of the biomes ( Parr et al., 2010; Parr and Sullivan, 2011 )and we are mainly interested in potential storage of phytoliths (andhence PhytOC) in soils well beyond the life of the plants, we have onlyincluded PhytOC input from aboveground litterfall and subsequentaccumulation in soils or sediments. To account for variation amongbiomes in phytolith C sequestration estimates due to differential vegeta-tion distribution and phytolith production in relevant plant types,we divided each continent into forest (including bamboo), grassland,wetland, cropland, tundra, and desert. We then used the relative arealextent and average phytolith production of each biome type whenpreliminarily calculating continental phytolith C sequestration (formore details see Appendix A).2. Materials and methods2.1. Productivity, phytolith and silica content dataFrom relevant published papers, we obtained ANPP data of herband/or tree litter (hereafter referred to as Si-rich tissues) for forests(Feng et al., 1999; Parr et al., 2010; Song et al., 2013a ), grasslands(Blecker et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2010; Melzer et al., 2010; Alexandre etal., 2011 ), and other biomes ( Li et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Song et al.,2013b )(Table 1 ). Forest ANPP in the form of wood and bark for ever-green and deciduous trees was excluded because the Si contributionto the soil pool from wood/bark is negligible compared to leaf biomass(Bartoli, 1983; Li et al., 2006 ); although note that because tropicalwoods often contain a lot of silica ( Amos, 1952; Welle, 1976 ), our esti-mates for tropical regions are conservative. Phytolith and silica contentdata were obtained from published monographs ( Hou, 1982; Xu et al.,1998 ) and papers ( Ding et al., 2008; Parr and Sullivan, 2011; Li et al.,2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Song et al., 2012a, 2013a, 2013b ).2.2. Estimation of phytolith and PhytOC contentsBecause the ratio of phytolith/silica for most plants is approximately1(Song et al., 2012a, 2013a, 2013b ), the phytolith content of plant bio-mass was estimated from silica content (weight % of plant dry biomass)(Table 2 ). As most ecosystems contain different plant functional typesand even more species, we arrived at one phytolith content value perecosystem using different phytolith content for different plant function-al types within those ecosystems and then averaged those based on es-timated relative ANPP for each plant functional type. Based on our ownmeasurements and data from 22 published papers (up to 199 datapoints, for more details see Appendix B), the C content of phytolithsmainly extracted by a microwave digestion method varies from 0.1%toN10%. Therefore, we used the average occluded C content inphytoliths of these relevant plants for each ecosystem as a preliminaryestimation due to the dif ﬁcult and extremely labor-intensive measuringof the PhytOC for all plants in different biomes. Based on the analysis ofthese data, we approximated the average PhytOC content as 2.36% for(sub-) tropical forest, 2.37% for temperate forest, 3.06% for boreal forest,1.85% for grassland (including tropical savanna and temperate steppe),1.59% for wetland, 4.21% for cropland, 2.67% for shrubland, and 1.5% forTable 1General information on global terrestrial biomes.Biomes Area (106ha) Above ground Si-rich tissues ANPP of Si-rich tissues(t ha−1yr−1)cReferencesForest(Sub)tropical forest 1949 Tree leaf litter and herb litter 6.95 1Temperate forest 810 Tree leaf litter and herb litter 6.09 1Boreal forest 1304 Tree leaf litter and herb litter 5.19 1Total or averagea4063 6.21GrasslandTropical savanna 2250 Herb litter 6.89 2–4Temperate steppe 1250 Herb litter 2.06 2,3,5,6Total or averageb3500 5.17Wetland 330 Herb litter 6.50 7,8Cropland 1533 Crop straw including sheath, stem and leaf 5.28 9Shrubland 250 Shrub leaf litter and herb litter 3.20 2,10Tundra 743 Shrub leaf litter, herb litter and moss litter 0.89 2,10Desert 1925 Shrub leaf litter and herb litter 0.42 2,10Total or averageb12,344 4.521Song et al., 2013a ;2Atjay et al., 1979 ;3Melzer et al., 2010 ;4Alexandre et al., 2011 ;5Blecker et al., 2006 ;6Song et al., 2012b ;7Guo et al., 2008 ;8Zong et al., 2011 ;9Song et al., 2013b ;10Olson et al., 2001 .aArea for different biomes based on Atjay et al.

Song et al. / Science of the Total Environment 603 –604 (2017) 502 –509tundra and desert ( Table 2 ). Note that whereas some studies reportedthat the C content in phytolith dry weight extracted using rapidH2SO4/H2O2digestion mainly ranges from 0.1% to 0.5% of phytolithdry weight ( Santos and Alexandre, 2017 ), the study of Parr andSullivan (2014) demonstrated that the C content in phytoliths extractedthrough modi ﬁed microwave digestion is at least one order of magni-tude higher. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) examination demonstrate that this variation is not due to insuf-ﬁcient decomposition of non-PhytOC fractions when using the modi ﬁedmicrowave digestion method but is more likely caused by the shatteringof phytoliths after rapid H2SO4/H2O2digestion ( Parr and Sullivan, 2014 ).For this reason, the PhytOC content values obtained from phytoliths ex-tracted via the modi ﬁed microwave digestion method should be consid-ered more reliable.2.3. Calculation of PhytOC production ﬂux and rateThe PhytOC production ﬂux, that is, the weight per area and timeunit of the carbon (in the form of CO2) sequestered as PhytOC(kg CO 2ha−1yr−1)(Table 2 ), can be calculated ( Song et al., 2013a )a s :PhytOC production flux ¼PhytOC content/C2ANPP of Si −rich tissues /C244=12 ð1Þwhere PhytOC content is the PhytOC concentration in the Si-rich tissuesof plants (% of dry weight), ANPP of Si-rich tissues is the dry-weightAboveground Net Primary Production of Si-rich tissues per unit area(kg ha−1yr−1)(Table 1 ), and 44/12 is the mass transfer coef ﬁcient ofCO2/C. Note that uncertainty estimates of PhytOC production ﬂux ac-count for uncertainties of phytolith content of plant biomass and carboncontent of phytoliths. See below for discussion.2.4. Estimation of phytolith stability factorAlthough a considerable percentage of biomass (10 –50%) may beharvested or consumed so that not all plant phytoliths return to thesoil, studies of biomes such as tropical forest ( Alexandre et al., 1997;Meunier et al., 1999 ), temperate forest ( Bartoli, 1983 ) and temperategrassland ( Blecker et al., 2006 ) show that soils contain 300 –1300times more phytoliths than the aboveground biomass. These valuesimply that most (ca. 80%) phytoliths have relatively intact surfacesand can be preserved in soils and sediments for 400 to 3000 years(Alexandre et al., 1997; Meunier et al., 1999; Blecker et al., 2006 ),though a subset of small or ﬂat phytolith particles may be preferentiallydissolved due to their high speci ﬁc surface area ( Meunier et al., 1999;Parr and Sullivan, 2005 ). While it is possible that some C from cellwall phytoliths may be quite labile and easily lost at an annual –decadalscale compared to C trapped in lumen phytoliths, which are likely to bemuch more stable at a centennial –millennial scale ( Perry et al., 1987 ),the stability of PhytOC should overall track the stability of the phytolithsin which it is contained. Therefore, we hypothesize that the stability andturnover time of PhytOC equal to those of phytoliths. The phytolith orPhytOC stability factor (PSF100) can thus be estimated from phytolithturnover time, which has been shown to increase with decreasing hu-midity and temperature ( Blecker et al., 2006 ) for a terrestrial biomeover 100 years (the time span of greatest concern in studies of C sinkprediction for our immediate future; Sitch et al., 2008 ), as:PSF100¼1−100=PhytOC turnover time¼1−100=phytolith turnover time ð2Þwhere phytolith turnover time (yr) is calculated as soil phytolith stor-age (g m−2) divided by plant phytolith production ﬂux (g m−2yr−1),assuming near steady state of the soil system.2.5. Calculation of phytolith C sink ﬂux and rateThe phytolith C sink ﬂux, that is, how much C occluded in phytolithsis stored in the soil (kg CO 2ha−1yr−1), can be estimated from PSF 100and PhytOC production ﬂux (Song et al., 2013a, 2013b ):Phytolith C sink flux ¼PSF 100/C2PhytOC production flux ð3Þwhere the PSF 100is given by Eq.

(3)andthe area is expressed as 106ha.3. Results3.1. Phytolith production in terrestrial biomesPhytolith content in above ground Si-rich tissues varies greatlyamong biomes (1.00 –10.37% of dry opal weight) ( Table 2 ). The phyto-lith content in grassland (weighted average 7.43 ± 2.35%) is 1.3 to 5.8times higher than that of other biomes. The phytolith content of grass-land and forest in the tropical zone is generally higher than that inother climatic zones ( Table 2 ). Based on the weighted average phytolithcontent (3.94 ± 1.78%) and ANPP (4.52 t ha−1yr−1) of global terrestrialbiomes (for more details see Tables 1, 2 ), the total phytolith productionrate in global terrestrial biomes (12,344 × 106ha) is estimated to be2198 ± 993 Tg yr−1(dry opal weight).3.2. Production and stability of PhytOC in terrestrial biomesThe average PhytOC production ﬂux for the seven biomes is 17.19 ±7.78 kg CO 2ha−1yr−1(Table 2 ). The PhytOC production ﬂux of crop-land is 3 to 100 times higher than that of (sub)tropical forest andother biomes ( Table 2 ). The stability of PhytOC (PSF 100) ranges from0.9 in dry grasslands to 0.6 in tropical rainforest ( Table 2 ). In particular,large differences are observed among biomes that vary in temperatureand humidity. For example, generally, PhytOC from biomes with lowtemperature and/or humidity such as tundra and desert is more stablethan that from other biomes.3.3. Phytolith C sequestration in terrestrial biomesThe phytolith C sequestration ﬂux variesfrom0.4±0.2kgCO 2ha−1yr−1for desert to 36.0 ± 24.0 kg CO 2ha−1yr−1for cropland, with an averageof 12.7 ± 7.4 kg CO 2ha−1yr−1(Table 3 ). According to Eq. (3)and thetotal distribution area of all global terrestrial biomes, the totalphytolith C sequestration rate of global terrestrial ecosystems is156.7 ± 91.6 Tg CO 2yr−1(Table 3 ). Grassland (40%), cropland (35%),and forest (20%) are the dominant contributing biomes to this phytolithC sequestration. Among continents, the largest phytolith C sequestra-tion rates occur in Asia (48.0 ± 28.8 Tg CO2yr−1), Africa (36.9 ±20.4 Tg CO 2yr−1) and South America (26.2 ± 16.3 Tg CO 2yr−1),which account for 31%, 24%, and 17% of the total global terrestrialPhytOC storage, respectively ( Fig. 1 ).4. Discussion4.1. Global phytolith C sink estimation and uncertaintiesOur total phytolith production rate in global terrestrial biomes(2198± 993 Tgyr−1dry opalweight) is lowerthan 84±29Tmol Si yr−1(equivalent to 5040 ± 1740 Tg yr−1dry opal weight) estimated byConley and Carey (2015) . The difference arises in part because, unlikethese authors, we assume no phytolith production in plant tissueswith low Si content such as roots, trunks, and branches of trees. Infact, these tissues may also produce some amount of phytoliths inmany tree taxa. For example, bark and wood of Douglas ﬁr(Pseudotsugamenziesii ), Norway spruce ( Picea abies), European beech ( Fagussylvatica )a n dO a k( Quercus sessili ﬂora) may produce, respectively,0.05%, 0.11%, 0.39% and 0.03% phytoliths per dry weight, though mostbiogenic Si (SiO2) are accumulated in the leaves/needles (1.13%, 0.97%,1.59 and 1.17, respectively) ( Cornelis et al., 2010 ). For (sub)tropical for-est, especially bamboo forest, the stem tissues (e.g., wood, bark) of treesoften contain a lot of silica ( Amos, 1952; Welle, 1976; Yang et al.,2015a ). Because we did not consider these additional reservoir of silicain this study, our estimation is conservative, particularly in (sub)tropicalregions. Furthermore, Conley and Carey (2015) presumed a Si contentof all primary production in terrestrial ecosystems of 1 –3% of dryweight, which may be an overestimate ( Epstein, 1994; Conley, 2002 ).In comparison, Hodson et al. (2005) compiled Si content of 735 plantspecies from 125 published studies and found an average value ofonly 0.92%. Recently, Yang et al. (2015b) also reported that the averageSi content of 108 plant species in forests of North China was only 0.42%.In addition, plants generally accumulate more silica as they get older(Motomura et al., 2002; Cornelis et al., 2010 ), a phenomenon that mayalso cause the observed difference. If the contribution of belowground(e.g., root, rhizome) and wood phytolith deposition is also considered,our values for phytolith C sequestration in soils would behigher —although not likely as high as Conley and Carey (2015) .Our phytolith C sink estimate is also associated with a higher uncer-tainty than that of Conley and Carey (2015) (48% and 34% of the esti-mate, respectively). Beyond uncertainty in the phytolith content ofplant biomass, the inexactness of our estimation stems from uncer-tainties in ANPP data of Si-rich tissues, C content of phytoliths and phy-tolith turnover time. As outlined above, our uncertainty calculations forTable 3Estimated current phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes.aBiomes Area (106ha) Phytolith C sequestration ﬂux(kg CO 2ha−1yr−1)Phytolith C sequestration rate(Tg CO2yr−1)mean SE mean SEForest(Sub)tropical forest 1949 9.0 7.4 17.5 14.4Temperate forest 810 4.8 3.8 3.9 3.1Boreal forest 1304 6.9 4.3 9.0 5.6Weighted average or subtotalb4063 7.5 5.7 30.3 23.0GrasslandTropical savanna 2250 25.3 12.2 57.0 27.5Temperate steppe 1250 7.0 1.7 8.8 2.1Weighted average or subtotalb3500 18.8 8.4 65.8 29.5Wetland 330 8.1 3.2 2.7 1.1Cropland 1533 36.0 24.0 55.2 36.8Shrubland 250 5.0 1.2 1.3 0.3Tundra 743 1.0 0.8 0.7 0.6Desert 1925 0.4 0.2 0.7 0.3Total weighted averageb12,344 12.7 7.4 156.7 91.6aPhytolith C sequestration contributed from belowground parts or wood is not considered in this study because phytoliths are considered to be mainly produced from the aboveground,photosynthetic parts of the biomes ( Parr et al., 2010; Parr and Sullivan, 2011 ).

Song et al. / Science of the Total Environment 603 –604 (2017) 502 –509PhytOC production ﬂux account for uncertainties of phytolith content ofplant biomass and C content of phytoliths, but do not include uncertain-ty in the estimates of ANPP of Si-rich tissues for global terrestrial bi-omes. Furthermore, we consider variation of phytolith turnover timeacross different climates, but do not consider difference of soil chemis-try, which is considered a less important factor at a global or regionalscale than climate ( Dove, 1995; Dove et al., 2008 ). A more realistic eval-uation of uncertainties would therefore be slightly larger than what wereport, but not substantially larger. Notwithstanding these uncer-tainties, our study presents the ﬁrst, relatively realistic approximationof phytolith C sink in global terrestrial biomes.Future work should focus on improving estimates of ANPP of Si-richtissues for global terrestrial biomes, phytolith content in roots, rhi-zomes, and wood as well as phytolith turnover time under differentsoil conditions to better constrain global phytolith C sink.4.2. Contribution of different ecosystems to global phytolith C sinkAt a global scale, the chief portion of phytolith C sequestration occursin grasslands, as a result of both the large global area and high phytolithC sequestration ﬂux of this biome ( Tables 1, 3 ;Blecker et al., 2006;Melzer et al., 2010; Song et al., 2012a ). In contrast, the contributionsfrom forest and cropland are mainly a result of, respectively, large area(Song et al., 2013a ) and high phytolith C sequestration ﬂux (Parr andSullivan, 2011; Song et al., 2013b )(Tables 1, 3 ). We also found large var-iation among different ecosystems within each major biome type(Table 3 ). For example, tropical savanna (57.0 Tg CO2yr−1)i sr e s p o n s i -ble for approximately 85% of the grassland phytolith C sequestration,and tropical/subtropical forest (17.5 Tg CO2yr−1)c o n t r i b u t e sN 55% ofphytolith C sequestration in forests overall, mainly due to high phytolithC sequestration ﬂux in these ecosystems (e.g. 25.3 kg CO2ha−1yr−1fortropical savanna in grassland biome type and 9.0 kg CO 2ha−1yr−1for(sub)tropical forest in forest biome type). We hypothesize that thelarge amounts of PhyOC stored in tropical savannas is the result ofhigh ANPP in many of these humid, ﬁre-adapted ecosystems and highphytolith content of tropical grasses ( Bond, 2008; Quigley andAnderson, 2014 ), despite higher rates of dissolution of phytoliths inwetter grassland soils compared to drier soils ( Blecker et al., 2006 ). Sim-ilarly, the high contribution of tropical/subtropical forests to forest phy-tolith C sequestration may be related to rapid plant growth (higherANPP) and generally higher aboveground Si storage ( Blecker et al.,2006 ). In particular, tropical/subtropical forests with abundant bamboohave much-elevated PhytOC ﬂux because of the very high phytolith pro-duction and rapid growth of these plants (leaf litter PhytOC productionﬂux for bamboo is 3 –80 times higher than for other forests; Song et al.,2013a ).4.3. Factors controlling continental difference of phytolith C sinkAfrica has the highest PhytOC sequestration rate of all continents,despite having 2/3 of the area of Asia. This pattern is almost entirelylinked to exceptionally high phytolith C storage ﬂux in tropical savanna,where both the overwhelming dominance of grasses (Poaceae) andsedges (Cyperaceae) and the rapid growth and high ANPP of, aboveall, savanna grasses promote high phytolith input into the soils(Melzer et al., 2010 ). The relatively high phytolith C sequestration ratein South America is similarly associated with high PhytOC ﬂuxes in sa-vanna and tropical forest ( Blecker et al., 2006 ;Fig. 1 ). In contrast, Asiahas a relatively low area-weighted PhytOC ﬂux (Fig. 1 ), likely tied tothe large areal fraction of temperate and boreal forests ( Pan et al.,2011; Song et al., 2012a ), as well as temperate steppes ( Song et al.,2013b ), all of which have relatively low ﬂux values ( Song et al., 2012a,2013a; Yang et al., 2015b ). Its large phytolith C storage results mainlyfrom its overall vast area, which also includes biomes with high phyto-lith C sequestration ﬂuxes (e.g., bamboo-dominated forests; Parr et al.,2010 ).Fig. 1. Phytolith C sink rate and ﬂux in terrestrial ecosystems from different continents. a: Asia, b: Europe, c: Africa, d: North America, e: South America, f: Oceania.506 Z. Song et al. / Science of the Total Environment 603 –604 (2017) 502 –5094.4. Signi ﬁcance and potential of global phytolith C sequestrationThe carbon in phytoliths is highly resistant to decomposition andmay accumulate in soil pro ﬁles for several thousands of years ( Parrand Sullivan, 2005 ), and, in buried soil pro ﬁles, for millions of years(e.g., Strömberg, 2011 ). The accumulation of PhytOC in soils is slow onan annual –decadal scale, but is prominent at a centennial –millennialscale ( Fig. 3 ). The large C sequestration in the global pool of phytolithsindicated by our analysis therefore supports the idea that the biogeo-chemical silica cycle contributes vitally to the global carbon cycle (seealsoConley and Carey, 2015 ).Furthermore, because phytoliths are formed in plants and subse-quently incorporated into the soil, it seems possible that vegetationmanagement such as rational fertilization could not only recover de-graded ecosystems but also substantially increase the size of the globalC sink; this in turn would help to offset increases in atmospheric CO 2(Song et al., 2013a, 2013b; Zhao et al., 2015 ). Our calculations indicatethat phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial ecosystems, contrib-uted mainly from grassland, forest and cropland, could be roughly dou-bled from the current 156.7 ± 91.6 Tg CO 2yr−1by the end of the 21stcentury through strategic management plans for these ecosystems(Fig. 2 ;Tables 3, 4 ).In forests, economically-driven management practices such as care-fully managed afforestation/reforestation and regular harvesting ofbamboos with elevated leaf litter PhytOC production ﬂux (e.g.,Phyllostachys pubescens, Zhou et al., 2011 ) may signi ﬁcantly augmentphytolith C sequestration ( Song et al., 2013a ). It has been suggestedthat the area currently covered by bamboo globally could increasefrom 25 × 106ha to 100 × 106ha (~3% of world's forests) in the nextfew decades ( Zhou et al., 2011; Song et al., 2013a ), a change thatcould signi ﬁcantly boost the PhytOC ﬂuxes for subtropical forests onseveral continents. These practices in combination with other measuresfor increasing bamboo shoot production such as input of external Sifrom silicate rock powder amendment and organic mulching ( Huanget al., 2014 ) may further boost bamboo PhytOC production ﬂux from81.6 ± 7.1 to N300 kg CO2ha−1yr−1(Parr et al., 2010; Song et al.,2013a ). Using a median PhytOC production ﬂux of bamboo(300 kg CO 2ha−1yr−1)(Parr et al., 2010 ), a hypothesized expansionof the world's bamboo area from 25 × 106to 100 × 106ha over thenext few decades ( Zhou et al., 2011; Song et al., 2013a ), and a PSF 100of 0.6 ± 0.1 ( Table 2 ), the phytolith C sink in global bamboo forestscan be preliminarily estimated at 18.6 ± 4.0 Tg CO 2yr−1.T h e s ecalculations suggest that, with the appropriate management, the phyto-lith carbon sink in forests globally could theoretically increase from30.3 ± 23.0 to 47.1 ± 27.0 Tg CO 2yr−1by the end of the 21st century(Fig. 2 ).Similarly, sustainable grassland management such as controlledgrazing and ﬁre could signi ﬁcantly increase biomass production and Siuptake, thus enhance phytolith C sequestration in the prominently phy-tolith-producing grasses and sedges that dominate these ecosystems(Song et al., 2012a ). Indeed, Melzer et al. (2010) estimated that expand-ed grazing and more frequent ﬁres could enhance grass biomass pro-duction/phytolith production by as much as 50 –100% in tropicalgrasslands. Furthermore, practices for recovery of degraded grasslandsunder drought stress such as N and Si fertilization ( Eneji et al., 2008;Zhao et al., 2015 ) may increase biomass production and/or Si content.For example, it has been reported that Si fertilization may have aug-mented biomass yields by 205% for Rhodes grass under de ﬁcient irriga-tion conditions ( Eneji et al., 2008 ). Combined, these approaches couldbe expected to roughly double phytolith C sequestration in grasslandsby the end of the 21st century ( Fig. 2 ).Finally, global croplands have a high potential for storing morePhytOC. The phytolith C sequestration in global cropland has tripledsince 1961 mainly as a result of cropland expansion, fertilization, and ir-rigation ( Song et al., 2013b ). Measures designed to increase food pro-duction, such as enhancement of cereal area and percentage incroplands, more rotation of crops, and reasonable fertilization and irri-gation would likely also increase overall biomass production and, linkedto that, Si uptake by plants. Given that cereals such as rice, wheat, andcorn have higher PhytOC production ﬂuxes than other crops ( Parr andSullivan, 2011; Song et al., 2013b ), such practices would therefore en-hance cropland phytolith C sequestration. Ongoing work to facilitatecrop adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses such as genetic engineer-ing ( Jansson et al., 2010 ) and Si fertilization ( L i ue ta l . ,2 0 1 4 ), couldalso signi ﬁcantly augment the cropland phytolith C sink. For example,it has been estimated that the global phytolith C sequestration in crop-lands could reach approximately 2600 Tg CO2yr−1through increasedphytolith production if all crops in the world were geneticallyengineered ( Jansson et al., 2010 ). Although it constitutes an extremecase, this assessment implies that, even if only 1 –2% of crops were ge-netically engineered, in combination with other measures, an additional52 Tg CO2yr−1could with certainty be sequestrated in croplandphytoliths. Therefore, through scienti ﬁc management, phytolith C se-questration in croplands globally could be expected to increase from55.2 ± 36.8 to 165.5 ± 110.3 Tg CO2yr−1by the end of the 21st century(Fig. 2 ).Taking the present and potential global terrestrial phytolith C se-questration rates to be, respectively, 156.7 ± 91.6 Tg CO 2yr−1and349.5 ± 198.7 Tg CO 2yr−1(Fig. 2 ), we preliminarily estimate the totalterrestrial phytolith C sequestration during 2000 –2099 to 15.7 –35.0 Pg CO 2, which corresponds to 25 –110% of conservative estimateof total land uptake or 1 –5% of average estimate of total land uptake(Sitch et al., 2008 )(Fig. 3 ). As large uncertainties of total land uptake es-timate are associated with complex responses of vegetation to changingsoil moisture status and elevated temperatures ( Sitch et al., 2008 )a n dselection of different models and future CO2emission scenarios, wethink that the preliminary estimate is reasonable.4.5. ImplicationsThe projected global terrestrial phytolith C sequestration is equiva-lent in magnitude to the burial of diatom –Si bound carbon ( Tréguer etal., 1995; Montagnes and Franklin, 2001 )a n dC O 2consumption throughsilicate weathering ( Gaillardet et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2016 ;Fig. 3 ).Therefore, the phytolith C sink and other mechanisms related to thecoupled biogeochemical cycles of Si and C, such as diatom C sequestra-tion and CO 2consumption during silicate weathering could be exploredin tandem as complementary means to stably sequestrate atmosphericFig. 2. The present and potential phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes. Theincrease in potential relative to current phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrialbiomes is the result of application of strategic management of forest, grassland, andcropland biomes ( Table 4 ).507 Z. Song et al. / Science of the Total Environment 603 –604 (2017) 502 –509CO2in the future. Furthermore, ecosystem-level feedback mechanismsin the Si cycle and phytolith C sequestration in response to differentmanagement practices (e.g., ﬁre, grazing, or Si fertilization), and in par-ticular how these responses might depend on climatic and soil condi-tions are not fully understood and need to be further researchedbefore strategic management of biogeochemical C sequestration canbe implemented.5. ConclusionsWe estimate that the total phytolith C sequestration in global terres-trial biomes is 156.7 ± 91.6 Tg CO2yr−1, with grassland, forest, andcropland as the dominant producers of phytolith-based C. Practicessuch as bamboo afforestation/reforestation and grassland recovery foreconomic and ecological purposes could theoretically double theabove phytolith C sink, which is equivalent in magnitude to the C se-questration of oceanic diatoms in sediments and through silicateweathering. Studies using terrestrial biogeochemical models shouldseek to more explicitly incorporate plant-soil Si-C cycling modules tobetter constrain global biogeochemical C sequestration.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.107 .AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for support from the National Natural Science Foun-dation of China (Grant No. 41522207, 41571130042, 41130536), theField Frontier Project of Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy ofSciences (2045200295), and the National Science Foundation grant(EAR-1253713 to C.A.E.S.).

A comparison of cumulative phytolith, diatom and silicate weathering C uptakeindicated as a percentage of average and conservative estimate of total land uptakeduring 2000 –2099. Land uptakes are the average and minimum net cumulative organicC sequestration in plants and soils for this time period estimated by Sitch et al. (2008) .For total global terrestrial phytolith C sequestration estimation during 2000 –2099, theaverage of the present and potential global terrestrial phytolith C sequestration ﬂuxes(Fig. 2 ) was used. Diatom C uptake here refers only of burial of diatom-Si bound C oncentury time scales excluding short-term biological C pump of diatoms as the carbonstorage in living diatoms is similar to carbon storage in phytoliths in living plant tissueand that is not what we're considering in this study. Oceanic diatom C uptake wasestimated from the net diatom burial ﬂux of 6.1 ± 2.0 Tmol yr−1(Tréguer et al., 1995 )and average C content in diatoms of 10% ( Montagnes and Franklin, 2001 ).
