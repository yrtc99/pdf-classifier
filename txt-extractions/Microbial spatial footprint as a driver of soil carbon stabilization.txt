ARTICLEMicrobial spatial footprint as a driver of soilcarbon stabilizationA.N. Kravchenko1,2,3, A.K. Guber1,2, B.S. Razavi4, J. Koestel5, M.Y. Quigley1, G.P. Robertson1,2,6&Y. Kuzyakov3,7,8Increasing the potential of soil to store carbon (C) is an acknowledged and emphasizedstrategy for capturing atmospheric CO 2. Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretioninclude reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plantdiversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggestingthat our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insuf ﬁcient. Here we use aunique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping todemonstrate for the ﬁrst time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major,hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to theatmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of30–150µm pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzymeactivities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint thatmicroorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.Corrected: Author Correctionhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 OPEN1Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.2DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center,Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.3Department of Agricultural Soil Science, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.4Department ofSoil and Plant Microbiome, Institute of Phytopathology, Christian-Albrecht-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.5Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Uppsala, Sweden.6W.

Various land manage-ment practices are known to build soil C. These practices includereducing soil disturbance4,5, increasing quantity of plant biomassadded to soil6, and increasing plant diversity7,8, and perenni-ality9,10. All aim at the two key components necessary to achieveC gains: boosting new C addtions11,12and enhancing physicalprotection of the newly added C11-13.However, abundant unexplained examples of these practicesworking in some but not other circumstances signal that ourunderstanding is incomplete14. For example, row crop systemswith cover crops can accumulate C even in presence of aggressivetillage15,16, and some perennial bioenergy systems such asswitchgrass ( Panicum virgatum ) can be slow to increase soil Cdespite large below ground C inputs and the lack of soil dis-turbance9,17. Such discrepancies suggest a substantial knowledgegap with respect to the plant-soil-microbial interactions that drivesoil C accretion. This de ﬁciency is unfortunate, since strategies foreffective soil C accrual can only be ef ﬁciently developed with a fullunderstanding of the underlying controlling mechanisms.Whether soil C will be gained or lost stems from the balancebetween microbial decomposition of new C inputs and protectionof new C, either as plant-derived or microbially processed com-pounds18, within the soil matrix. Majority of the fresh organicmatter inputs comes from plants, i.e., above ground litter andespecially roots19,20, and is subsequently utilized by the microbialcommunity to produce CO 2and decomposition inter-mediates21,22. Intermediate products can escape further decom-position by forming organo-mineral associations with soil mineralsurfaces, or by entrapment in small soil pores where they becomeinaccessible to microorganisms and their exoenzymes23,24.S u c haspects of soil C balance as sizes and chemical composition of Cinputs19,20, their microbial processing25, and strength of thephysical protection due to soil textural26,27and structural28,29characteristics have been extensively studied and well understood.Yet, a crucial element kept escaping the research focus: the needfor new C to be transported from the micro-sites of its entryand initial processing to the micro-sites where it can be protectedfrom further decomposition. Most studies implicitly assume thatC processing and protection are spatially collocated. We suggestthat processing and protection take place in different micro-sitesof the soil matrix. The need for the new C to be transported to theprotective sites prior to protection to occur is the currentlyoverlooked underlying cause for the mentioned above dis-crepancies in expected and realized C gains.Transport in soil occurs via pores, which are conduits for gases,water, nutrients, and dissolved organic C, and are habitats formicroorganisms30,31. Here we provide novel evidence thatdevelopment of pores of certain sizes can have a controlling effecton C accrual. Pores in the 30 –150 µm radius size range may beespecially important32because they function as likely routes of O 2inﬂux33,34and localities of new C inputs from ﬁne plant roots35.Their special role is evidenced by greater microbial activity36–39,higher abundance of diverse taxa40, and presence of dissolvedorganic matter enriched in lipids and depleted in lignin41,42.We hypothesize that the abundant presence of such pores,along with ample, fresh C inputs and able microbial communities,is necessary for prompt C accrual. We posit that high abundanceof such pores contribute to C accrual in a multi-prong fashion.Speci ﬁcally, they in ﬂuence in ﬂux of fresh C inputs, affect activitiesof microbial decomposers by modifying their habitats, and opti-mize conditions for transport of microbial decomposition pro-ducts into protective soil matrix. Non-invasive X-ray computedmicro-tomography (µCT) scanning supplies detailed 3Dinformation regarding the material density distribution withinintact soil samples. Hence it is very well suited to outline thelocations and geometry of soil pores, promoting, in turn,understanding of chemical and biological processes taking placewithin the soil pore space43,44. We studied soils from ﬁve repli-cated bioenergy cropping systems, established in 2008, to repre-sent a gradient of plant biodiversity45. The ﬁve systems consist oftwo monocultures differing in perenniality, namely continuouscorn ( Zea mays L.) and switchgrass, a two-species system ofcontinuous corn with a winter rye ( Secale cereale L.) cover crop,and two systems with high plant diversity, i.e., poplars ( Populussp. hybrid) with an herbaceous understory and a native succes-sional community abandoned from agriculture in 2008. Weevaluated cropping system effects on the soil volume in thevicinity of ≥30 µm radii pores, which serves as an indicator of thesize of the spatial in ﬂuence generated by the microorganismsresiding in such pores. Using the new approach of in situzymography we assessed micro-scale spatial patterns in the dis-tribution of six extracellular enzymes representing microbialactivities related to C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling.Then, combining information from 2D zymography and 3D µCTscanning, we localized associations between microbial substrateutilization, as re ﬂected in enzyme activities, and the abundance ofsoil pores.Our results suggest that pores with 30 –150 µm radii containthe most active microorganisms capable of responding rapidly tofresh C inputs and thus, of producing the greatest amounts ofmicrobially processed C products. These products are importantcontributors to soil organic matter accumulation13,46. Once theymove into the adjacent soil matrix, they stabilize there via variousphysico-chemical mechanisms. The greater the presence of30–150 µm pores and their spread throughout the soil, the greaterthe volume of the soil matrix receiving and protecting the pro-ducts of microbial decomposition, and subsequently the highersoil C accrual. Greater plant diversity stimulates development of30–150 µm pores and such stimulation is a previously unknownmechanism by which ecosystems with diverse plant communitiesenhance soil C accrual.ResultsEffects of cropping systems on soil C accrual and soil pores .W ecollected disturbed soil samples and undisturbed samples, refer-red to as intact cores, at a replicated ﬁeld experiment in southwestMichigan, USA. The studied cropping systems were in-place for 9years, an experimental duration regarded as typically suf ﬁcient fordetecting soil C changes47. Intact soil cores were subjected to X-ray µCT scanning, followed by pore characterization from 3Dimages (Supplementary Fig. 1).Consistent with previous reports from this site9,o ft h e ﬁvecropping systems only the two systems with high plant diversity,poplar and native succession, resulted in higher levels of total soilC (Fig. 1a). Lower C levels were observed in continuous corn withand without cover crops and in the switchgrass system. Short-termrespiration, an indicator of labile C, followed the same pattern asthe soil organic C and was lower in corn and switchgrass than inthe native succession system (Supplementary Fig. 2). However,microbial biomass C in switchgrass system was signi ﬁcantly higherthan that of continuous corn and not different from that of poplarand native succession systems (Fig. 1a). Belowground primaryproductivity of the two perennial herbaceous systems, switchgrassand native succession, was similar at the start of the experiment in2009; however, 3 –4 years later, monoculture switchgrass exceedednative succession by 10 –20 fold (Fig. 1b).We assessed the volume of the soil matrix that was in closeproximity to ≥30 µm pores (Fig. 2a), that is, within <180 µmARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-42 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3121 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications2009 2010 2011 2012 20130500Belowground primary productivity, g m–2100015002000Native succession Switchgrassb* * *** ***0.51.01.52.0Soil organic C, %0100Microbial biomass C, µg C g–1 soil200300400aContinuous cornContinuous corn withcoverSwitchgrass Poplar Native successionaaAabBbcBcBFig. 1 Soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and belowground primary productivity in soil of the studied cropping systems 9 years after their implementation .aAverage soil organic C (gray) and microbial biomass C (red) for ﬁve studied systems (5 –10 cm soil depth).

Each core contained 8 –16 slices, and, in most of the cores, zymograms of each enzyme were obtained on two slices per core. cAmembrane saturated with an enzyme-speci ﬁc substrate was placed on the surface of each slice and a zymogram was obtainedNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3121 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3distance from the pore boundaries. The 180 µm distance was usedas an approximate indicator of a soil volume potentially affectedby processes taking place within the pores and its value wasselected as consistent with spatial patterns in microbial and Cdistributions observed in soil matrixes at similar experimentalscales30,48. A much smaller portion of the soil matrix incontinuous corn and switchgrass was in the vicinity of thesepores as compared to poplar and successional soils (Fig. 3). Morespeciﬁcally, the proportion of the soil matrix located close to suchpores in native succession and poplar systems exceeded that inswitchgrass by 51% and 67%, respectively. Total porosity in thepoplar and native succession systems differed considerably fromthe others (Fig. 3). Since prior to 2008 the experimental sitebelonged to an agricultural ﬁeld with common land use andmanagement history, the observed differences are solely a productof contrasting root activities during the last 9 years.Associations between enzyme activities and soil pores . AfterµCT scanning, the intact soil cores were subjected to 2D zymo-graphy. Combining zymograms from >130 soil slices of intact soilcores with 3D X-ray µCT images provided a unique opportunity toassociate enzyme activities with pores of different sizes (Fig. 2b, c).Spatial associations of enzyme activities with soil poressubstantially differed between the poplar and successionalsystems versus the continuous corn and switchgrass systems(Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). Enzyme activities in soils ofsuccessional systems were the same in regions with prevalence of<30 µm and 30 –150 µm pores, while in poplars the activitiesassociated with prevalence of <30 µm exceeded those in theregions with prevalence of 30 –150 µm pores. In contrast, in bothcorn systems and in switchgrass, the enzyme activities were muchlower in the regions dominated by <30 µm pores than in theregions dominated by 30 –150 µm pores. This effect wasparticularly strong in switchgrass soils, and was observed for allstudied enzymes except cellobiohydrolase (Supplementary Fig. 3).In all systems the lowest activities were associated with very large(>180 µm) pores.Notwithstanding differences in enzyme activities among poresizes, soil enzyme activities from disturbed samples were notmuch different among the systems (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thesystems differed only in acid phosphatase activity, which was thehighest in the native succession soil and the lowest incontinuous corn.Enzyme activities and soil pores after addition of fresh C .T oaddress our expectation that 30 –150 µm pores harbor activemicrobial communities capable of processing fresh C inputs, wealso conducted zymography measurements after soil cores wereincubated with fresh plant litter (Supplementary Fig. 1d).Zymography after incubation of soils with fresh plant littershowed more pronounced contrast in spatial associations betweenenzyme activities and soil pores compared to soil without fresh C(Fig. 4b). The enzyme activity increased in response to fresh Cadditions especially in the areas with 30 –150 µm pores as com-pared to those with greater abundance of the smaller pores.DiscussionNine years of implementing cropping systems with different plantspecies diversities led to the formation of contrasting soil poresize distributions49. The more diverse systems, i.e., poplar andnative succession, developed higher soil porosity (Fig. 3) and agreater presence of 60 –150 µm pores49and had concomitantlyhigher soil C contents (Fig. 1a). The systems with low plantdiversity, i.e., continuous corn with and without cover crops andswitchgrass, had no pore increases and did not experience soil Cgains. In the latter three systems greater enzyme activities wereassociated with 30 –150 µm pores (Fig. 4a). Yet, soil underswitchgrass acquired signi ﬁcantly higher microbial biomass thancontinuous corn, comparable to that of poplar and native suc-cession systems (Fig. 1a).Theﬁnding that greater presence of pores bene ﬁts C accrualdoes appear paradoxical. However, it actually re ﬂects a previouslyunrecognized micro-scale spatial interaction between physicaland microbiological contributors to soil C sequestration. We positthat in soils with fewer 30 –150 µm pores, microbial communitieshave a smaller spatial footprint, which we de ﬁne as the volume ofthe soil matrix that can be immediately in ﬂuenced by microbialdecomposition products. A smaller footprint implies a smallersoil volume for entombing microbial decomposition products50.We propose the following conceptual model integrating thismechanism in the existing concept of plant-soil-microbial inter-actions (Fig. 5): Plant roots are the key agents in formation of soilpore architecture. Pores in 30 –150 µm size range are the pre-ferential locations of new C inputs and active microbial com-munities, where active processing of C inputs takes place. Thegreater the volume of the soil matrix in contact with such pores,the greater is the potential for microbial decomposition productsto be transported to and be protected within the soil matrixinaccessible to microbial decomposers. Plant systems that sti-mulate creation of such pores enhance opportunities for micro-bial decomposition products to reach inaccessible soil matrix andthus stimulate C gains. Below we provide the evidence from thecurrent study and published literature in support of the proposedconcept.A signi ﬁcant body of research supports the notion that pores inthe range of tens-of-µm play an outsized role in C processing.Pores of this size demonstrate faster organic matter decomposi-tion, greater presence of labile organic compounds, and highermicrobial abundances36–42. The special role of pores of this sizerange is driven by two factors. First, they are likely preferentiallocations of ﬁne roots, typically ~30 µm. Fine roots are covered byroot hairs contributing to rhizodeposition and have maximalexudation rates. Stable isotope analysis showed that these poresindeed receive and process large amounts of fresh C inputs51.Second, these pores possess optimal micro-environmental con-ditions in terms of water and oxygen supply to resident microbial010203040Total porosity, %0102030Soil matrix in pore vicinity, %ContinuouscornContinuouscorn withcoverSwitchgrassPoplarNativesuccessionAB A A C BCFig. 3 Soil pore characteristics of the studied cropping systems 9 years aftertheir implementation.

Smaller pores tend to have longer periods ofanoxia52and larger pores tend to have longer periods of watershortage53. Higher enzyme activities associated with 30 –150 µmpores (Fig. 4) con ﬁrm that these pores provide micro-environmental conditions optimal for microbial functioningand also harbor active microbial communities capable of a speedyresponse to new C inputs.Ourﬁndings suggest that the ability of root systems to generatesuch pores can be a decisive factor in producing soil C gains. Theroots of the two more diverse cropping systems, i.e., poplars andnative succession, which quickly accumulated high levels of soilC, apparently stimulated the formation of ≥30 µm pores49. Onceformation was initiated, these pores became, ﬁrst, the locations ofenhanced microbial activity and intensive processing of new Cinputs; and second, the major source of microbially processed Cthat diffused into and became physico-chemically protectedwithin the surrounding soil matrix by forming associations withmineral surfaces which protected them from further decom-position11,13. High abundance of such pores ensured a largeproportion of the soil matrix in close proximity to activemicrobial communities as represented by the percent of soilmatrix located within 180 µm of the nearest ≥30 µm pore (Fig. 3).The switchgrass system with its low abundance of 30 –150 µmpores49, exceptionally high belowground biomass production(Fig. 1b), and a surprising lack of C gains (Fig. 1a; SupplementaryFig. 1) epitomizes the importance of this mechanism. Theswitchgrass system is very similar to poplar and native succes-sional vegetation in terms of possessing all the componentsknown to be necessary for rapid and extensive soil C accrual. As aperennial system, switchgrass management does not involveannual tillage; its belowground production is massive54andgreatly exceeds that of the native succession vegetation (Fig. 1b).Switchgrass soils have highly diverse microbial communities, withmicrobial biomass (Fig. 1a) and bacterial diversity indices greatlyexceeding those in the continuous corn system and similar tothose in poplar and native succession55. Fungal biomass in theswitchgrass soils likewise exceeds that of corn and is similar topoplar and native succession56, and greater fungal abundance istypically associated with greater C accrual13. The production ofﬁne roots in switchgrass is also comparable to that of the nativesuccession system57. The switchgrass system was in place for nineyears, a suf ﬁcient time for changes in soil C to take place47. Yeteven labile soil C fractions, which typically indicate comingchanges in total soil C did not increase under switchgrass (Sup-plementary Fig. 1 and ref.9). It should be noted that these resultsare not unique to the current study. While the conversion ofannual cropland to switchgrass often leads to soil C gains58,59,n oor slow increases in soil C concentrations under switchgrass aswell as high variability in observed C gains60have also beenreported, including diverse experimental sites in North Dakota,South Dakota, and Nebraska61, southeastern US62, and northernItaly17.In soils under switchgrass, high root C inputs63stimulatedmicrobial activity, but in the absence of a suf ﬁcient abundance of30–150 µm pores, most of this C was apparently oxidized to CO 2rather than entombed as organo-mineral associations in thenearby soil matrix. While the 30 –150 µm pores in switchgrass soilwere the sites of intensive enzyme activities and C processing(Fig. 4), the volume of the soil matrix adjacent to such pores wasrelatively small (Fig. 3). Thus, the pore-adjacent layer likelybecame quickly saturated with microbial C inputs, with limiteddiffusion farther from the pores. This is consistent with obser-vations of Chenu et al.36who noted that once a new C source wasapplied to the surface of soil aggregates it was actively microbiallyconsumed in situ with only small amounts diffusing into aggre-gate centers. A large volume of soil matrix, with high potential forC physico-chemical protection, therefore remained unutilized,not receiving C, and resulting in overall low soil C levels. Indeed,in switchgrass soil intensive microbial processing and C turnoverhave been demonstrated in a number of13C isotope based stu-dies64–67. It can be surmised that the new C inputs were eitherfully decomposed and lost as CO 2or lost as dissolved organic Cduring convective ﬂow events.Developed differences in soil pore characteristics betweenmonoculture switchgrass and biodiverse poplar and native suc-cession systems could be a result of several physical and biologicalfactors. A potential physical factor is a difference in water usageby plant communities. Systems where soils experience greaterdrying in summer would be expected to have a greater presenceof large pores (cracks) due to soil shrinkage. This phenomenon iscommonly observed in soils with high clay contents (2:1), butstill, though to a lesser extent, is present in sandy loam soils.Systems with greater soil moisture levels prior to soil freezing inwinter would be expected to develop greater pore presence due tomore extensive soil expansion during freezing/thawing cycles.However, experimental evidence suggests that in our systemsthese physical mechanisms could be only minor contributors tothe observed pore differences, especially so since the studied soilsdo not contain signi ﬁcant amounts of shrink-swell clays. Over theyears, soil water content under poplars, with its greater poreabundances, tended to differ from that in the other systems(Supplementary Fig. 5). However the observed tendency wasactually disadvantageous to pore formation via wetting-dryingand freezing-thawing mechanisms mentioned above, becausepoplar soil tended to be more moist in spring and summer, anddrier in fall prior to soil freezing.Biological factors are thus likely to dominate. Differences inroot architecture, including root density, diameter, strength, ﬁneroot biomass and mycorrhization, are well known to affect soilporosity68–70; and amounts and compositions of root exudatesare likewise affected by root characteristics63. Systems withgreater plant diversity have a greater variety of root architectureswith correspondingly different effects on porosity. Moreover, inthe systems with no soil disturbance and low plant diversity thereuse of the old root channels by the new plant roots is morelikely71,72, further reducing possibilities for new pore formations.Overall, our results point to a heretofore missing link inunderstanding plant-soil-microbial interactions. Plant commu-nity composition de ﬁnes not only the composition of the soilmicrobial community, but, by affecting presence and character-istics of soil pores, it also de ﬁnes spatial distribution patterns ofregions where the microorganisms can most effectively reside andfunction as related to C turnover and sequestration. That patternthen de ﬁnes the spatial footprint that microorganisms can makeon the surrounding soil matrix. For soil C processing the size ofthis footprint translates into the size of the soil volume involvedin the protection of microbially-processed C inputs.Our ﬁnding was enabled by comparisons between a mono-culture switchgrass and biodiverse native succession and poplarsystems ̶the systems that possessed great similarities in all theirfeatures except for pore characteristics. Very high inputs of freshC in the switchgrass system made the effects of pore presence onmicrobial functioning especially pronounced and their detectionpossible using 2D zymography and X-ray µCT tools. We surmisethat similar considerations are applicable to the no-till continuouscorn systems of this study, where small microbial footprint isprobably one of the contributors to their low C levels.Our work demonstrates how better understanding of micro-scale interactions between plants, microorganisms, and soilcharacteristics can have a direct impact on macro-scale (land-scape) features of terrestrial ecosystems, i.e., accrual of soil C, andhow it can lead to new strategies in sustainable agriculturalARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-46 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3121 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsmanagement. A potential strategy is the maximization of rootdiversity as a prerequisite of ef ﬁcient C accrual, which can beachieved by planting more diverse switchgrass stands, promotingdiverse understory in poplar plantations, and intensively usingpolyculture cover crops in row crop systems.MethodsField experiment . The Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) experi-ment had been established in 2008 at Kellogg Biological Station ’s Long-termEcological Research Site, Michigan, USA on well-drained Al ﬁsols73. Soil textureconsists of 65% sand, 27% silt, and 8% clay. The ﬁeld experiment is a randomizedcomplete block design with ﬁve replications45. The ﬁve bioenergy land use andmanagement system are: no-till continuous corn and no-till continuous corn withwinter cover crop of cereal rye, a monoculture switchgrass, a hybrid poplar(Populus nigra ×P. maximowiczii NM6) with herbaceous understory9, and an earlysuccessional community abandoned from agriculture in 2008. The experimentalsite was plowed prior to establishment and no further plowing was conducted ineither of the systems. All systems were managed using local best agronomicpractices45.Two intact soil cores (5 cm Ø × 5 cm height) were collected from four replicatedplots of each bioenergy system for a total of 40 cores in early spring 2017. The soilcores were taken using a soil core sampler (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp.) into anacrylic cylinder located within the sampler. The sampler had two rings, 5-cm heighteach, and soil from the ﬁrst ring was discarded. Thus, the cores were collectedprecisely from 5 –10 cm depth within the soil pro ﬁle. A disturbed soil sample andan additional soil core for bulk density measurement were also collected from eachsampling location. Bulk density was measured for each sampling location using thecore method74and is reported in ref.49. Soil temperatures were around 5 °C at thetime of sampling and soil water content levels were around ﬁeld capacity. Duringthe time period prior to the zymography measurements the cores were kept in adark at 4 °C, except for times of shipping and during µCT scanning. To preservethe cores during shipping each core was tightly closed on both ends with ridged foilcaps and wrapped in several layers of plastic using duct tape. The disturbedsamples were stored air-dried.X-ray computed µCT scanning and image analysis . Intact soil cores were sub-jected to X-ray scanning using a GE Phoenix v|tome|x m scanner at the Institute ofSoil and Environment at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences inUppsala, as described in ref.49. In brief, the X-ray scanner was equipped with a240 kV tube, a tungsten target and a 16´´ ﬂat panel detector with 2014 × 2014detector crystals (GE DRX250RT). Each 3D X-ray µCT image was reconstructedfrom 2000 projections, with a tube voltage of 130 kV and an electron current of200 µA. No optical ﬁlters were used. Soil cores were scanned inside their acrylicrings. Beam hardening artefacts were not observed. 3D µCT X-ray images werereconstructed using the ﬁltered back-projection approach (GE software datos|x).The entire soil core, including the acrylic cylinder, was scanned. Each image had avoxel size of 29 µm in x, y and z direction.Two examples of the scanned images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a, b.The image processing was conducted using ImageJ/Fiji software. The same imageprocessing procedures were applied to soil samples from all studied systems.Preprocessing consisted of a 3D median ﬁlter with a radius of two voxels in alldirections using Median 3D ﬁlter tool from ImageJ. After that we removed 0.5 cmborder parts around each core to avoid artifacts associated with sample wall effects.For segmenting the images into pores and non-pores we used the minimumerror approach75on the respective image histograms. The grayscale histograms (8-bit) of all soil cores exhibited a two-distribution pattern, with one distributioncorresponding to air +liquid and the other to solid portions of the images. Thus,following ref.76, the two-Gaussian ﬁts were applied to the histograms. Thethreshold was computed as a greyscale value that minimized the difference betweenthe overlapping areas of the two distributions. This approach conserves the voxelbalance between the two segmented phases (solid and air +liquid). The necessarycomputations were performed in the Regression Wizard tool of the SigmaPlotsoftware (Systat Software, Inc). The segmentations were conducted separately foreach soil core.Then, visible pores ( ≥30 µm) were obtained using the Xlib plugin for ImageJ77.We used the continuous 3D pore-size distribution option of the software, whichprovides radii of the largest spheres, that ﬁt into the 3D pore volume, as describedin detail in ref.77. Therefore, the pore size at a speci ﬁc location was de ﬁned as theradius of the maximally inscribable sphere at this location. Particulate organicmatter, including plant roots, in the images was identi ﬁed as described in ref.49and in further analyses particulate organic matter was separated from pore andsolid fractions. Pore-size distribution data from the studied cores are reported inref.49.As a measure of the soil matrix fraction that was potentially affected by Cprocessing taking place within the visible pores ( ≥30 µm), we used the soil matrixvolume located within 180 µm distance from these pores (Fig. 2a). The volume wasdetermined via a series of 3D dilations using ImageJ until ~180 µm distance fromthe pore surface was reached. The value of 180 µm was selected as consistent withdistances for spatial correlations in microbial colony distributions30and spatialpatterns of soil C distributions48in previous micro-scale studies of soil matrix.Soil measurements . The total porosity of each intact soil sample was calculatedfrom its soil volume determined from the µCT image, gravimetric soil moisturecontent measured at the end of the study, and soil weight. A particle density of2.6 g cm−3was assumed for the total porosity calculations. Porosity <30 µm wasdetermined as the difference between the total porosity and the image-basedporosity, that is, the volume of pores with radii >30 µm, obtained from the images.For total soil C measurements, disturbed samples were sieved and groundfollowed by combustion analysis on Carlo-Erba Elemental Analyzer (CostechAnalytical Technologies, Valencia, CA). Short-term respiration was determined byincubating 10 g soil samples for 7 days at 20 °C in the dark78. Measurements ofCO 2emissions were conducted using infrared Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS)(1412 Photoacoustic multi-gas monitors; INNOVA Air Tech Instruments,Ballerup, Denmark) in the gas circulation mode. Microbial biomass C wasmeasured using chloroform fumigation incubation method79. After 24 h offumigation with ethanol-free chloroform, 5 g fumigated and non-fumigated(control) soil samples, were subjected to 10 day incubations followed by CO 2measurements as described above. Microbial biomass C was calculated based onthe amounts of CO2emitted from fumigated and control samples80.Gravimetric soil water content monitoring was conducted on a bi-weekly basisfrom each replicated experimental plot at the GLBRC experimental site. Soilsamples for gravimetric soil water content measurements were collected from 0 –25cm depth using a push probe (Ø 2 cm) during growing seasons of 2009 –2015. Soilwas dried for 48 h at 60 °C.Root biomass at 0 –10 cm depth was measured in soil cores (Ø 7.6 cm) collectedin triplicates from each experimental plot. The cores were taken at three pointsalong plant density gradients moving out from the center of a bunchgrass into theinterstitial space. Cores were air-dried, sieved over a 2-mm sieve, and roots werewashed, dried at 60 °C for 48 h, and weighed. Samples were collected in Novemberfrom 2009 –2013.The following soil biological characteristics of the studied cropping systemswere measured from the studied experimental plots 1 –2 years prior to the currentwork and reported in peer-reviewed literature: microbial community compositionand bacterial diversity indices55, fungal biomass56,ﬁne root production57, labilesoil C fractions9.2D zymography of soil cores . Enzyme activities were mapped using soil zymo-graphy approach81. Zymography mapping consists of placing a membrane satu-rated with an enzyme-speci ﬁcﬂuorogenic substrate on a surface of the soil sample.Once the substrate is enzymatically hydrolyzed, a ﬂuorescent product is generatedand the ensuing ﬂuorescent patterns re ﬂect the presence and activities of theenzymes. A photo of the membrane is taken in ultraviolet (UV) light, which then isused to produce a map of enzyme activities on the studied surface, referred to as azymogram.A schematic representation of the process of combining zymography with μCTinformation is shown on Supplementary Fig. 6, while a detailed description of thezymography procedures and soil processing for zymography analyses used in thisstudy are provided in ref.82. In brief, the following speci ﬁc settings were used:membrane —hydrophilic polyamide ﬁlters (100 μm thick, Tao Yuan, China)81;camera —Nikon D90 camera (Nikon Inc.) with a Sigma 18 –250 mm f/3.5 –6.3 DCMacro OS HSM lens (Sigma Corp. of America); source of UV light —a 22 W BlueFluorescent Circline Lamp —FC8T9/BLB/RS (Damar Worldwide 4 LLC);extracellular enzymes —beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, xylanase, N acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and acid phosphatase; respectiveenzyme-speci ﬁc substrates: 4-Methylumbelliferyl- β-D-Glucoside, 4-Methylumbelliferyl- β-D-Cellobioside, 4-Methylumbelliferyl- β-D-Xylopyranoside,4-Methylumbelliferyl-N-Acetyl- β-D-Glucosaminide, L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphate83.Soil cores were cut into 2 mm slices (Fig. 2b) using a specially designed cuttingtable (Supplementary Fig. 1c), as described in detail in ref.82. A total of 13 soilcores were analyzed, with 10 –16 zymograms taken per core, one map per each soilslice. Soil moisture levels were not manipulated prior to the measurements. Sincegood contact between a membrane and a soil surface is needed for obtainingreliable enzyme activity data84, only portions of each membrane were usable. Suchportions were identi ﬁed via an MUF-staining approach84as described by ref.82.The areas with minimal contact were excluded from enzyme map analyses.The zymogram was covered by a 1 mm2grid, and for each pixel of the grid weidenti ﬁed a corresponding 1 mm3voxel from the µCT image. The enzyme pixelwas assumed to be located at the center of the µCT voxel (Supplementary Fig. 6).For each 1 mm2pixel of the zymogram we calculated the average grayscale valueand standardized it based on the mean and standard deviation of the entirezymogram. For each 1 mm3voxel of the µCT image we also calculated averages forthe studied characteristics, e.g., volumes of pores of different sizes and volume ofthe soil matrix in relative proximity to sizeable pores. The aggregation of the datato the 1 mm scale conducted here was required to address the uncertaintiesassociated with soil cutting and matching of zymography and µCT images. Becauseit introduced smoothing into the resulting pore data, to ensure that the uncertaintyin pore characteristics of individual voxels was minimized during the analyses ofNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3121 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11057-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7the relationships between pores and enzyme activities, we only selected for suchanalyses the voxels where the pore values were above the 95th percentile value forthe entire soil core (Supplementary Fig. 7). Speci ﬁcally, for each core weconstructed histograms for pores of all studied class sizes and calculated the 95thpercentiles for abundances of each pore size class. Then each voxel of the core wasexamined and only the voxels with abundances exceeding the 95th percentiles wereretained for further analyses. On very rare occasions when a voxel exceeded 95thpercentile in more than one pore size class it was grouped in the larger of the sizeclasses. While this approach reduced the number of data points available for theanalyses, it ensured that the data used are highly representative in terms of theirpore characteristics.In order to evaluate how addition of new nutrient inputs in ﬂuences relationshipsbetween soil pores and enzyme activities we conducted incubations with fresh plantinputs in 10 studied cores, with 1 –2 soil slices per core for a total of 14 slices. Eachslice was covered by a layer of nutrient source, either as an alder ( Alnus glutinosa L.)leaf or as a layer of red clover ( Trifolium pratense L.) leaves, as shown inSupplementary Fig. 1d. Prior to the experiment, the leaves were air-dried in abotanic press to ensure the maximum uniformity in their contact with the entire soilsurface. After placing the dried leaves on the soil surface, 240 µl of water was evenlyadded with a pipette on top. The surface was covered with aluminum foil and a 100g sandbag weight to maximize the contact with the soil, and incubated for 3 –7 days.After the incubation, the leaves were carefully removed from the surface and anadditional 0.2 –0.3 mm of soil was cut off the surface to ensure that no leaf materialremained on the soil surface subjected to zymography. Then, zymographymeasurements were conducted on the surface as described earlier.Statistical analysis . Statistical analyses were conducted using PROC MIXED andPROC GLIMMIX procedures of SAS85. Implemented statistical models varieddepending on the experimental units from which different response variables werecollected. Speci ﬁcally, comparisons among the bioenergy systems in terms of theresponse variables with a single observation per soil core, e.g., soil C or soil volumein pore vicinity, were conducted using the statistical model with a ﬁxed effect of thebioenergy system and random effects of the experimental ﬁeld block and experi-mental ﬁeld plot (nested within the system). Statistical models for exploringstandardized enzyme activities for different enzymes in different bioenergy systemsand corresponding to areas with prevailing pores of different sizes included ﬁxedeffects of enzyme, system, and pore size class, as well as their interactions, andrandom effects of blocks, plots, cores (nested within the systems and plots), andalso individual soil slices (nested within all of the above factors). Normality of theresiduals and homogeneity of variances were checked for each studied variable. Incase of marked deviations from normality the data were log-transformed, while incase of variance heterogeneity, unequal variance analysis was performed86.Data availabilityData collected for this study will be made publicly available on Dryad and will bepreserved in the KBS LTER database available at http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables .
