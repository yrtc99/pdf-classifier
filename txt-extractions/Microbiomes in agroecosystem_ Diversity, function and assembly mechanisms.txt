Crop-associated microbiomes play an important rolein shaping plant performance, which includes but not limited to nutrientuptake, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. Although ourunderstanding of structure and function of soil and plant microbiomes hasbeen rapidly advancing, most of our knowledge comes from ecosystems innatural environment. In this review, we present an overview of the currentknowledge of diversity and function of microbial communities along the soil –plant continuum in agroecosystems. To characterize the ecological mecha-nisms for community assembly of soil and crop microbiomes, we explorehow crop host and environmental factors such as plant species and devel-opmental stage, pathogen invasion, and land management shape micro-biome structure, microbial co-occurrence patterns, and crop-microbiomeinteractions. Particularly, the relative importance of deterministic and sto-chastic processes in microbial community assembly is illustrated under dif-ferent environmental conditions, and potential sources and keystone taxa ofthe crop microbiome are described. Finally, we highlight a few importantquestions and perspectives in future crop microbiome research.INTRODUCTIONSoil not only serves as nutrient repository for crops,providing essential water and mineral elements, butalso harbours vast diversity of microbial species thatplays a fundamental role in a wide variety of ecologicalprocesses, providing the most important microbial seedbank for formation of the plant microbiome (Bakkeret al.,2018 ; Cordovez et al., 2019 ; Guerra et al., 2021 ;Oldroyd & Leyser, 2020 ). The plant microbiome con-sists of diverse microbial taxa including bacteria,archaea, fungi, protists and viruses, which play a vari-ety of important roles such as nutrient uptake, diseaseresistance, and abiotic stress tolerance for plant growthand health (Carri /C19on et al.,2019 ; de Vries et al., 2020 ;Toju et al., 2018 ; Trivedi et al., 2020 ). Many recentdiscoveries suggest that crop-associated microbiomescan be harnessed to protect the crops against patho-gens (Carri /C19on et al.,2019 ; Guo et al., 2022 ; Leeet al., 2021 ) and to enhance crop resilience to abioticstresses like drought and salt (Qi et al., 2022 ; Schmitzet al., 2022 ; Xu, Dong, et al., 2021 ). It was reported thatglobal demand for agricultural crops is expected to rise70% by 2050 to feed the growing population, and themicrobiome engineering was proposed as a vital bio-technological strategy to improve crop productivity andhealth in a sustainable way (Arif et al.,2020 ; Haskettet al., 2021 ; Singh et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is impera-tive to obtain a systematic understanding on the funda-mental ecological processes that govern the assemblyand co-occurrence patterns of soil and crop micro-biomes under different environmental conditions.Received: 19 June 2022 Accepted: 8 September 2022DOI: 10.1111/1758-2229.13126This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium,provided the original work is properly cited.© 2022 The Authors. Environmental Microbiology Reports published by Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Environmental Microbiology Reports. 2022;14:833 –849. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/emi4 833The development of multi-omics approaches suchas metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics,and culturomics in recent decades has greatly pro-moted the investigation on diversity, composition, andfunctions of the microbiomes in soils and plant compart-ments, including the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, andendosphere (Bulgarelli et al.,2012 ; Duran et al., 2018 ;Lundberg et al., 2012 ; Matsumoto et al., 2021 ; Mulleret al., 2016 ; Xu, Pierroz, et al., 2021 ). For example, arecent study based on metagenomics, metabolomics,and comparative genomics has suggested that the sor-ghum host can selectively recruit microbial memberscarrying more genes related to iron metabolism in theroot microbiome by specific metabolites under droughtstress (Xu, Dong, et al.,2021 ). Moreover, there has beenan increasing research effort to unravel the ecologicalmechanisms underpinning microbiome assembly, plant –microbiome interactions, and microbe –microbe interac-tions, among which community ecology theory andeco-evolutionary feedbacks can provide a mechanisticframework to discern these complex interactions withinthe plant –microbiome holobiont (Cordovez et al.,2019 ;Fitzpatrick et al., 2020 ;F o s t e re ta l . , 2017 ;M a r t i net al., 2017 ). It has been well documented that micro-biome assembly and dynamics in soils and plants in natu-ral environment are controlled by a broad range of bioticand abiotic factors, including compartment niche, plantgenetic signal and age, climate, and soil type and nutri-ents (Almario et al.,2022 ; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2020 ;H a r b o r te ta l . , 2020 ; Thiergart et al., 2020 ; Wagneret al., 2016 ). However, our knowledge of how biotic andabiotic factors together with agricultural managementshape microbiome assembly, microbial co-occurrencepatterns, and crop –microbiome interactions along thesoil–plant continuum in agroecosystems is still largely lim-ited. In this review, we aim to (1) provide an overview ofdiversity, composition, and functions of soil and cropmicrobiomes; (2) to explore the ecological mechanismsfor microbiome assembly and network patterns under dif-ferent environmental conditions; (3) to identify sourcesand keystone taxa and genes associated with the cropmicrobiome; and (4) to identify some priority areas forfuture research on crop-associated microbiomes.DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONS OFMICROORGANISMS INAGROECOSYSTEMSDiversity and composition of soil and cropmicrobiomesSoils are a main repository of terrestrial biodiversity har-bouring extremely complex and diverse microbial spe-cies that plays a central role in fundamental ecologicalprocesses (Bardgett & van der Putten,2014 ; Guerraet al., 2021 ; Jansson & Hofmockel, 2020 ). It was esti-mated that 1 g of surface soil contains up to 1 billionbacterial cells, approximate 200 m fungal hyphae, tensof thousands of protists, and trillions of viruses(Bardgett & van der Putten, 2014 ; Fierer, 2017 ; Sokolet al., 2022 ; Wagg et al., 2014 ). This vast diversity inbelowground soils acts as the microbial seed bank formicrobial colonization in crops (Cordovez et al., 2019 ;Trivedi et al., 2020 ). Plant hosts provide various micro-habitats (i.e. compartment niches), such as the rhizo-sphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere, for the growthand proliferation of microorganisms (Figure1) (Knightset al., 2021 ; Muller et al., 2016 ; Trivedi et al., 2020 ).Only selected members of soil microbiomes may movefrom soils to plant compartments and form complex co-associations with crop hosts (Cordovez et al.,2019 ;Muller et al., 2016 ). Sophisticated interactions betweenplants and their associated microbiomes have coe-volved over 400 million years in terrestrial ecosystems.Consequently, crop hosts and the associated micro-biomes are thought to form a ‘holobiont ’with the stabil-ity attributed to the evolutionary selection of plant –microbiome interactions (Hassani et al.,2018 ; Trivediet al., 2020 ). Members of the crop microbiome comprisenot only the mutually beneficial microbes like mutualis-tic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and symbioticnitrogen-fixing bacteria but also neutral and pathogenicones (Cordovez et al.,2019 ; Martin et al., 2017 ; Trivediet al., 2020 ). Understanding the diversity, composition,and functions of the microbiomes along the soil –plantcontinuum will be crucial for exploiting crop micro-biomes for the development of sustainable agriculture.Microbial habitats in the soil –plant continuum canbe separated into bulk soil, the rhizosphere, root, stemand leaf, which host distinct diversity and compositionof microbial communities (Figure1) (Fitzpatricket al., 2020 ; Muller et al., 2016 ). It is well documentedthat the rhizosphere, phyllsphere, especially for theendosphere contain much less microbial diversity inrelation to bulk soil (Knights et al.,2021 ; Trivediet al., 2020 ; Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ). For example, afew recent studies that examined the bacterial and fun-gal communities along the soil –plant continuum in field-grown maize and wheat/barley demonstrated thatmicrobial richness gradually decreased from soils toepiphytes and then to endophytes (Table1) (Xiong, He,et al., 2021 ; Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ). Similar patternshave been reported in rice and maize rhizosphere sam-ples showing a decreasing gradient in bacterial diver-sity from bulk soil to the rhizosphere and to theendosphere (Edwards et al.,2015 ; García-Salamancaet al., 2013 ). Moreover, a recent work in sorghum founda significantly higher protistan alpha diversity in the rhi-zosphere and bulk soils than in the phyllosphere (Sun,Jiao, Chen, Trivedi, et al.,2021 ). It was reported thatthe cultivable plant endophytes can reach a density of105–107cells per gram in roots and 103–104cells pergram in leaves, stems, flowers, fruits and seeds(Compant et al., 2010 ; Compant et al., 2021 ). Wang,Wang, et al. ( 2020 ) quantified root-associated bacterial834 XIONG ANDLU 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Another work investi-gated nitrogen-cycling genes of five oilseed crops andshowed that ammonia monooxygenase gene ( amoA)expression patterns differed between archaea and bac-teria (Wang, Gan, et al.,2020 ). The archaea amoAgenes were expressed 10 times higher in the rhizo-sphere than in root, whereas the bacterial amoA genesshowed a higher expression in root than in the rhizo-sphere (Wang, Gan, et al.,2020 ). A recent work sug-gested that soil aggregate sizes also significantlyaffected the abundance of microbial nitrogen-cyclinggenes (e.g. amoA,narG,nirS/K) (Han et al.,2021 ). Fur-ther, the microbiome in soil and crop system comprisesa few abundant taxa having a wide niche breadth andvast diversity of rare taxa with a greater specificity inniche requirement (Jiao & Lu, 2020 ; Xiong, He,et al., 2021 ). For instance, a previous study thatexplored fungal abundant and rare sub-communitiesbased on the large-scale soil survey in agriculturalfields revealed that 68.2% of fungal phylotypes wereidentified as rare taxa, which accounted for only 3.6%of the average relative abundance in soil (Jiao &Lu,2020 ). Similar results were reported in crop micro-biomes showing that the majority of mycobiome diver-sity (70.1%) were represented by rare taxa with a highphylogenetic diversity (Xiong, He, et al.,2021 ). Theseresults indicate that crop hosts are likely to exert astrong effect on soil microbiome by enriching the abun-dance of a few dominant taxa but reducing the overalldiversity, causing shift of abundant versus rare sub-community compositions and their ecological attributes.It has been well documented that microbial commu-nity composition differed greatly between soil and cropFIGURE 1 Diversity and functions of crop-associated microbiomes. Soils in agroecosystems not only are a main nutrient repository forcrops, providing essential water and nutrients to the crops, but also act as the most important microbial seed bank for the crop microbiome. Plantprovides multiple microhabitats such as the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere for the development of the crop microbiome. Plant hostshave a strong selection effect on microbial diversity and composition, with microbial richness gradually decreasing from soils to epiphytes and toendophytes. Crop-associated microorganisms (i.e. the crop microbiome) provide a number of life-support functions for their hosts, includingnutrient uptake, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. For example, crop microbiomes can enhance host resilience to abiotic stresseslike drought, salt, and cold.

Bulgarelli et al. ( 2015 ) showed that bacte-rial community associated with barley roots was domi-nated by Comamonadaceae ,Flavobacteriaceae , andRhizobiaceae , whereas members of Firmicutes andChloroflexi were more abundant in bulk soil. Xiong, He,et al. (2021 ) and Xiong, Zhu, et al. ( 2021 ) investigatedthe bacterial and fungal communities associated withsoil, root, and leaf in maize-wheat/barley rotation sys-tems, and showed that the bacterial families Enterobac-teriaceae ,Pseudomonadaceae , and Methylobacteriaceae and the fungal class Dothideomycetes were sig-nificantly enriched in plant compartments. In contrast,the bacterial family Chitinophagaceae and the fungalclass Sordariomycetes were more abundant in soil hab-itats. Specifically, relative abundance of bacterial classAlphaproteobacteria and fungal class Pucciniomyceteswere significantly higher in the leaf endosphere thanany other compartments (Xiong, He, et al.,2021 ; Xiong,Zhu, et al., 2021 ). Similarly, it was reported that Alpha-protobacteria dominated bacterial communities in sug-arcane leaf and stalk samples (Hamonts et al.,2017 ).Fungal phylum Ascomycota preferentially colonized thesugarcane leaf and stalk, while Basidiomycota weremore abundant in sugarcane roots and rhizosphere soil(Hamonts et al.,2017 ). By characterizing protistancommunities in multiple compartments of sorghum,Sun, Jiao, Chen, Trivedi, et al. (2021 ) indicated thatphyllosphere protistan community was dominated byRhizaria, Alveolata, and Amoebozoa. All these resultssuggest that crop hosts exert a strong selection effecton microbial diversity and composition, which verylikely originate from the belowground seed bank.Functions of soil and crop microbiomesIn agroecosystems, soil and crop-associated microbialcommunities provide a wide variety of functions(e.g. nutrient cycling) and benefits (e.g. pathogen resis-tance) to crop growth and health (Figure1) (Arifet al., 2020 ; Bakker et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2020 ). Soilmicroorganisms are key game players in a cascade ofintricate soil functions that underpin fundamental eco-system services (e.g. nutrient cycling, soil fertility, andclimate regulation) (Bardgett & van der Putten,2014 ;Guerra et al., 2021 ). For example, microorganisms liv-ing in bulk soil and the rhizosphere are integral to C, N,and P cycling and play critical roles in influencing cropfitness and productivity (Guerra et al.,2021 ; Jansson &Hofmockel, 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). It was reported thatmicrobial communities in the agricultural soils played akey role in regulating phosphorus cycling via microbialphosphorus solubilization strategy (Wu et al., 2022 ).Wagg et al. ( 2014 ) suggested that soil microbialTABLE 1 Recent studies on soil and crop microbiomes under different environmental conditionsCrop/compartment Microbes Treatments ReferencesTomato/soil, rhizosphere, and root Bacteria Salt stress Schmitz et al.

A recent work explored the relationshipsbetween soil biodiversity of multiple organism groups andmultiple ecosystem function s in 228 agricultural fields,which demonstrated that soil biodiversity was significantlypositively related to multipl e ecosystem functions associ-ated with crop yield, nutrient provisioning, elementcycling, and pathogen c ontrol (Jiao et al.,2021 ). Particu-larly, soil phylotypes with smaller sizes or at lower trophiclevels such as archaea, bacteria, fungi, and protist photo-trophs appeared to exhibit stronger biodiversity –ecosystem function (BEF) rel ationships in compared tothose with larger sizes or at higher trophic levels likeinvertebrates or protist predators (Jiao et al.,2021 ).Within each microbial group, rare species played a moreimportant role in driving ecosystem multifunctionality thanabundant species (Zhang, Lu, et al.,2022 ).In addition to soil microbiomes, microorganisms col-onizing plant compartments provide a number of life-support functions for their host, including nutrientuptake, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance(Figure1) (Arif et al., 2020 ; Toju et al., 2018 ). Someplant microorganisms can simultaneously produce anddegrade plant hormones, which could influence manyaspects of plant growth and development (Finkelet al.,2020 ; Muller et al., 2016 ). Among the extensiveand diverse microorganisms, mutualistic symbionts likearbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen-fixingbacteria are striking examples of plant –microbe interac-tions at which microorganisms promote plant growth byfacilitating the acquisition of scarce nutrients (Martinet al.,2017 ; Parniske, 2008 ). For example, a field studyin maize grown in nitrogen-depleted soils revealed thataerial roots provided a home to nitrogen-fixing microbesthat contributed 29% –82% of the nitrogen nutrition ofcrops (Van Deynze et al.,2018 ). A recent work alsodemonstrated that maize stem xylem harboured con-served core bacterial taxa carrying nifH gene, whichcontributed to 11.8% of the total N accumulated inmaize stems (Zhang, Zhang, et al.,2022 ). A meta-analysis in seven cereal crops (corn, wheat, rice, bar-ley, sorghum, millet, and oat) suggested that AM fungalinoculation in field led to a 16% increase in crop grainyields (Zhang, Lehmann, et al.,2018 ). On the otherhand, these beneficial fungi could interact withnitrogen-fixing bacteria to promote plant nutrient acqui-sition and health. For instance, facultatively biotrophicfungus Phomopsis liquidambaris helps rhizobial migra-tion from soil to the peanut rhizosphere via mycelialnetwork and further triggers nodulation (Zhanget al.,2020 ). Increasing studies based on metagenomicsequencing and DNA stable isotope probing alsorevealed that the plant microbiome plays a critical rolein nutrient transformation and cycling (Crombieet al.,2018 ; Guerrieri et al., 2015 ; Xiong, Singh,et al., 2021 ; Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2022 ). For instance,a recent study shows that the maize phylloplane micro-biome possessed diverse functional genes involvedin C, N and P cycling (e.g. xylA,amyA,nosZ,narG, andpstA/B) that vary across host growth stages (Xiong,Singh, et al.,2021 ).Increasing evidences have shown that crop-associated microbiomes can enhance plant resilienceto abiotic stresses such as drought, salt, and cold(de Vries et al.,2020 ; Schmitz et al., 2022 ; Xu, Dong,et al., 2021 ). Drought is probably the most importantenvironmental stress limiting crop growth and agricul-tural productivity. Hence, much recent research efforthas been made to harness the crop microbiome toincrease crop resilience to drought (de Vrieset al.,2020 ; Qi et al., 2022 ; Xu, Dong, et al., 2021 ). Forexample, a recent study explored the molecular mecha-nisms underlying crop –microbiome interactions underdrought stress and revealed that microbial iron metabo-lism in roots is important for sorghum ’s response todrought (Xu, Dong, et al., 2021 ). Similarly, a recentstudy examined the effects of synthetic community(SynCom) containing 53 Arabidopsis -associated bacte-ria on sorghum growth under drought stress, whichshowed that plants colonized by both Arthrobacter andVariovorax performed well or better than control plants(Qi et al.,2022 ). Likewise, some plant properties suchas total biomass, relative water content, and sugar con-tent were enhanced by AMF symbionts at low tempera-tures (Acuna-Rodriguez et al., 2020 ). It was reportedthat a SynCom of five bacterial strains comprising Ensi-ferspp., Ralstonia spp., and Bacillus spp. originatingfrom the root of the desert plant Indigofera argenteaoffers the potential to increase tomato resilience to highsalt stress (Schmitz et al., 2022 ).Soil-borne pathogens are a major threat to globalagricultural production, and the crop microbiome isincreasingly seen as a key driver contributing to plantresistance against infectious diseases (Kwaket al.,2018 ; Savary et al., 2019 ). It was proposed thatplants can ‘cry for help ’from their microbiomes whenthey suffer from pathogen invasion, leading to a consid-eration of selectively recruiting beneficial microbes toalleviate the pathogen stress (Bakker et al.,2018 ; Liuet al., 2021 ). Recent studies in common beans(Mendes, Raaijmakers, et al., 2018 ), wheat (Liuet al., 2021 ), pepper (Gao et al., 2021 ), and citrus (Liet al., 2022 ) have shown that crop-associated microbialcommunities provide a first line of defence against thesoil-borne pathogens. For example, a previous worksuggested that the both below- and aboveground com-partments of diseased plants can recruit potential bene-ficial bacteria such as Streptomyces ,Pseudomonas ,andBacillus against the Fusarium wilt disease (FWD)(Gao et al.,2021 ). Metagenomic analysis furthershowed that the microbial communities of the diseasedplants significantly enriched some functional genesMICROBIOMES IN AGROECOSYSTEM 837 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

In a recent study, Li et al. ( 2022 ) alsoreported a marked enrichment of beneficial microbes inthe phyllosphere of infected plants. Glasshouse experi-ments further indicated that several bacterial strainsincluding Pantoea spp., Methylobacterium spp., andSphingomonas spp. with antagonistic traits could pro-vide important protective effects for plants against path-ogen challenge (Li et al.,2022 ). Moreover, study in thetomato rhizosphere has demonstrated that microorgan-isms producing growth-inhibitory siderophores in the rhi-zosphere could suppress the bacterial pathogenRalstonia solanacearum and thus protect crops frominfection (Gu et al.,2020 ). The relative abundance ofFirmicutes and Actinobacteria in the tomato rhizospherewas negatively related to incidence of bacterial wilt dis-ease (Lee et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, the seed-endophytic bacterium Sphingomonas melonis can betransmitted across generations in disease-resistant riceseeds and positively affects rice resistance to patho-gens by producing anthranilic acid (Matsumotoet al.,2021 ). Besides bacteria and fungi, accumulatingevidence suggests that protists and algae are alsoimportant members of the crop microbiome, which canprovide protective effect on crop health (Guoet al.,2022 ; Lee & Ryu, 2021 ; Xiong et al., 2020 ). Forinstance, a recent study showed that protistan predatorscan strongly enhance banana health and yield by stimu-lating disease-suppressive bacteria like Bacillus spp.(Guo et al., 2022 ). Algal species like prokaryotic Ana-baena spp. and Calothrix spp., and eukaryotic Chlorellafusca have been used intensively for biological controlof crop fungal pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum ,Rhizoctonia solani , and Colletotrichum orbiculare(Lee & Ryu, 2021 ). Moreover, increasing evidence indi-cated that through horizontal gene transfer (HGT)events the crop endophytes can acquire novel functionssuch as biodegradation of organic contaminants andresistance against plant pathogens and heavy metals,which play a vital role in host adaptation (Compantet al.,2021 ). Together these findings reveal the promi-nent roles of crop-associated microbiomes in host fit-ness and health under various environmental stresses,which can help to develop microbiome-based tools aim-ing to sustainably improve agricultural productivity.MICROBIOME ASSEMBLY ANDDYNAMICS ALONG THE SOIL –PLANTCONTINUUMTransmission route and origin of the cropmicrobiomeEcological theories suggest that microbial community isshaped by a complex interaction of four fundamentaleco-evolutionary processes, including dispersal (e.g. themicrobial movement between local communities), selec-tion (e.g. the community is influenced by abiotic andbiotic factors), diversification (e.g. genetic variation), andecological drift (e.g. stochastic variation in growth anddeath) (Figure2) (Cordovez et al., 2019 ; Fitzpatricket al., 2020 ). Among them, dispersal and diversificationare key factors influencing the assembly and diversity ofmicrobial communities, and selection and ecological driftcan affect the abundance of microorganisms within themicrobiome (Cordovez et al.,2019 ). Increasing evi-dences showed that microorganisms can be transferredto the crop hosts via the vertical transmission from theparent plants and seeds, as well as via the horizontaltransmission from the surrounding environment, includ-ing the soil microbial seedbank, the atmosphere, neigh-bouring plants and insects, and even interacting animals(Figure2) (Abdelfattah et al., 2021 ; Fitzpatricket al., 2020 ; Meyer et al., 2022 ; Xiong, Singh,et al., 2021 ). For example, a recent study on oak seed-lings in a microbe-free environment has confirmed themicrobial transmission route from seed to the phyllo-sphere and root (Abdelfattah et al.,2021 ). Similarly, aprevious study on the clonal plant Glechoma hederaceashowed that a significant proportion of the bacterial andfungal communities can be transferred from the motherplants to the daughters (Vannier et al., 2018 ). Moreover,findings from previous studies in multiple below- andaboveground compartments of crops showed that crop-associated microbiomes are mainly derived from soilsand gradually enriched and filtered at different plantcompartments at which the rhizosphere and rhzoplaneare important interfaces for microbial transmission(Xiong, Singh, et al.,2021 ; Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ).During the processes of microbial enrichment, somemembers within Enterobacteriaceae ,Pseudomonada-ceae , and Methylobacteriaceae were significantlyenriched in plant compartments (Xiong, Zhu,et al., 2021 ). Many members within these bacterial fami-lies were also reported as core taxa of the crop micro-biome in previous studies (Bourceret et al., 2022 ;Cernava et al., 2019 ; Schmitz et al., 2022 ; Walterset al., 2018 ), suggesting that they are able to adapt tohost-specific selection stresses such as plant metabo-lites and immune system. In addition, the neighbouringplants and local air also play a role in the dispersal pro-cesses of the crop microbiome. By using the plastic leafof artificial plants as ‘local background controls ’in thefield across plant developmental stages, Xiong, Singh,et al. (2021 ) showed that air-borne microorganismswere important sources (52% –92%) of both bacterialand fungal communities in the maize phyllosphere. In arecent work, Meyer et al. ( 2022 ) examined how the phyl-losphere microbial community is shaped by dispersalfrom the nearby plants including tomato, pepper, andbean plants and demonstrated that local dispersal is akey factor influencing the assembly of phyllosphere838 XIONG ANDLU 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Biological and ecological traits such asplant identity, biomass, and age of the nearby plants areimportant determinants of phyllosphere microbiomediversity (Meyer et al.,2022 ). Some plant endophyteslike Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacter spp. canenter the internal plant tissues through root tip and roothair, stomata and hydathodes, damaged trichomes orwounds, and plant cracks and even cross the endoder-mis and colonize the entire plant body via plant vessels(Compant et al.,2021 ; Muller et al., 2016 ; SynekFIGURE 2 Ecological processes shaping the assembly of soil and crop microbiomes. Ecological theories suggest that microbiomeassembly is shaped by a complex interaction of four eco-evolutionary processes, including dispersal, selection, diversification (e.g. geneticvariation), and drift (e.g. random birth and death). Microorganisms can be transferred to the crops via the vertical transmission from the seeds, aswell as via the horizontal transmission from soils, the atmosphere, neighbouring plants, and interacting insects and animals. The assembly ofcrop microbiomes is influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors, such as plant compartment, crop species and genotype, developmentalstage, climate, soil type and nutrients, and agricultural practices. In addition to these deterministic factors, stochastic processes (e.g. drift ) alsohave a role in community assembly, and the relative importance of the stochastic processes versus deterministic processes varies according todevelopmental stage, plant compartment, and microbial species.

All these results provide empirical evi-dences supporting the diverse sources of the cropmicrobiome, and an important challenge for furtherresearch is whether different environmental stresses willaffect microbial dispersal processes and transmissionroutes of the crop microbiome.Host and environmental factors shapingmicrobial communitiesChanges in crop microbiome diversity and compositionare associated with a broad range of host and environ-mental factors, including plant compartment, crop spe-cies and genotypes, developmental stage, climate, soiltype, and agricultural managements (Figure2)( M u l l e ret al., 2016 ; Philippot et al., 2013 ; Singer et al., 2019 ;Trivedi et al., 2020 ). Increasing studies on crop plantsgrown under different environmental conditions havedemonstrated that plant compartment (i.e. host micro-habitats) is the most influential factor determining theassembly of crop-associated microbiomes (Bourceretet al.,2022 ; Edwards et al., 2015 ; Gao et al., 2020 ,2021 ;H a m o n t se ta l . , 2017 ; Singer et al., 2019 ;T k a c zet al., 2020 ;X i o n g ,Z h u ,e ta l . , 2021 ). For example,recent studies examining both bacterial and fungal com-munities in the soil –plant continuum of maize plantrevealed that microbiome assembly is shaped predomi-nantly by host selection rather than by soil managements(Bourceret et al., 2022 ; Xiong, He, et al., 2021 ;X i o n g ,Zhu, et al., 2021 ). Similarity, Gao et al. ( 2020 )c h a r a c t e r -ized fungal communities associated with soil, rhizo-sphere, roots and leaves of sorghum plants andsuggested that variation in fungal communities wasmainly explained by plant compartment followed bydevelopmental stage and host genotype. These resultscan be explained by the fact that plant metabolisms aswell as physical and chemical properties significantlyvary in different plant microhabitats, which selectivelyrecruit microbial species with specific ecological niches(Philippot et al.,2013 ; Trivedi et al., 2020 ;V o r h o l t , 2012 ).In sub-habitats or compartments of plant, growingevidences indicated that effects of host and environ-mental factors on microbial community largely dependon ecological attributes of the compartment(e.g. below- or aboveground compartments), differencein host identity (e.g. species or genotype), and scaleand degree of environmental stress (e.g. geographicdistance) (Chen et al.,2019 ; Grady et al., 2019 ; Xiong,Zhu, et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2018 ). For instance, site(i.e. soil type) had the strongest impact on microbialcommunities in the bulk soil but weaker in plant com-partments like root, and the leaf endosphere (Tkaczet al.,2020 ; Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ). In contrast, theeffects of crop species on microbial community assem-bly increased from soils to crop surfaces and to thecrop endosphere (Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ). Similarresults were also reported in the pepper (Gaoet al., 2021 ), Wheat (Hartman et al., 2018 ), and Sor-ghum (Gao et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, an increasingresearch effort is to explore the impact of host signalson crop microbiome assembly. A large-scale replicatedfield study on 27 maize inbred lines has shown thatplant age is the strongest factor shaping maize rhizo-sphere communities, followed by field location andplant genetics (Walters et al.,2018 ). Further analysesidentified 143 OTUs belonging to Alphaproteobacteria,Betaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria as heritabletaxa whose relative abundances were significantlyrelated to plant genotype (Walters et al.,2018 ). More-over, by investigating root microbiomes of four maizeinbred lines from the vegetative stage to the reproduc-tive stage, a recent work identified 26 stable OTUsbelonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria thatpersisted throughout the host life cycle (Bourceretet al.,2022 ). By characterizing the root metabolomeand ionome of wildtype plants at the vegetative andreproductive stages, Bourceret et al. ( 2022 ) found thatplant developmental stage is an important driverinfluencing root metabolisms and microbiomes. Similarresults were also reported in the rice root (Zhang,Zhang, et al.,2018 ) and the soil –plant continuum of themaize (Xiong, Singh, et al., 2021 ), revealing that plantdevelopmental stage had significant influence on micro-biome assembly and functions. In a recent study, Wag-ner et al. (2020 ) compared the microbiomes of diversemaize inbred lines and their F1 hybrid offspring andshowed that both bacterial and fungal communities inthe rhizosphere and leave differed between inbred linesand hybrids. Additionally, a recent study revealed thatcircadian rhythms also plays a role in shaping rice rhi-zosphere microbial communities, in which light expo-sure exerts an effect on rhythmic variation ofcommunity structure (Zhao et al.,2021 ). Further, it wasrecently demonstrated that soil microbial communitiesharbour circadian indicator taxa that can influencemicrobial circadian rhythms by regulating communitydiversity, network patterns, and assembly processes(Zhao et al.,2022 ).Given that most of agroecosystems are under inten-sive management, microbial community assembly inthe soil –plant continuum was also influenced by agri-cultural managements and fertilization practices(French et al., 2021 ; Schmidt et al., 2019 ). For exam-ple, Fan et al. ( 2019 ) suggested that long-term fertiliza-tion drastically reduced N fixation and significantlyinfluenced associated diazotrophic communities. More-over, previous study in soil and wheat root microbialcommunities under different agricultural managementssuggested that management regime (i.e. conventionaland organic managements) had significant impact onroot bacterial community but not on the fungal commu-nity (Hartman et al.,2018 ). For microbiome in soil, man-agement type had greater influence on fungal840 XIONG ANDLU 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensecommunities while bacterial communities were primarilyinfluenced by tillage intensities (Hartman et al., 2018 ).Further, several recent studies indicated that soil micro-biomes were more sensitive to different fertilizationpractices than crop microbiomes (Sun, Jiao, Chen, Wu,et al.,2021 ; Xiong, He, et al., 2021 ; Xiong, Zhu,et al., 2021 ). Although fertilization regimes had lesseffects on the crop microbiome, some microbial taxasuch as potential plant pathogen and protistan con-sumers in the phyllosphere can be significantly influ-enced by fertilization (Sun, Jiao, Chen, Trivedi,et al.,2021 ; Xiong, He, et al., 2021 ). Additionally, recentstudies have suggested that organic farming has multi-ple positive effects on crop-associated microbiomesand crop health, such as increasing microbial alphadiversity and network complex complexity, recruitingsome beneficial bacteria like Bradyrhizobium andBacillus , and protecting crops against plant pathogens(Guo et al.,2021 ; Guo et al., 2022 ; Karlssonet al., 2017 ; Khoiri et al., 2021 ; Wittwer et al., 2021 ).Together these results demonstrate that host selec-tion exerts a strong effect on a number of traits of cropmicrobiomes, and in addition agricultural managementregime plays an important role in shaping microbialcommunities. A better understanding of crop –microbiome interactions under different agriculturalregimes will be a key step for harnessing the cropmicrobiome to improve agricultural production.Quantification of deterministic andstochastic processes in microbiomeassemblyElucidating the relative importance of deterministic andstochastic processes driving the assembly of crop-associated microbiomes is a great challenge in micro-biome research (Table2). Community ecology theorysuggests that microbiome assembly is determined bymultiple interactions of deterministic (e.g. selection)and stochastic (e.g. stochastic dispersal or drift) pro-cesses (Cordovez et al.,2019 ; Fitzpatrick et al., 2020 ).For microbiomes in agroecosystems, the relative impor-tance of deterministic and stochastic processesremains unclear, but growing evidences showed thatboth processes are likely to contribute to microbiomeassembly (Table2) (Gao et al., 2020 ; Jiao et al., 2020 ;Xiong, Singh, et al., 2021 ). For example, a previousTABLE 2 Relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in the assembly of soil and crop microbiomesCrop/compartment Factors Stochasticity/determinism ReferencesWheat/soil Spatial scale Dominant stochastic processes onthe North China Plain (150 –900 km), while dominantdeterministic processes on theTibetan Plateau (130 –1200 km)Shi et al.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensestudy that investigated the influence of spatial scale onthe relative role of stochasticity and determinism in243 sampled sites across 1092 km distance demon-strated that stochastic processes played a dominantrole in microbiome assembly from 150 to 900 km anddeterministic processes dominated at the scale oflarger than 900 km (Shi et al.,2018 ). Another large-scale soil survey on fungal microbiome in agriculturalfields across eastern China revealed that the assemblyof abundant sub-community was governed primarily bydispersal limitation, while rare sub-community wasmainly determined by homogeneous selection (Jiao &Lu,2020 ). Similarly, a recent study on fungal micro-biome in the maize –wheat/barley rotation system hassuggested that abundant sub-community in the plantcompartments is largely shaped by stochastic pro-cesses, while the rare sub-community is mainly deter-mined by deterministic processes and is more sensitiveto host selection caused by crop species and compart-ment niche (Xiong, He, et al.,2021 ).Furthermore, host selection pressure that regulatesthe relative importance of deterministic versus stochas-tic processes varies depending on plant developmentalstage (Figure 2) (Gao et al., 2020 ; Xiong, Singh,et al., 2021 ). For instances, a previous study in the sor-ghum system indicated that stochastic processes(e.g. drift or stochastic dispersal) had a role in fungalcommunity assembly in leaves and roots at the earlystage of host development with fungal community sizenegatively correlated to the relative importance of sto-chastic processes (Gao et al.,2020 ). Xiong, Singh,et al. ( 2021 ) examined both bacterial and fungal com-munities at three developmental stages of maize andfound that plant developmental stage had an importantimpact on the relative contribution of deterministic andstochastic processes in crop microbiome assembly,with deterministic processes exerting a stronger influ-ence on bacterial communities at the early stage andon fungal communities at the late stage, respectively.In contrast, both bacterial and fungal communities insoil and the rhizosphere were mainly driven by the het-erogeneous selection over time (Xiong, Singh,et al.,2021 ). The relative importance of ecological pro-cesses is also related to geographical distance andcrop type. Jiao et al. ( 2020 ) examined archaeal, bacte-rial, and fungal communities in adjacent pairs of maizeand rice fields and found that crop species and lati-tudes played important roles in influencing the deter-ministic and stochastic processes in soil microbiomeassembly. Dispersal limitation played a more importantrole in soil microbiome assembly in rice fields than inmaize fields, with soil microbiome assembly in high lati-tude rice fields being more driven by dispersal limitation(Jiao et al.,2020 ). Moreover, soil physicochemical attri-butes like available sulfur also played a key role inmediating the balance between stochastic and deter-ministic processes in microbiome assembly (Jiao &Lu,2020 ).All above findings suggest that the relative impor-tance of deterministic versus stochastic processes inmicrobiome assembly of agroecosystems variesaccording to spatial scale, crop type, plant develop-mental stage, and microbial sub-community(e.g. abundant or rare species) (Figure2). Yet in thecontext of global change, if and how environmental per-turbations like precipitation and fertilization regimeaffect deterministic and stochastic processes in micro-biome assembly along the soil –plant continuum are notwell known, and multiple experimental and statisticalapproaches are needed to further uncover these enor-mously complex and mysterious processes.MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS ANDKEYSTONE TAXA OF CROP-ASSOCIATEDMICROBIOMESMultiple factors influence microbial co-occurrence patternsA better understanding of complex interactions withinthe microbial communities in soils and plant compart-ments is essential for sustainable management ofagroecosystem. Microbial co-occurrence network anal-ysis provides a useful approach to decipher potentialinteractions within microbial communities (Barberanet al.,2012 ; Coyte et al., 2015 ; van der Heijden &Hartmann, 2016 ). Increasing studies have revealed thatmicrobial interactions play important roles in shapingthe overall microbiome assembly and microbiome sta-bility (Coyte et al., 2015 ; Duran et al., 2018 ; Niuet al., 2017 ; van der Heijden & Hartmann, 2016 ). Niuet al. ( 2017 ) explored the role of microbial interactionsin community assembly dynamic using a simplifiedmaize root community consisting of seven species(including Enterobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp.,Ochrobactrum spp., Herbaspirillum spp., Pseudomo-nasspp., Curtobacterium spp., and Chryseobacteriumspp.). It was revealed that removal of just one speciesEnterobacter spp. can lead to a significant decrease ofthe abundance of five bacterial strains but promote thepredominance of one species Curtobacterium spp. Thisfinding suggests that Enterobacter spp. acting as key-stone taxa plays a vital role in controlling the micro-biome assembly of maize root (Niu et al.,2017 ). Somemembers within Enterobacter were also identified asdominant taxa in maize, wheat, and barley plants, sup-porting the essential role of Enterobacter spp. in cropmicrobiomes (Xiong, Zhu, et al., 2021 ). It was recentlyreported that microbial SynCom not only offers a con-sistent protection against salt stress for tomato plantsbut also influences the microbial network by increasingthe average connectivity (Schmitz et al.,2022 ). Further,growing evidences suggested that pathogen invasionhad important impact on microbial co-occurrence pat-terns in below- and aboveground compartments of842 XIONG ANDLU 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

( 2022 ) showed that pathogeninvasion increased bacterial network connectivity andcomplexity in the phyllosphere of citrus plant. Theincreased connectivity after pathogen invasion wasmainly related to interactions among epiphyticmicrobes. In contrast, Gao et al. (2021 ) reported thattheFusarium wilt disease (FWD) in pepper decreasedbacterial network complexity but increased fungal net-work complexity. Bacterial –fungal interkingdom net-work analyses showed that FWD decreased theproportion of negative edges and modularity of the net-work, indicating a more unstable co-occurrence pat-terns in the diseased plants (Gao et al.,2021 ). Inaddition, a more complex microbial co-occurrence net-work was recorded in Fusarium oxysporum -resistantcultivar of common bean compared with susceptiblecultivar (Mendes, Mendes, et al.,2018 ).Moreover, agricultural systems and fertilizationpractices had a significant impact on microbial co-occurrence patterns in soils and plant compartments(Banerjee et al.,2019 ; Sun, Jiao, Chen, Trivedi,et al., 2021 ; Xiong, He, et al., 2021 ). For instance, find-ings from field work in the maize and rice soils showedthat microbial co-occurrence network was more inten-sive in maize soils than in rice soils, and the speciesco-occurred patterns differed between the high-latituderegion and the low-latitude region (Jiao et al.,2020 ). Itwas reported that grapevine rootstocks can significantlyinfluence bacterial network properties in roots, withgrafted grapes supporting a higher network complexitythan ungrafted grapes (Marasco et al.,2018 ). Plantsecondary metabolites like maize synthesized benzox-azinoids can affect specific microbial clusters within theroot microbial co-occurrence networks (Kudjordjieet al.,2019 ). Another work found that cropping prac-tices markedly alter bacterial –fungal co-occurrence net-work patterns (Hartman et al., 2018 ). Furthermore,Banerjee et al. ( 2019 ) found a greater fungal networkcomplexity in organic farming than in conventional andno-till farming systems. Organic fertilizer amendmentincreased the relative abundance of bacterivorous andomnivorous protists but reduced plant pathogenic pro-tists (Xiong et al.,2018 ). Additionally, recent study in along-term field experiment under different levels ofland-use intensity has shown that land managementnot only had a major impact on the structure and com-position of bacterial, protistan and fungal communitiesbut also affected microbiome network complexity(Romdhane et al.,2022 ). In a recent study, Bazanyet al. ( 2022 ) found that water deficit stress can signifi-cantly influence inter-kingdom microbial connections inthe rhizospheres of corn and sugar beet. Recent stud-ies on the bulk soil and the rhizosphere indicated thatmicrobial circadian clock is also a strong determinant inregulating microbial co-occurrence patterns (Zhaoet al.,2021 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ). All these findingssignificantly broaden our knowledge of microbial inter-actions along the soil –plant continuum. It is now amajor challenge to investigate the real ecological andbiological roles of microbial species within the complexmicrobial interactions under different environmentalstresses and agricultural managements.Identification of keystone taxa andfunctional genes of the microbiomeIt has been well documented that microbial communi-ties in soils and plant compartments contain keystonetaxa that potentially play a central role in the structureand function of terrestrial microbiome (Table 3)(Banerjee et al., 2018 ; Banerjee et al., 2019 ; van derHeijden & Hartmann, 2016 ). Technically keystone taxareflect the network hubs, core taxa, and/or biomarkertaxa in a community. Current approaches used to iden-tify keystone taxa include network analysis, RandomForest Model analysis, and SynCom experiment(Banerjee et al.,2019 ; Bertani et al., 2016 ; Hamontset al., 2017 ; Knapp et al., 2021 ). For instance, Weiet al. ( 2019 ) explored correlation between initial soilmicrobiome and disease outcomes caused by soil-borne plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum andidentified Massilia ,Dyadobacter ,Terrabacter ,Arachi-dicoccus , and Dyella genera as keystone taxa in theinitial microbiomes of healthy plants, which wereclosely related to tomato disease outcomes (Table 3).Further, the initial microbiomes of healthy plants har-boured more abundant functional genes related to non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthases(e.g. COG3321 and COG1020), which involve in theproduction of antimicrobial compounds that could eitherdirectly inhibit plant pathogen or contribute to theassembly of a pathogen-suppressing microbiome (Weiet al.,2019 ). A previous study in sugar beet plantsdemonstrated that the infection plants could enrichsome disease-suppressive bacteria belonging to Chiti-nophagaceae andFlavobacteriaceae in the root endo-sphere (Carri /C19on et al.,2019 ). Further metagenomicsand network analysis revealed a significant enrichmentof functional genes related to chitinase (e.g. GH18) andbiosynthetic gene clusters encoding the production ofnon-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs,e.g. BGC396, BGC471, and BGC592) and polyketidesynthases (PKSs, e.g. BGC298) in the root endosphereof the diseased plants (Carri /C19on et al.,2019 ). Similarity,Lee et al. ( 2021 ) analysed the rhizosphere microbialcommunity of a healthy and diseased tomato and iden-tified Brevibacterium frigoritolerans ,Bacillus niacini ,Solibacillus silvestris , and Bacillus luciferensis asplant-protective microbes, which significantly facilitateshost disease suppression by activation of plant immu-nity. Findings in the wheat rhizosphere also indicatedthat Stenotrophomonas rhizophila can contribute toMICROBIOMES IN AGROECOSYSTEM 843 17582229, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-2229.13126 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

In contrast, some members of fungal fami-liesConiothyriaceae ,Mycosphaerellaceae, andSym-metrosporaceae were more abundant at the maturestage and were identified as network hubs for the cropmicrobiome (Xiong, Singh, et al., 2021 ). As for agricul-tural practices, a recent study revealed that organic fer-tilizer could significantly reduce Fusarium wilt disease(FWD) incidence via enhancing predatory interactionsbetween predatory protists Cercozoa and pathogen-suppressive bacteria Bacillus spp., among whichmicrobial secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes(e.g. nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene,COG1020) involved in the production of antimicrobialcompounds play an important role in inhibiting plantpathogens (Guo et al.,2022 ). Moreover, some networkhubs belonging to Sphingobacteriales, Cytophagales,Tremellales, and Agaricales were also identified asindicators for conventional system, and a network hubRhizobiales was indicators for organic system (Schmidtet al.,2019 ). Further, a field long-term fertilizationexperiment provided empirical evidences supportingthe central role of keystone taxa such as Chloroflexi ,Nitrospirae , and Mesorhizobiumin in maintaining soilnutrient cycling and crop production after four decadesof fertilization (Fan et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, evi-dences from microbial dilution experiment have sug-gested that the metabolic functions such as nitrogenmetabolism and phosphonate and phosphinate metab-olisms of keystone taxa belonging to Nitrospira andGemmatimonas played an important role in sustainingsoil microbiome stability (Xun et al.,2021 ). A large-scale field study showed that five heritable taxa relatedtoAgrobacterium ,Devosia ,Comamonadaceae , andSinobacteraceae were also the core taxa of maize rhi-zosphere microbiome that were present in 100% ofsamples (4911 samples) (Walters et al.,2018 ). Allthese results indicate that the crop host has a strongselection effect on the keystone taxa of the crop micro-biome across plant developmental stages and underdifferent environmental stresses. Additionally, whilstour understanding of keystone taxa of soil and cropmicrobiomes is advancing, increasing studies haveindicated that some potential soil-borne human patho-gens such as Clostridium botulinum ,Salmonella enter-ica, and Burkholderia pseudomallei may transfer tohuman system via soil –plant –food chains (Breviket al.,2020 ; Nieder et al., 2018 ; Samaddar et al., 2021 ;Yan et al., 2022 ). However, our knowledge of ecologi-cal mechanisms that influence this harmful microbialloop along the soil –plant –food continuum is still limited.TABLE 3 Identification of keystone taxa for soil and crop microbiomesCrop/compartment Keystone taxa ReferencesTomato/soil Massilia ,Dyadobacter ,Terrabacter ,Arachidicoccus , and Dyella Wei et al.

In future study,more integrative and advanced approaches such asmetaproteomics, epigenomics, phenomics, single-cellgenomics, CRISPR-based genomic editing are expectedto provide powerful tools for deciphering biologicalmechanisms that govern crop –microbiome interactionsand engineering plant microbiome function to improvecrop production and health (Hatzenpichler et al.,2020 ;Lawson et al., 2019 ; Xu, Pierroz, et al., 2021 ).CONCLUDING REMARKSIncreasing evidences suggest that soil and crop micro-biomes provide a number of life-support functions fortheir host plants, including growth promotion, nutrientuptake, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance.Cultivating crop-associated microbes favourable to cropproductivity and health has been considered as one ofthe most promising biotechnological strategies toachieve food security and sustainable production. Asystematic understanding of ecological mechanismsthat govern microbiome assembly, microbial co-occurrence patterns, and crop –microbiome interactionsalong the soil –plant continuum could provide importantknowledge for future microbiome engineering. In thepresent review, we have highlighted how multiple hostand environmental factors shape the microbiomeassembly and network patterns under different environ-mental conditions. We suggested that host selectionmediated by plant compartment is the most dominantfactor determining diversity, composition, and networkpatterns of crop-associated microbiomes. The effects ofhost and environmental factors on microbial communityin each compartment depend on ecological attributes ofthe compartment and the degree of host signals andenvironmental stresses. Both deterministic and stochas-tic processes have a role in community assembly of soiland crop microbiomes, and the relative importance ofthese processes varies according to spatial scale, plantcompartment and developmental stage, and microbialgroups. Advanced approaches like network analysisand synthetic community experiment have identifiedsome keystone taxa such as Bacillus ,Streptomyces ,Rhizobium, andFlavobacterium for crop microbiomes.Although recent findings significantly broaden ourunderstanding on the structure and functions of soiland crop microbiomes, our knowledge of molecularmechanisms that govern crop –microbiome interactionsalong the soil –crop –food continuum under differentenvironmental stresses remains scare. For example,some critical questions remain largely unexplored:(1) How do crops recruit beneficial microbes withdesired functions under various environmental condi-tions? (2) Which kinds of keystone functional genes inthe crop microbiome enhance crop resistance to patho-gens and abiotic stresses? (3) If and how soil-bornehuman pathogens and antimicrobial resistance can betransfer to human system via soil-crop-food chains?(4) How do crops and their microbiomes interact andco-evolve in response to agricultural management andglobal change at a long-time scale? Answering thesequestions should contribute to our knowledge of theunderlying mechanisms that govern crop –microbiomeinteractions and provide an essential information forprecisely harnessing crop microbiomes for develop-ment of agricultural sustainability.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was financially supported by the NationalNatural Science Foundation of China (no. 91951206and 41630857).CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe author declares that there is no conflict of interestthat could be perceived as prejudicing the impartialityof the research reported.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTData sharing is not applicable to this article as no newdatasets were created or analyzed in this study.REFERENCESAbdelfattah, A., Wisniewski, M., Schena, L. & Tack, A.J.M.
