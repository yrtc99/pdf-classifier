Here, we used the National ForestResource Inventory data for China collected from 2004 to 2008 and forest biomass and soil carbon storage data obtainedfrom direct field measurements to estimate carbon (C) sequestration rate and benefit keeping C out of the atmosphere inforest ecosystems and their spatial distributions. Between 2004 and 2008, forests sequestered on average 0.36 Pg C yr−1(1 Pg = 1015g ) ,w i t h0 . 3 0P gCy r−1in vegetation and 0.06 Pg C yr−1in 0 –1 meter soil. Under the different forestcategories, total C sequestration rate ranged from 0.02 in bamboo forest to 0.11 Pg C yr−1in broadleaf forest. Thesouthwest region had highest C sequestration rate, 30% of total C sequestration, followed by the northeast and southcentral regions. The C sequestration in the forest ecosystem could offset about 21% of the annual C emissions in Chinaover the same period, especially in provinces of Tibet, Guangxi, and Yunnan, and the benefit was similar to most Annex Icountries. These results show that forests play an important role in reducing the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxidein China, and forest C sequestration are closely related to forest area, tree species composition, and site conditions.Keywords : carbon sequestration; per unit area carbon sequestration; vegetation carbon sequestration; soil carbonsequestration; spatial distribution1. IntroductionWith the climate change debate advancing, variouscountries are exploring ways and means for responsib-ility and goal of energy conservation and emissionreduction. Carbon (C) sequestration in forests has beenshown to be a cost-effective option for mitigation ofanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (Brownet al. 1996 ). The term “C sequestration ”in forests iscommonly used to describe any increase in biomass andsoil C storage caused by a change in forest ecosystems.In 1990, estimated global forest ecosystems wereestimated to be a net C source with emissions, rangingfrom 0.5 to 1.3 Pg C yr−1(1Pg=1015g) (Dixon et al.1994 ). In contrast, recent global C analyses haveestimated a global net forest C sink in the range from1.0 ± 0.8 Pg C yr−1for 1990 –1999 to 1.2 ± 0.9 Pg C yr−1for 2000 –2007 based on forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem C studies (Pan et al. 2011 ). The changeof C sequestration in global forests was consistentwith estimated C sink of global terrestrial ecosystems,which increased from 1.0 –2.6 Pg C yr−1for the 1990sto, currently, 2.0 –3.4 Pg C yr−1(Watson et al. 2000 ;Canadell et al. 2007 ). These uncertainties have emergedand invoke multiple processes with strong spatial andtemporal dynamics of global C sequestration.Large-scale afforestation and reforestation have beenproposed as a strategy for increasing C sequestration(Brown et al. 1996 ; Canadell et al. 2007 ). China hasinitiated a nationwide afforestation strategy since the1970s (Wang et al. 2004 ), and the area of forestplantations has exceeded 60 million hectares (Mha),becoming first in the world (Jia 2009 ). Though notrequired by the Kyoto Protocol, China has planned toreduce C emissions and determine how to increase thecountry ’s C sequestration will be an important issue inregional C budgets (Liu & Diamond 2005 ). The mostrecent Chinese forest inventory data also showed that thearea of forests in 2004 –2008 has increased by 20.6 Mhaover the past five years (Jia 2009 ). Policy-makers requiremore accurate information on the current and projectedC sequestration in forests to make better plans formitigating the climate change.In recent years, major efforts have been made toestimate C sequestration rates of Chinese forests at anational scale, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.18 Pg C yr−1(Xu1999 ; RTCCCCS 1999 ; Fang et al. 2001 ; Zhang &Xu2002 ,2003 ). In spite of these efforts, it still remains adifficult task, surrounded by large uncertainties (Panet al. 2011 ). The efficiency of C sequestration differs indifferent tree species as they vary in growth, mortality,and decomposition that drive C sequestration (Lorenz &Lal2010 ; Wang et al. 2010 ). The C sequestration is alsorelated to region, growing stage, and forest managementactivities (Johnson & Sharpe 1983 ; Turner & Lambert*Corresponding author. Email: wangbing@caf.cnScandinavian Journal of Forest Research, 2014Vol. 29, No. 1, 51 –59, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2013.856936© 2013 Taylor & Francis2000 ). However, forest type, region, and age classeswere not taken into account in most previous estimatesof C sequestration (Fang et al. 2001 ; Zhang & Xu 2002 ).It is, therefore, necessary to re-estimate the current forestC sequestration, using the newest data (2004 –2008) andthe direct field measurements. Additionally, relativelyfew studies have attempted to quantify the value of Csequestration via afforestation in China. The objectivesfor this study were to (1) quantify C sequestration(Pg C yr−1) and its benefits to Chinese forest ecosystemsin the period of 2004 –2008; (2) analyze distribution ofC sinks in different regions; and (3) understand how thecomposition and structure of forests affected forestC sequestration.2. Materials and methods2.1. C sequestration estimate method2.1.1. Vegetation C sequestration estimate methodBased on the fact that production of every 1 g dryorganic matter can fix 1.63 g CO2as the photosynthesisequation shows (Guo et al. 2001 ; Xue & Tisdell 2001 ;Zeng et al. 2008 ), we can estimate the amount ofatmospheric CO 2fixation in vegetation. The equation isshown as follows:Mvcsi¼1.63XiSi/C2NPP iwhere MVCSiis the vegetation C sequestration (Mg yr−1)of the ith vegetation type; SiandNPP iare the area (hm2)and net primary productivity (NPP) value (Mg hm−2yr−1) of the ith vegetation type.Different plants have different NPP and C content. Inthis study, NPP was estimated using field measurementsthat depend on the type of plants and availablemeasurements. The estimates for the biomass and Ccontent followed the methods proposed by Fonseca et al.(2011 ). A nested plot design was used, measuring thevarious biomass components (aboveground, below-ground, and litter layers) by age class as well as byforest type at provincial levels. For each of the biomasscomponents that are described below, an approximately1 kg field subsample was taken to the laboratory for Canalyses. The NPP of a stand, i.e. the change of biomassbetween 2 years, was then estimated according to thenumber of trees in each sampling area. Lastly, thevegetation C stock and sequestration of each stand wascalculated using above equation.2.1.2. Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) estimate methodThe vegetation type method (Post et al. 1985 ) wasutilized to estimate SCS. Because the 0 –1-meter layerwas thought to include most of the soil organic carbon(SOC) in a soil column (Campbell et al. 2008 ), thecalculations incorporate horizon data to 1-meter depthand SOC content at depths below 1 m is regarded as0gCk g−1. Firstly, we calculated the soil organic carbondensity (SOCD) in different soil horizons, which repre-sented the weight of organic C in the 1 m3soil-cubic atthe soil profile depth of 1 m. Second, because the SOCDvaried with vegetation type, we transferred the SOCD ofsoil horizons into SOCDiof vegetation. Finally, theSOCD iwas multiplied by the area of each vegetationtype to estimate the amount of soil organic carbonstorage (SOCS) over the region.The equations of SOCS estimate are as follows:SOCS ¼SOCDi/C2AiSOCD i¼Xnj¼1Cj/C2Dj/C2Hj/C2ð1/C0PjÞ/100where SOCS is soil organic carbon storage (kg); Aiisthe area (m2) of the ith vegetation type; SOCD iis theorganic carbon storage per unit area (kg m−2) at theprofile of the ith vegetation type; Cj,Dj,HjandPjaretheSOC content (g C kg−1), the average soil bulkdensity (g cm−3), the thickness (cm) and the volumefraction of the fraction >2 mm of the jth soil horizon; nisthe number of horizons involved.The SCS is commonly used to describe any increasein SOC content caused by a change in forest ecosystems.The relation of SCS estimate is as follows (Liu & Li2012 ):SCS¼SOCS y/C0SOCS y/C0ttwhere SOCSy is SOCS (kg) of invertory time in the ythyear, and SOCSy-t is SOCS (kg) of the inventory time inthe ( y-t)th year.2.2. Scaling upA challenge in the field of C accounting is the need toupscale measurements and observations from the level ofunit area, patch or stand, up to landscapes, regions, andbeyond (Medlyn et al. 2003 ). Spatial upscaling mainissues, such as sample grain size, sample extent,nonlinearities, and growing stage, must be considered(Harmon 2001 ).The issues were addressed in this study by thefollowing steps. The changes of biomass (abovegroundor total) are related to forest type (species), region (sitequality), growing stage (age class), and forest manage-ment activities (Johnson & Sharpe 1983 ). To reduceheterogeneity of site condition, entire China is dividedinto 31 regions by provinces. According to NationalForest Inventory Report of China (Anonymous 2010 ),Chinese forests were subdivided into four large forestcategories: bamboo forest (e.g. Phyllostachys pubescensand other bamboo species), economic forest (e.g. Camelliaoleifera ,Vernicia fordii ,a n d Sapium sebiferum ,a n d52 D. Wang et al.Eucommia ulmoides plantations) and shrub forest (e.g.Rhododendron spp .,Hippophae spp .,Sabina procum-bens,Sophora Davidii ,a n d Sabina vulgaris ), otherforest (refers to all other plantations and natural forests,including 46 dominant tree species). In each province,the forest category was stratified into forest types bytree species; each forest type was further subdividedinto five age classes, including young, middle-aged,near-mature, mature, and over-mature. In total, forestinventory data were compiled from more than 250,000permanent and temporary plots across China, and weestablished 7012 sample plots across 31 provinces, 4forest category and 5 age classes in the study area basedon forest inventory plots (Forestry Ministry of China1983 ). Annual C sequestration for vegetation and soilpool were then summed over all provinces in China toderive a national estimate for each year.On the basis of a clear difference in climate,geography, land use, and social economy, we dividedthe whole area into seven subregions: North Central(including Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, andTianjin), Northeast (including Heilongjiang, Jilin,and Liaoning), Northwest (including Gansu, Ningxia,Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang), Southeast (includingJiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, and Zhejiang), Southwest(including Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, Guizhou, andTibet), Central (including Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui,and Jiangxi) and South Central (including Guangdong,Guangxi, Hainan, and Fujian) ( Figure 1 ).2.3. Estimating C sequestration benefits of forestsForests create social benefits by keeping the C out of theatmosphere. The benefits are difficult to observe directlybut can be calculated by observation of compensatorycosts to reveal its cost to society, or “shadow price ”(Brainard et al. 2006 ). Two methods have been typicallyused to indirectly quantify the benefits of C sequestrationby forests. The first method is calculating the monetaryvalue using a C fixation price (Baral & Guha 2004 ). Theafforestation cost is typically estimated as the totalafforestation investments divided by the C sequesteredby the forests (Xue & Tisdell 2001 ). However, the costof sequestering C for afforestation or reforestation isuncertain, varying from $0 Mg−1C to $300 Mg−1C(Sedjo et al. 1995 ; Thompson et al. 1997 ; Jotzo &Michaelowa 2001 ). Thus, it is difficult to use thismethod for comparisons of C sequestration benefit indifferent regions due to no standard global price. Thesecond method is estimating the effects of C sequestra-tion by forests in offsetting C emissions from thecombustion of fossil fuels (Zhao et al. 2010 ). Therefore,the C sequestration benefits of forests in China wereevaluated based on the ratio of the total C sequestered byforests to the total C emissions from the fossil fuelscombustion. The annual average C emissions in Chinabetween 2005 and 2007 were derived from Yueet al. ( 2010 ).3. Results3.1. Chinese forest resourcesAccording to the latest forest inventory data, China has195.5 Mha of forests, or 20% of the total area of thecountry ’s land (Anonymous 2010 ). The volume of treesis estimated to be 14913 Mm3of which 13721 Mm3is inforests. Furthermore, Chinese forests account for 4.9%of the global forest area (4000 Mha) (FAO 2010 ) andFigure 1. Zoning of China for calculation of C sequestration in forest ecosystems.Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research 53have 61.7 Mha of plantations with a stand volume of upto 1960 Mm3, which is the largest of any country in theworld.The Orher Forest was the dominant forest category inChinese forests, accounting for more than half of thetotal area of forests, followed by economic forests, shrubforests, and bamboo forests ( Table 1 ). Forest was largelynatural and mainly situated in southwest, northeast, andcentral regions. The southern provinces are home topredominantly plantations and bamboo forests. In termsof age-class distribution, the country ’s forest is heavilyskewed toward the young and middle-aged forests(Table 2 ), particularly plantations. So they have apotential to sequester C due to high NPP per unitarea and reduce atmosphere CO2, even improvingenvironment quality.3.2. Forest C sequestrationThe C sequestration rate of forest ecosystems in Chinawas estimated to be 0.36 Pg C yr−1from 2004 to 2008,with 0.30 Pg C yr−1(84%) in vegetation and 0.06Pg C yr−1(16%) in soil. The majority of the C wassequestered by other forests, among which C sequestra-tion rate was highest in broadleaf forests (30.6%), with amean value of up to 0.11 Pg C yr−1; coniferous forestshad the next highest C sequestration rate, followed bymixed forests ( Table 3 ). Per unit area C sequestrationwas highest in the mixed forest. The shrub forests andthe economic forests had lower C sequestration rates,0.04 Pg C yr−1and 0.02 Pg C yr−1, respectively. The Csequestration in the bamboo forest was the lowest inforests, but the per unit area C sequestration rate washigher, next to that of the mixed forest.C sequestration showed a spatial pattern with thedistribution of forest resources ( Figures 2 and3). Of thetotal C sequestration rate in Chinese forests, 0.11 Pg Cyr−1, or 30%, was found in the southwest region, farmore than in any other regions. The northeast region hadmore than 17% of total C sequestration rate and highestper unit area C sequestration rate. In the south centralregion, total C sequestration rate was similar as in thenortheast region, but per unit area C sequestration ratewas lower than that of the other regions. The northcentral, central, northwest, and southeast regions togetheraccounted for only 36% of the total C sequestration rate.3.3. C sequestration benefits of forestsAnnual average C emissions from the combustion offossil fuels in China were 1.7 Pg C yr−1(Yue et al.2010 ). More than 20% of these C emissions could beoffset by C sequestration of forests ( Figure 4 ). The Csequestration benefits were not distributed evenly acrossregions. The highest was 67.7% in the southwesternregion. The northeastern and the south central regionswere also more than the level of national C sequestrationbenefits (21.1%), the former was 32.7%, and the latter39.6%. The benefits of C sequestration reduced net Cemissions to reach near zero in Tibet, Guangxi, andYunnan. In the provinces, such as Heilongjiang, Jiangxi,Sichuan, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, sequestered C byforests were almost half or even greater than half of Cemissions. The benefits of C sequestration were less, orbelow 1%, in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Tianjin.4. Discussion4.1. Influence of forest types on C sequestrationWe investigated the variation in C sequestration inChinese forest ecosystems. The variations along foresttype and geographical location were consistent withresults from the US forest ecosystems (Birdsey 1992 ).C sequestration in forest ecosystems are primarily relatedto changes in C sequestration in vegetation due to itslarge C sequestration rate. The C sequestration throughincrease in the forest area by afforestation and reforesta-tion had been supported (Laganière et al. 2010 ). It wasfound that the broadleaf forest and the coniferous foresthave higher C sequestration rates than other forest types.Moreover, the efficiency in C sequestration differsamong the tree species as they vary widely in propertiesTable 1.

Wang et al.that drive C sequestration (Purves & Pacala 2008 ).Pérez-Cruzado et al. ( 2012 ) reported that C sequestration(biomass and soil) in the broadleaf forests ( Eucalyptusnitens andEucalyptus globulus ) was more than that inthe coniferous forests ( Pinus radiata ) in Europe. NPPand biomass are greater in the broadleaf forests than inthe coniferous forests in China (Jiang et al. 1999 ). Thus,the broadleaf forest had the highest C sequestration inthis study due to higher per unit area C sequestration, asa result of higher NPP and soil C sequestration. Thehighest per unit area C sequestration in the mixed forestcould be attributed to the presence of the broadleavedspecies rather than to the mixture (i.e. diversity) per se.Tree species composition affected site conditions, treebiomass, forest soil development, and soil C stocks,which influenced the C sequestration potential of forests(Binkley & Menyailo 2005 ; Chiti et al. 2007 ; Purves &Pacala 2008 ).4.2. Influence of site condition on C sequestrationSoil C stocks appeared to be strongly influenced by soiltype or climate than by tree species at regional ornational scales (Vesterdal et al. 2013 ). The differentregions also showed differences in the C sequestration offorest in this study. The greatest C sequestration of forestoccurred in the southwest region, where was one of themainly concentrated regions of Chinese forest distribu-tion, area accounted for more than 28% of the total offorest area, and there are higher vegetation C density dueto abundant water and sunshine that can providefavorable conditions for plantations (Li et al. 2004 ).The northeast region, one of the important forest zonesin China, had highest soil C density due to thick litterlayer and low rates of decomposition, particularly in thelarge area of the native forests (Li et al. 2004 ), whichshould have contributed to the higher C sequestration.The south central region had generally similar Csequestration as the northeast region. This is mainlybecause the provincial government is paying a greatattention to plantation in the south central region,especially in fastest growing economies of GuangdongProvince (Qi 2002 ; Yang 2003 ); this region has themaximum percentage of fast-growing plantations inChina (Anonymous 2010 ). The northwest and southeastregions contained lowest C sequestration because treeswere few and small in the regions that were affected bythe human and the climate (Li et al. 2004 ; Anonymous2010 ). It suggested that the spatial distribution of Csequestration was positively correlated with combina-tions of many factors, including forest structure, climatecharacter, and forest policy and management.Table 2.

Changes of C sequestration benefitBased on the method for estimating the effects of Csequestration by forests in offsetting C emissions, ourstudy showed that the benefits of C sequestration offorests in China (21.2% of C emissions) were lower thanthe average for global terrestrial ecosystems, whichabsorb about 30% of all CO2emissions from fossil fuelburning and net deforestation (Canadell et al. 2007 ),being especially high in New Zealand (81%), Sweden(62%), and Finland (56%). However, the figure forChina was higher than for the USA (10%), Japan (7%),and Germany (3%) and most other Annex I countries(Woodbury et al. 2007 ). Owing to the uneven develop-ment of regional economy and forestry, the benefits of Csequestration in all the provinces were unequal. Tibet,Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces mostly achieved zeronet C emission and C sequestration over C emission. TheC sequestration was half of C emissions in someprovinces, such as Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan,Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, but that declined to below1% in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Tianjin, suggesting that inthese provinces, energy saving, and emission reductionplan are inevitable.4.4. Comparison of C sequestration with previousestimatesThe mean C sequestration rate of all major forest typesin China, measured directly from field studies, was 0.36Pg C yr−1, which was much higher than those fromprevious estimates based on model, including that ofZhang and Xu ( 2003 ), Fang et al. ( 2001 ) and Pan et al.(2011 ), who shown were between 0.13 Pg C yr−1and0.18 Pg C yr−1(Table 4 ). These differences could reflectchanges in forest resources and estimate method. First,Chinese forests are constantly changing. With thechanging needs of society and economy, the forestswere cleared for urban and suburban development,highways, and agricultural use. Under the pressure ofmore natural disasters or negative impacts, Chinesegovernment is paying a great attention to plantationsand protection of natural forests. At present, the forestmanagement policy to conserve forests can be groupedinto four major categories: (1) maintained existing forest(stop deforestation and forest degradation), (2) agricul-tural land that was planted with trees or allowed to revertnaturally to forest, (3) regenerated to forests in harvest-ing for timber products, and (4) introduce a massiveafforestation and step up efforts for the fostering,protection, and management of forest resources. And,of course, all forest lands changed continually as treesand other vegetation naturally germinate, grow, and die.RegionNorth CentralNortheast NorthwestCentralSoutheast SouthwestSouth CentralTotalPer unit area carbon sequestration0.81.01.21.41.61.82.0Amount carbon se questration0.00.10.20.30.4Per unit area (Mg ha–1 yr–1)Amount (Pg yr–1)Figure 2. Carbon sequestration rates for forests in differentregions.Figure 3. Carbon sequestration rates for forests from 31 provinces (1Tg = 1012g).56 D. Wang et al.C sequestration in different forest type, region, and ageclasses was not taken into account in most previousestimates (Zhang & Xu 2003 ). This study used thenewest forest inventory data, and the area of total forestwas higher than predicted values in Zhang and Xu(2003 ) and Fang et al. ( 2007 ), which led to a higher Csequestration. Compared with last five years, mostyoung forests grew up, and the quality of forests hadimproved (Anonymous 2010 ). The size of the trees(DBH) affects C sequestration, and a large tree generallysequestered more C than a small tree (Nowak 1994 ).Finally, previous estimates depended largely on modelprojections and average point estimates. For example,the established regression model by Fang et al. ( 2001 ,2007 ) was based only on stand volume of the matureforests, but ignored stand volume of the young andmiddle-aged forests. In contrast, our estimates usedgrowth rate of stand data and was to scale C sequestra-tion from the unit-area-level to the region-level in thecase of considering spatial variability and integrateregional forest resources and C sequestration data toreach national comprehensive estimates.4.5. Comparison of C sequestration with othercountriesForest covered an area of 195.5 million ha in China,about 4.9% of the world ’s forest area (FAO 2010 ), andcontained 9% or less for the gross C sink (4.02 PgCy r−1) in the world from the atmosphere to vegetationand soil (Pan et al. 2011 ). In addition, the C sequestra-tion of Chinese forests was close to that of the USA, butless than Russia and no less than those of other mid-to-high latitudes regions/nations ’forests ( Table 5 ). Thevalue may be attributed to the largest plantations inChina, and a high proportion of young and middle-agedforests. Plantations were effective in sequestering atmo-spheric CO2(Lal 2005 ; Turner et al. 2005 ; Schulze2006 ). Young trees have great C sequestration potentialand may respond to long-term CO 2enrichment (Lorenz& Lal 2010 ). There may be another reason that themission of C from burning, deforestation, and decay ofvegetation is not estimated in this study.Figure 4.

Concluding remarksForests play an important role in mitigating the impactsof climate change in China. The quantification of Csequestration by forests is critical for the assessment ofthe actual and potential role of forests in reducingatmospheric CO2. This research provides a case studyof the quantification of C sequestration by forests inChina. Based on field survey data and forest inventorydata derived in 2004 –2008, it is estimated that Chineseforests vegetation sequestered five times C more thanthat in soil. The C sequestration by forests equaled to21.2% of the annual C emissions from fossil fuelcombustion in China. In addition, our results indicatedthat the C sequestration rate varied among forest typeswith different species composition and age structure, andthere are significant regional differences due to theinfluence of site condition. Afforestation should be acommon strategy that over the course of decades leads tothe incorporation of C in plant biomass and soil. Theseresults are important to support future climate mitigationactions, provide insights for decision-makers to makebetter management plans for forests at the regional,national, and global level.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge the support from DagangshanForest Ecological Research Station for field monitoring andsampling, and they are Wei Dai, Xiulan Bai, Yan Jing, andPing Li.FundingThis study was funded by the National Basic ResearchProgram of China (973 Program) [No. 2011CB403201]and supported by CFERN & GENE Award Funds onEcological Paper.ReferencesAnonymous. 2010.
