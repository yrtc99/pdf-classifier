How-ever, under current climatic conditions, Ireland is situated on the margin of the geographical range whereMiscanthus production is economically feasible. It is therefore important to optimize the yield and other ecosys-tem services such as carbon sequestration delivered by the crop. A survey of commercial Miscanthus ﬁeldsshowed a large number of areas with no Miscanthus crop cover. These patches can potentially lead to reducedcrop yields and soil carbon sequestration and have a signiﬁcant negative impact on the economic viability of thecrop. The aim of this research is to assess patchiness on a ﬁeld scale and to analyse the impacts on crop yieldand soil carbon sequestration. Analysis of aerial photography images was carried out on six commercial Miscan-thus plantations in south east Ireland. The analysis showed an average of 372.5 patches per hectare, covering anaverage of 13.7% of the ﬁeld area. Using net present value models and a ﬁnancial balance approach it wasshown that patchiness has a signiﬁcant impact on payback time for initial investments and might reduce grossmargins by more than 50%. Total and Miscanthus -derived soil organic carbon was measured in open patchesand adjacent plots of high crop density showing signiﬁcantly lower Miscanthus -derived carbon stocks in openpatches compared to high crop-density patches (0.47Mg C ha/C01/C60.42 SD and 0.91Mg C ha/C01/C60.55 SD). Usinggeographic information system (GIS) it was shown that on a ﬁeld scale Miscanthus -derived carbon stocks werereduced by 7.38% /C67.25 SD. However, total soil organic carbon stocks were not signiﬁcantly different betweenopen patches and high crop density plots indicating no impact on the overall carbon sequestration on a ﬁeldscale over 3 –4 years since establishment for these Miscanthus sites.Keywords: bioenergy, crop patchiness, ecosystem services, gross margins, Miscanthus , net present value, soil carbon sequestra-tion, soil organic carbonReceived 15 January 2013; revised version received 25 March 2013 and accepted 26 March 2013IntroductionIn recent years the use of biomass for energy produc-tion, particularly in Europe and North America, hasincreased signiﬁcantly (Sims et al., 2006; EuropeanCommission, 2011). The main drivers of this develop-ment are the possible reduction in greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions and independence from fossil fuels.While national and international legislation is promot-ing the use of bioenergy by setting mandatory renew-able energy targets or subsidizing biofuel production(e.g. European Parliament, Council, 2009; Departmentof Agriculture, Fisheries & Food, 2010) the costs andbeneﬁts of producing bioenergy have generated contro-versy within the scientiﬁc community. Major concernsare the impact on biodiversity and the efﬁciency of car-bon saving (e.g. Dauber et al., 2010; Anderson-Teixeiraet al., 2011; European Commission, 2011; Jorgensen,2011).The use of Miscanthus 9giganteus (Greef et Deu exHodkinson et Renvoize) (Greef & Deuter, 1993; Hod-kinson & Renvoize, 2001) as a bioenergy crop has beena focus of research in the last decade (e.g. Lewandow-skiet al., 2000; Clifton-Brown et al., 2007; Styles et al.,2008). This perennial, rhizomatous C 4grass, originatingfrom south-east Asia is highly adaptable to most ofEuropean climates with estimated yields between 13Correspondence: Jesko Zimmermann, tel. + 353 1 896 3068,fax + 353 1 896 1147, e-mail: zimmerjr@tcd.ie566 ©2013 Blackwell Publishing LtdGCB Bioenergy (2014) 6, 566–576, doi: 10.1111/gcbb.12084and 25.8 Mg ha/C01(Clifton-Brown et al., 2004). In Ire-land, the introduction of Miscanthus has been subsi-dized by the government for the last few years withthe most recent bioenergy scheme having come intooperation in August 2012 (Department of Agriculture,Fisheries & Food, 2010). In the Irish context, Miscanthushas been estimated to have both economic and envi-ronmental beneﬁts with gross margins of 326 to383€ha/C01when used for direct combustion (Styleset al., 2008) making it a viable alternative to conven-tional crops. However, the estimates of the gross mar-gin are particularly dependent on market dynamicsand the total biomass yield.Miscanthus has a carbon mitigation potential of 4.0 –5.3 Mg C ha/C01yr/C01(Clifton-Brown et al., 2007) andhas been shown to sequester signiﬁcant amounts ofcarbon into the soil (e.g. Clifton-Brown et al., 2007;Dondini et al., 2009). Furthermore, Zatta et al. (2013)and Zimmermann et al. (2012) found that the introduc-tion of Miscanthus to arable or grassland does not leadto a signiﬁcant reduction in soil organic carbon. Tooptimize carbon beneﬁts from Miscanthus it is impor-tant to understand all factors inﬂuencing soil carbonsequestration.Recent studies conducted in the United Kingdomand Ireland have reported patchiness in Miscanthusﬁelds (Semere & Slater, 2007; Bellamy et al., 2009; Sageet al., 2010; Zimmermann et al., 2012). Possible reasonsfor this patchiness are problems with the planting tech-nique, bad rhizome quality, poor overwintering, orsmall-scale variations in the soil quality (Lewandowskiet al., 2000; Price et al., 2004; Atkinson, 2009). Most ofthese earlier studies focussed on the impact of patchi-ness on biodiversity, but it can be expected that thepatchiness also has a signiﬁcant impact on the biomassyield, which especially in the Irish context could com-promise the economic performance of Miscanthus . Eco-nomic studies show relatively low sensitivity of theeconomic viability of Miscanthus production to a reduc-tion in the expected yields (Styles & Jones, 2008; Styleset al., 2008), assuming lower yields are associated withlower inputs. Currently gaps in the crop cover are notcovered by economic models. As Ireland is situated onthe margin of economically viable Miscanthus produc-tion (Clifton-Brown et al., 2004; Stampﬂ et al., 2007) sitespeciﬁc yield losses due to gaps in the crop covermight render the Miscanthus production uneconomicfor farmers. Furthermore, due to its high establishmentcosts, Miscanthus introduction represents a considerableﬁnancial risk to producers, and ﬁnancial returns in theinitial years of production are especially important topay back initial debt and therefore improve the per-ceived risk balance of Miscanthus to farmers (Styleset al., 2008).Although soil carbon sequestration currently has nodirect impact on the economic feasibility of Miscanthus,it is an important ecosystem service. Land-use changerelated carbon dynamics is an important part of thenational greenhouse gas inventory report (NIR) asdeﬁned in the Kyoto protocol (United Nations, 1998)and the loss of soil organic carbon due to land-usechange has been identiﬁed as a major factor in increas-ing atmospheric CO2levels (Smith et al., 2008). Duringthe 1990s, soils have emitted about 1.6 /C60.8 Pg C yr/C01of carbon to the atmosphere due to land-use change(Schimel et al., 2001; IPCC, 2007). Historical carbonlosses due to cultivation and disturbance have been esti-mated to be between 40 and 90 Pg carbon globally(Schimel, 1995; Houghton, 1999; Houghton et al., 1999;Lal, 1999). The support of soil carbon sequestrationthrough clean development mechanisms under theKyoto Protocol is currently focussed on afforestationand reforestation, however, the importance of soil car-bon sequestration in agriculture in relation to land-use,land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) is well recog-nized (IPCC, 2000, 2006). It is likely that in the futuresoil carbon sequestration in agriculture will become apart of the NIR, and that carbon credits will be allocatedto this ecosystem service.It can be expected that in open patches sequestrationofMiscanthus -derived soil organic carbon is signiﬁcantlylower than in areas of normal or high crop density. Asthe main sources of soil organic matter are plant litterand root material (e.g. Schneckenberger & Kuzyakov,2007) large gaps in the crop cover can signiﬁcantlyreduce the soil organic carbon input and thereforedirectly inﬂuence soil carbon sequestration. Whethernon-crop plants that have been observed to reach highcover densities in such gaps (Semere & Slater, 2007;Bellamy et al., 2009) can compensate for the lower levelsofMiscanthus -derived soil organic carbon is currentlynot known.The aim of this study is to assess the patchiness incommercial Miscanthus ﬁelds and analyse the impactson the crop yield and soil carbon sequestration using anintegrated ﬁeld-measurement, and remote sensingapproach. The study comprised three major steps. (i)Field measurements of the difference in soil carbonsequestration in open patches and high crop densityplots in Miscanthus ﬁelds; (ii) assessment of the patchproperties in selected ﬁelds using remote sensing; (iii)assessment of the impact of patchiness on soil carbonsequestration and crop yield on a ﬁeld scale. It ishypothesized that the patchiness will signiﬁcantlyreduce the crop yield and soil carbon sequestration on aﬁeld scale, and that the yield reduction will signiﬁcantlyincrease the payback time, as well as lower the grossmargin for Miscanthus producers.©2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, GCB Bioenergy ,6, 566–576E F F E C T SO FC R O PP A T C H I N E S SI N MISCANTHUS 567 17571707, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12084 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2023].

All Miscanthus ﬁeldswere planted in 2006 or 2007, so that the Miscanthus plantationswere at the end of the establishment phase (Karp & Shield,2008) at the time the experiment was conducted. The selectioncriteria were an elevation of maximum 120 m a.s.l., a minimumﬁeld size of 2 ha, and the availability of an adjacent on farmcontrol site. The control site was a ﬁeld representing the formerland-use, grassland or tilled land, of the Miscanthus ﬁeld. Forthe analyses it was important that both the Miscanthus and thecontrol sites had not recently been used to cultivate a C4crop(i.e. maize). The planting of the Miscanthus crop has been car-ried out by an external contractor; therefore the farmers werenot able to provide information on planting techniques used.However, as all farms were supplied by the same contractor itcan be assumed that no differences in planting technique wereapparent.Soil sampling and sample preparationSoil from four treatments, i.e. high crop-density Miscanthus ,open patch, for the two former land-use categories, grasslandand tillage, respectively, as well as from the respective on farmcontrol sites was collected. The open patch and high crop-den-sity plots were sampled as matched pairs. A matched pair wasdeﬁned as two adjacent subplots nested within each farm.Within each category four randomly distributed subplots weresampled using a soil auger (Ø 5.6 cm). Five soil samples up to30 cm soil depth were taken in each subplot situated at least1m from the edge of the subplot. The soil samples weredivided into three depths 0 –10 cm, 10 –20 cm, and 20 –30 cm.Four of the samples were then pooled according to depth toaccount for small-scale variation. The ﬁfth sample was used forbulk density measurement. Soil bulk density was measured byweighing a known volume of oven dried soil (105 °C), after-wards stones ( >2 mm) were removed and their volume andweight determined. The core weight and volume was correctedfor stone content and the bulk density was then calculated bydividing the corrected soil weight by the corrected volume.The collected soil was air dried and passed through a 2 mmmesh-size sieve and residual biomass larger than 2 mm wasremoved manually. The soil was then ground using a ball milland approximately 30 mg were transferred into silver capsules.Any carbonate carbon was removed using the acid fumigationmethod (Harris et al., 2001). In addition, soil pH was measuredfrom 3 g soil suspended in 12 ml distilled water using a Jen-way 4330 pH meter.Carbon measurementsMiscanthus -derived carbon (SOC Mis) was determined using the13C natural abundance method. While photosynthesis generallyleads to lower13C values in plant organic matter comparedwith atmospheric CO 2, the degree of depletion is dependent onthe photosynthetic pathway. Organic matter in C 4-plants showsdistinctly higher13C abundance than in C 3-plants. In an envi-ronment with only one source of C 4-derived soil organic carbon(e.g. Miscanthus ) the isotopic signal can be used to quantify theamount of carbon derived by that given source (Balesdent &Balabane, 1992).Table 1 Parameters of the sampled Miscanthus sites, elevation was measured using one GPS measurement.

With xbeing the fraction ofd13CMisthe isotope mass balance can be written asx¼ðd13Cnew/C0d13ColdÞ=ðd13CMis/C0d13ColdÞð 2ÞThe d13Coldvalues were taken from the d13C values of therespective adjacent control sites at the corresponding depths. Itis important that neither the Miscanthus sites nor the controlsites had any C4cropping history as this could have biased theresults. The d13C of the Miscanthus plant represents an averageof shoot, root, and rhizome material (value taken from M. Don-dini, personal communication). All d13C values, as well as totalSOC values, were measured by the UC Davis Stable IsotopeFacility using a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyserinterfaced to a PDZ Europa 20 –20 isotope ratio mass spectrom-eter (Sercon Ltd, Cheshire, UK). All carbon contents are mea-sured from the depths 0 –10 cm, 10 –20 cm, and 20 –30 cm.Using the measured bulk density the measured carbon contentsgiven in g C kg/C01soil were converted into area based carbonstocks (Mg C ha/C01).Data analysisAll data sets showed a normal distribution and no transforma-tions were applied. Due to the nature of the isotope mass bal-ance, negative SOCMisvalues result from higher d13C values inthe control site compared with the corresponding Miscanthussite. Negative SOC Misvalues can therefore indicate a C 4-historyor a local source (e.g. cow dung) of high d13C. As the analysisis based on the assumption that the control site represents thed13C value prior to Miscanthus planting, with Miscanthus beingthe only source of higher13C carbon, a higher d13C value in thecontrol site renders a matched pair unfeasible for the analysis.As SOC Misvalues can be close to zero, inaccuracy in measure-ment can also lead to negative values, therefore, to avoid posi-tive bias, only negative outliers were removed. Data pointsoutside the 1.5 interquartile-range were considered outliers.The statistical analysis was carried out using analyses of var-iance (ANOVAS ) to account for the nested structure of the experi-mental design (crop density nested in farm) by introducingfarm (F) as an error term. Miscanthus -derived carbon stocks(SOC Mis) as well as total SOC stocks (SOC t) were used asresponse variable. As this study focuses on the ﬁeld scale, thesoil organic carbon stocks were summed over the 30 cm sam-pling depth for the statistical analysis. Former land-use (LUf;grassland vs. tillage) and crop density (Dens; open patch vs.high crop density plot) were used as response variables. Toaccount for possible interactions between the response vari-ables an initial model was run, taking all possible interactionsinto account. In a stepwise selection process all non signiﬁcantterms were removed ( P>0.05). The analysis was carried usingthe NLME package in the R-project software (Pinheiro et al.,2010; R Core Team, 2012). Differences between numbers oflarge and small patches were analysed using a paired t-testwith numbers: small ( /C205m2) and large ( >5m2) patches beingdeﬁned as pairs per farm.Assessment of patchinessHigh resolution aerial imagery from Bing maps (Microsoft,Redmond, Washington, USA) was used for the remote sensinganalysis for all ﬁeld sites. To be suitable for the analysis theimagery required a sufﬁcient resolution to enable patch identi-ﬁcation. Furthermore, the images must have been recordedwhen the crop canopy was fully developed (ideally betweenAugust and October) as patches cannot be recognized directlyafter harvest, and are difﬁcult to identify in earlier growthstages or after winter senescence. To assess the number andsize of patches in Miscanthus ﬁelds a geographic informationsystem (GIS)-based analysis of remote sensing imagery wasused. Patches were identiﬁed using a combination of spatialanalysis and manual digitizing. Smaller patches are generallyshaded by surrounding Miscanthus and can therefore be identi-ﬁed as dark areas. The dark areas were identiﬁed and con-verted into polygons. In a second step, the polygons werecompared with the aerial images and errors were correctedmanually (typically large patches that were not shaded.) Theﬁnished polygons were then used to analyse the patch number,average patch size, and the overall loss of cropped area due topatchiness. All spatial operations were conducted using ArcGIS10 (ArcGISTM, ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). Ground-tru-thing was carried out by measuring 172 patches randomly dis-tributed among the farms using a hand-held Thales MagellanMobileMapper CE GPS receiver (Arc Pad 7.0). As the data werenon normal, the Spearman-rho correlation coefﬁcient was usedto compare the ﬁeld measurements with the remote sensingmeasurements.Effect of patchiness on yieldThe effect of patchiness on yield was estimated by calculatingthe loss of total yield in each ﬁeld due to the reduction in effec-tively cropped area as a result of patchiness. It was assumedthat the yield in the open patches is zero. To assess the eco-nomic impact for farmers, two model approaches were used,(i) a net present value model (NPV); and (ii) a ﬁnancial balanceapproach. Discounted annualized net present values repre-sented the difference between discounted costs and discountedincome over the 21 year plantation lifetime, divided by21 years. The approach was based on an updated version ofthe NPV model used in Styles et al. (2008). The ﬁnancial bal-ance approach enabled the determination of the number ofyears after establishment that plantations break even under dif-ferent yield and patchiness scenarios.

Thebiomass price of 75 €Mg/C01for dry matter is a conservativeestimate based on current market prices of about 60 €Mg/C01(20% moisture content) (Caslin, 2009). The NPV approach wasemployed with an annual discount rate of 5%, while the ﬁnan-cial balance approach assumed a 5% annual interest rateapplied to all remaining debt. The models were calculated forthree yield levels representing dry matter harvested off takesduring spring harvest of: 10.5 Mg ha/C01yr/C01,1 2M gh a/C01yr/C01,and 13.5 Mg ha/C01yr/C01. These yields represent the possiblerange in Ireland (Clifton-Brown et al., 2000; Stampﬂ et al.,2007). Fertilizer application rates, and associated costs, werescaled according to the three (expected) yield levels withoutpatchiness. The impact of patchiness was therefore determinedin relation to the expected baseline yield of a theoretical non-patchy ﬁeld. Furthermore, it was assumed that the peak yieldswere achieved from years 3 to 17 after establishment of thecrop. During years one, two, and three crop yields were set atzero, 30% and 60% of the peak yield (Clifton-Brown et al.,2007) while for years 18 –21 an annual 10% decline in peakyield was assumed. Miscanthus has been postulated to producestable yields for 15 –20 years (Lewandowski et al., 2000)although no yield data are currently available from olderMiscanthus trials in Ireland to conclusively support thisassumption. A fall in yield after 18 years of the crop life-cycleis seen as an incentive for producers to remove the crop(J. Finnan, personal communication). The models were run forﬁve levels of patchiness for each of the three yield types: 0%,10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%.As direct yield measurements were not possible on the sur-veyed commercial sites, the total yield was estimated using theMISCANFOR model (Hastings et al., 2009). The model was runfor the year 2009 using soil data from the Harmonized WorldSoil Database (FAO, 2009), and CRU 2.1 0.25 degree climatedata for the period 1970 –2002 (Climatic Research Unit, Univer-sity of East Anglia). The model was used to calculate peakyield (before senescence) as dry matter. To estimate the harvestyield for spring the results had to be corrected for repartitionof nutrients, leaf fall, and stubble left in the ﬁeld after harvest,using the factor 0.66 based on Clifton-Brown et al. (2004). Themodelled data were used as a baseline representing a non-patchy ﬁeld. The reduction in crop yield due to patchiness wasthen calculated by reducing the effectively cropped area by thesum of the area of all patches in the respective ﬁelds.Effect of patchiness on soil carbon sequestrationTo measure the effect of patchiness on soil carbon sequestrationthe SOCMisvalues measured in high crop density Miscanthusand open patches were interpolated onto two respective 0.5 mrasters using kriging. The open patch SOC Misvalue raster wasthen clipped using polygons that represented the patchinessfor the corresponding ﬁelds as derived from the aerial images,creating raster ﬁles representing SOC Misvalues for the mod-elled patches of each ﬁeld. This raster was then merged withthe high crop density SOC Misvalue raster using the mosaicfunction, creating a full coverage of modelled patchiness for aﬁeld. The average SOCMisvalues were then calculated for eachraster in each ﬁeld as well as the high crop density SOC Misras-ter ﬁle representing a ﬁeld with no patches. All spatial opera-tions were conducted using ArcGIS 10 and all raster operationswere carried out using the spatial analyst toolbox.ResultsCrop patchinessAnalysis of the aerial imagery showed that open patchescan be classiﬁed into three groups: (i) small randomlydistributed patches (see Fig. 2a –f); (ii) linear featureswith either a number of small patches aligned along aline, or large stretches of open patches (especially visibleon Fig. 2a –c); and (iii) as large open areas with fewMiscanthus shoots growing (Fig. 2a, f, both in the south-eastern corner of the ﬁeld.) The comparison of patchareas measured in the ﬁeld and with remote sensingshowed a signiﬁcant ( P<0.01) correlation (correlationcoefﬁcient 0.55). The results of the GIS-based remotesensing analysis are summarized in Table 3. Standard-ized to patches per hectare, all sites show similar patchnumbers (on average 372.54 /C631.96 SD).

Similar proportionate declines occur forthe high and low yield levels. At patchiness levels of 40to 50 % the gross margin is reduce to one third, com-pared to a non-patchy ﬁeld.The results of the ﬁnancial balance approach areshown in Figure 4. Changes in patchiness up to 20%lead to a payback period between 4 and 7 years for allmodelled baseline yields. When looking at 30% and40% patchiness, establishment costs are paid backwithin 9 and 11 years, depending on the baseline yields,independent of the patchiness. Generally the time topay back initial costs increases with lower assumedyields. The estimated yields of the surveyed Miscanthussites are summarized in Table 3. According to the NPVmodel, two sites show a reduction in the gross marginof almost 50% due to patchiness (MG11 and MG20).Total soil organic carbon and Miscanthus-derived carbonThe average total soil organic carbon stocks (SOC t) andthe Miscanthus -derived carbon stocks (SOC Mis) undereither high or low crop density are summarized inTable 4. The ﬁnal two models describing the inﬂuenceof the parameters, former land-use (LU f) and crop den-sity (Dens), on SOC t, and SOC Misare shown in Table 5.Crop density did not show any signiﬁcant inﬂuence onSOCtand was therefore removed in the selection pro-cess of the ﬁrst model. However, Miscanthus ﬁeldsplanted on grassland show signiﬁcantly higher SOC tvalues than ﬁelds planted on former tilled lands.Table 3 Summary of the patchiness estimated using remote sensingFarmField sizeNumber of patchesAverage patch size Total patch area(ha) Total Per ha (m2) (ha)MG11 2.450 859 350.62 5.51 0.47MG18 1.061 389 366.78 2.18 0.08MG20 3.562 1455 408.53 4.72 0.69MT3 3.691 1217 329.69 3.59 0.44MT5 3.631 1491 410.63 3.28 0.49MT6 8.269 3051 368.97 5.78 0.85Fig. 3 Annualized discounted gross margins under differentyield (Mg ha/C01) and patchiness scenarios.(a)(b)(c)Fig. 4 Evolution of ﬁnancial balance over plantation lifetimefor (a) 10.5 Mg ha/C01yr/C01, (b) 12 Mg ha/C01yr/C01, and (c) 13.5Mg ha/C01yr/C01harvested yield for the different patchiness sce-narios (P in % reduction in crop cover).©2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, GCB Bioenergy ,6, 566–576572 J.

The factor LU fhad no signiﬁcantinﬂuence on SOC Misand was therefore removed fromthe second model during the selection process.Table 6 summarizes the estimated reduction inMiscanthus -derived carbon in the top 30 cm of the soilcolumn due to patchiness compared with a non-patchyﬁeld. The average estimated reduction on a ﬁeld scale is7.38% /C67.34 SD. The highest estimated reductions areseen on sites MG20 and MG11. Site MG18 shows thelowest reduction. An exception is site MT3 showing anincrease in Miscanthus -derived carbon with increasingpatchiness.DiscussionThe analysis showed a similar abundance of patches onall surveyed farms. The signiﬁcant correlation betweenGPS based and remote sensing based area measure-ments showed sufﬁcient quality of the measured data.The categorization of the patches described earlierallows for possible explanations for the occurrence ofpatches; (i) linear patches are likely to be explained bycongestions in the rhizome planting machinery, whichhas been reported by landowners (personal communica-tion); (ii) large patches are often situated in depressions(e.g. MG20), suggesting problems with water-logging;and (iii) small randomly distributed patches mightoccur when single rhizomes are damaged duringpre-planting storage, which has been reported by land-owners, and therefore are not able to germinate.Furthermore, small-scale variation in the soil propertiesand poor overwintering might also lead to openpatches. The authors are not aware of another studyquantifying the patchiness in Miscanthus ﬁelds thereforea comparison with other data is not possible, however,similar patchiness of around 25% is reported in com-mercial Miscanthus plantations in Lincolnshire (personalcommunication Blankney Estates Ltd, Blankney, Lin-colnshire, UK).The estimated loss of yield could have a signiﬁcantimpact on the economic viability of Miscanthus planta-tions. The NPV model showed that depending on theexpected yield, patchiness can lead to a signiﬁcantlyreduced gross margin over the whole crop life-cycle. Inparticular, systems with already low baseline yieldsmight not be able to achieve positive gross margins.

Higher levelsof patchiness such as reported in Lincolnshire, UK (25%,personal communication Blankney Estates Ltd) mayeven lead to a two thirds reduction of the gross marginfor farmers, depending on the baseline yield. Theﬁnancial balance approach shows that Miscanthusplantations typically break even after between 4 and11 years, with patchiness being the main reason forlonger amortization times. Increased payback periodsare likely to have a signiﬁcant impact on farmers’ accep-tance of the crop as a possible alternative to conven-tional crops, reﬂecting a typical aversion to commit tolong-term ﬁnancial investments in an uncertain eco-nomic climate and ﬂuctuating commodity prices (Styleset al., 2008; Augustenborg et al., 2012). The ﬁnancial bal-ance model indicates that the economic feasibility of Mi-scanthus is relatively robust to patchiness but does notdiscount future beneﬁts, and may thus provide an ‘opti-mistic’ representation of long-term investments such asMiscanthus establishment.Although soil carbon sequestration has at present nodirect ﬁnancial implications for Miscanthus producers, itis an important ecosystem service as it is recognized asa major greenhouse gas sink (e.g. Smith et al., 2008), andit is likely that in future carbon credits will be allocatedto it. Therefore, maximization of soil carbon sequestra-tion could become an economically, as well as ecologi-cally, advantageous objective.Field measurements showed a signiﬁcant reduction inMiscanthus -derived carbon in open patches, comparedwith directly adjacent high crop density plots. This indi-cates that processes leading to soil carbon sequestrationunder Miscanthus can be categorized into highly local-ized and more extensive ones. Localized contributionsto the soil organic carbon pool are most likely rootexcretions and dead root material, whereas plant litteris generally more evenly distributed especially duringharvest (Beuch, 1999; Kahle et al., 1999). This might alsohave implications for the stability of the carbon seques-tered, which is subject to further research.It has been shown that on a ﬁeld-scale patchiness canlead to a considerable reduction in Miscanthus -derivedcarbon stocks, the only exception being site MT3. How-ever, as MT3 was the ﬁrst site to be sampled during theﬁeld campaign it is possible that open patches were notcorrectly identiﬁed during this early stage of annualgrowth. Total SOC stocks did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween open patches and high crop density. At thisearly stage of crop establishment, Miscanthus -derivedcarbon does not represent a large portion of the overallsoil organic carbon stocks. As shown in Zimmermannet al. (2012), there was no signiﬁcant difference in soilorganic carbon stocks between pre- Miscanthus land-useand Miscanthus plantation. A number of studies haveshown a signiﬁcant shift in the origin of soil organic car-bon under Miscanthus crops (Schneckenberger & Kuzya-kov, 2007; Dondini et al., 2009), indicating that thereduction in Miscanthus -derived carbon input underopen patches might lead to signiﬁcant differences in totalsoil organic carbon stocks during the Miscanthus life-cycle. However, Schneckenberger & Kuzyakov (2007)also found no signiﬁcant differences in total soil organiccarbon contents between grasslands and a 9 year old Mi-scanthus site. Long-term changes in soil organic carbonstocks might therefore depend on the former land-use.As most patches had a high cover of grasses and otherplants, it is therefore possible that losses in Miscanthus -derived carbon will be compensated by inputs of C3-plant derived carbon. To assess the long-term impact ofpatchiness on soil organic carbon stocks it is necessary toconduct further research on older plantations.From an economic point of view it is in the best inter-est of Miscanthus producers to maximize the crop yield.Taking measures to minimize patchiness, such as care-ful soil preparation and planting should be manage-ment priorities. The analysis of remote sensing imageryshowed that it is possible to reduce patchiness by about50% through the avoidance of large patches, thereforesigniﬁcantly reducing the gross margin losses to thefarmer. Depending on the source of patchiness, it maybe possible to replant open patches. However, if under-lying site speciﬁc properties such as waterlogging orsmall-scale variations in soil properties inhibit Miscan-thus growth it may be assumed that the area is unsuit-able for Miscanthus establishment. Replanting smallrandom patches is difﬁcult as they can often not beidentiﬁed due to the height and density of the Miscan-thus vegetation. In addition, in small patches it is difﬁ-cult for young inﬁll plants to establish and survive asthey are outcompeted for light by the more vigorousestablished plants (personal communication, BlankneyEstates). However, it was shown that the contribution ofsmall patches towards overall patchiness is lower thanthat of large patches.This study showed the importance of assessing croppatchiness in Miscanthus stands at the ﬁeld scale espe-cially for economic considerations. Analysis of theimpact of patchiness on crop yield and Miscanthus -derived carbon stocks showed considerable reductionsin both parameters. Using net present value models anda ﬁnancial balance approach, it was shown that mea-sured levels of patchiness can signiﬁcantly reduce grossmargins and can potentially render Miscanthus uneco-nomical for farmers. Especially in Ireland, where cropyields are already relatively low, patchiness can seri-ously undermine the economic viability of this energy©2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, GCB Bioenergy ,6, 566–576574 J.

The study also shows a signiﬁcant reduction intheMiscanthus -derived portion of the soil organic car-bon stocks under open patches. However, long-termstudies are required to assess if this will lead to an over-all reduction in soil organic carbon stocks under Miscan-thus as grasses and weeds growing in the patches mayshow similar soil carbon sequestration rates to Miscan-thus and therefore compensate reductions in soil carbonsequestration.This study assumed a linear relationship betweencrop patchiness and yield losses. It is, however, likelythat competition levels will change on the edges ofpatches and directly affect biomass production andsoil carbon sequestration in the vicinity of patches.Although effects of water, nutrient, and light availabilityare well understood (Beale & Long, 1997; Vleeshouwers,1998), the effects of patchiness on all of these factors arelikely to be highly complex. Light availability is stronglyinﬂuenced by the size of patches as well as the spatialalignment of more linear features (i.e. east-west vs.north-south). Water and food competition are likely tointeract with weed cover and composition in openpatches. Therefore, any current estimate of competitioneffects of patches on adjacent Miscanthus plants islikely subject to large error and requires more detailedresearch.In conclusion, patchiness can be signiﬁcantly reducedthrough careful site selection and preparation, and byavoiding congestions in the planting machinery. Areasthat are prone to waterlogging are unsuitable for Mi-scanthus cultivation and should be avoided. Large openpatches identiﬁed after establishment may be replanted.Randomly occurring small patches are difﬁcult to iden-tify on site, however, their proportion of overall patchi-ness is relatively small and losses in soil carbonsequestration might be compensated by a more abun-dant non-crop vegetation. Overall, further research onthe reasons for and the impacts of crop patchiness inMiscanthus stands will be required to fully understandpossible challenges and beneﬁts.AcknowledgementsWe thank the landowners who granted us access to their prop-erty.
