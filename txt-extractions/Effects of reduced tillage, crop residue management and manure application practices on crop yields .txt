In this context, the effects of different tillage and C input management (residuemanagement and manure application) practices on crop yields, residue C and annual changes in total soilorganic C (SOC) (0–30 cm depth) were investigated ove r one cycle of a 4-year crop rotation (2003–2006)on a cropped Andisol in northern Japan. For tillage pract ices, the effects of reduced tillage (no deep plowing,a single shallow harrowing for seedbed preparation [RT]) and conventional deep moldboard plow tillage(CT) were compared. The combination of RT, residue return and manure application (20 Mg ha)1in eachyear) increased spring wheat and potato yields signiﬁcantly; however, soybean and sugar beet yields werenot inﬂuenced by tillage practices. For all crops studied, manure application enhanced the production ofabove-ground residue C. Thus, manure application served not only as a direct input of C to the soil, butthe greater crop biomass production engendered enhanced subsequent C inputs to the soil from residues.The SOC contents in both the 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm lay ers of the soil proﬁle were greater under RT thanunder CT treatments because the crop residue and manu re were densely incorporated into the shallow soillayers. Comparatively, neither tillage nor C input management practices had signiﬁcant effects on annualchanges in SOC content in either the 10–20 cm or 20– 30 cm layers of the soil proﬁle. When soil C seques-tration rates, as represented by annual changes in t otal SOC (0–30 cm), were assessed on a total soil massbasis, an ANOVA showed that tillage practices had no signiﬁcan t effect on total C sequestration, but C inputmanagement practices had signiﬁcant positive effects ( P£0.05). These results indicate that continuous Cinput to the soil through crop residue return and man ure application is a crucial practice for enhancingcrop yields and soil C sequestration in the Andisol region of northern Japan.Key words: Andisol, crop residue, manure application, reduced tillage, soil carbon sequestration.INTRODUCTIONAgriculture contributes to 10–12% of total globalanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Smith et al.2007). Closely associated with crop and animal pro-duction, CH 4and N 2O are the major greenhouse gasesemitted through agricultural activities (Johnson et al.2007; Smith et al. 2007). In modern highly mechanizedand material-intensive cropping systems, CO 2is alsoemitted from a number of fuel-consuming operations(Koga et al. 2006). In contrast, soil organic C (SOC)sequestration in agricultural lands has recently drawngrowing attention for its promise in mitigating rises inatmospheric CO 2concentrations (Paustian et al. 1997;Smith et al. 2007). In principal, agricultural soils canprovide a large C sink and their SOC can be increasedthrough the implementation of efﬁcient agronomicpractices (Johnson et al. 2007; Ogle et al. 2005; Paustianet al. 1997).The quantity of SOC in agricultural ecosystems isinﬂuenced by a number of factors, such as climate, soilCorrespondence : N.

These factorsinﬂuence the formation an d decomposition of SOC insoil and, thereby, determine soil C sequestration rates.Crop residues, plant roots and organic amendmentsrepresent signiﬁcant sources of C inputs for soil Csequestration. As crop type and agronomic practicessuch as tillage, fertilization and application of organicamendments inﬂuence plant biomass production(Kundu et al. 2007; Sainju et al. 2008), it is importantto understand how residue biomass production isinﬂuenced by different ﬁeld management practices andhow this impacts on soil C sequestration. Meanwhile,SOC is constantly lost from the soil to the atmospherethrough heterotrophic soil respiration. As deep tillageincreases CO2release from the soil (Reicosky andArcher 2007), the implementation of conservationtillage (no till or reduced tillage) appears to be a practicethat can enhance soil C sequestration. Collectively,increasing annual C inputs into soil and/or reducingtillage intensity are crucial in determining soil C seques-tration rates. Over the wide range of agro-ecosystemsworldwide, optimal ﬁeld management practices toenhance soil C sequestration have been studied interms of tillage (Angers et al. 1997; Bayer et al. 2006;Hermle et al. 2008), fertilization (Jagadamma et al.2007; Kundu et al. 2007), residue management (Duikerand Lal 1999), applicatio n of organic amendments(Agbenin and Goladi 1997), crop rotation (Campbellet al. 2000; Su 2007) and combinations thereof(Dolan et al. 2006; Halvorson et al. 2002; Sainju et al.2008).Located in the northern part of Japan, the Tokachiregion of Hokkaido prefecture is Japan’s main centerof production for wheat ( Triticum æstivum L.), potato(Solanum tuberosum L.), beans [adzuki bean, Vignaangularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi; kidney bean,Phaseolus vulgaris L.; soybean, Glycine max Merr.]and sugar beet ( Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris ). In thisregion, where these crops are cultivated in rotation,harvest is followed by the conventional tillage practiceof deep tillage (to a depth of roughly 25 cm) with amoldboard plow, effecting b oth residue incorporationand improving soil structure. The soil structure is alsoaltered as a result of the harvesting of root crops(potato and sugar beet) and by ridge construction forpotatoes. Although local government extension agentsrecommend manure application to maintain soilfertility and crop productiv ity, compound fertilizerscontaining inorganic forms of N, P and K are typicallyused in crop production. Consequently, intensive ﬁeldmanagement systems, such as those implemented in theTokachi region of Hokkaido, may rapidly reduce SOCto contribute to CO2emissions from the soil.Andisols, derived from vo lcanic ash, although notwidely distributed worldwide, are typical of the Tokachiregion, where they constitu te a staple soil in Japanesearable crop production (Shoji et al. 1993). Andisolshave unique chemical (e.g. high organic C contents,presence of metal–humus complexes and high Psorption capacity) and physical (e.g. low bulk densityand high porosity) properties. Given the nature ofJapanese Andisols, they may display unique C dynamicsin terms of soil C sequestration. In fact, in optimizinga soil organic matter turnover model (RothamstedCarbon Model) for Japanese Andisols, special modiﬁ-cations were necessary (Shirato et al. 2004). Therefore,it is important to identify the effects of ﬁeld manage-ment practices on total C inputs to the soil and soil Csequestration, so that Japanese agricultural soils cancontribute to mitigating global warming. However,at present, lacunae exist in our understanding of therelationships between different ﬁeld managementpractices and soil C sequestration in Japanese Andisols.In the present study, optimal ﬁeld management practicesfor soil C sequestration under a spring wheat–potato–soybean–sugar beet rotation on an Andisol in northernJapan were identiﬁed.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy siteA ﬁeld experiment to assess the effects of different tillageand C input management practices on total SOC andother relevant parameters was conducted (crop culti-vation in 2003–2006 and soil sampling in 2003–2007)at the National Agricultural Research Center forHokkaido Region (42 /C17653¢N, 143 /C17603¢E), located in theMemuro township near the center of the Tokachiregion of Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan (Fig. 1).The soil in the ﬁeld was an Andisol (Typic Hapludands),a well-drained volcanic ash-derived soil, typical of thisregion (Soil Survey Staff 2006). The soil texture was aclay loam (sand, 53.1%; silt, 21.9%; clay, 25.0%), andthe initial (2003) mean soil pH was 6.0.Figure 2 shows the monthly precipitation and meanair temperatures over the study period. The annualmean precipitation and air temperature over the studyperiod were 902 mm and 5.8 /C176C, respectively. Based onthe annual precipitation and mean air temperatureat the site, the climate zone was categorized as CoolTemperate Moist (Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange 2006). In winter, the ﬁeld was covered withsnow throughout the study period. The Tokachi regionof Hokkaido is an area where soils freeze in winter(Hirota et al. 2006). In the winters of 2002–2003,2005–2006 and 2006–2007, the soils froze, and the/C2112009 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant NutritionSoil C sequestration on a Japanese Andisol 547maximum soil frost depths were 19, 17 and 25 cm,respectively, whereas the soils hardly froze in thewinters of 2003–2004 and 2004–2005 (Iwata et al.2008). Prior to the ﬁeld experiment, the entire ﬁeldwas cropped to Phacelia ( Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.)in 1998 and to cabbage ( Brassica oleracea L.) in 1999.Both conventional tillage (C T) and reduced tillage (RT)treatments began in 2000 as part of a previous study(Miyazawa et al. 2004).Experimental design and ﬁeld managementOver the 4-year period of 2003–2006, spring wheat(T. æstivum ), potato ( S. tuberosum ), soybean ( G. max )and sugar beet ( B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris ) were cul-tivated in rotation with four different crop sequences(Table 1). In each crop sequence, the ﬁeld experimentwas set up in a split-plot design with two blocks(Table 2), where the main plot factor was tillage withtwo tillage treatments: (1) conventional tillage (CT), (2)reduced tillage (RT). Under CT, following the autumnharvest, deep (25 cm) moldboard plow tillage incorpo-rated the residue and manure (when applied). In earlyspring, seedbed preparation included two shallow(10 cm) harrowings prior to sowing or transplanting.Under RT, moldboard plowing was omitted and only asingle shallow harrowing was carried out in earlyspring for crop residue and manure incorporation aswell as for seedbed preparation. Therefore, under RT,crop residues, which overwintered on the groundsurface, were incorporated into the soil by shallowharrowing.Furthermore, each main plot was divided into foursubplots with different C input management systems(Table 2): (1) removal of all above-ground residuebiomass from the ﬁeld, no manure application (–R), (2)return of residue biomass into soil, no manure application(R), residue return and manure application in (3)autumn (R+FM) or (4) spring (R+SM).

Standard ﬁeld management practicesfor the Tokachi region of Hokkaido were followed,with all subplots receiving granular compound fertilizer(Table 3). A paper-pot transplanting system was used insugar beet production, where 5–6-week-old seedlingsraised in paper pots (13 cm high ·2c m i n d i a m e t e r )were transplanted into the ﬁeld. In 2003 and 2006,some portions of the sugar beet crops were damagedowing to a foliar disease. The area of each subplot was16 m2(4 m ·4 m). In total, 64 subplots (four cropsequences ·two blocks ·two levels of tillage ·fourlevels of C input) were implemented in the ﬁeldexperiment.Plant and manure analysisIn 2003–2006, crop yields and dry-weight basis above-ground residue biomass production at harvest wererecorded. The residue biomass and manure sampleswere oven-dried at 80 /C176C for 3 days and ground to aﬁne powder. The C and N contents of these sampleswere measured by a dry combustion method using anNC analyzer (Sumigraph NC-900; Sumika ChemicalAnalysis Service, Tokyo, Japan). The annual C inputsfrom wheat seeds, seed potatoes, soybean seeds andsugar beet seedlings were equivalent to 60, 200, 25and 1 kg C ha)1, respectively. The paper pots usedfor transplanting sugar beet seedlings contributed16 kg C ha)1. Carbon inputs from fungicides, insecticidesand herbicides were not considered.Soil sampling and analysisSoil samples, taken between planted rows in early Juneof each year from 2003 to 2007, were drawn from fourdifferent layers of the soil proﬁle: 0–5, 5–10, 10–20and 20–30 cm. In each subplot, ﬁve soil subsampleswere taken from each depth using a hand auger (4 cmdiameter) and bulked in the ﬁeld. The compositesamples were then passed through a 2 mm sieve andair-dried in a dark and cool room for 1 month. Aftervisible plant and manure d ebris were removed usingforceps, air-dried soil samples were ground to a ﬁnepowder. For these samples, the moisture contents weredetermined by drying at 105 /C176C, and the C contentswere measured using an NC analyzer (SumigraphNC-900). As the soil was slightly acidic (pH 6.0), andlime had not been applied to the ﬁeld, the total C inthe soil was considered to be equivalent to SOC. Formeasuring soil bulk densities, irrespective of cropsequences and C input management treatments, 10subplots were randomly selected from each CT and RTtreatment. In each selected subplot, soil core sampleswere taken annually for the four soil layers (0–5, 5–10,10–20 and 20–30 cm) in early June of every year.Table 2 Tillage and carbon input management factorsFactor TreatmentTillage (main plot factor)†Conventional tillage (CT)Reduced tillage (RT)Carbon input management (subplot factor) Removal of above-ground crop residues ( )R)Return of all crop residues (R)Return of all crop residues + manure application in autumn (R+FM)Return of all crop residues + manure application in spring (R+SM)†Both the CT and RT treatments began in 2000 as part of another study (Miyazawa et al. 2004).Table 3 Crops, varieties, planting densities, fertilizer application rates and times of sowing and harvestingCrop VarietyRow spacing(cm)Planting density†(plant m)2)Fertilizer application rate‡Sowing or transplanting HarvestingN§P2O5K2O(kg ha)1)Spring wheat Haruyutaka 30 16.0 80 200 120 Late April Early AugustPotato Kita-akari 72 4.6 64 (12) 160 336 Early May Early SeptemberSoybean Toyomusume 66 15.2 30 250 130 Late May Early OctoberSugar beet Abend 66 7.6 144 (66) 240 144 Late April Mid October†In g seeds m)2for spring wheat.‡All subplots received granular compound fertilizer, depending on the crop.§The main form of N applied wasammonium-N.

Thetotal SOC at a depth of 0–30 cm was calculated on asoil-mass-weighted basis (Ellert and Bettany 1995) bysumming total SOC for all soil depths. As soil bulkdensities were inﬂuenced by tillage treatments andsampling years in the ﬁeld experiment, it was necessaryto eliminate the effect of such changes in soil bulkdensities on the calculations of total SOC over thestudy period. For this purpose, the length of the 20–30 cmlayer was changed for the 2004–2007 soil samples sothat the total soil mass in 2004–2007 would equal themean total soil mass (0–30 cm) in 2003 (2,601 Mg ha)1for CT and 2,765 Mg ha)1for RT). Annual changes inSOC contents (0–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm) andtotal SOC (0–30 cm) over the period of 2003–2007were calculated from the relationship between samplingyears, and SOC contents or total SOC in the corre-sponding years by linear regression analysis for eachsubplot.Statistical analysesFor each crop, the effects of cultivation year, tillage(CT and RT) and C input management practices (–R,R, R+FM and R+SM) on crop yields and the annualproduction of above-ground residue biomass C weretested byANOVA . The effects of sampling years and till-age practices on soil bulk densities were tested foreach soil depth byANOVA . Annual changes in SOCcontents (0–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm) and totalSOC (0–30 cm) were also tested with crop sequences,tillage and C input management byANOVA . All statisticalanalyses were carried out using R (R DevelopmentCore Team 2008).RESULTSCrop yieldsCarbon input management practices (i.e. residue incor-poration and manure applicat ion) signiﬁcantly inﬂuencedthe harvestable yield bio mass production in springwheat ( P£0.001), potato ( P£0.001), soybean ( P£0.05)and sugar beet ( P£0.05) (Tables 4,5). In R+FM andR+SM, manure application increased yield biomassproduction. Yield reduction resulting from residueremoval was more pronounced in spring wheat than inthe other three crops. The effects of tillage on cropyields were signiﬁcant for spring wheat ( P£0.05) andpotato ( P£0.01). Spring wheat and potato yields wereimproved by RT. These crops have a relatively shortgrowing period (3–4 months) from planting to harvest-ing, and yields in such crops may be vulnerable to soilnutrient status (e.g. N and P) at planting. Given thatcrop residues and manure were densely incorporatedinto the surface soil layer in the RT treatments, it wasexpected that the nutrient concentrations in the soilsurface would be higher in RT soils than CT soils atplanting.

Largequantities of residue C were produced by spring wheat(1.73–2.26 Mg C ha)1year)1) and sugar beet (1.73–2.14 Mg C ha)1year)1), whereas very low residue C wasnoted for potato production (0.15–0.21 Mg C ha)1year)1).Soybean displayed an intermediate residue C produc-tion (1.12–1.26 Mg C ha)1year)1). The ANOVA resultsshowed that tillage had no signiﬁcant effect on residuebiomass C, but C input management practices ( )R, R,R+FM and R+SM) had signiﬁcant effects (Table 7). Aver-aged across the four crops, the quantities of C retained inthe residues ranged from 1.23 ± 0.69 Mg C ha)1year)1for CT ·()R) to 1.42 ± 0.81 Mg C ha)1year)1forRT·(R+FM) in a single year (Table 6). Continuousmanure application in R+FM and R+SM increased thetotal C in the crop residue biomass. Mean residue Cwas 8 and 6% higher for R+FM and R+SM than for R,respectively, under the CT system, whereas it was 14and 12% higher, respectively, under the RT system.Conversely, decreases in residue C by the removal ofcrop residues from the ﬁel d were most pronounced inspring wheat.In R+FM and R+SM, cattle dairy manure wasapplied annually at a rate of 20 Mg ha)1on a fresh-weight basis (Table 8). The rate of direct annual Cinputs from manure, expressed on a C basis, wasequivalent to 1.39 ± 0.22 Mg C ha)1year)1. The C/Nratios of the manure samples used varied from 12.6to 20.0.The total annual C inputs from crop residue biomassand dairy manure are summarized in Table 9. As cropresidues were removed and no manure was applied inthe –R subplots, actual C inputs from residue biomass(except for below-ground biomass) and manure intothe soil were assumed to be zero. In R, the annual Cinputs were derived from crop residues, accountingfor 1.31 ± 0.75 and 1.25 ± 0.69 Mg C ha)1year)1forCT and RT, respectively (these yearly variations werederived from the variations between crops). Largertotal C inputs, approximately 2.8 Mg C ha)1year)1,occurred because of direct C inputs from composteddairy manure and increased C inputs as a result ofimproved above-ground residue biomass production.Soil bulk densities under CT and RTThe effect of different tillage practices on soil bulkdensities was tested byANOVA for soil samples takenTable 6 Above-ground residue biomass carbon production under different tillage and carbon input management practices(Mg C ha)1year)1)†Crop Residue biomassConventional tillage Reduced tillage)R‡R R+FM R+SM )R‡R R+FM R+SMSpring wheat Straw, stubble and husks 1. 73 1.95 2.05 2.02 1.80 1.94 2.26 2.18Potato Stems and leaves 0.16 0.15 0.21 0.19 0.17 0.17 0.18 0.18Soybean Stems, leaves, stubbleand pods1.12 1.14 1.22 1.23 1.13 1.17 1.24 1.26Sugar beet Leaves 1.92 1.99 2.14 2.10 1.87 1.73 1.99 1.96Annual mean§1.23 (0.69) 1.31 (0.75) 1.41 (0.78) 1.39 (0.77) 1.24 (0.68) 1.25 (0.69) 1.42 (0.81) 1.40 (0.78)†Means of 2003–2006.‡It is important to note that the actual C inputs from above-ground residue biomass were zero in )R.§Mean (± standarddeviation) over the four crops. –R, removal of above-ground crop residues; R, return of all crop residues; R+FM, return of all cropresidues + manure application in autumn; R+SM, return of all crop residues + manure application in spring.Table 7 ANOVA results for the above-ground residue biomass carbon productionCrop Y T CI Y ·TY ·CI T ·CI Y ·T·CISpring wheat ns ns *** ns * ns nsPotato * ns ** * ns ns nsSoybean * ns ** * ns ns nsSugar beet * ns * ns ns ns ns*P<0 . 0 5 ;* * P< 0.01; *** P< 0.001; ns, not signiﬁcant; CI, carbon input; T, tillage; Y, year./C2112009 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant NutritionSoil C sequestration on a Japanese Andisol 551from CT and RT plots over the period of 2003–2007(Table 10). For the 0–5 cm soil layer, the mean bulkdensities of CT and RT soils were similar, mainlybecause both soils were subject to shallow harrowingevery spring for seedbed preparation. However, thebulk densities of the 5–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm soillayers were greater in RT soils than in CT soils(P£0.05). This difference could be attributed to thecontinuous moldboard plowing in CT soils. The deeperthe soil layers were the greater the soil bulk densities,regardless of tillage practices.Annual changes in SOC contents and storageThe dry-weight basis SOC contents in the initial year(2003) and annual changes in the SOC contents from2003 to 2007 are presented in Table 11.

Koga and H. Tsujimean C contents ranged from 30.8 to 40.3 g kg)1across all soil layers and treatments. Large variations inSOC contents already existed in 2003. The rates ofannual changes in soil C contents varied with soillayers and ﬁeld management practices. As above-groundresidues and dairy manure were densely incorporatedinto the shallow soil layers in RT, the mean SOCcontents at 0–5 and 5–10 cm depths increased in the R,R+FM and R+SM subplots. Similarly, the SOC contentin the shallow soil layer increased in R+SM under CTbecause the manure applied in spring was incorporatedby shallow harrowing, even with CT. In the –R subplots,where crop residues were withdrawn from the ﬁeld, theSOC contents decreased rapidly at all soil layers. Evenwith no physical soil disturbance at the deeper soillayers by deep tillage under RT, the largest decrease in theSOC contents occurred at the 20–30 cm depth. TheANOVA results showed that neither crop sequence nortillage had signiﬁcant effects on annual changes in SOCcontents at all soil layers (Table 12). Meanwhile, the0–5 and 5–10 cm depth SOC contents were signiﬁcantfor C input management ( P£0.05).In 2003, CT and RT plots bore 2,601 ± 118 and2,765 ± 104 Mg ha)1of the soil mass, respectively,to a 30 cm depth, and housed 86.9 ± 11.2 to98.9 ± 10.6 Mg C ha)1in total SOC reserves in a rangeacross CT and RT (Table 13). Given that the annualchanges in total SOC (0–30 cm) were evaluated basedon the mean soil mass in CT and RT in the initialyear, in R under CT (conventional management forthis region), the total SOC was declining at a rate of0 . 7 1±1 . 0 4M gCh a)1year)1(0.8% mean annual reduc-tion).

The effects of con-servation tillage (no till and RT) on crop yields inJapanese Andisol ﬁelds have been studied for theirbeneﬁts in saving costs, labor and fuel (Koga et al.2006; Miyazawa et al. 2004). Better crop yields underRT compared with CT have already been reported forspring wheat in Hokkaido (Miyazawa et al. 2004) andfor summer crops (e.g. maize and soybean) in Tsukuba,central Japan (Tsuji et al. 2006). In contrast, similaryields between the two tillage practices have beennoted for soybean, maize and sugar beet in Hokkaido(Miyazawa et al. 2004; Ogawa et al. 1988) and formaize and barley in Tokyo and Niigata prefectures incentral Japan (Sakai et al. 1994). In our ﬁeld experi-ment, higher spring wheat and potato yields wereobtained under RT than under CT, whereas soybeanand sugar beet yields did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween CT and RT (Table 4), even when RT impactedsoil properties such as soil bulk densities (Table 10) andvertical SOC content proﬁles (Table 11). Greater orequal crop yields under RT in various studies in Japanindicate that RT is a promising conservation tillagepractice that would not sacriﬁce crop yields in Japan’sAndisol ﬁelds. In terms of no-till soil management inJapan, there are some reports on yield reductionsowing to germination, weed and soil temperatureproblems (Sakai et al. 1994; Tsuji et al. 2006). In theTokachi region, signiﬁcant effects of C input manage-ment (residue management and manure application)on crop yields were noted in spring wheat, potato,soybean and sugar beet (Tables 4,5). These resultsindicate that a combination of RT, residue return andmanure application is the optimal practice for springwheat and potato yields. Meanwhile, residue return andmanure application, independent of tillage practices,are recommended for soybean and sugar beet to obtainhigher yields in this region.Annual carbon inputs as affected by ﬁeldmanagement practicesOrganic amendments and residue biomass componentsfrom crop production are the principal inputs for soil Csequestration, but inputs of the latter are inﬂuencedby crop species, cropping systems and a number ofagronomic practices (Bolinder et al. 2007; Paustianet al. 1997). One way to increase C inputs is to usehigh-residue-producing crops in the cropping system.Johnson et al. (2006) reported mean annual residue Cproduction for major ﬁeld crops in the USA; 3.12, 1.46,1.07 and 1.49 Mg C ha)1year)1for corn ( Zea mays L.),wheat, soybean and sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor (L.)Moench), respectively. Under the crop rotation systemimplemented in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, theproduction of residue C varied widely among the crops(Table 6). Spring wheat and sugar beet represented highresidue C production (~2 Mg C ha)1year)1), althoughlower than that of corn in the USA. In contrast, residueC was very low in potatoes (< 0.2 Mg C ha)1year)1).Low C inputs from potato residues may illustrate thatSOC is lost from the soil rapidly through conventionalpotato production.In previous studies, different residue biomass pro-duction, depending on fertilization practices, contributedto different soil C sequestration rates (Campbell et al.Table 13 Effects of different tillage and carbon input management practices on annual changes in total soil organic carbon(0–30 cm)†Conventional tillage Reduced tillage)R R R+FM R+SM )R R R+FM R+SMTotal SOC in 2003(Mg C ha)1)‡86.9 (11.2) 88.4 (11.4) 90.8 (11. 8) 90.2 (11.8) 92.6 (9.9) 95.1 ( 10.3) 95.3 (10.3) 98.9 (10.6)Annual change in totalSOC (Mg C ha)1year)1)§)1.45 (1.32) )0.71 (1.04) )0.60 (1.17) )0.14 (0.66) )1.58 (1.11) )0.42 (0.75) )0.35 (1.16) )0.49 (1.02)†The total soil organic carbon (SOC) (0–30 cm) in each year was assessed on a soil mass basis.

Koga and H. Tsuji2000; Kundu et al. 2007). Kundu et al. (2007) reportedthat annual C inputs from soybean residues variedwidely, depending on fertilization regimes. In theirstudy, no fertilization and a lack of P or K markedlydecreased the input of residue C, whereas farmyardmanure application increased residue C signiﬁcantly,resulting in signiﬁcantly greater soil C sequestrationrates. Likewise, annual inputs of residue C in theTokachi region were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the Cinput management practices for all crops studied; inparticular, manure application increased the C retainedin the residue biomass by 6–14% compared withsimple residue incorporation (Table 6). These resultsindicate that manure application serves not only as apractice for direct C inputs into soil, but also as apractice that indirectly increases C input from residuebiomass as a result of greater biomass production.Conversely, continuous residue removal was an unfavo-rable practice. Residue removal not only causes a lackof input of above-ground residue C, but also lowers theproduction of residue biomass C to be returned to thesoil in the following years.Relationship between tillage and soil carbonsequestration on a Japanese AndisolSoil tillage has long been widely practiced as a methodfor controlling weeds, preparing seedbeds and improvingsoil physical conditions (Franzluebbers 2004). As thispractice principally inﬂuences the depths to which cropresidues and organic amendments are incorporated,as well as physical soil properties, the subsequentformation/decomposition of soil organic matter is alsoaltered. In the context of current global warmingissues, alternative tillage practices that would allow thesequestration of more C in soil have been intensivelystudied. However, few studies have investigated theeffects of tillage on soil C sequestration in Japanesesoils.The relationships between no till and soil Csequestration have been extensively studied globally(Franzluebbers 2005; Paustian et al.1 9 9 7 ;W e s ta n dPost 2002). Greater SOC under no till than underCT was noted in more than 90% of observations insoutheastern USA (Franzluebbers 2005). Paustian et al.(1997) also reported that in temperate zones SOC was8% greater, on average, under no till than under CT.The impacts of RT on soil C sequestration have alsobeen assessed in terms of shallow tillage (Halvorsonet al. 2002; Hermle et al. 2008) and chisel-basedreduced tillage (Bayer et al. 2006; Dolan et al. 2006) asopposed to conventional tillage, although the soil depthconsidered differed from study to study. In previousstudies, there are some reports showing no signiﬁcantpositive effects of RT on soil C sequestration, forexample, shallow tillage on a Swiss Luvisol (Hermleet al. 2008), chisel-based reduced tillage on BrazilianCerrado soils (Bayer et al. 2006) and for a Minnesotasoil (Dolan et al. 2006). In contrast, Halvorson et al.(2002) obtained two different results on the effects ofshallow tillage on soil C sequestration: a positive effectfor an annual crop rotation system, but no signiﬁcanteffect for a spring wheat–fallow system. This contradic-tory result arose from the effect of different croppingsystems on the levels of total residue return.In the present study, shallow tillage served as areduced tillage practice in assessing soil C sequestra-tion. The main reason for shallow tillage was that atleast one harrowing was necessary for seedbed prepara-tion and no till is not, therefore, applicable because thesoil surface became rough and uneven after harvestingof root crops such as sugar beet and potato in theTokachi region’s crop rotation system. For the Tokachiregion’s Andisol, RT had no signiﬁcant positive effectson annual changes in total SOC and soil C sequestration(Table 12).Reduced tillage increased the SOC contents in theshallow soil layers (0–5 and 5–10 cm depths; Table 11)when crop residues and manure were returned to theﬁeld. This may illustrate that more SOC is sequesteredunder RT than under CT in the shallow soil layersgiven the signiﬁcant C input from residues and manure.In contrast, in the deep soil layer of 20–30 cm, theSOC contents under RT decreased rapidly, despite thefact that this deep soil layer did not undergo any physicalsoil disturbance by plowing. Consequently, this rapiddecrease in the SOC contents in the deeper soil layermight deny the positive effects of RT on higher soil Csequestration in the shallow soil layers. The soil at thestudy site was a well-drained Andisol and the meansoil bulk densities for the 20–30 cm soil layer werelow (0.93 Mg m)3for CT and 0.97 Mg m)3for RT)compared with other clayey soils throughout theworld. The porous nature of the Andisol might haveled to high air permeability, even into the deep soillayer, and an attendant rapid decomposition of soilorganic matter through heterotrophic respiration. Interms of implementing RT in the Tokachi region, RThad no positive effects on soil C sequestration, but itshould be noted that spring wheat and potato yieldswere increased by RT (Table 4) and total fuel consump-tion was signiﬁcantly reduced by not plowing (Kogaet al. 2006).Residue incorporation and manure applicationfor soil carbon sequestrationIncreasing the total C input from plant residue biomass(Duiker and Lal 1999; Sainju et al. 2008) and organicamendments (Agbenin and Goladi 1997) is crucial to/C2112009 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant NutritionSoil C sequestration on a Japanese Andisol 555soil C sequestration. Duiker and Lal (1999) demon-strated that SOC contents were positively correlatedwith the quantity of wheat straw added (0–16 Mg ha)1).As presented in Table 9, in the Tokachi region’s Andisolﬁeld, total annual C inputs from above-ground residuesand manure varied between treatments (0 Mg C ha)1year)1for residue removal, 1.3 Mg C ha)1year)1forresidue incorporation and 2.8 Mg C ha)1year)1forresidue incorporation and manure application). In theTokachi region’s Andisol ﬁeld, soil C sequestration wasenhanced, according to the increasing annual C inputsfrom the residue biomass and dairy manure applied(Tables 12,13).Despite the signiﬁcant C inputs from crop residuesand manure (2.8 Mg C ha)1year)1at the maximum),the mean annual changes in total SOC were all negative(Table 13). This illustrates that further C input isnecessary to maintain SOC across the 0–30 cm soildepth in the Tokachi region’s Andisol ﬁelds. Accordingto the modiﬁed Rothamsted C model for Andisols(topsoil, 0–15 or 17.5 cm soil depth), the annual Cinput needed to maintain the initial SOC at equilibriumwas reported to be 2.5–4.1 Mg C ha)1for four sitesfrom Japanese Andisol ﬁelds (Shirato et al. 2004). Theresults of this model indicate that more C input isnecessary to maintain total SOC if 0–30 cm depth soilis considered in the model. In contrast, in an Indiansandy loam soil (5–10 g kg)1of SOC contents), only0.3 Mg C ha)1year)1of C inputs was required tomaintain SOC (0–45 cm depth; Kundu et al. 2007).Hence, Japanese Andisols with relatively high SOCcontents might require large quantities of C inputs tomaintain total SOC. On this basis, agronomic practicesto attain further C inputs to the soil are cruciallyimportant to maintain SOC in Andisols in the Tokachiregion. For example, possible options under an actualcrop rotation system in the Tokachi region are increasingmanure application rates, introducing high-residue-producing crops in the rotation system and growinggreen manure crops in the fallow period. More impor-tantly, the use of a better combination of these possibleoptions would be good practice to ensure that soil inthe Tokachi region can be a net sink of C.ConclusionIn an Andisol ﬁeld in the Tokachi region of northernJapan, the effects of RT, residue management andmanure application practices on soil C sequestrationwere studied so that Japanese agricultural soil couldcontribute to both sustainable food production andmitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through soil Csequestration. The response of crop yields to thesepractices differed from crop to crop. Increases in cropyields under RT were noted in spring wheat and potatocrops. Yield biomass production was enhanced bycontinuous residue return and manure application forall crops. In the Andisol ﬁeld, RT had no positiveeffects on overall soil C sequestration (0–30 cm). Incontrast, a combination of residue return and manureapplication exerted a beneﬁcial impact on increasingresidue C and decelerating the loss of SOC. Theseresults illustrate the importance of continuous residuereturn and manure application for sustainable foodproduction and soil C sequestration in an Andisol inthe Tokachi region’s crop rotation system.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was ﬁnancially supported by the Ministry ofAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Evalua-tion, Adaptation and Mitigation of Global Warmingin Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research andDevelopment).
