The aim of the present study was to test current hypothesesconcerning the epibiont’s chemoautotrophy, and the mutualistic character of this association. In-vivo experiments were carried out in a pressurised aquarium with isotope-labelled inorganic carbon(NaH13CO 3and NaH14CO 3) in the presence of two different electron donors (Na 2S2O3and Fe2þ) andwith radiolabelled organic compounds (14C-acetate and3H-lysine) chosen as potential bacterialsubstrates and/or metabolic by-products in experiments mimicking transfer of small biomoleculesfrom epibionts to host. The bacterial epibionts were found to assimilate inorganic carbon bychemoautotrophy, but many of them (thick filaments of epsilonproteobacteria ) appeared versatileand able to switch between electron donors, including organic compounds (heterotrophic acetateand lysine uptake). At least some of them (thin filamentous gammaproteobacteria ) also seem capableof internal energy storage that could supply chemosynthetic metabolism for hours under conditionsof electron donor deprivation. As direct nutritional transfer from bacteria to host was detected, theassociation appears as true mutualism. Import of soluble bacterial products occurs by permeationacross the gill chamber integument, rather than via the digestive tract. This first demonstrationof such capabilities in a decapod crustacean supports the previously discarded hypothesis oftranstegumental absorption of dissolved organic matter or carbon as a common nutritional pathway.The ISME Journal (2013) 7,96–109; doi:10.1038/ismej.2012.87; published online 23 August 2012Subject Category:microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactionsKeywords: autoradiography; chemosynthetic ectosymbiosis; Crustacea; isotopes; Rimicaris exoculata ;transtegumental transferIntroductionMostly described as endosymbioses (Dubilier et al. ,2008), associations between invertebrates and chemo-autotrophic bacteria are regularly encountered inreducing marine habitats (Cavanaugh et al. , 2006).Among the Crustacea, chemosynthetic epibioses arereported in only a few hydrothermal decapods: theshrimp Rimicaris exoculata (Segonzac et al. , 1993),the galatheid crabs Kiwa hirsuta (Macpherson et al. ,2005; Goffredi et al. , 2008), Kiwa puravida (Thurberet al. , 2011), and Shinkaia crosnieri (Miyake et al. ,2007), and two amphipods from littoral sediments(Gillan and Dubilier, 2004; Gillan et al. , 2004) andsulphide-rich caves (Dattagupta et al. , 2009). Mostof these associations are regarded as nutritionalectosymbioses, but to date, there is little directevidence of bacterial autotrophy and no directdemonstration of mutualistic nutritional bacteria–host interactions.Correspondence: P Compe `re, Laboratoire de Morphologie fonction-nelle et e ´volutive, De ´partement de Biologie, Ecologie et Evolution,Centre MARE, Universite ´de Lie `ge, 4000 Sart-Tilman, Lie `ge, BelgiumE-mail: pcompere@ulg.ac.beReceived 30 January 2012; revised 18 June 2012; accepted 20 June2012; published online 23 August 2012The ISME Journal (2013) 7, 96–109&2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/13www.nature.com/ismejThe shrimp R. exoculata (Williams and Rona,1986) dominates the megafauna of several deep-seahydrothermal vent sites of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,forms dense aggregates around active chimneys(Segonzac, 1992) and harbours a luxuriant bacterialcommunity in its enlarged gill chamber (Van Doveret al. , 1988; Casanova et al. , 1993; Segonzac et al. ,1993; Polz and Cavanaugh, 1995; Zbinden et al. ,2004) (Figure 1).

The shrimpR. exoculata , listed as a model organism of an extremedeep-sea environment (CAREX, 2010), is exceptionalamong crustaceans for its association with bacteria.Recent studies suggest that R. exoculata gill chamberepibionts constitute a diversified community withvarious morphotypes, phylotypes and metabolisms(Zbinden et al. , 2004, 2008; Petersen et al. , 2009;Hu¨gler et al. , 2011; Guri et al. , 2012), but no studyhas directly demonstrated which substrate(s) thebacteria oxidise to fuel their ‘chemosynthetic’ meta-bolism(s). This shrimp also harbours a digestivebacterial community (Zbi nden and Cambon-Bonavita,2003; Durand et al. , 2010) whose role remains hypo-thetical (detoxification, nutrition and/or pathogencontrol).There is strong evidence, based on stable isotopesignatures and essential fatty acid composition,suggesting that the shrimp gets organic mattermainly from its epibionts, rather than from grazingfree-living bacteria associated with chimney walls(Gebruk et al. , 1993; Pond et al. , 1997a, 2000;Rieley et al. , 1999; Colac ¸oet al. , 2007). Yet thisevidence of symbiont–host nutritional relation-ships is indirect, and how carbon is transferredfrom bacteria to shrimp remains an open question.The hypothesis of direct transfer of dissolvedmolecules across the shrimp integument, especiallythe gill chamber lining, has been proposed onthe basis of morphological observations (featuresdedicated to bacteria farming, absence of scrapemarks on the biofilm) (Zbinden et al. , 2004; Corbariet al. , 2008b), but the nature of the transferredmolecules and the integument areas involvedremain to be discovered.The major aims of this study were to test(1) inorganic carbon fixation by active bacterialchemosynthetic metabolisms and (2) the hypothesisof bacterial organic carbon transfer (soluble mole-cules) to the shrimp tissues. For this, we incubatedlive shrimps in a pressurised vessel with differentisotope-labelled molecules and electron donors, totrace carbon assimilation by the epibionts andshrimp tissues.Materials and methodsShrimp collectionR. exoculata specimens were collected with theslurp-gun operated from the manned submersibleNautile at the Rainbow hydrothermal vent site(361140N–33 1540W, 2320 m depth) during the‘MoMARDREAM-Naut’ cruise, July 2007. Healthyspecimens were maintained alive in a pressurisedIPOCAMP incubator (Shillito et al. , 2001) at in-situpressure (230 bars) and temperature (15 1C) forin-vivo experiments (Zbinden et al. , 2008). Controlspecimens were directly frozen at /C0801C aftercollection.ExperimentsExperiments were carried out only on red-colouredpre-ecdysial specimens (that is, having an estab-lished and still-growing bacterial community)(Corbari et al. , 2008b). In the IPOCAMP, incubationswith isotopic tracers were carried out in flasks filledtill to the top with seawater (SW), whose volume (50or 250 ml) was chosen according to the treatmentduration and number of shrimps to ensure shrimpsurvival in good physiological condition at the endof the experiment (Shillito et al. , 2001; Ravaux et al. ,2003). Incorporation of13C- and14C-bicarbonate bythe chemoautotrophic bacteria was tested withdifferent chemical energy sources.14C-acetate and3H-lysine were chosen as representative microbialsubstrates and/or metabolic by-products liable tomimic transfer of small biomolecules from epibiontsto host.After each experiment, tracer excess was washedoff in 0.22- mm-filtered SW: 15 min for13C and 1, 5and 30 s, 5 and 15 min for the other experiments.The shrimps were then either directly frozen at/C0801C or dissected into body parts and tissues ofinterest: (1) regions colonised by the bacteria: thebranchiostegites (integument folds enclosing the gillchamber), later separated into the inner bacterialbiofilm ( BB) and the outer branchiostegite ( OB)o rshrimp tissues, and the mouthparts ( MP, scaphog-nathites and exopodites); (2) exchange or absorptionorgans: gills ( Gi), digestive tract ( DT) and hepato-pancreas ( HP); (3) abdominal muscles ( Mu). In somespecimens, the old abdominal cuticle ( AC) wasseparated from the inner tissues (new cuticle andepidermis). In the laboratory, the samples wererinsed once again (see below) and treated to removeunfixed tracers and to preserve the labelled organicmolecules before quantification.13C-bicarbonate incorporation . Four and twoshrimps were incubated for 4 and 10 h, respectively,in 250-ml flasks containing 1 g/L NaH13CO 3(98%;Sigma 372382; St Louis, MO, USA) in filtered SWenriched or not (control) with iron (100 mMFeCl 2;Sigma 372870) or thiosulphate (100 mMNa 2S2O3;Sigma 72049) as chemical energy source. Before use,the dissected tissue samples were rinsed three timesin distilled water before dehydration overnight at601C. Dried samples were finely ground to obtain apowder to vaporise in the mass spectrometer.14C-bicarbonate incorporation . Two specimenswere incubated for 6 h in 50-ml flasks containing0.25 g/L NaH12CO 3labelled with 80 mMNaH14CO 3(4mCi/ml; GE Healthcare CFA3-5MCI; Buckingham-shire, UK) as inorganic carbon source and dissolvedin SW enriched or not with an electron donor (Fe2þor Na 2S2O3) at the same concentration as above. Thefirst shrimp for each condition was directly frozenat/C0801C for autoradiography and scintillationanalysis. The second shrimp was dissected intobody parts as described above before storage inCarbon uptake by a vent shrimp and its bacteriaJ Ponsard et al98The ISME Journalcryotubes at /C0801C. In unlabelled shrimps (con-trol), the radioactivity level was undetectable to verylow in both bacterial mats and shrimp tissues.In the laboratory, the samples were rinsed fourtimes in distilled water and their fresh weightwas determined. After overnight digestion at50–55 1C in glass scintillation vials containing 1 mlquaternary ammonium hydroxide (0.5 N) in toluene(BTS-450 Tissue Solubilizer; Beckman Coulter580691; Fullerton, CA, USA), they were acidifiedfor 2 h at room temperature by adding 250 ml aceticacid to remove any remaining14C-bicarbonate andthe calcium carbonate present in the cuticle orHP. Scintillation liquid (Ready Organic; BeckmanCoulter 586600) (10 ml) was added to all samplesjust before reading.14C-acetate and3H-lysine incorporation . Two setsof three to four shrimps were incubated for 1 h in50 ml SW containing either 20 mCi/ml3H-lysine (GEHealthcare TRK520-1MCI) (that is, 0.2 mM)o r1 0 mCi/ml sodium14C-acetate (GE Healthcare CFA14-1MCI)(that is, 0.2 m M). In both experiments, one entirespecimen was immediately frozen after rinsing (forautoradiography and analysis). The others weredissected and the pieces stored at /C0801C. Sampleswere treated as in the14C-bicarbonate experiment.Stable isotope and elemental analysisThe atomic percentage of stable isotope (% at13C) ofeach sample and its carbon content expressed as apercentage of dry weight (%C dw) were obtained withan isotope ratio spectrometer (Optima, Isoprime,UK) coupled to an elemental analyser (Carlo Erba,Milan, Italy) (Lepoint et al. , 2004).The percentage of natural13C in control shrimpswas first subtracted from the measured13C percen-tage in each sample to obtain the percentage of13C(or total carbon) incorporated during the experi-ment (%at13Cinc). Carbon incorporation rates (C inc),expressed in moles of carbon incorporated per timeunit and weight unit of total carbon in the sample(mmolCinc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01), were calculated accordingto the formulas:%at13Cinc/C1DW sam/C1%Cdw ðÞ ¼ W13CincW13Cinc/MM CDW sam/C1%Cdw ðÞ /C1 t¼Cincwhere % at13Cincis atomic percentage of incorporated13C; DW samis the dry weight of the sample, %C dwisthe carbon content expressed as a percentage of dryweight, DW sam.%C dwis the weight of carbon in thesample, W13Cincis the weight of13C incorporatedinto the sample during the experiment, MM Cis themolar mass of carbon, tis the duration of theexperiment, and C incis the carbon incorporationrate expressed in moles of incorporated carbon pertime unit and weight unit of total carbon in thesample.Measurement of incorporated radioactivityThe beta-radioactivity of the samples was measuredfor 15 min in liquid phase in a Beckman LS 6500Scintillation Counter (effective resolution: 0.06 keV).Moles of incorporated radioelement are knownfrom the measured number of disintegrationsper second (disintegrations per second /C22 half-lifein seconds/Avogadro’s number). The total incor-poration rate, expressed in moles of incorporatedmolecules per time unit and weight unit of totalcarbon in the sample ( mmolRinc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01), wascalculated according to the formula:xEinc/f ðÞFW sam/C1p ðÞ /C1 %Cdw ½/C138 /C1 t¼RincwherexEincis the number of moles of incorporatedradioelement, fis the ratio of radioactive to coldmolecules in the incubation medium, FW samis thefresh weight of the sample, pis the dry weight/freshweight ratio measured on control shrimps, %C dwisthe carbon content expressed as a percentage ofsample dry weight, and R incis the total incorpora-tion rate expressed in moles of incorporated mole-cules per time unit and weight of total carbon in thesample.AutoradiographyHistological localisation of radiotracers was done byautoradiography on frozen shrimps incubated with aradiotracer. To isolate shrimp segments, each frozenshrimp was embedded in Tissue-Tek gel (Sakura4583; Torrance, CA, USA), directly frozen in liquidnitrogen, and cut into segments 1 cm long with ahacksaw in a cryostat at /C0201C. Segments of thecephalothorax (including MP and gills) and theabdomen were directly thawed overnight in fixativesolution (2.5% glutaraldehyde), decalcified in EDTA(0.2M, pH 8), post-fixed in 1% OsO 4for 2 h, rinsed indistilled water (4 /C210 min), dehydrated with etha-nol, and embedded in Steedman’s wax (polyethy-lene glycol distearate; Sigma 305413—hexadecanol9:1; 99%; Sigma 258741). Twelve-micrometre cross-sections were obtained with a microtome (Reichert,Austria) at three levels ( MP, gills and abdominalmuscles) and deposited on gelatinised glass slides.They were rehydrated, washed in distilled waterand then coated with a photographic emulsionfilm (Hypercoat LM-1; GE Healthcare RPN40) inthe dark according to the classical wet method(Ullberg et al. , 1982). The slides were developedwith KODAK products (KODAK D19-Revelatorand KODAK-Fixator; Rochester, NY, USA) afteran exposure time of 6–9 months for14C-bicarbonateor 6 h to 3 months for14C-acetate and3H-lysine.The slides were mounted in epoxy resin beforebeing observed and photographed with an OlympusAX70 light microscope (Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan)equipped with a Visicam 5.0 camera (Hilden,Germany).Carbon uptake by a vent shrimp and its bacteriaJ Ponsard et al99The ISME JournalStatistical analysisAll data are reported as mean values ±s.d. Outliers(possibly due to experimental contamination or tothe absence of labelling) were eliminated withDixon’s Qtest ( Po0.05). One-way analysis ofvariance (Kruskall–Wallis) was used and all pair-wise multiple comparison procedures (Dunn’sMethod) performed with Sigma Plot 11.0 software(Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) were usedfor sample comparisons. Po0.05 was taken asfiducial limit for statistical significance.Dunn’s multiple comparisons vs controlgroup method were used to test the real incorporationof14C.Results13C-bicarbonate experimentsThe data for13C-bicarbonate incorporation are shownin Figure 2a. Bacterial mats of branchiostegites andMP displayed a high rate of inorganic carbonincorporation from13C-bicarbonate. Other bodyparts ( OB,DTand Mu) showed lower rates. All theresults appeared to be statistically significant.After a 10-h incubation, the13C uptake measuredin the bacterial mats was approximately twice ashigh as after 4 h (Table 1). In the BB, it was higher inthiosulphate-incubated shrimps (78.8 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01)than in SW-incubated specimens (52.4 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01).The incorporation rate was higher in the MP(12.1–16.7 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) than in the BB(3.9–7.3 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01). In shrimp tissues,it was higher in the OB(1.1mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01,in the presence of thiosulphate) than in the DT(0.3mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01)o rt h e Mu(0.2mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01). The incorporation rates for MPandBBwere significantly different from those of shrimptissues ( Po0.05).14C-bicarbonate experimentsThe radioactivity levels measured in the bacteriaand tissues of control shrimps appeared negligibleas compared with radiotracer uptake ( Pp0.001)(Figure 2b).High14C incorporation rates were observed in thebacterial mats of the MPand BB(Figure 2b), of thesame order of magnitude as the corresponding13C-bicarbonate incorporation rates. The rate was muchhigher in the presence of iron or thiosulphate. In theMP and BB, respectively, it reached 10.4 and5.4mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01in the presence of thio-sulphate and only 3.9 and 2.8 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01for shrimps incubated in SW alone.Most of the shrimp tissues analysed showed signi-ficant14C incorporation, whatever the incubationconditions (Figure 2b). The highest carbon incorpo-ration rates were recorded in the tegumental tissuesof the gill chambers, that is, the OB(2.7mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) and the Gi(0.2mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01).The rates recorded for the internal tissues of allshrimps ( Mu: 0.01; DT: 0.04; HP: 0.01 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) were low to very low, but neverthelesssignificant ( Pp0.001), the digestive gland display-ing the lowest values. The ACshowed a surprisinglyhigh incorporation rate (0.6 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01in the presence of iron), to be explained below.14C-acetate experimentsThe results for14C incorporation from acetate areshown in Figure 3a. Bacterial mats ( MPand BB)showed high rates, indicating that acetate is asuitable carbon source for these bacteria. The raterecorded in SW (61.3 mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) was15 times the rate of carbon incorporation from14C-bicarbonate (3.9 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01inMP).High rates of14C incorporation were measured inthe integument, especially in areas lining the gillFigure 2 Rates of inorganic carbon incorporation into the bacterial mats of the mouthparts and branchiostegite and into shrimp tissues,as calculated from13C fixation ( a)o r14C fixation ( b) data. The shrimps were incubated: ( a) for 4 or 10 h in NaH13CO 3in pure seawater(dark grey), supplemented with reduced iron (light grey) or thiosulphate (white); ( b) for 6 h in pure SW with NaH14CO 3(dark grey),supplemented with iron (light grey) or thiosulphate (white).

The level remained lowbut measurable in the internal tissues. In the Muand HP, the rate did not exceed 0.1 mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01. It was slightly higher in the DT(0.4mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01). In the AC, a distinctionwas made between the old, outer cuticle ( AC o)a n dt h einner tissues ( AC n). The14C incorporation rate for thewhole ACwas mainly due to high14C uptake intothe inner, living tissues ( AC n, 4.8 mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01), that is, the epidermis secreting thenew cuticle, while the inert old cuticle showed lowlabelling ( AC o, 0.7mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01).3H-lysine experiments3H-lysine incorporation rates were about 100 timeslower than the14C-acetate incorporation rates(0.7mmolLys inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01vs 61.7 mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01in the BB) (Figure 3b). The highest rateswere again found in the bacterial mats ( MPandBB),suggesting that these bacteria can use lysine,probably for protein synthesis. Significant rateswere measured in the gill chamber integument(OBandGi) (34.1 and 16.1 nmolLys inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01,respectively), while the internal tissues (excepttheMu: 0.8 nmolLys inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) showed lowlabelling.AutoradiographyOur autoradiographic observations were in goodagreement with the analytical data, confirmingthe distribution of the radiolabelled moleculesamong the bacterial mats and shrimp tissues(see Supplementary Information 2—Figures 7a andb for negative controls).In the bacterial mats associated with the MPandbranchiostegites, results for the three radiotracerincubations were quite similar. The labelling inten-sity depended on the specific radioactivity of theisotope, the exposure time and the amount ofradiotracer incorporated.3H-lysine gave the bestresult with the shortest exposure time, followed by14C-acetate and14C-bicarbonate. Silver grain preci-pitation (in the photographic emulsion) alwaysappeared first along the bacterial filaments(Figures 4a and c), eventually covering the wholelength of the filaments as a dense black deposit(Figures 4b and d). By comparing the picturesobtained after short and long exposure times wewere able to distinguish the labelled filamentousbacteria from the mineral crust of iron oxides: theTable 1 T o t a la m o u n t so fi n o r g a n i cc a r b o n( mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01±s.d.)incorporated after 4 and 10 h into the body parts of shrimpsincubated with13C-bicarbonate in the presence of seawater,or seawater supplemented with iron or thiosulphateIncorporated inorganic13C per g of organic C in thesample ( mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01) after 4 and 10 h incubationswith NaH13CO 3in SW, SW þFe and SW þSNaH13CO 3–4 h NaH13CO 3–10 hShrimp tissuesSWMP 50.4 ±10.3 103.0 ±8.2BB 13.3 ±6.3 52.4 ±3.4OB 4.3 ±3.3 3.1 ±0.5DT / 15.9 ±0.7Mu 1.1 ±0.6 2.6 ±0.0FeMP 65.7 ±27.3 /BB 22.8 ±9.8 24.0 ±2.1OB 4.8 ±3.5 8.4 ±0.3DT / 1.3 ±0.5Mu 0.8 ±0.1 0.5 ±0.0SMP 67.9 ±29.9 158.5 ±7.0BB 28.4 ±25.0 78.8 ±3.7OB 5.0 ±2.1 4.8 ±0.4DT / 3.1 ±0.1Mu 0.6 ±0.0 1.7 ±0.14Abbreviations: BB, branchiostegite biofilm; DT, digestive tract;Fe, iron condition; MP, mouthparts; Mu, muscles; OB, outerbranchiostegite; S, thiosulphate condition; SW, seawater.Figure 3 Rates of incorporation of14C(a) and3H(b) into thebacterial mats and inner tissues of R. exoculata shrimpsincubated for 1 h with14C-acetate or3H-lysine in pure SW.

U, uropods.Carbon uptake by a vent shrimp and its bacteriaJ Ponsard et al101The ISME Journallatter also appeared as dark masses, but they werenot labelled, whereas the bacteria located inside orbelow the mineral crust were moderately labelled(Figure 5a).The shrimp tegumental tissues appeared denselylabelled after incubation with3H-lysine or14C-acetate, but sections of shrimps incubated with14C-bicarbonate required very long exposure timesbefore the label appeared. After 20–30 days ofexposure, gills and muscles also appeared moder-ately labelled (Figures 5b and c), but neither the DTnor the HP showed any measurable labelling.Detailed views of the branchiostegite (Figure 5a)confirmed and explained the analytical dataobtained for the abdominal integument: livingtissues synthesising new cuticle and the new cuticleitself showed the most intense labelling. In contrast,the overlying old cuticle remained free of silvergrains except in its lower part, which was probablyinfused with moulting fluid enzymes secreted by theepidermis (Compe `reet al., 2004).DiscussionThe in-vivo experiments presented here providedirect evidence that R. exoculata epibionts areautotrophic. These are the first experiments to havebeen carried out on live shrimps together with theirepibionts, and the first to demonstrate a mutualisticrelationship in this bacteria–shrimp symbiosis underin-situ pressure conditions.Carbon fixation by bacterial chemosynthesisOnce thought to be a monoculture of a single,pleomorphic phylotype of epsilonproteobacteria ,the gill chamber epibiont population of R. exoculatais now regarded as a functional consortium orsyntrophic community (Stams and Plugge, 2009)dominated by gamma- and epsilonproteobacteria .By combining 16S rRNA and functional geneanalysis with in-situ hybridisation and transmissionelectron microscopy observations on R. exoculataFigure 4 Autoradiographs of histological sections: cross-sectioned bacteriophore setae of the mouthparts of R. exoculata shrimpsincubated for 1 h with3H-lysine ( a,b) or for 6 h with14C-bicarbonate ( c,d).

Authors have alsoidentified gamma-proteobacterial epibionts of theThiotrichaceae family ( Leucothrix group), togetherwith some free-living members and some otherinvertebrate ectosymbionts, mainly of crustaceans(Goffredi, 2010). These gammaproteobacteriaappearing at least as filamentous and rod-shapedmorphotypes can probably grow as sulphide oxidi-sers, most likely using the APS pathway for energygeneration and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cyclefor carbon fixation ( aprA and cbbM gene sequences,respectively) (Zbinden et al. , 2008; Hu ¨gler et al. ,2010, 2011; Guri et al. , 2012). In addition, coccoid-shaped cells with intracytoplasmic membranestacks have been identified as type-I methano-trophic gammaproteobacteria (pmo A genesequence) (Corbari et al ., 2008a; Zbinden et al. ,2008; Guri et al. , 2012), and deltaproteobacteriarelated to Desulfocapsa have been identified thanksto their aprA and hydrogenase gene sequences(Hu¨gler et al. , 2011), suggesting they can growlithotrophically using hydrogen as electron donorfor sulphate reduction. On this basis, the authorshypothesise that an internal sulphur cycle betweensulphur-oxidising epsilon- and gammaproteobac-teria and sulphate-reducing deltaproteobacteriacould take place in the shrimp gill chamber, asproposed for oligochete symbiosis (Dubilier et al. ,2001).The following results of the present study supportthe view that shrimp-associated bacteria carry outchemosynthetic inorganic carbon fixation: (1) thecarbon incorporation rates for13C- and14C-bicarbo-nate are in good agreement, (2) they increase in thepresence of electron donors (S 2O32/C0,F e2þ), (3) theyare stable over time, as confirmed by the time-related increase in13C incorporation and (4) auto-radiographs of histological sections show labellingof bacterial mats.The carbon fixation rates observed here are similarto but somewhat higher than those observed by Polzet al. (1998): 3.9 vs 2 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01for theMPof shrimp incubated in SW. This comparison issomewhat uncertain, as we had to convert Polz’sdata, expressed per weight unit of protein, intovalues given per weight unit of total carbon, thecarbon content of proteins being estimated at 45%(Rouwenhorst et al. , 1991). Yet, the consistentlyhigher rates found here might be due to theincubation of live shrimps under in-situ pressure(230 bars in this study), as opposed to the use, inprevious experiments, of pieces of dead shrimpunder atmospheric pressure. Active chemoautotro-phy might be promoted by preserving shrimps andFigure 5 Autoradiographs of different cross-sectioned bodyparts of R. exoculata shrimps incubated for 1 h with14C-acetate(a,c)o r3H-lysine ( b): (a) branchiostegite (3-day exposure)showing intense labelling of emerging filamentous bacteria andmuch weaker labelling below the mineral crust, a dense silverdeposit covering the living tissue, that is, both the inner and theouter epidermis and their respective new cuticles, while the oldouter cuticle remains almost free of silver particles; ( b) gills(20-days exposure); ( c) abdominal muscles (29-days exposure)labelled moderately but more intensely than the background.Scale bar: 100 mm.AS, sectioning artificial space; FB, filamentousbacteria; Mi, mineral crust; Mu, muscles; OB, outer branchioste-gite (old cuticle separated from the new one); RB, rod-shapedbacteria; T, tissues including the epidermis bordered by the newcuticle being deposited.Carbon uptake by a vent shrimp and its bacteriaJ Ponsard et al103The ISME Journalbacteria in good physiological condition (Ravauxet al. , 2003). Accordingly, Zbinden et al. (2008)observed o30% degraded epibionts in re-pres-surised shrimps. The carbon fixation rates deter-mined here are much lower, however, than thoseobtained for other chemosynthetic symbionts (bac-terial homogenates or endobacteria of bivalve gills),for example, those of Bathymodiolus thermophilus :150mmolCinc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01in SW (Nelson et al. ,1995), or Solemya velum : 2500 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01in the presence of thiosulphate (Scott andCavanaugh, 2007). Moreover, owing to the relativelylow energy level of thiosulphate as compared withsulphide, the latter authors observed threefoldhigher carbon fixation rates with 0.2 mMNa 2S(70mmolC /C2gprot/C01/C2min/C01) than with 1 m MNa 2S2O3(20mmolC /C2gprot/C01/C2min/C01).That the presence of an electron donor increasesthe carbon fixation rate indicates that Na 2S2O3, andFe2þat least contribute to fuelling R. exoculataepibionts, and our autoradiography data suggest thatchemosynthesis occurs at least in the large filamen-tous bacteria ( epsilonproteobacteria of MarineGroup 1), which appeared more intensely labelledthan the thin filamentous and rod-shaped ones(epsilonproteobacteria of Marine Group 2 andgammaproteobacteria ). The view that R. exoculataepibionts have sulphide-oxidising activity is con-sistent, moreover, with the fact epsilon- and gam-maproteobacteria are assumed to have such activity,on the basis of the group affiliation of the former(Petersen et al. , 2009; Goffredi, 2010; Guri et al. ,2012) and because the latter possess functional SoxBand aprA genes (Hu ¨gler et al. , 2010, 2011). Wecannot say, however, what the epibiotic bacteria ofR. exoculata use as predominant energy source.Methane and hydrogen, found in hydrothermalfluids from the Rainbow vent field along withsulphide and iron (Charlou et al. , 2002; Douvilleet al. , 2002; Schmidt et al. , 2008), are also potentialdrivers of chemoautotrophy. In particular, the type-Imethanotrophic gammaproteobacteria may usemethane as both electron and carbon source(Zbinden et al ., 2008; Guri et al ., 2012), deltapro-teobacteria are believed to use H2for sulphatereduction (Hu ¨gler et al. , 2011), and epsilonproteo-bacteria (of Marine Groups I and II) may use H 2instead of sulphide for chemosynthesis, as proposedforBathymodiolus gill endosymbionts (Petersenet al. , 2011). The possibility that R. exoculataepibionts might use H 2is strongly supported bythe identification of a hupL gene sequence fromGroup-2 epsilonproteobacteria (Hu¨gler et al. , 2011)among the R. exoculata epibionts and by the metaboliccapabilities reported for Campylobacterales, especiallyof the family Thiovulgaceae (Campbell et al. , 2006;Goffredi, 2010). We have also tested methane andhydrogen (see Supplementary Information 1), butwe observed rapid death of the incubated shrimps,so they were discarded. Furthermore, whether CH4-or H 2-metabolic genes are actively expressed or nothas not been determined. Biotic iron oxidation by R.exoculata epibionts has been proposed (Zbindenet al. , 2004, 2008; Corbari et al., 2008a) on the basisof the close association of these bacteria with heavyiron-oxyhydroxide deposits. Our results supportthis hypothesis, but evidence is lacking as to theability of the bacterial phylotypes identified so far tooxidise iron. Furthermore, abiotic iron-oxide pre-cipitation can compete strongly with biotic ironoxidation (Schmidt et al. , 2009), bacterial cell wallscan induce it (Corbari et al., 2008a).We also show here that R. exoculata epibionts canincorporate14C-acetate and3H-lysine much fasterthan they incorporate14C from bicarbonate. In thebranchiostegite bacterial mats, the rate of organiccarbon incorporation from acetate (61.7 mmolAc inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) was 10–20 times the rate observed with14C-bicarbonate, depending on whether thiosulphatewas present (5.4 mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01) or not(2.8mmolC inc/C2gCsam/C01/C2h/C01). This may be due to thepresence of heterotrophic bacteria, but to date, thishas not been investigated. Our observation that thethick bacterial filaments were intensely labelledwith all three radiotracers, and that the thin oneswere also labelled to a lesser extent, suggests that atleast the epsilonproteobacteria might switch to amixotrophic metabolism and use small organicmolecules, when available, as energy and/or carbonsources. Acetate and amino-acid assimilation is thusunsurprising and might reflect a capacity of certainchemolithoautotrophic bacterial epibionts to adjusttheir metabolism to changes in their geochemicalenvironment. A versatile (autotrophic/mixotrophic/heterotrophic) energy metabolism using severalelectron donors (including hydrogen and organiccompounds) and acceptors (including oxygen andnitrate) has indeed been reported for free andsymbiotic epsilonproteobacteria of the Thiovulga-ceae family (Campbell et al. , 2006; Goffredi, 2010)and suggested for R. exoculata ectosymbionts(Hu¨gler et al. , 2011). Mixotrophy/heterotrophy isalso commonly accepted as a possible feature ofgammaproteobacteria of the Thiotrichaceae family(Goffredi, 2010), as most Beggiatoa species can growon acetate as sole added carbon source (Larkin andStrohl, 1983). It has been proposed but not investi-gated for R. exoculata epibionts (Hu ¨gleret al. , 2011).In support of this hypothesis, a metagenomic studyhas revealed in Riftia pachyptila endosymbionts thepresence of all genes required for heterotrophicmetabolism (Robidart et al. , 2008), and a metapro-teomic study has pinpointed acetate as a substratefor bacterial endosymbionts of the gutless marineworm Olavius algarvensis (Kleiner et al. , 2012).Schulz and Jørgensen (2001) interpret the metabolicflexibility of filamentous sulphur-oxidising bacteria,especially those of the Thiothrix group, and theirability to grow heterotrophically or autotrophicallyon different sulphur species, as a need to overcomedisadvantages of their sessile life and to adapt theiractivity to changes in substrate availability (oxygen,Carbon uptake by a vent shrimp and its bacteriaJ Ponsard et al104The ISME Journalsulphide). In R. exoculata , the obvious variability ofbacterial assemblages according to the gill chamberarea, the individual and the vent site (Zbinden et al. ,2008; Petersen et al. , 2009; Hu ¨gler et al. , 2011)suggests a consortium composition plasticity as aresponse to varying vent fluid composition (Charlouet al. , 2002; Schmidt et al. , 2008) and to fluctuatinggeochemical or micro-environmental conditions inthe zone of mixing with deep water.The relatively high carbon fixation rate observedin SW alone suggests that R. exoculata epibiontshave an internal energy store that supplies auto-trophic metabolisms in the absence of an externalelectron donor, for example, when the shrimpsswim from reduced-compound-rich hydrothermalfluid to oxic (reduced-compound-poor) deep water.Such carbon fixation has previously been evidencedinBathymodiolus thermophilius and R. exoculatasymbionts (Nelson et al. , 1995; Polz et al. , 1998).Energy could be stored as iron polyphosphate andsulphur globules like those observed ultrastructu-rally by Wirsen et al. (1993) and Zbinden et al .(2008) in thin filamentous bacteria. These could beidentified as Leucothrix -like gamma-ectosymbiontsbecause their APS pathway allows production ofintermediate sulphur compounds and because thestorage role of similar globules is well documentedin their shallow-water relatives (Larkin and Strohl,1983; Schulz and Jørgensen, 2001). Furthermore,these globules were shown to be empty in speci-mens maintained in a pressurised aquarium withoutelectron donors (Zbinden et al. , 2008). This suggeststhat the enhanced carbon fixation observed in thepresence of thiosulphate as compared with pure SWmight reflect a switch of gamma- and/or epsilon-epibionts to an external energy source supportingautotrophic metabolism.Bacteria–host transfersSeveral authors propose that organic nutrients mightbe transferred from epibionts to R. exoculata(Casanova et al. , 1993; Zbinden et al. , 2004;Corbari et al. , 2008b). Others, arguing that thecuticle is impermeable, reject this hypothesis(Segonzac et al. , 1993; Gebruk et al ., 2000). Thelatter authors refer to an experiment (Anderson andStephens, 1969) or to subsequent review papers(Stephens, 1988; Preston, 1993; Gebruk et al., 2000)suggesting that crustaceans, in contrast to manyother marine invertebrates, cannot take up dissolvedorganic matter or dissolved organic carbon. Accord-ing to Anderson and Stephens (1969), the apparentincorporation of radiotracers by crustaceans was dueto uptake by epibionts alone and not by thecrustaceans themselves. Yet these authors workedwith whole organisms, and never separated theinternal tissues from the integument and theepibionts as we have done here.The present results demonstrate the transfer ofcarbon fixed by bacteria to the host shrimp tissuesand the ability of shrimps to take up dissolvedorganic molecules such as acetate or lysine acrosstheir integument. Together with our autoradio-graphs, the higher radiotracer concentrations in theshrimp tissues than in the incubation media(Table 2) and the incorporation of3H-lysine and14C-acetate into the Mu (proteins) and the HP(storage lipids) confirm their active uptake and theiraccumulation in shrimp insoluble organic matter.Our separate analysis of the old and new cuticles ofthe abdominal integument and the correspondingautoradiographs also suggest that the new cuticleand the secreting epithelium incorporate morelabelled molecules, probably because of the intensebiosynthetic activity at this level in pre-ecdysialcrustaceans.These results thus constitute in-vivo experimentalevidence of nutritional transfer of bacteria-fixedTable 2 Initial and final concentrations (in mM) of labelledcompounds (13C,14C-bicarbonate,14C-acetate,3H-lysine) in theincubation media and the shrimp body partsLabelledcompounds ineach incubationmediumInitial concentration(mM) of labelledcompounds in theincubation mediumFinal concentration(mM) obtained after1 h in bacteria andshrimps tissuesNaH13CO 3 11 764 MP 157.17 ±52.92DT 49.94 ±0.29BB 42.04 ±13.84Mu 20.42 ±9.13OB 8.30 ±7.33NaH14CO 3 3000 MP 33.01 ±16.31OB 19.88 ±15.13DT 15.84 ±16.30BB 12.20 ±4.89AC 7.02 ±2.95Gi 5.97 ±2.04HP 2.13 ±0.55Mu 1.75 ±1.0114C-acetate 200 MP 524.24 ±100.53BB 281.48 ±47.86Gi 245.47 ±66.43OB 111.52 ±53.91AC n 101.97±80.37U 46.19 ±9.14AC 33.01 ±0.35DT 18.79 ±9.61AC o 14.87±0.91Mu 9.01 ±3.76HP 7.84 ±0.993H-lysine 0.2 MP 14.82 ±7.92BB 3.02 ±2.97Gi 0.54 ±0.28OB 0.48 ±0.22Mu 0.06 ±0.00DT 0.00 ±0.01HP 0.00 ±0.00Abbreviations: AC, abdominal cuticle; ACn, new abdominal cuticle;AC o, old abdominal cuticle; BB, branchiostegite biofilm; DT, digestivetract; Gi, gills; HP, hepatopancreas; MP, mouthpart; Mu, muscles;OB, outer branchiostegite; U, uropods.In bold are the data for compartments that accumulate the radiotracers(in4out).

They are in good agreement withprevious stable isotope studies (Gebruk et al. , 1993;Pond et al. , 1997a, b, 2000; Rieley et al. , 1999;Colac ¸oet al. , 2007) and confirm that R. exoculatadepends on its epibionts for its nutrition. They thusstrengthen the view that the relationship betweenbacteria and shrimp is mutualistic: the epibiontssupply carbon compounds to the shrimp and theshrimp, thanks to its gill chamber flow and itsswimming behaviour, offers them protection and asupply of chemical compounds, maintaining theirposition at the oxic/anoxic interface around activechimneys (Casanova et al. , 1993; Segonzac et al. ,1993). The R. exoculata bacterial epibiosis canthus be regarded as a true mutualistic trophicectosymbiosis, similar to what is known about thechemosynthetic endosymbiosis of organisms suchasR. pachyptila (Felbeck, 1981; Fisher et al. , 1989),Calyptogena magnifica (Childress et al. , 1991) andS. velum (Stewart and Cavanaugh, 2006; Scott andCavanaugh, 2007).Finally, the view that bacterial products areassimilated across the shrimp integument ratherthan viatheDTis strongly supported by: (1) thesignificant incorporation of both14C-acetate and3H-lysine after an incubation time as short as 1 h. Thisis insufficient for uptake by ingestion assimilation,which commonly takes several hours (ingestionassimilation of carbon from bicarbonate, for exam-ple, requires prior incorporation by the bacteria,followed by grazing of bacteria from the MP)(Chipps, 1998; Hoyt et al. , 2000); (2) the highincorporation levels recorded in the gill chamberintegument lining ( OB,Gi), as opposed to (3) themuch lower levels recorded in the DT(Figure 6).These results are in agreement with the view that theshrimps do not graze on their epibionts (Zbindenet al. , 2004; Corbari et al. , 2008b), but rather farmthem (Segonzac et al. , 1993; Polz and Cavanaugh,1996), although they might also ingest some chim-ney bacteria along with sulphides (Van Dover et al. ,1988; Segonzac, 1992). The low but neverthelesssignificant incorporation of14C from bicarbonate intheDTcorroborates the data of Polz et al . (1998),although they found higher rates than ours (uponincubating isolated gut segments). This incorpora-tion might be due to chemosynthetic activity of themidgut microbial community (Polz et al. , 1998;Zbinden and Cambon-Bonavita, 2003; Durand et al. ,2010), but this community would be less active thanthe gill chamber community.The view that soluble carbon-containing com-pounds are transferred from bacteria to shrimp bycrossing the gill chamber integument tallies with theultrastructural characteristics of this integument,which resemble those of permeable and/or trans-porting tissues (Martinez et al ., 2005): a very thincuticle (30 mm), reduced blood-water distance, mito-chondria-rich cells with apical infolding in thebranchiostegite epithelium. In R. exoculata , theuptake of bacterial nutrients across the integumentcould be the major source of nourishment, alongwith complementary sources such as grazing onchimney minerals (Van Dover et al. , 1988; Segonzacet al. , 1993), ingestion of bacteria-colonised exuviae,and midgut microflora activities (Zbinden andCambon-Bonavita, 2003; Zbinden et al. , 2004;Corbari et al. , 2008b; Durand et al. , 2010). It couldbe regarded as a peculiar adaptation of the shrimp.Although some authors have discarded this hypoth-esis, the present results may bring it back intofavour. By extension, they suggest that this processmight exist in many crustacean species, whichwould derive their nourishment at least partly fromdissolved organic matter or dissolved organic car-bon, as is commonly accepted for many marineinvertebrates: annelids (Richards and Arme, 1982;Ahearn et al. , 2000; Peppler and Ahearn, 2003),molluscs (Wright and Secomb, 1986; Wright, 1988;Wright and Pajor, 1989; De Eguileor et al. , 2000) andcuticle-lined parasitic organisms such as nematodes(Fleming and Fetterer, 1984; Gordon and Burford,1984; Masood, 1984). Arbitrarily rejected for crusta-ceans (Stephens, 1988) and especially decapods,this idea is surprisingly accepted without demon-stration for parasitic rhizocephalan barnacles suchasSacculina carcini (Bresciani and Høeg, 2001) andfor parasitic copepods (Kannupandi, 1976; Poquetet al. , 1994) with a modified cuticle. It is wellknown, furthermore, that in pre-ecdysis, crusta-ceans (and other arthropods) absorb soluble mole-cules (for example, sugars and amino acids) fromtheir degrading old cuticle through the new cuticleand re-utilise them for its synthesis (Compe `reet al.,Figure 6 Schematic view of R. exoculata (a) and its gillchamber—transversal view ( b) showing the level of14C-tracersincorporation in the internal organs by colour range from thehighest levels in red to the lowest in yellow.
