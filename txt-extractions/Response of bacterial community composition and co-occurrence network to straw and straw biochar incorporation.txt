Lime concretion black soil (LCBS) is a typicallow-medium crop yield soil, and it is also one of the main soil types forgrain production in China. However, the link between SSB additions andsoil bacterial communities in LCBS remains unclear. This study exploredthe effects of SSB incorporation on bacterial community composition,structure and co-occurrence network patterns at different soil depths andmaize growth stages. The results showed that soil PH, soil organic matterand total nitrogen signiÔ¨Åcantly affected the seasonality and stratiÔ¨Åcation ofthe soil bacterial community. The composition and diversity of bacterialcommunities were signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by growth period and treatmentrather than soil depth. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the bacterial community diversity increasedsigniÔ¨Åcantly with crop growth at 0‚Äì20 cm, decreased the relative abundanceof Actinobacteria, and increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteriaand Acidobacteria. SF (straw with fertilizer) and BF (straw biochar withfertilizer) treatments decreased bacterial community diversity. Co-occurrencenetworks are more complex in BF, S (straw), and SF treatments, and thenumber of edge network patterns is increased by 92.5, 40, and 60% at thematurity stage compared with F (fertilizer) treatment, respectively. Moreover,the positive effect of straw biochar on the bacterial network pattern increasedwith time, while the effect of straw weakened. Notably, we found that rarespecies inside keystone taxa (Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae) play anindispensable role in maintaining bacterial network construction in LCBS. Thisstudy offers a comprehensive understanding of the response of soil bacterialcommunities to SSB addition in LCBS areas, and provides a reference forfurther improvement of LCBS productivity.KEYWORDSstraw and straw biochar, soil bacterial community, co-occurrence network, keystonetaxa, lime concretion black soil, maizeFrontiers in Microbiology 01 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 2Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399IntroductionThe application of chemical fertilizers in agriculturalproduction has become very common and essential (Zhanget al., 2019). DiÔ¨Äerent types of chemical fertilizers have beenapplied to farmland over the past few decades, and the long-term application of chemical fertilizers can have negativeeÔ¨Äects on soil, such as soil degradation and lower productivity(Adesemoye and Kloepper, 2009; Agegnehu et al., 2017). As arenewable resource, straw is rich in nutrients, and its returnto the Ô¨Åeld is considered to be an eÔ¨Äective and promisingmethod to improve soil quality and increase soil fertility(Dikgwatlhe et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2019). Its addition not onlychanges the soil‚Äôs physicochemical properties, but also aÔ¨Äectsthe living environment of the microbial community in the soil(Navarro-Noya et al., 2013).Microorganisms are an important part of the soil ecosystemand are the main participants in soil physicochemical processes.They include highly diverse and complex bacteria, fungi,viruses and protozoa, of which bacteria are the most abundant(Takaku et al., 2006; Bardgett and van der Putten, 2014; deAraujo et al., 2018). Straw returning to the Ô¨Åeld provides acarbon source that is easily decomposed for microorganisms,promoting the reproduction and enriching the species of thosemicroorganisms (Morais et al., 2019). Previous studies haveshown that bacteria (such as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, andAcidobacteria) dominate the microbial community during theearly stages of straw decomposition (Liu et al., 2019). Strawreturning signiÔ¨Åcantly increases bacterial biomass comparedwith no returning (Navarro-Noya et al., 2013; Chen et al.,2017). Morais et al. (2019) concluded that straw returning hada signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äect on soil bacteria. However, it has also beensuggested that the addition of straw with a high C/N ratioleads to a shortage of nitrogen, which intensiÔ¨Åes the Ô¨Åercecompetition for nitrogen between the microbial communityand plants, thereby inhibiting the growth of microorganisms(Kuzyakov and Xu, 2013).As research on the eÔ¨Äect of straw returning on soil qualityhas deepened, researchers have found that the decompositionrate of straw is slow (Brunetto et al., 2011), which increasesfarmland diseases and insect pests (Liu et al., 2022a). Therefore,some scholars have proposed generating straw biochar throughhigh-temperature pyrolysis and then returning it to the Ô¨Åeld(Laird, 2008; Feng et al., 2021). The incorporation of biocharchanges the soil‚Äôs physicochemical properties and has a director indirect impact on soil microbial activities (Wu et al.,2019). This positive eÔ¨Äect is related to the porous structureand large speciÔ¨Åc surface area of biochar, which provides asuitable and favorable shelter for the microbial communitywhile also providing unstable carbon-containing organic matterand nutrients for microbial growth and reproduction, changingmicrobial activity (Gomez et al., 2014; Jaafar et al., 2014;Partovi et al., 2021). Previous reports have suggested thatshort-term biochar addition can signiÔ¨Åcantly alter soil bacterialdiversity, and a combination of biochar and chemical fertilizersis considered the most beneÔ¨Åcial treatment for soil bacteria (Yuet al., 2018b). But it does not apply to all soils and the eÔ¨Äect isnot always positive (Zhang et al., 2019). The eÔ¨Äect of biocharon microbes is not certain and the diversity of biochar and soiltypes means the practical eÔ¨Äect in diÔ¨Äerent soil types cannotbe generalized (JeÔ¨Äery et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Ginebraet al., 2022). This positive or negative eÔ¨Äect is not clear but wedo think it might be related to changes in chemical propertiesafter biochar pyrolysis, soil PH and nutrients (Paz-Ferreiro et al.,2011; Gomez et al., 2014). In addition, most of the eÔ¨Äects ofbiochar on soil microorganisms were obtained based on speciÔ¨Åcsampling times, and these results focused on speciÔ¨Åc states ofsoil bacteria, with few eÔ¨Äects reported for diÔ¨Äerent growth stagesof crops (Zhen et al., 2014; Bello et al., 2021). Consequently,time course investigations are necessary to indicate changes insoil bacterial communities due to straw or straw char addition(Bello et al., 2021).The North Anhui Plain is one of the important grainproducing areas in China. The main soil type is lime concretionblack soil (LCBS), which accounts for 54% of the total area of theregion (Du et al., 2021). It is recognized as a medium and low-yielding soil, largely because of its unique dry shrinkage and wetexpansion characteristics and poor water and fertilizer retentionproperties. Previous studies have shown that straw returningcan improve the LCBS properties, such as soil bulk density andsoil water content (Ruan et al., 2022). However, little is knownabout the eÔ¨Äects of straw and equal proportions of straw biocharincorporation on soil microbial communities. In addition, theeÔ¨Äects of the incorporation of straw and straw biochar (SSB) onthe co-occurrence network and keystone taxa (KT) changes ofsoil bacteria in diÔ¨Äerent growth stages of maize are still unclear.The main purpose of this study is threefold: (1) evaluate theeÔ¨Äects of diÔ¨Äerent treatments and soil depths on soil bacterialdiversity and richness in growth stages of maize, (2) determinewhether soil bacterial network patterns, topological properties,and KT are aÔ¨Äected by diÔ¨Äerent treatments in growth stages ofmaize, (3) investigate the links between environmental variablesand soil bacterial genera and KT to discover the key factorsmediating bacterial species succession.Materials and methodsStudy site descriptionThe Ô¨Åeld experiment was conducted at the WudaogouHydrological Experiment Station in Guzhen County, BengbuCity, Anhui Province (117210E, 3390N), which is locatedin the southern part of the North Anhui Plain and is animportant seed crop base for maize and wheat in China.The area is a transition zone between warm temperate andnorth subtropical climates. The annual average water surfaceevaporation, temperature and rainfall is 1,011 mm, 14.9C, andFrontiers in Microbiology 02 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 3Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399885 mm, respectively, and the rainfall from June to Septemberaccounts for 60‚Äì70% of the total annual rainfall. The soil typeis LCBS. The basic soil properties at 0‚Äì20 cm depth at thebeginning of the experiment is shown in Table 1 .Field experimentIn the experiment, four Ô¨Åeld treatments were set up inrandomized blocks: straw biochar with fertilizer (BF), straw (S),fertilizer (F), and straw with fertilizer (SF). Each plot was dividedinto three subplots with three replicates (133.3 m2). Soil pitswere dug around the plots and an aluminum-plastic board wasinserted vertically with 20 cm of the board above the ground toavoid the inÔ¨Çuence of soil moisture and nutrients from otherplots in the Ô¨Åeld. The stubble and straw were removed manuallyfrom the plot when the wheat was harvested. Wheat strawwas crushed into 3‚Äì5 cm and returned to the Ô¨Åeld using apulverizer, and the application amount was 5,400 kg ha 1. Theraw material of the biochar was wheat straw, and the applicationamount was 1,800 kg ha 1according to the straw conversionratio of 33%. The wheat straw was purchased from ZhengzhouJinbang Environmental Technology Co., Ltd. On June 12, 2021,SSB was evenly spread in the soil surface of the test plot, andthe rotary tiller was evenly rotated into the soil tillage layer.Base fertilizer urea (N 46.4%) and compound fertilizer (N-P 2O5-K2O = 30-5-5%) were applied separately, and the applicationamounts were 15 and 60 g m 2, respectively. On the sameday, maize was artiÔ¨Åcially sown with 60 cm between each rowand 27 cm between each plant. The tested maize variety wasDenghai 533. When maize was sown, an open space (buÔ¨Äerzone) of 60 cm from the edge of the plot was left to avoidthe inÔ¨Çuence of adjacent plots. All experimental plots had thesame, conventional Ô¨Åeld management, such as weeding andinsecticide application.Sampling and soil physicochemicaldeterminationSoil samples were collected at the seedling stage (SS)and maturity stage (MS) of maize using a soil auger(diameter = 5 cm), and each subplot at a depth of 0‚Äì20 cm(0‚Äì10 cm and 10‚Äì20 cm) was randomly sampled accordingto the Ô¨Åve-point method. Soil samples were collected betweentwo maize plants. Five soil samples were collected from eachlayer, and after manual removal of visible stones or plantdebris, they were thoroughly mixed to make one compositesample. To reduce the inÔ¨Çuence of the external environmenton microorganisms, sample collection was divided into twosessions. About 10 g of soil samples were collected and placedinto sealed bags the Ô¨Årst time. The samples were then placedin a foam box with dry ice, and transported to the laboratoryand stored at 80C for microbial DNA extraction. About1,000 g of soil samples were taken during the second sessionto determine the soil‚Äôs physicochemical properties, includingammonia nitrogen (NH 4C-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N), totalnitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), total phosphorus(TP), organic matter (SOM), bulk density (BD), PH, and soilwater content (SWC).TN was determined by the Kjeldahl method. Soil NH 4C-N and NO 3 -N were extracted in a KCl solution and thendetermined using spectrophotometry (Lu, 2000). The soil APwas determined by using the molybdenum-antimony anti-colorimetric method after extraction with N aHCO 3solution. TPwas determined by alkali fusion-molybdenum antimony anti-spectrophotometry. The SOM was converted by measuring theorganic carbon content with TOC analyzer (XPERT-TOC/TNb,Trace Elementa, Netherlands). Soil PH was measured using aPH meter (DZS-706, INESA, Shanghai, China) in a solutionwith a soil/water ratio of 1:2.5 ( w/v). Soil bulk density (BD) wasobtained by the cutting ring method (Lu, 2000). The SWC wasdetermined by the drying method (105C).DNA extraction and high-throughputsequencingDNA samples were extracted using the DNeasyPowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Netherlands) in line withthe manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. DNA concentration,quantity and quality were determined using a NanoDropND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc,Waltham, MA, USA) and 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis.We performed PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation of the V3-V4 region ofthe bacterial 16S rRNA gene by using the forward primer(338F: 50-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-30) and the reverseprimer (806R: 50-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-30) (Dinget al., 2021). The ampliÔ¨Åcation conditions were as follows: 98Cfor 2 min, followed by 25 cycles consisting of 98C for 15 s,55C for 30 s, and 72C for 30 s, and a Ô¨Ånal extension at 72Cfor 5 min. The Ô¨Ånal product was puriÔ¨Åed and quantiÔ¨Åed usingTABLE 1 Basic properties of soil at 0‚Äì20 cm.Soildepth(cm)PH Totalnitrogen(mgkg 1)Totalphosphorus(mgkg 1)Availablephosphorus(mgkg 1)Organicmatter(gkg 1)Bulkdensity(gcm 3)Soil particle distribution (%)<0.002mm0.002‚Äì0.02mm0.02‚Äì2mm0‚Äì10 7.5 876.0 561.9 9.9 15.1 1.18 15.1 23.7 61.310‚Äì20 7.6 867.0 537.2 6.1 13.4 1.60 14.7 22.4 62.9Frontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 4Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN)and PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,USA), respectively. And equimolar pooling and paired-endsequencing (2300 bp) were performed on the Illumina MiSeqplatform (Ding et al., 2021). Furthermore, all raw reads wereanalyzed on the QIIME2 platform (Knight et al., 2010). The rawdata were quality controlled, denoised, merged, and chimerasremoved before DADA2 clustering (Callahan et al., 2016).Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were labeled by the ASVnumber in this study.Statistical analysesThe alpha diversity of microbial communities (Chao1and Shannon indices) was estimated using QIIME2. ThesigniÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äects of growth stage, treatment, soil depth and theirinteractions on microbial alpha diversity were determined usingthree-way analysis of variances (ANOV As). The least signiÔ¨ÅcantdiÔ¨Äerence (LSD) post hoc test identiÔ¨Åed signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerencesbetween treatments in microbial alpha diversity. Comparisonof bacterial beta diversity by Bray-Curtis distance was basedon non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis andanalysis of similarities (ANOSIM) using the ‚Äúvegan‚Äù package(v.2.5-7) in R (v.4.0.2). The student‚Äôs t-test was used to evaluatediÔ¨Äerences between bacterial taxonomic levels under speciÔ¨Åctreatments. Correlations between soil properties and bacterialgenera were analyzed by redundancy analysis (RDA), whichwas performed in the vegan package. Multicollinearity testswere used to remove variables with variance inÔ¨Çation factors(VIF) >10 (Aertsen et al., 2012), and Ô¨Ånally, permutation tests(999 permutations) were performed to assess the signiÔ¨Åcance ofsoil properties on bacterial communities. Network analysis wascarried out using the ‚Äúpsych‚Äù package (v.2.1.9) and the ‚Äúigraph‚Äùpackage (v.1.2.6) in R to explore bacterial network patterns(Csardi et al., 2006; R√∂ttjers and Faust, 2018). The co-occurrencenetwork was constructed based on the spearman correlationcoeÔ¨Écient >0.7 and FDR-corrected P-values <0.05 (Ge et al.,2021; Liu et al., 2022b). The topological features of each networkwere calculated using the igraph package. The KT identiÔ¨Åedincluded high average degree, high betweenness centrality, andhigh closeness centrality (Banerjee et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2021).The spearman correlations between soil properties and bacterialKT were calculated and heatmaps were drawn using the psychpackage and the ‚Äúcorrplot‚Äù package (v.0.92) in R.ResultsGene sequence data characteristicsA total of 2,058,101 bacterial non-singleton sequences wereobtained from 48 soil samples, and the average read lengthof bacterial sequences was 417 bp (the main length rangedfrom 404 to 433 bp) after screening. We observed 39 phyla,123 classes, 283 orders, 494 families, 1,027 genera, and 1,626species in this study. The rarefaction analysis found thatthe number of recorded ASVs tended to be smooth, whichindicated the amount of data in the sequence was reasonable(Supplementary Figure 1 ).Alpha and beta-diversity of bacterialcommunities under the incorporationof straw and straw biocharWe used Chao1 and Shannon indices to characterize thea-diversity of soil bacterial communities ( Figure 1 ). The analysisof the results revealed that all treatments had little eÔ¨Äect onthea-diversity of soil bacterial at the SS of 0‚Äì20 cm. Bacterialcommunities tended to increase in the a-diversity over time, asmeasured by the Chao1 and Shannon indices. In the 0‚Äì10 cmsoil layer at MS, BF and SF treatments signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased thea-diversity of soil bacteria, S treatment signiÔ¨Åcantly increasedthea-diversity of soil bacteria, and F treatment had nosigniÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äect on the a-diversity of soil bacteria. The Ftreatment signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the a-diversity of soil bacteriaat 10‚Äì20 cm depth at MS. Table 2 shows soil bacterial a-diversitywas signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected by maize growth stage ( p<0.001),followed by treatment ( p<0.01), but neither was aÔ¨Äected by soildepth or growth stage and soil depth interaction. The interactionbetween growth stage and treatment, treatment and soil depth,and growth stage, treatment and soil depth had a signiÔ¨Åcantlygreater impact on Chao1 than on Shannon index.NMDS analysis was performed to determine the eÔ¨Äectof diÔ¨Äerent treatments on the composition of the bacterialcommunity at 0‚Äì20 cm depth in SS and MS ( Figure 2 ). Itrevealed a clear diÔ¨Äerence in the soil bacterial communitycomposition of maize at SS and MS (0‚Äì10 cm: R= 0.917,p= 0.001; 10‚Äì20 cm: R= 0.652, p= 0.001) ( Figures 2Ai,Bi ). Atthe same time, it revealed obvious diÔ¨Äerences in the bacterialcommunity composition between 0‚Äì10 cm and 10‚Äì20 cmdepths (SS: R= 0.549, p= 0.001; MS: R= 0.412, p= 0.001)(Figures 2Aiv,Biv ). The bacterial community compositions ofBF, S, F and SF treatments were signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent only at the0‚Äì10 cm depth at SS ( Figures 2Aiii,Bii,iii ). The results showedthat sampling time and soil depth signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected soilbacterial community structure. DiÔ¨Äerent treatments had littleeÔ¨Äect on soil bacterial community structure.Taxonomic classiÔ¨Åcation and diversityof bacterial communitiesWe revealed some unique genera at diÔ¨Äerent growthstages and diÔ¨Äerent treatments.

BF treatment produced the highestgenera at SS and MS at the 0‚Äì10 cm and 10‚Äì20 cmdepths, followed by SF treatment; BF and SF treatmentsproduced more unique genera than F and S treatments(Figures 3B‚ÄìE ). The top 10 bacterial phyla and genera in relativeabundance for all soil samples are shown in Figure 4 . Thesoil bacterial community was dominated by Actinobacteria(42.36%), Proteobacteria (30.02%), Acidobacteria (9.49%) andChloroÔ¨Çexi (8.26%) at the phylum level, accounting for about90% of the relative abundance of all treatments. Comparedwith F treatment, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriain BF treatment and SF treatment slightly increased, and Streatment decreased.

AtSS, the dominant genera of soil bacteria at 0‚Äì20 cm depthincluded Subgroup_6, Nocardioides, KD4-96, Streptomycesand Solirubrobacter. However, only the relative abundanceof Subgroup_6 increased signiÔ¨Åcantly during the MS, andthe relative abundance of several other dominant generadecreased signiÔ¨Åcantly. There are also some genera with relativeabundance below 1% that were not noticed at 10‚Äì20 cm, such asNocardioides, Streptomyces, and Solirubrobacter.Additionally, we identiÔ¨Åed diÔ¨Äerential bacteria between BF,S, SF treatments and F treatments using two-group comparisonsand analyzed the mean relative abundance of diÔ¨Äerentialbacteria ( Figure 5 ). It can be found that the diÔ¨Äerence in soilbacterial community composition gradually increased with thegrowth of maize, with the diÔ¨Äerence in bacteria at diÔ¨Äerenttaxonomic levels greatest between BF and F treatments.

S and SF treatmentsincreased bacterial community complexity at SS, but decreasedbacterial community complexity in BF treatment ( Figure 7 ).From SS to MS, the number of edges of network in S,F and SF treatments decreased by 46.7, 48.1 and 41.8%,respectively, reducing the complexity of bacterial community;but the number of edges of network increased by 24.2%in BF treatment ( Figure 8 ;Table 3 ). The three treatmentsFrontiers in Microbiology 08 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 9Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399increased the number of edges in the bacterial network by92.5% (BF), 40% (S), and 60% (SF) compared to the Ftreatment at MS, respectively ( Table 3 ). SF treatment increasedbacterial complexity compared to S treatment. Similarly, wefound that whether SS or MS, the positive correlation betweennodes and the number of edges showed a similar pattern.These results indicate that fertilizer (F) treatment and straw(S and SF) treatments reduced bacterial complexity as thecrop grew, with the S and SF treatments being more aÔ¨Äectedthan the F treatment. The decomposition of straw biocharincreases the complexity of bacterial communities. BF, S, andSF treatments increased bacterial community complexity andpositive associations in bacterial networks compared to Ftreatment ( Figures 7 ,8;Table 3 ).The bacterial KT at SS and MS of maize were obtained in thefour treatments ( Table 4 ). We found that KT were signiÔ¨ÅcantlyaÔ¨Äected by growth stage in diÔ¨Äerent treatments. Unculturedgenus was the KT of the BF treatment and F treatmentand was classiÔ¨Åed as Gemmatimonadetes. Solirubrobacter andUnclassiÔ¨Åed_nocardioidaceae were the KT in the S and SFtreatments at SS, respectively. But they are both classiÔ¨Åedas Actinobacteria. Interestingly, we found that the KT inthe BF, S, and F treatments all belonged to Actinobacteriaat MS. The KT in the BF and F treatments were bothUnclassiÔ¨Åed_micromonosporaceae. In addition, the KT in theSF treatment were Nitrospira and CCD24, which were quitediÔ¨Äerent from the other three treatments. It indicated thatbiochar incorporation had little eÔ¨Äect on bacterial KT, but strawincorporation signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected bacterial KT. We furtheranalyzed the correlations between KT and environmentalfactors in the diÔ¨Äerent treatments ( Figure 9 ). At SS, the KTof S and SF treatments were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated withenvironmental factors (NO 3 -N, TP , and SOM) ( p<0.05),while the other two treatments did not reach a signiÔ¨Åcant level.The correlation of bacterial KT with environmental factors inthe four treatments increased with maize growth. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,KT in BF treatment were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with NO 3 -N (p<0.05); KT in S treatment were signiÔ¨Åcantly correlatedwith BD ( p<0.01); KT in F treatment were signiÔ¨Åcantlycorrelated with SOM, TP and BD ( p<0.05); KT in SF treatmentwere signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with nitrogen indicators (NH 4C-N,NO 3 -N and TN) and SOM ( p<0.05).DiscussionResponse of bacterial diversity to strawand straw biochar addition with maizegrowthIn this study, we found that the a-diversity and b-diversityof soil bacteria increased signiÔ¨Åcantly from SS to MS, and thea-diversity of bacteria was signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected by treatment butnot by soil depth. This suggests that certain bacterial groups havea greater ability to degrade stubborn recalcitrant compounds(Xiao et al., 2022). The soil depth and growth stage signiÔ¨ÅcantlyaÔ¨Äected bacterial b-diversity, according to ANOSIM analysis. Itshows that changes in bacterial communities are seasonal andhierarchical. The same results were also obtained by Hellequinet al. (2021) and Y ang et al. (2022). They concluded that thechanges of the soil microbial community depended on thegrowth stage of plants and soil depth. The eÔ¨Äect in the initialstage of plant growth is weak, and the greater the diÔ¨Äerence insoil depth, the stronger the eÔ¨Äect. The relationship is greatestwith the release of various root exudates in diÔ¨Äerent growthstages of vegetation (Bello et al., 2021). Liu et al. (2022b)showed that temporal succession was the main driving forcefor community structure, and crop types and root exudateswere the main reason for the diÔ¨Äerences in communitycomposition during the succession period. On the other hand,the decomposition of crop SSB and the dissolution of chemicalfertilizers lead to the release of many nutrients and solubleorganic matter, which stimulate the growth of microorganismsand the development of diversity (Ge et al., 2021; Partovi et al.,2021). In addition, we found that bacterial diversity of the Streatment was slightly lower than that of the other treatments atSS, but higher than that of the other treatments at MS. Becausethe S treatment at SS did not provide suÔ¨Écient nutrients for thegrowth of the crop, the growth rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced,resulting in a decrease in nutrients required by the crops, whilethe straw provided a carbon source for the microorganisms,increasing the advantage of competition for nutrients betweenmicroorganisms and plant for limited nutrients (Bei et al.,2018). The high nutrient requirement for maize growth in theF, SF, and BF treatments intensiÔ¨Åes the nutrient competitionbetween microorganisms and crops, and aÔ¨Äects the growth ofmicroorganisms, which may be negative (Bahram et al., 2020;Nevins et al., 2021). Meanwhile, it was also shown that theprocess of crops competing with microorganisms for limitednutrients is beneÔ¨Åcial to crop growth in SF and BF treatmentsand enhances crop competitive advantage compared to Ftreatments, thus signiÔ¨Åcantly reducing the bacterial diversity ofSF and BF treatments. This is consistent with previous researchÔ¨Åndings (L√©vesque et al., 2020). In summary, soil bacterialdiversity is aÔ¨Äected by the interaction of various factors such ascrop growth status, growth stage, soil depth and treatment.Bacterial community structure andcomposition in response to straw andstraw biochar with maize growthOur study shows that the most abundant microbialphylum in soil is Actinobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria,Acidobacteria and ChloroÔ¨Çexi, which are considered to bethe most common bacterial phyla in agricultural cultivationFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 10Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399FIGURE 8Network analysis showed the co-occurrence patterns of soil bacterial taxa at maturity stage in different treatments.

But there are diÔ¨Äerences underdiÔ¨Äerent treatments, which is consistent with previous researchresults (Zhang and Lv, 2020). Actinobacteria and Acidobacteriaare oligotrophic with lower growth rates, and prefer soilenvironments with low resource availability (Pascault et al.,2013; Liu et al., 2014). But the bacteria in Actinobacteria havethe ability to produce lignocellulose, hydrolase and degradelignocellulose, which play a particularly important role indegrading persistent compounds (Su et al., 2015; Bello et al.,2020). The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was reducedand the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteriaincreased with crop growth. Actinobacteria are a group ofbacteria that easily grow on carbon-rich substances, and thedecrease in Actinobacteria is attributed to the reduction ofFrontiers in Microbiology 10 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 11Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399TABLE 4 The keystone taxa in bacterial networks under different treatments at different growth stages.Stage Treatment ASV_ID Phylum Genus Degree ClosenesscentralityBetweennesscentralitySeedling stage BF ASV_114014 Gemmatimonadetes Uncultured 8 0.030 61S ASV_242313 Actinobacteria Solirubrobacter 10 0.134 190F ASV_114014 Gemmatimonadetes Uncultured 9 0.088 26SF ASV_66802 Actinobacteria UnclassiÔ¨Åed_nocardioidaceae 10 0.067 50Maturity stage BF ASV_228348 Actinobacteria UnclassiÔ¨Åed_micromonosporaceae 10 0.044 37S ASV_296676 Actinobacteria Streptomyces 7 0.119 174F ASV_113785 Actinobacteria UnclassiÔ¨Åed_micromonosporaceae 5 0.059 78SF ASV_92735 Nitrospirae Nitrospira 8 0.040 26ASV_302974 Proteobacteria CCD24 8 0.040 26FIGURE 9Correlation between keystone taxa and soil physicochemical properties under different treatments.

The relative abundance of Acidobacteria wasdecreased in SF and BF treatments. It is closely related to changein soil PH (Yin et al., 2021). This suggests that changes inbacterial survival patterns are based on resource and nutrientstatus acquired during decomposition (Carbonetto et al., 2014).The relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased in BFtreatment compared with F and S treatments. Proteobacteriabelong to eutrophic bacteria, and the decomposition of SSBprovides a suitable environment for it to grow rapidly in thesoil (Y ang et al., 2022). In addition, the relative abundanceof ChloroÔ¨Çexi was signiÔ¨Åcantly increased in BF treatment anddecreased in S and SF treatments. A possible explanationFrontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 12Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399is that due to the small particle size of the straw biocharincorporated in this experiment, the soil bulk density slightlyincreased, forming an anaerobic environment, while the strawincorporation increased soil aeration, thereby reducing therelative abundance of ChloroÔ¨Çexi (Edeh and Ma≈°ek, 2021). Wealso found the eÔ¨Äect of SSB addition on bacterial communitycomposition at the bacterial genus. The species of bacterialgenera and the number of unique genera were increased inBF and SF treatments compared to F treatment. The numberof bacterial genera was increased in SF treatment comparedwith S treatment, indicating that fertilization can also alterbacterial community composition (Ge et al., 2021). Zhao et al.(2016) reported that the application of chemical fertilizersand straw returning to the Ô¨Åeld changed the structure of soilmicrobial community.Previous studies have demonstrated that soilphysicochemical properties are the main drivers aÔ¨Äectingsoil microbial composition and structure (Bai et al., 2020; Belloet al., 2021). It is well known that total organic carbon is themain energy source for microbial growth and activity, andsigniÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äects the composition and structure of microbialcommunities in soil (Xue et al., 2018; Araujo et al., 2021).Through RDA analysis, this study found that PH, SOM, andTN were the key factors that signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected bacterialcommunity changes. The result corroborated the Ô¨Åndings ofQi et al. (2021). Certain microorganisms can obtain C and Nfrom SSB to grow and reproduce with appropriate C:N ratios(Li et al., 2017). Delgado-Baquerizo et al. (2018) concluded thatsoil PH was an important factor aÔ¨Äecting regional soil bacterialcommunities. It also demonstrates that any signiÔ¨Åcant deviationin pH can cause stress on unicellular microorganisms and alsolead to changes in nutrients in the environment, which in turncontrol microbial composition and diversity in the ecosystem(Gui et al., 2022).Co-occurrence network and keystonetaxa responses of soil bacterialcommunitiesThe bacterial networks of the S and SF treatments weresimilar, but very diÔ¨Äerent compared to the BF and F treatmentsat SS ( Figure 7 ;Table 3 ). The S and SF treatments increasedthe complexity of the network compared to the F treatment.With the growth of maize, the network complexity of BFtreatment increases, while the other three treatments networkcomplexity decreases. BF treatment had the most complexbacterial network at MS, followed by SF treatment ( Figure 8 ;Table 3 ). The same result was obtained by Yu et al. (2018a). Ithas been reported that more complex networks may be formedin nutrient-rich environments (Y ang et al., 2019). It also provedthat the addition of SSB had a positive eÔ¨Äect on soil propertiesin LCBS. Increasingly complex networks improve materialcycling in soil and information exchange between bacteria,which means greater stability and resistance of the bacterialcommunity (Karimi et al., 2017). Wagg et al. (2019) proposedthat a more developed microbial co-occurrence network patternimplies increased soil ecosystem function related to carbon andnutrient cycling. Bacterial networks are dominated by positiveinteractions in the diÔ¨Äerent treatments ( Table 3 ), implyingthat bacteria are mutually beneÔ¨Åcial or have similar functions(Y ang et al., 2022). The number of positive correlation edgeswas signiÔ¨Åcantly increased in SSB addition compared with Ftreatment, because the degradation of complex organic matterrequires a variety of bacteria to work together (Deng et al.,2012; Y ang et al., 2022). Recent studies have also shown thatorganically managed farmlands have more complex microbialnetworks and more keystone taxa (Banerjee et al., 2019).The KT play speciÔ¨Åc roles in the cycling of diÔ¨Äerentsubstances and have important eÔ¨Äects on the structure andfunction of soil microorganisms (Banerjee et al., 2016; Yuet al., 2018a). KT were classiÔ¨Åed as Gemmatimonadetes andActinobacteria at SS. KT were classiÔ¨Åed as Actinobacteria,Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria at MS, with Actinobacteriapredominating. We believe that bacterial community successionmay be aÔ¨Äected by aÔ¨Äecting KT at diÔ¨Äerent growth stagesof maize under SSB additions. This observation is consistentwith existing studies (Sun et al., 2020). Gemmatimonadetes arethought to be more prone to oligotrophic taxa with higher C:N, which are related to the decomposition of complex organicmatter, such as the initial stage of biochar returning to theÔ¨Åeld (Carbonetto et al., 2014). Actinobacteria are considered tomainly decompose straw and become a KT in straw treatment(Su et al., 2015). It is signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with organicmatter and is extensively involved in carbon assimilation (Sunet al., 2020). Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae were signiÔ¨Åcantlynegatively correlated with N indices in the SF treatment. Zhanget al. (2021a) suggested that the addition of high nitrogen had astrong negative eÔ¨Äect on Proteobacteria under straw returning.Nitrospirae, the most prevalent nitrite oxidizing bacteria, areprimarily responsible for the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle andtend to thrive in low carbon and nitrogen conditions (Le Rouxet al., 2016). But straw and fertilizer addition helped to increasesoil TN and SOM content, which can stimulate decomposeractivity, indicating that the coupled eÔ¨Äect of carbon andnitrogen on Nitrospirae should be considered in future studies(Zhang et al., 2021b; Xiao et al., 2022). Notably, the same taxawere not observed to appear as KT in the bacterial networks ofthe diÔ¨Äerent treatments. However, we found taxa from the samegenus as the KT in multiple bacterial co-occurrence networkpatterns, namely ASV_114014, ASV_228348 and ASV_113785.These Ô¨Åndings revealed that many species have similar functions(Han et al., 2022) and that KT are constantly changing withconditions (Bello et al., 2020; Ge et al., 2021). Interestingly,the bacterial KT Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae had lowerrelative abundances. It shows that rare taxa are also veryimportant in maintaining the microbial co-occurrence network.Similarly, previous studies have illustrated that rare species oftenFrontiers in Microbiology 12 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-999399 September 30, 2022 Time: 15:25 # 13Du et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999399have diÔ¨Äerent functional characteristics than abundant speciesand make greater contributions to the ecosystem (Chapmanet al., 2018; Kurm et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2021).ConclusionThis study determined the response of the bacterialcommunity composition, structure and co-occurrence networkpattern to the soil physicochemical properties under diÔ¨Äerentcombination applications in LCBS during maize growth.The dominant phyla of soil bacteria were Actinobacteria,Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and ChloroÔ¨Çexi in all treatments.Bacterial communities showed distinct seasonality andstratiÔ¨Åcation, and the main drivers for this change fromsoil PH, SOM, and TN changes. Overall, SSB incorporationdecreased bacterial community diversity under fertilizationconditions. However, the incorporation of SSB stimulatedpositive information exchange and synergistic eÔ¨Äects betweensoil bacteria and promoted soil material circulation. Thus, morecomplex and stable bacterial networks were induced, describedby more nodes, edges and centrality. Not only that, the positiveeÔ¨Äect of straw biochar on microbial network patterns graduallyincreased with time. Finally, we identiÔ¨Åed bacterial keystonetaxa with low relative abundance, which play an important rolein maintaining soil ecological stability. The study highlights theimportance of SSB addition to improve soil quality and maintainmicrobial diversity in LCBS.Data availability statementThe datasets presented in this study can be found in onlinerepositories.
