Use of biochar as a soil amendment to both reduce GHG emissions and deliver CO2 removal (CDR) was first proposed as a global strategy for climate change mitigation only 15 years ago and has been intensively studied over the past decade2. Biochar is produced by the anoxic thermochemi -cal conversion of biomass through pyrolysis processes that generate recoverable heat and fuels, such as gases and condensable volatiles, besides the solid biochar, an environmentally persistent material characterized by high carbon and low oxygen and hydrogen con-tents3. This Review provides an in-depth overview of the scientific progress in understanding the biogeochemical mechanisms of bio -char persistence, its effects on CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from soil, and on plant growth and concomitant CO2 uptake, and explores the trade-offs between energy generation and carbon sequestration. Of particular importance is the ensuing balance between GHG emission reductions and CDR, which mainly depends on prioritizing either energy generation to offset fossil fuel use or sequestering biochar, through choices of feedstock type and production conditions, which lead to different systems-level climate mitigation outcomes. Optimization of emissions reduction, CDR and non-climate effects, such as crop yield enhancement, is needed, for which we lay out research priorities and policy mechanisms.Climate-relevant biochar effectsThe climate change mitigation effects of biochar hinge not only on its material properties, but also on the effects of its production and deployment on GHG emissions across its entire life cycle. An important distinction exists between the reductions of CO2, N2O, CH4 and soot emissions, and the withdrawal of CO2 from the atmo -sphere (CDR) (Fig. 1). Biochar systems can affect both GHG emis -sions and CDR through: (1) reduced carbon mineralization and non-CO2 emissions from biochar itself in comparison with those from unpyrolysed biomass; (2) emissions associated with the ther -mochemical conversion of biomass as well as avoided fossil fuel emissions if energy is produced (potentially with carbon capture and storage, CCS); and (3) changes in GHG emissions after the bio-char additions to soil, which include increased plant growth (and so stores additional carbon in vegetation), lower non-CO2 GHG emis -sions from soil and reduced mineralization of soil organic matter. Full life-cycle impacts also include emissions associated with the transport, storage and incorporation of biochar—current assess-ments conclude that these make only minor contributions to the overall GHG inventory4–7. Indirect climate change effects can also be caused by land use changes to grow feedstocks or land spar -ing, changes in biomass management (transportation, storage and landfilling)8, reduced requirements for irrigation9 and changes in fertilizer needs10 or albedo11. These indirect effects vary greatly between biochar systems, yet emergent patterns show that, with the use of sustainably sourced feedstock (either regrown or true wastes), the emission reductions of GHGs (expressed in equivalents of CO2, CO2e), which include those of CH4 and N2O, vary from 0 to 1.6 tCO2e per ton of biomass to produce the biochar5–7,12, whereas the addition of biochar instead of unpyrolysed residues to flooded rice can reduce emission by up to 3.9 tCO2e t−1 biomass due to the large warming potential of CH4 emissions6.Biochar in climate change mitigationJohannes Lehmann   1,2 ✉, Annette Cowie   3, Caroline A. Masiello4, Claudia Kammann5, Dominic Woolf1,2, James E. Amonette   6,7, Maria L. Cayuela   8, Marta Camps-Arbestain   9 and Thea Whitman   10Climate change mitigation not only requires reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but also withdrawal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Here we review the relationship between emissions reductions and CO2 removal by biochar sys-tems, which are based on pyrolysing biomass to produce biochar, used for soil application, and renewable bioenergy. Half of the emission reductions and the majority of CO2 removal result from the one to two orders of magnitude longer persistence of biochar than the biomass it is made from. Globally, biochar systems could deliver emission reductions of 3.4–6.3 PgCO2e, half of which constitutes CO2 removal. Relevant trade-offs exist between making and sequestering biochar in soil or producing more energy. Importantly, these trade-offs depend on what type of energy is replaced: relative to producing bioenergy, emissions of biochar systems increase by 3% when biochar replaces coal, whereas emissions decrease by 95% when biochar replaces renewable energy. The lack of a clear relationship between crop yield increases in response to fertilizer and to biochar additions suggests opportunities for biochar to increase crop yields where fertilizer alone is not effective, but also questions blanket recommendations based on known fertilizer responses. Locally specific decision support must recognize these relationships and trade-offs to establish carbon-trading mechanisms that facilitate a judicious implementation commensurate with climate change mitigation needs.NATurE GE osCiENCE | VOL 14 | DECEMBER 2021 | 883–892 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 883Review AR ticle Nature GeoscieNceGHG emissions are altered by all of these effects, but the net removal of atmospheric CO2 is only delivered in four direct ways: (1) the higher persistence of pyrolysed compared with unpyrolysed bio -mass (48–54% of the net GHG emission reductions (all the data from Fig. 1)); (2) increased growth of plants in soils to which biochar was added (8%), if this increased biomass is itself converted into biochar or other long-lived carbon products (Fig. 1 ); (3) reduced mineral -ization of the existing soil organic carbon (SOC) together with an increased retention of new plant residue inputs (often called negative priming (4–6%; Fig. 1 ); and (4) CCS of pyrolysis gases and liquids.Biomass sources and biochar productionThe largest differences between biochar systems in their climate change mitigation potential per unit of biochar produced stem from the choice of biomass source. At one extreme, the use of forests that store carbon in their living biomass could create a large release of CO2, assuming that the forest used to make biochar is not regrown after harvest (Fig. 2). Use of the forest biomass for biochar and other pyrolysis products should therefore be restricted to sustainably  managed forests, which ensures that both the spatial extent and productive potential of existing forests do not decrease or, better, increase, and to postharvest residues (mill waste and so on). When the purpose-grown biomass crops are harvested for biochar pro-duction and then regrown, subsequent cycles of regrowth, biochar production and application can build increasing carbon stores over time (Fig. 2). When using biomass feedstocks that would decom-pose if unpyrolysed, such as plant litter or prunings, decomposition would release CO2 more slowly than thermochemical conversion13. Y et most agricultural residues decompose on annual timescales and therefore constitute a low carbon debt compared with the large increase in carbon persistence through pyrolysis (Fig. 2)14. The largest emission reductions are achieved if the biomass would otherwise generate not only CO2 but also N2O, CH4 or soot in the near term, such as in landfills, manure storage or residue burning. Recycling nutrient-rich wastes, such as excreta, therefore consti-tutes untapped opportunities for emission reductions through their use as biochar feedstock, even with a lower return of plant-available nitrogen, which facilitates the return of other nutrients to farmland CO2, N2O, CH4Biomass feedbackTransportCCSBiomass sub-systemCO2, N2O, CH4,sootLandfill,bioenergy,others(fire and so on)CO2, N2O, CH4, sootTransportCO2Soil sub-systemSOCTransportConversion sub-systemCDR-derived GHG reductionNon-CDR-derived GHG reductionLand sparing0.7–1.72.8–6.53.5–8.2CO2BiocharpersistenceNegative primingPlant growth Possible generation of bioenergyor other products and offset offossil emissions Biomasssource50%69%Pyrolysis, gasificationTotal biochar systemFig. 1 | Climate mitigation effects of biochar systems within the total biochar system. Emission reduction through avoided biomass disposal dominates in the biomass sub-system (here we assume that biomass is sustainably produced, with no change in land carbon stock in the biomass system, and exclude land sparing due to the lack of data at a global scale). In the conversion system, CDR can be achieved through CCS. In the soil system, CDR is mostly delivered through a lower mineralization of the biochar than that of the unpyrolysed residue, and to a lesser extent by increased plant growth16, negative priming89 and by an unknown contribution of land sparing. Doughnuts show the numerical ranges of global annual GHG emission reductions (PgCO2e yr−1), with the minimum (orange inner ring) and maximum (orange outer ring) CDR as a proportion of the net GHG emission reduction by adopting biochar systems (blue comprises emission reductions that do not lead to CDR, for example, avoided fossil fuel emissions and N2O reductions)16,89.

With only organic residues and wastes allocated to biochar (that is, excluding biomass crops), the technical potential16 of emission reductions is estimated at 2.4–3.9 PgCO2e yr−1, 44–49% being CDR (Methods). If annual and perennial biomass crops are grown on 100% of the abandoned cropland that has not subsequently become urban, forest or pasture and 6% of pasture is converted into multipurpose agroforestry without loss of fodder16, the potential of emission reductions increases by 40–64% to 3.4–6.3 PgCO2e yr−1, 49–59% being CDR. Land sparing by increased crop growth might allow a large but still poorly explored increase in CDR: under the assumption of a 25% crop yield increase in the (sub)tropics, dedicated biomass crops for biochar production on that land alone may seques-ter 2.3 PgCO2e yr−1 in biochar, and an additional 1.7 PgCO2e yr−1 with CCS (average 2020–2100)17, which increases the global mitiga -tion potential to 7.4–10.3 PgCO2e yr−1, with 5.7–7.7 PgCO2e yr−1 or 75–77% of the net emission reductions being CDR.Persistence of biocharNet CDR by implementing biochar systems commonly rests on the persistence of biochar (Fig. 1). Not only is the microbial carbon mineralization of biochar reduced by one to two orders of magni-tude compared with that of unpyrolysed residues18, but also con -comitant N2O and CH4 emissions from organic matter added to the soil under reducing conditions is largely avoided when pyrolysed above 450 °C (ref. 19).The increased carbon persistence in biochar can be explained by a fundamental change in molecular composition and, specifi -cally, the increased proportion of fused aromatic structures3,20–22 that increase with longer pyrolysis times and lower ash content of the feedstocks23. The proportion of fused aromatic structures can be estimated by the relative amounts of carbon to hydrogen or oxygen atoms (Fig. 3a), because both hydrogen and oxygen are displaced by carbon during fusion of the aromatic rings24.Thus, the atomic ratios of hydrogen to organic carbon (H/Corg) or oxygen to organic carbon (O/Corg) can be used to predict the extent of biochar mineralization25,26 (Fig. 3b): 95% of the tested bio -chars with H/Corg < 0.5 showed a carbon persistence of over 50%, which averaged at 82%, after 100 years (Fig. 3a). The resistance to various oxidizing agents can be used to predict mineralization over periods of weeks to months27, as it reflects the proportion of the eas -ily mineralizable fraction. To predict the persistence over centennial timescales, the vastly different fast- and slow-mineralizing fractions of biochars require separate quantification using repeated measure-ments of either the mineralized or the remaining biochar over at least annual timescales using isotopic tracing26.Over centennial timescales, the observed differences in persis -tence between different biochars (Fig. 3) are of lower importance than the differences in persistence between biochar and unpyrol-ysed biomass. The difference in life-cycle emission reductions was found to be less than 10%, irrespective of whether 80 or 90% of the biochar carbon remains after 100 years4,7,28,29. If used in long-lived products, such as building materials, the biochar carbon sink is secure as long as the product is not burned. Redistribution and sub-soil burial of biochar through erosion and leaching can decrease its mineralization, the extent of which depends on the conditions at the sites of erosion and deposition30,31.CH4 and N2o emissions from soilEmissions of CH4 and N2O from soil that do not originate from the carbon or nitrogen in biochar may also change after biochar addi -tions. Under saturated conditions, in which peat soils release CH4 and where rapid electron transport occurs, net decreases in CH4 emissions of up to 50% have been observed after biochar addition32 due to the increased activities of methanotrophs in the oxic rhizo -sphere33.

Compared with growing or constant vegetation (baselines 2 and 3), a large carbon debt (dotted shade) would be generated. b , This debt will only be compensated if regrowing vegetation generates larger carbon stores than the baselines (question marks indicate additional research needed).

Under well-drained conditions, ash-rich biochars decreased CH4 consumption, probably due to hindrance of the methanotroph activity by an increased electrical conductivity in the soil solution from associated ash37. In comparison, a higher net soil CH4 consumption after the additions of high-temperature woody biochars has been attributed to better gas diffusion38, potentially augmented by electron transport through biochar’s fused aromatic ring structure, as shown for anaerobic conditions32.N2O emissions are reduced by 38%, on average, in the first year of application, with net emission reductions of >10% documented for several years39. Lower N2O emissions are a result of several mechanisms, which include transient microbial nitrogen immobili -zation or abiotic retention mechanisms, to some extent, but micro -bial reduction of N2O to N2 is the most likely multi-annual effect. This microbial reduction can result from a greater expression of N2O reductase genes39, pH increase and increased electron-transfer ability by functional groups on biochar surfaces40, facilitated by elec -tron transfer through biochar’s fused aromatic ring structure, which is promoted by a higher pyrolysis temperature41. Transformation of N2O to N2, which thus avoids N2O emission, is a permanent mitiga -tion benefit, as the nitrogen has left the soil system so the effect can -not be reversed. The persistence of high-temperature biochars also means that this net decrease in N2O emissions may continue over the lifetime of the biochar, even though the oxidation of biochars over time may reduce their electron-transfer capabilities through the biochar41 and current meta-analyses have not unambiguously confirmed ongoing N2O emission reduction39. Concomitant reduc -tion of indirect N2O emissions through decreases in nitrogen leach -ing39 or reductions in the release of ammonia42 and NO by biochar43, however, are poorly quantified.Mineralization of native soCMineralization of native soil organic matter has often been found to increase (positive priming) within the first few weeks after biochar additions, but predominantly to decrease (negative priming) over the long term (more than two years) by 4% on average18,44. Negative priming effects have been found 6–10 years after biochar addi -tions45,46, averaging 0.5–1.2 tC ha−1 yr−1 (1.7–4.4 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1), and in soils that were enriched in biochar-type materials hundreds to thousands of years earlier47–50. Negative priming as a result of biochar additions may therefore by itself be an important CDR contribution that can be larger than that of many other soil management tech-niques, which often result in sequestration rates of <0.2 tC ha−1 yr−1 (<1 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1) (ref. 51).The main cause of the lower mineralization of native soil organic matter is the stabilization of organic compounds due to their adsorp -tion to biochar, which is promoted by the high surface area and car -bon contents of biochars produced at temperatures above 450 °C (ref. 44). Biochar thus acts as a new reactive surface, consistent with the accepted mechanisms of soil organic matter stabilization52,53.Comparisons with the priming effects of equivalent amounts of unpyrolysed organic matter must be included in contexts in which this organic matter would be applied in the field. Isotope studies are indispensable and may even need to include methods to distinguish three carbon sources45,54,55, namely biochar, native soil organic mat -ter and plant or other organic inputs. Long-term studies, including studies that involve repeated applications, are needed to ascertain the ceiling that this additional carbon accrual may reach52, and should consider interactions with inorganic carbon56.Plant growth for CDrThe effects of biochar on plant growth are important for three rea -sons: increased photosynthesis would remove additional CO2 from the atmosphere (if retained in the soil, plants, biochar or other products); greater crop yields may provide an incentive for adop-tion of the technology; and increased productivity can enable land sparing57 and thereby increase the overall potential for land-based climate-change-mitigation strategies on Earth’s finite terrestrial sur -face58.

However, crop yield responses to biochar additions do not neatly separate by soil type, or correlate with responses to inorganic fer -tilizers (Fig. 4a), which suggests that responses to biochar cannot be predicted from responses to fertilizers, but that biochar can be a valuable complementary approach. Some expected soil–crop–biochar interactions emerge, such as the positive response when high-pH biochar is added to acidic soils or no response when neutral or alkaline soils are amended61. However, crops grown in  alkaline soils showed the same yield increase as those in acid soils to the amendment of biochar with a pH of <9 (ref. 61), which indicates opportunities for biochar use beyond acid soils. Instances in which biochar-based fertilizers with biochar application rates of <2 t ha−1 (ref. 62) have increased crop yields in soils non-responsive to con -ventional fertilizers suggest opportunities for biochar to comple -ment traditional fertilizers.Filling crop yield gaps or reclaiming mine land and degraded landscapes may provide some of the most promising avenues to incentivize CDR using SOC accrual including biochar, yet rely on Fertilizer crop yield effect (In(fertilizer/control))–0.4 –0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4Biochar crop yield effect (In(biochar/fertilizer))–0.200.20.40.60.8Highly weathered soilsIntermediately weathered soilsWeakly weathered soilsAnthrosols1:1baBiocharBiochar crop yield effect (%)Soil carbon accrual (PgC yr–1)+1001–1000RestoredwetlandsCroplandmanagementBiochar0.5Fig. 4 | Global plant growth responses and CDr with biochar. a, Crop responses to inorganic fertilizers are not correlated with crop responses to biochar (r2 = 0.006, P = 0.56, n = 58; data from ref. 61), which indicates opportunities to increase crop yield and biomass accrual across many different soil conditions, complementary to inorganic fertilizers. b, Crop yields are typically higher with greater SOC contents, yet with often uncertain and nonlinear relationships between organic C contents and yield (indicated by the large diamonds within the boxes); crop yields, by definition, decrease when land use is converted from crop production to wetlands and may decrease when aboveground biomass is prioritized for soil carbon sequestration in lieu of crop harvest (boxes show the range of global aggregate data for SOC accrual and crop yield) (Methods).

An addi -tional incentive for farmers to use biochar in soil management may be provided by improved product quality64, which has received  little attention.CDr and GHG emission reductionsThe relationship between CDR and emission reductions dif -fers between alternative climate change mitigation strategies that enhance SOC (Fig. 5a). With a global adoption of biochar, the ratio of net emission reductions to CDR by SOC accrual tends to be greater than unity, which indicates a positive feedback from second-ary GHG impacts (assuming no CCS and a low use of plantations). In comparison, global adoption of improved cropland management has a lower ratio of net emissions reduction to soil CDR (Fig. 5a).  At the other extreme, wetland restoration shows lower emission reductions than those of CDR on a carbon-equivalent basis, because as SOC increases in saturated environments, CH4 and N2O emis -sions typically also increase, with the possible exception of adding biochar65. These relationships illustrate potential trade-offs and synergies between soil CDR and emission reductions that require recognition of nonlinearities and the effects on plant growth, soil GHG emissions or indirect land use change. Therefore, modelling should be employed that captures such interactions between bio-char and other land-based approaches, including but not limited to integrated assessment models to generate defensible comparisons66.We distinguish between five general biochar system types: those that maximize energy generation, maximize crop pro -duction, include CCS, have no or low energy generation, or use non-renewable biomass (dotted boxes in Fig. 5b). The three main differences between these biochar systems relate to: (1) the fate of the biomass and its associated emissions if it were not converted into biochar (biomass sub-system in Fig. 1); (2) the efficiency of conversion (that is, how much biochar is produced per unit feed-stock) and what material or energy products are generated and used in carbon storage (for example, biochar versus capture of CO2 as part of a CCS approach (conversion sub-system in Fig. 1)); and (3) the deployment of biochar and its resultant effects on plant growth and emissions from soil (soil sub-system in Fig. 1).The slightly greater emission reductions of biochar systems than those of soil CDR (biochar lies above the 1:1 line in Fig. 5) mean that emission reductions are generated in excess of the sequestered biochar; these largely stem from avoided emissions in the biomass sector (avoided landfill and avoided CH4 in rice) and reduced emis -sions from soil (N2O and CO2)12,16. Higher emission reductions at the same CDR (upward arrow in Fig. 5b) may be delivered by reducing non-CO2 emissions (CH4 and N2O) from soil34–36,39 or replacing the more emission-intensive energy sources (for example, coal instead of natural gas)12,16,67. Increasing both CDR and emis -sion reductions at the same time (arrows to the upper right in  Fig. 5b) requires greater crop yields to enable land sparing17 or nega -tive priming44–47.Increasing the energy output to displace fossil fuel emissions at the expense of biochar production will decrease the CDR (unless the emissions are sequestered using CCS)17, because of the inverse rela -tionship between biochar and energy production68.

Lower emission reductions at similar CDR (down-ward arrow in Fig. 5b) are the result of biochar systems that have no opportunity to generate or utilize energy, which may be the case with highly distributed and small in-field conversion systems or at remote locations where biomass is harvested for fire prevention or the management of invasive species69. The use of biomass that is not rapidly renewed, or pyrolysis without energy capture, must be con -sidered within a full life cycle69 and ecological perspective70 to deter -mine whether it is a viable climate change mitigation approach.Carbon accounting and tradingVerification of the various GHG emission reductions and CDR as well as their possible monetization requires a carbon account-ing system that compares the implementation of biochar systems with business as usual71, and includes soil amendment or disposal of unpyrolysed organic residues (Fig. 6). The abatement value (CDR and/or emission reductions) of biochar systems can, to some extent, be monitored at the point of conversion. The amount converted and the properties of the resultant biochar material can be reported more easily (cheaper and less variable) than measuring or model-ling soil carbon accrual or GHG emissions at the site of application.

All GHG emissions (which include N2O and CH4) and car -bon stock changes have to be estimated (Fig. 6). For soil emissions (D–H in Fig. 6) these can, in most cases, be conservatively ignored, whereas biomass use and biochar production use (A–C in Fig. 6) must be monitored72.A focus on CDR rather than merely GHG emission reductions of biochar systems for carbon trading leverages the verifiable con -version of easily decomposable biomass into persistent biochar (C in Fig. 6). A market focus on CDR alone may command higher prices than GHG emission reductions of biochar systems73. In addi -tion, the 30% increase of carbon prices associated with so-called nature-based solutions from 2019 to 2020 in comparison with the 16% decreases associated with renewable energy74 during the same period suggest that rewarding environmental co-benefits, which include, but are not limited to, water quality or biodiversity, is cur-rently favoured by the market.Life-cycle changes in GHG emissions must be verified, and any net emissions at the system level must be deducted from the amount of carbon sequestered. Further development is required to examine whether life-cycle emission reductions can be reliably and cost-effectively included to compensate for emissions during con-version (B in Fig. 6). Differences in CH4 emissions between decom -posing biomass or biochar itself (E in Fig. 6) are easily verifiable but are only relevant in some cropping systems (for example, flooded rice). At the other extreme, negative priming of native SOC may be a large additional CDR (H in Fig. 6) but expensive to verify, and it may rely on modelling that is yet to be developed.The biomass used for biochar could in many situations (albeit not all) be used solely or partly to generate energy products28, either by converting the biomass feedstock directly (for example, by com -bustion for bioelectricity or heat) or by using the biochar as fuel (as done with traditional charcoal). Depending on the type of fuel that is replaced, emission reductions by generating energy vary widely: emissions could be 3% higher for producing biochar than energy if coal is displaced, but 21–29% lower if oil or natural gas are displaced and 95% lower if solar, wind or nuclear energy is dis-placed (Methods). Whether energy generation rather than carbon sequestration leads to greater GHG emission reductions therefore depends on local situations28,29,75,76. As the energy system is increas -ingly decarbonized, producing biochar will become increasingly favourable compared with using biomass to generate energy4.Biochar applications that sequester carbon must also compete with the market value of any energy product77. Condensation and catalytic or biological conversion of gases can generate liquid transportation fuels that may generate greater income than crop yield increases78. Carbon markets that only value emission reductions together with the higher commercial value of liquid transportation fuels compared with that of biochar in soil will, in most cases, provide an incentive to generate energy products over CDR76,77,79,80. Such a market incen -tive may only tilt towards biochar and CDR once the transportation sector is decarbonized, CDR is valued by the carbon market at higher prices than reduced emissions81, or where energy products cannot be produced or utilized (for example, remote areas)77.outlookQuantifying the long-term persistence and potential concomitant effects of biochar on soil and vegetation requires decadal-scale research on plant growth responses, biomass use, biochar persis-tence, priming, CH4 and N2O emissions from soil, and identifica -tion of drivers for adoption of CDR versus emission reductions (Extended Data Table 1). High priority areas for optimization in the implementation of biochar systems include sustainable biomass sourcing and plant growth to maximize CDR, whereas adoption requires government and market incentives, education, reliable crop yield increases to enhance farm income, and shovel-ready waste management systems. Decision-support tools are needed to guide selection of suitable biochar systems to achieve local objec-tives at the scale at which farm or land use decisions are made.New directions to enhance climate change mitigation benefits of biochar systems are encouraged, such as combinations with other conversion technologies before pyrolysis (for example, anaerobic digestion), with sequestration of the CO2 evolved during conver -sion (CCS), or with inorganic carbon capture in soil. Biochar from woody materials together with high-nutrient containing-wastes82 or silicate rock powder83 can be combined with conventional mineral or organic fertilizers into commercial granular fertilizers, so that existing global fertilizer supply networks can be employed to deliver CDR with each fertilization84. Economic hurdles to implementa -tion may be lowered by non-soil uses of biochar (animal feed4,85, construction material86, energy storage87, catalysts88 and so on) and by non-energy uses of condensable and non-condensable gases (including bioplastic, microbial food and so on), which require further research and development to ascertain their climate change mitigation and economic value.As urgency increases to not only reduce GHG emissions, but also to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, biochar or other CDR approaches have to be critically evaluated for their broader impacts on the environment and society in addition to climate change mitigation. Prioritizing approaches will require a global societal discussion about—for example—whether we value persistent organic carbon in soils more than carbon injected into geological formations, CDR more than GHG emission reductions, and how incentives and effec-tive governance structures may be set up by governments, markets and consumers.online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of data availability and asso-ciated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00852-8.Received: 14 December 2020; Accepted: 6 October 2021;  Published online: 2 December 2021references 1.

The global GHG emissions and emission reductions through implementation of biochar systems were calculated using the BGRAM algorithm16 with two biomass availability scenarios identified as the ‘alpha’ and the ‘maximum sustainable technical potential’ (MSTP) scenarios. The alpha scenario, values for which provide the lower bound to ranges given in Fig. 1 and the text, assumes the conversion of biomass residues and wastes available using current technology and practices. The MSTP scenario assumes conversion of the maximum fraction of the global biomass resource that can be harvested without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation and thus is used to generate the upper bound of the ranges reported.Calculations for each biomass scenario16 yielded annual and cumulative estimates of increases and decreases in emissions over the course of 100 years; the maximum annual difference in these emissions is reported here. Emission increases include the net losses in SOC due to biomass removal, biomass and biochar transport emissions, emissions for the incorporation of biochar by tillage, CO2 emissions during biomass conversion (pyrolysis or bioenergy) and CO2 emissions from the decomposition of biochar stored in soil. Emission decreases include CO2, CH4 and N2O from biomass avoided by its conversion into biochar, displacement of fossil CO2e emissions by bioenergy generated during the biomass conversion (using fossil CO2e intensities adjusted to the 2018 global averages91), soil CH4 and N2O emissions following biochar application to soils and increases in net primary productivity in soils to which biochar is applied.Estimates of CDR were calculated by subtracting emissions of CH4 and N2O (biomass and soil) and displaced fossil-CO2e emissions from the total net GHG emissions after adjusting net primary productivity for the fraction of non-CDR emissions reductions. For net GHG emission and CDR estimates that include negative priming we assumed a 7–10% range for a 100 yr increase in SOC per unit of biochar carbon added (that is, an average annual increase of 0.07–0.10% in SOC per unit of biochar carbon added). This assumption is conservative compared with both the short-term (<10 yr) and tightly constrained field data with known biochar amendment rates45,46,92 that show annual increases of 10% or more, and a long-term (100 yr) model of biochar amendments to three contrasting soils89 with mean annual increases close to 1%. A meta-analysis of short-term (mostly less than 3 yr) laboratory priming studies18 shows a mean 3.8% total increase across all studies.The data given here are applicable to a globally relevant mixture of biochar persistence, biochar production, energy production, crop productivity responses and so on. The values exclude CCS, SOC priming and land sparing, except where explicitly mentioned. Where included, CCS of the pyrolysis CO2 emissions assume a 91% capture efficiency (MSTP scenario only). Land sparing refers to the effect by which crop production is increased per unit area and thereby either allows other areas to be taken out of agricultural production (and, for example, reforested or afforested) or allows farmers to forgo further expansion into natural areas (and, for example, reduce deforestation), which reduces emissions and increases CDR17,57.Biochar persistence. The proportion of biochar carbon that remains after 100 yr was calculated with a double-exponential model from experiments with at least 1 yr of replicated mineralization data using isotope tracing (n = 86; expanded from ref. 72 with additional data from refs. 93–96). Mineralization rates were adjusted to the average global temperature of 14.9 °C using a nonlinear relationship between temperature and Q10 temperature coefficient26. The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen values in Fig. 3a were calculated as molar fractions of their sum.Global crop yield and SOC accrual. The range of global aggregate data (1) for SOC accrual was taken from ref. 97 (2) for GHG balances with biochar from ref. 16 and (3) for GHG balances with land use change or improved cropland management from ref. 51.Crop yield changes with biochar additions to soil in comparison to fertilizer responses (Fig. 4) were obtained from ref. 79. Crop yield with cropland management was assumed to increase by 33% with an increase of SOC to 1% organic carbon98. This was calculated using the midpoint of the following relationships of SOC and crop yield: crop yields can be increased by 20–70 kg ha−1 for wheat, 10–50 kg ha−1 for rice and 30–300 kg ha−1 for maize with every 1 Mg ha−1 increase in the SOC pool in the root zone98. Crop yield in soils with organic carbon contents greater than 1% were assumed not to increase with further increases in SOC. The relationship between crop yield and SOC is still poorly quantified at a global scale, and these values are to be taken with caution.references 91.
