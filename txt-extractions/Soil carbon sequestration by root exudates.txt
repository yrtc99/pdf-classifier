Special issue: Climate change and sustainability IIOpinionSoil carbon sequestration by root exudatesPoonam Panchal,1Catherine Preece,2,3Josep Peñuelas,3,4and Jitender Giri1,*Root exudates are well-known ‘labile’ sources of soil carbon that can primemicrobial activity. Recent investigations suggest that the stability of labile carboninputs in soil mostly depends upon the physical, chemical, and biological proper-ties of the surroundings. Here, we propose that, in some ecosystems, such asforests and grasslands, root exudates can function as a source of soil organiccarbon (SOC) that can be stabilized through various mechanisms leading tolong-term sequestration. Increasing soil carbon sequestration is important forcapturing atmospheric CO2and combating climate change issues. Thus, thereis an urgent need to preserve existing ecosystems and to adopt strategies suchas afforestation, reforestation, and establishment of arti ﬁcial grasslands to fostercarbon sequestration through higher root exudate inputs in the soil.Greenhouse gas emissions: a global concernThe annual United Nations climate change conference, Conference of Parties (COP) 26 (seeGlossary ) recently took place in Glasgow, UK (2– 11 November 2021)i. One of its prime goalswas to work toward the strict compliance of the Paris Agreement (COP21), which was signedby more than 170 countries. These countries are required to work toward the reduction of green-house gas (GHG) emissions in such a way that global warming can be limited to less than 2°Ccompared with preindustrial temperature levels. Following this policy, an international initiativewas launched on 1 December 2015 termed the ‘4 per 1000 initiative ’. This initiative aims toincrease soil carbon assets by 0.4% annually within the top 30 –40 cm layer of soil of agriculturalﬁelds, grassland, and forestsii[1,2]. Some of the joint statements and declarations during COP26were launched for the purpose of ﬁnding practical solutions for increasing carbon sequestrationi.The Earth ’s soil contains around 2500 gigatons (Gt) of carbon, which is more than three times thelevel of carbon in the atmosphere [ 3]. The addition of more organic carbon in the soil should resultin net removal and/or reduction of CO 2, a common GHG, from the environment. A crude calcu-lation by Kell indicated that around 10% more CO 2sequestered in soil may result in the removal ofup to 20% of CO 2from the atmosphere [ 4]. Thus, increasing organic carbon content in soil is animportant process to mitigate climate change resulting from CO 2emission from various naturalandanthropogenic activities .Several arti ﬁcial and natural routes can lead to the seq uestration of atmospheric carbon intothe soil. There are many common arti ﬁcial processes, such as afforestation ,reforestation ,natural regeneration ,reduced-impact logging (RIL) , minimum or no tillage, mulch farming,growing perennial crops, judicious nutrient management and manuring, cover residue manage-ment, cover cropping, rotational grazing, and judicious application of irrigation water [ 5–7].Natural processes include plant litter deposition, accumulation of soil microorganism biomass,plant root debris accumulation, and root exudation [ 8,9]. Earlier studies showed that below-ground carbon inputs are more important sources of stable SOC than are aboveground inputs[9–11]. However, the contribution of carbon-rich root exudates insoil carbon sequestrationhas not been the focus of much research, perhaps due to the counter-effects of microbial pro-cesses and the ‘priming effect ’. The priming effect counters the net stability of root exudates inHighlightsSoil and plants are pivotal to the pro-cesses important for maintaining theintegrity of biogeochemical cycles, suchas the carbon cycle. Over the pastfew decades, anthropogenic activitieshave disturbed the atmospheric carboncycle, leading to severe CO2emissionsinto the atmosphere.Soil carbon sequestration by plantroot exudates is an important meansfor net removal of CO2content from theatmosphere.The rhizosphere environment in naturalecosystems, such as forests and grass-lands, can help to stabilize rootexudates in soil, while conditions incroplands do not appear favorable tos t a b i l i z er o o te x u d a t e sa sas o i lo r -ganic carbon (SOC) source.Thus, preserving forests and grasslandswith plant species secreting a highamount of carbon compounds mightincrease the SOC content in the soil ofthese ecosystems.1National Institute of Plant GenomeResearch, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg,New Delhi 110067, India2Plants and Ecosystems (PLECO),Biology Department, University ofAntwerp, BE-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium3CREAF, Cerdanyola del Vallès 08193,Catalonia, Spain4CSIC, Global Ecology UnitCREAF-CSIC-UAB, Bellaterra 08193,Catalonia, Spain*Correspondence:jitender@nipgr.ac.in (J.

All rights reserved.Trends inPlant Sciencethe soil, making them a transient or ‘labile ’source of SOC. In this opinion article, we compare theutility of root exudates in enhancing soil carbon content in three ecosystems: agricultural lands(croplands), forests, and grasslands. We highlight the potential of forests and grasslands toincrease soil carbon pools by root exudatio n of organic carbon compounds. We argue thatvarious properties of the soil and plant root exudates help to stabilize these compounds withinthe soil, thus, helping to increase the pool of SOC in the soil of these ecosystems. Therefore, pre-serving and protecting these ecosystems might signi ﬁcantly add to the SOC content via deposi-tion and stabilization of plant root exudates.The paradox of soil carbon sequestration by root exudatesAs i g n i ﬁcant amount of soil carbon input comes from belowground plant processes [ 9,10,12](Figure 1 A–C). Photosynthetically ﬁxed carbon is deposited within the rhizosphere primarily asroot biomass, exudates, and microbial biomass, as soil organic matter (SOM). It was recentlypointed out that there is a ‘paradox ’between stabilization and destabilization of SOC due toplant root-associated processes, including the process of root exudation [ 13]. Several studieshave categorized root exudates as a ‘labile ’form of SOC [ 14–18]. Here, we de ﬁne ‘labile ’in thecontext of plant root exudates that they are easily broken down by soil microorganisms. Freshlyadded root exudates can increase SOC utilization by increasing microbial activities in the rhizo-sphere, leading to a signiﬁ cant amount of CO2release into the atmosphere. Thus, these freshlyadded carbon compounds can lead to destabiliz ation of already existin g carbon pools in thesoil, a phenomenon known as the ‘priming effect ’[19]. Interestingly, ot her studies reportedthat, despite the visible priming effect, freshly added carbon can still contribute to higher netSOC [20, 21]. Multiple factors in ﬂuence the effect of root exudates on SOC stabilizationor SOC replenishment. These include soil textu re, species richness, microbial composition(numbers and diversity), C:N ratio of added c ompounds, relative ratio of rhizosphere andbulk soil , nutrient availability, climate, and already existing carbon pools in the soil [ 9,10,20,22–24].Thus, the extent to which root exudates can cause ‘positive ’or‘negative ’priming effects inthe rhizosphere predominantly determines their role in soil carbon liberation or sequestration,respectively [ 25].Root exudates encompass the majority of nonvolatile rhizodeposits and include an abundanceof soluble organic compounds, such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids [ 26]. Both low-molecular-weight root exudates and mucilages can be used as a carbon source by the microbialcommunity [ 26]. Various studies have investigated the role of important root exudate compoundsin SOC stabilization. For instance, Landi et al. used an exogenous application of glucose andoxalic acid, compounds frequently present in root exudates, to study CO2emissions inducedby a forest soil microbial community. Their analysis suggested that the addition of oxalic acidcaused a more pronounced positive priming effect compared with glucose [ 27]. Keiluweit etal.used13C-labeled arti ﬁcial exudates along with an arti ﬁcial root system to mimic natural soilconditions. Despite slight differences in the methods used, their study also indicated that oxalicacid causes higher respiration compared with adding glucose [ 28]. Similarly, Luo et al. testedthe respiration rates in soil samples of various biotopes, amended with glucose, citric acid, andoxalic acid, although with con ﬂicting results [ 29]. The highest respiration rate was obtained forglucose amendments, while oxalic acid amend ments did not cause a positive priming effectamong the various biotopes used. Here, the question arises why the same components showedcontrasting results in terms of SOC stabilization. Recently, some groups have argued that the sta-bility of organic carbon added to the soil is largely in ﬂuenced by the nature and properties of the soiland the belowground ecosystem, and is less dependent upon the chemistry of the added com-pounds [ 8,30,31]. For instance, organic acids, such as oxalic acid, can form stable SOC compo-nents by binding to aluminium and iron oxides [ 17,32], while, by contrast, they can alsoTrends in Plant Science750 Trends in Plant Science, August 2022, Vol. 27, No. 8Glossary4 per 1000 initiative: initiative startedby the French Government at theCOP21, Paris climate summit in 2015with the purpose of increasing soilcarbon by 0.4% each year to deal withclimate change and increase foodsecurity.Afforestation: establishment of a forestor stand of trees (forestation) in an areawhere there was no previous tree cover.Anthropogenic activities: humanactivities.Apparent priming effect: change inemission of CO2due to microbialdecomposition/respiration after additionof labile carbon compounds in the soil.Biochar: charcoal-like substanceproduced from burnt plant matter.Bulk soil: soil other than therhizosphere.Conference of Parties (COP):decision-making body responsible formonitoring and reviewing the imple-mentation of the United Nations Frame-work Convention on Climate Change.Labile carbon pools: fraction of soilorganic carbon that can be brokendown very quickly (e.g., during respira-tion of microorganisms) compared withthe stable part of SOC.Mineral-associated organic carbon(MAOC): organic carbon that isassociated with soil minerals.

Thus, SOC stability may depend upon the aluminium/ironoxide content and the other properties of the soil in the particular ecosystem.The involvement of soil microorganisms is also important in terms of SOC stability. Root exudatesare well known for attracting soil microorganisms within the rhizosphere [ 33]. The accumulation ofmicroorganisms may lead to either SOC destabilization through increased respiration or SOCstabilization due to accumulation of microbial biomass residues (necromass) [ 24,34,35].

While anthropogenic activitiesin agricultural land can directly or indirectly a ffect net SOC gain or stabilization, grasslandsand forests can be habitats in which net soil carbon sequestration by root exudates is feasible[7,36–39].SOC sequestration in agricultural lands is highly affected by anthropogenicactivitiesOne of the major sources of GHG emission is agricultural land, contributing up to 10.3% of totalGHGiii. While the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic situation has led to atemporary decrease in worldwide GHG emission by sectors such as power, industry, surfacetransport, and aviation, there are still no signs of a reduction in emissions by the agriculturaland forestry sectors [ 40,41]. Agricultural soils can accumulate a signiﬁ cant amount of organic car-bon, while at the same time ful ﬁlling the ever-increasing global food demand [ 42]. The total SOCcontent of agricultural land and managed areas is around 160.2 Gt [ 43]. However, many agricul-tural practices, such as soil tillage, removal of crop litter, and deep ploughing, lead to increasedmineralization of labile SOC [ 42]. Indeed, there is recent experimental evidence showing SOC sta-bilization following ‘no tillage ’adoption [ 44]. In addition, ﬂooding associated with rice cultivationusually results in higher GHG emission from soils [ 45]. There is evidence that the conversion ofnatural ecosystems to cultivated ones has signi ﬁcantly reduced the Earth ’s soil carbon pools[3,8]. Pausch et al. showed that annual crop species allocate a lower amount of belowgroundcarbon compared with grass and tree species ( Figure 1 A) [46 ]. SOC accumulation in the formof fungal and bacterial biomass is also smaller than in forests and grasslands (Table S1 in the sup-plemental information online). Moreover, the intense application of chemical fertilizers might leadto higher GHG emissions and eutrophication, which can revert the overall effect of SOC seques-tration by root exudation or any other natural modes of carbon sequestration (plant litter and mi-crobial necromass deposition) [ 47]. Thus, despite having a very high carbon sink capacity due toits relatively high productivity, agricultural land is often a poor candidate for soil carbon sequestra-tion. This could explain the decrease in soil organic matter on intensely farmed agricultural landsince the ‘green revolution ’in the middle of the past century [ 48].Root exudates can help to sequester carbon in forestsForest soils sequester more soil carbon compared with cropland soils [ 4]. The SOC content inforests is close to 702 Gt for soil layers up to 100 cm, which is further divided into topsoils,0–30 cm (342.6) and subsoils, 30 –100 cm (359.5) [ 43]. Forests can be subdivided into ﬁvem a j o rb i o m e s :b o r e a l ,p o l a r ,t e m p e r a t e ,s u b t r o p i c a l ,a n dt r o p i c a l .A m o n gt h e s eﬁ ve biomes,tropical forests cover 45% of total forested land [ 49]. The quantitative data on SOC contentin the top 100-cm soil of tropical, temperate, a nd boreal forest suggest that tropical forestscontain 214 –435 Gt of SOC, while temperate and boreal forest soils contain up to 153 –195 Gtand 338 Gt, respectively [ 50]. However, high uncertainty exists regarding the SOC contentbelow a depth of 100 cm in these biomes [ 50]. Emissions of CO2due to the positive priming effectwere found to be lower in soils of tropical forests than in other ecosystems, such as drylands andcroplands [ 31]. The negative priming effect in the soil of tropical forests appears to be a functionTrends in Plant ScienceTrends in Plant Science, August 2022, Vol. 27, No. 8 751drought, and insect and disease infes-tations, and by unnatural ones, such aslogging, mining, agricultural clearing, anddevelopment.Rhizosphere: soil closely associatedwith plant roots.Root exudates: suite of substances inthe rhizosphere that are secreted by theroots of living plants and microbiallymodi ﬁed products of these substances.They comprise low- and high-molecular-weight organic compounds that arepassively and actively released.Soil carbon sequestration: additionof atmospheric carbon into the soil,resulting in a net decrease in CO2intothe atmosphere.Soil organic carbon (SOC): measur-able part of soil organic matter.

The belowground soil carbon sequestration patterns in three ecosystems: (A) agricultural lands, (B) forests,and (C) grasslands. Carbon allocation patterns of crops, trees, and grasses represent agriculture, forests, and grasslands, respectively. Data for carbon allocation patternswere taken from [ 46], which is a compilation of 281 data sets. Carbon partitioning is depicted in terms of absolute values using the unit, grams of carbon per meter squareper year (g C m–2year–1) GPP values for crops were taken from [ 100] and for grasslands from [ 101], while GPP values for forests were calculated by taking averages of GPP(Figure legend continued at the bottom of the next page.)Trends in Plant Science752 Trends in Plant Science, August 2022, Vol. 27, No. 8of their higher initial SOC content. When a labile carbon source is added to these soils, theapparent priming effect rarely shows up due to the lower microbia l turnover activity. Interestingly,these results were obtained by comparing the variousf a c t o r sa f f e c t i n gt h ep r i m i n g ,s u c ha sc l i m a t e ,soil properties, and microbial composition of trop ical forests, which appear to be favorable for SOCstabilization [ 31]. Another study suggests that, while a single addition of labile carbon may induce apositive priming effect, the continuous addition of root exudates leads to net SOC retention intropical forest soils [ 51]. Very few studies have analyzed root exudate composition from tree speciesprobably because of the dif ﬁculties in the sampling of exudates from their roots. However, thequantity of carbon added to the soil by trees in the form of root exudates is more than that ofcrops and grasses ( Figure 1A –C; Table S2 in the supplemental information online). Microorganisms,such as fungi, contribute to stable SOC formation using labile carbon sources [ 52]. Interestingly, soilsof boreal, tropical, and temperate forests carry hi gh fungal biomass compared with grasslands andcroplands [ 53,54]. Soils of boreal and temperate forests are abundant in slow-decomposingectomycorrhizal fungi, helping to stabilize recalcitrant SOC, while tropical and subtropical forestsoils are rich in arbuscular mycorrhizal fun gi, which are involved in fast SOC turnover [ 55]. However,the experimental addition of root exudates in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-dominant forests causedlower priming compared with ectomycorrhizal fung i-dominant forests due to higher physical protec-tion of SOC [ 56]. Thus, the combination of a lower positiv e priming effect and higher SOC formationby the fungal population using carbon sources pr ovided by root exudates could lead to the accumu-lation of SOC from root exudates in these forest ecosystems.SOC is often subdivided into two types: particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) [57]. While the POC fraction of SOC is more vulnerableto microbial decomposition, the MAOC displays higher persistence due to protection by mineralassociation [ 58]. Root exudates are important in the formation of MAOC stock piling in soil with ahigh nitrogen content [ 21,59](Figure 1 D). The abundant stocks of nitrogen in tropical soils canefﬁciently support MAOC formation in these soils [ 60]. Macroaggregate formation is well knownto facilitate carbon retention in soil [ 61]. Root exudates can instigate macroaggregate formationin tropical forest soils with the help of their high clay composition [ 62–64](Figure 1 D). Polysaccha-rides, including sugar molecules, such as rhamnose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, andglucose, are the ‘sticky ’components found in extracts of mucilages that aid the stabilization ofsoil aggregates (Table S2 in the supplemental information online) [65 –67]. This phenomenonof SOC formation through high-quality labile root litter, termed the ‘soil centered ’approach,leads to long-term stabilization (>10 years) compared with stabilization through the recalcitrant‘litter-centered ’approach (1 –10 years) [ 68]. In this way, root exudates can both increase andstabilize the forest SOC content using the surrounding soil properties.Role of root exudates in carbon sequestration in grasslandsAs with forests, grasslands also represent a na tural reserve of SOC, given that they containaround 439 Gt of SOC [ 43]. Grasses exude a plethora of organic compounds, with organicacids and amino acids as relatively abundant forms [ 69]. A positive correlation between rootexudation and SOC accumulation was shown in an experiment that manipulated grasslandbiodiversity. Grasslands with higher species richness showed higher SOC accumulation [ 24].The study also indicated that, since root ex udates drive SOC accumulation by attractingof tropical, temperate and boreal forest ecosystems from [ 50] (D) Root exudates can act as a carbon source in soil and are also stabilized by processes such as MAOCformation and macro-aggregate formation. Root exudates also help in incorporation of plant and microbial residues into the stable SOC content by agg regatesformation and chemical bonding. Addition of biochar further increases the stability of root exudates in soil. Exudates also attract micro-organism s. This leads to theemission of CO 2as a result of their respiration.

While one study found a higher proportion of bacterial biomass and, thus, a lower pro-portion of fungal biomass, in grasslands compared with forests and croplands [ 53], another studyshowed that grasslands carry inter mediate proportions of bacterial biomass (Table S1 in the supple-mental information online) [ 54]. However, the fungal and bacterial biomass is appreciably high inpasture lands [54]. It is hypothesized that the belowgrou nd biomass of dead roots and microbialnecromass carrying the recalcitrant sources of SO C are stabilized by the processes of aggregationand chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix. This process is known as the microbial efﬁ ciency-matrix stabilization (MEMS) framework, which requires the involvement of labile carbon sources,such as root exudates [ 22,70,71]. The high water-holding capacity of mucilages further helps thisaggregation process [ 72]. SOC formation from dead roots is more ef ﬁcient in the deeper soils ofgrasslands compared with forest s, possibly because of the higher age and rigidity of tree roots com-pared with grass roots. Although tree roots are a m ore recalcitrant reservoir of carbon, they mainlyoccur in the top layers of soil, which are more prone to decomposition. By contrast, grass rootsform a dense network of ﬁne roots in deeper soils, which leads to slower decomposition [ 73,74].Furthermore, the recalcitrance of tree roots usually leads to short-term stabilization, while the ﬁneroots of grasses increase SOC stabilization in the longer term through the reaction of microbialproducts with mineral surfaces in the rhizosphere (for more details, please see [ 68]). In addition,the dense vegetation in grasslands with higher species richness also results in lower evaporationrates, thus mitigating the effect of climate on SOC decomposition [24].Another study showed that, following the pattern of tropical forest, grassland soils also displayed anet negative priming effect after the addition of fresh carbon sources [ 31]. The reason for this SOCstabilization could be high iron and aluminium oxide content in grassland soils (e.g., savannahand Tibetan alpine grasslands), which leads to mineral protection of labile SOC [ 75,76]. A signi ﬁcantamount of carbon may be added by root exudates to grasslands during grazing. There isconsiderable evidence suggesting that grazing stimulates ﬁne root exudation from C4 grassesand adds to the SOC [ 77–80]. Overall, the top 0 –20-cm soil layer of grazing grasslands, which isclosely associated with the roots, carries a high SOC density [ 81] and the higher SOC content ispositively correlated with the higher total nitrogen content in grasslands [ 82].Recently, a decade-long experimental set-up was used to test the utility of biochar amendment inincreasing the stability of exudates in ferralsols, a common soil type in the grasslands of tropical andsubtropical regions. It was observed that biochar can stabilize labile carbon from freshly addedryegrass root exudates by enhancing organo –mineral interactions [ 83]. Furthermore, biochar canincrease both the POC and MAOC content. The narrow rhizosphere-to-bulk soil ratio (~1/4) in thetopsoil of the grasslands is the key to stable MAOC formation by root exudates compared withecosystems in which the rhizosphere-to-bulk soil ra tio widens (>1/10), owing to higher root exudatesinputs in the rhizosphere [ 9]. Other studies have also supported the effectiveness of biochar instabilizing SOC built-up by root exudates due to negative priming in the long term [ 84,85]. Naturalbiochar can comprise up to 40% of grassland and boreal forest SOM content [ 30]. Additional inputsof‘naturally generated ’biochar along with natural exudation processes are efﬁ cacious processes inSOC sequestration in tropical and subtr opical grasslands and pasture lands ( Figure 1 D).Concluding remarks and future perspectivesRoot exudates are rich in organic compounds. However, studies of their potential roles inSOC formation and stabilization largely remain elusive. While human interference has led toTrends in Plant Science754 Trends in Plant Science, August 2022, Vol. 27, No. 8Outstanding questionsHow can we develop methods to getprecise in situ data on root exudatecompositions in natural ecosystems?How can we select plant species thatefﬁciently secrete root exudates thatcan increase SOC content?Is it possible to measure the SOC re-sulting exclusively from root exudatesin situ , separating it from the SOC as-sociated with aboveground plant in-puts and microbial inputs?Which methods can be used tominimize CO2emissions from naturalecosystems, such as forests andgrasslands, so that they do notbecome a net source of atmosphericcarbon?Can root exudates and root litter of arange of plant species increase stablesoil organic carbon content, and dothey do this more ef ﬁciently comparedwith aboveground plant inputs?disturbances of the SOC pools of agricultural lands, forests and grasslands appear to be morepromising in terms of achieving high soil carbon sequestration [ 7,36–39]. Most terrestrial soils arefar from carbon saturation and, in many places, roots can reach up to several meters in the soil,with exudates able to penetrate even further and, thus, can function in increasing SOC pools [ 4].Therefore, restoring and preserving degraded trop ical forests and grasslands, identifying and sow-ing seeds of root biomass-rich species that can secrete abundant amounts of carbon compounds,addition of naturally generated biochar, and establishment of pasture lands, are some of the impor-tant practices to enhance SOC sequestration via root exudates in these ecosystems.It is also important to consider the technical issues for the study of root exudates in soil carbonsequestration in natural ecosystems. There is a severe lack of in situ studies of root exudates[86,87]. Such in situexperiments may give a more realistic picture of how root exudates add toSOC pools in forests and grasslands. While the analysis of exudates from short-term experimentsin controlled conditions is comparatively simple, the sampling and analysis of exudates from olderplants in their native conditions is a technically demanding process that has resulted in a dearth ofdata regarding the actual composition of root exudates in soil [ 88–91]. Most exudate studies arebased on samples collected in hydroponics, and more research is needed to identify the compo-sition of root exudates in real soil [ 92]. The use of stable13C tracer techniques to measure rootexudates derived from SOC is a better approach compared with the use of arti ﬁcial exudateswithin arti ﬁcial experimental set-ups, because it can measure the net accumulation of rootexudates in the rhizosphere and is not biased toward any speci ﬁc components [ 91,93–96].Many studies have used breeding and genetically modi ﬁed plants for the past two decades toincrease their resistance toward multiple stress conditions through increased root biomass andexudation [ 33,97–99]. Similar approaches could be tested for native plant species of forestsand grasslands to increase SOC in these ecosystems through root exudate deposition. In thisway, the goals of dealing with climate change, in addition to increasing food security, might beachieved with the help of cultivars with higher root exudation (see Outstanding questions ).AcknowledgmentsP.P. acknowledges a research fellowship from UGC, India, a Newton Bhabha PhD placement fellowship from DBT, India, andthe British Council, UK.
