This review summarizes the information on i) the biochemical nature, physical stateand origin of GRSP, ii) GRSP decomposition and residence time in soil, iii) GRSP functions, in particular the phys-ical, chemical, and biochemical roles for soil aggregation and carbon (C) sequestration, and ﬁnally iv) how landuse and agricultural management affect GRSP production and subsequently, organic C sequestration. GRSP aug-ment soil quality by increasing water holding capacity, nutrient storage and availability, microbial and enzymaticactivities, and microbial production of extracellular polysaccharides. After release into the soil, GRSP becomeprone to microbial decomposition due to stabilization with organic matter and sesquioxides, and thereby in-creasing the residence time between 6 and 42 years.Temperate soils contain 2-15 mg GRSP g-1, whereas arid and semiarid grasslands amount for 0.87-1.7 mg g-1,a n dGRSP are lower in desert soils. GRSP content is highest in acidic soils as compared to neutral and calcareous soils.Conservation tillage, organic fertilizers and AMF inhabiting crops (e.g. maize, sorghum, soybean, and wheat) in-crease GRSP production and transform C into stable forms, thereby sustaining soil health and reducing CO2Keywords:Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiAgricultural management practicesGlomalinCarbon captureSoil qualityScience of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 150571Abbreviations: AMF, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; C, Carbon; GRSP, Glomalin related soil proteins; SOC, Soil organic carbon.⁎Corresponding author.⁎⁎Correspondence to: Y.

Crop rotations with non-mycorrhizal species (e.g. rapeseed) and fallow soils reduce AMF growth andconsequently, the GRSP production. The GRSP production increases under nutrient and water de ﬁciency, soilwarming and elevated CO 2. In the context of global climate change, increased C sequestration through GRSP in-duced aggregate formation and organic matter stabilization prolong the mean residence time of soil C. Protectingsoils against degradation under intensive land use, stable aggregate formation, and prolonging the residence timeof C calls for strategies that maximize GRSP production and functions based on reduced tillage, AMF-relevant croprotations and organic farming.©2 0 2 1E l s e v i e rB .

IntroductionSoil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration refers to the reduction of an-thropogenic CO 2emissions by facilitating their capture and storage inbiotic and soil carbon (C) pools. SOC sequestration is based on the in-crease of mean residence time (MRT) of C in soil (or other stablepools) to prevent its re-emission into the atmosphere ( Lal, 2008 ;Olson et al., 2014 ). The keywords in this de ﬁnition are: the transfer ofCO2from atmosphere through plants into the soil, plant residues,increasing MRT, and avoiding re-emission into the atmosphere. Soil ag-gregation and C stabilization processes are interlinked because thewater-stable aggregates protect against SOC decomposition and pavethe way for C stabilization ( Six et al., 2002 ;Totsche et al., 2018 ). Mycor-rhizal and saprophytic fungi are the most important microbial groupsfor aggregate formation and stabilization, whereas bacteria are impor-tant mainly for the lower hierarchical aggregate orders such asmicroaggregates ( Six et al., 2004 ).Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish symbiotic relation-ships with more than 80% of terrestrial plants. AMF produceglycoprotein glomalin, more speci ﬁcally glomalin related soil proteins(GRSP, often interchangeable), which are crucial for soil aggregation, Cstorage and soil quality improvements ( Nichols, 2003 ;Rillig et al.,2001b ;Schüßler et al., 2001 ). Even before the discovery of glomalin,Gupta and Germida (1988) advocated the existence of agglutinativeagents (possibly microbially derived) that cemented and ef ﬁcientlyformed microaggregates. The mycotrophic ability of AMF (AMF coloni-zation) and GRSP production is important to increase soil quality andprotect its structure ( Holátko et al., 2021 ). In the case of AMF-mediated soil aggregation, the indirect role of GRSP is more importantthan the direct role of hyphae ( Rillig et al., 2002a ).To represent glomalin, a more categorical term ‘Glomalin RelatedSoil Proteins ’or‘GRSP ’was proposed due to the lack of protocols forextracting pure glomalin. Subsequently, GRSP became the acceptedterm for glomalin ( Rillig, 2004 ). Glomalin quanti ﬁed by the Bradfordprotein assay is termed as ‘BRSP ’or‘Bradford reactive soil protein ’(Table 1 ). The term ‘glomalin ’has been reserved to designate the puri-ﬁed product of AMF, which is measured through the monoclonal anti-bodies generated against AMF ( Wright et al., 1998 ;Wright andR. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 1505712Upadhyaya, 1996 ). To avoid confusion in nomenclature, this reviewuses AMF glycoproteins for native glomalin and GRSP for extractedglomalin ( Table 1 ).This review summarizes and generalizes information on the role ofAMF-produced glycoproteins (GRSP) in sequestering soil C and focuseson i) the origin, biochemical nature, and physical state of GRSP in soils,ii) their decomposition and residence time, iii) the direct and indirectrole of GRSP in physical, biochemical and microbial C stabilization, andiv) the impact of land use and agricultural management practices onGRSP production and its consequences for SOC sequestration.2. An overview of AMF glycoproteins2.1. The sources and chemical properties of GRSPGRSP in their native form were identi ﬁed as a recalcitrant, hydro-phobic and sticky glycoproteins ( Wright et al., 1998 ;Wright andUpadhyaya, 1996 ). The presence of N-linked oligosaccharides on AMFhyphae and carbohydrate residues ( Nichols, 2003 ;Wright et al., 1998 )corroborate the glycoproteinaceous nature of GRSP ( Fig. 1 ). Glycosyl-ated proteins constitute a major portion of GRSP and the speci ﬁc glycandomains are responsible for the apparent diversity of GRSP ( Bolligeret al., 2008 ;Wright et al., 1998 ). Contradicting their glycoprotein nature,freeze dried GRSP extracts contained more protein-peptide signals withfewer carbohydrate signals, suggesting that it was a ‘chaperon contain-ing thioredoxin ’(Gillespie et al., 2011 ).GRSP consists of a broad range of elements, functional groups andcomposite substances ( He et al., 2010 ;Lovelock et al., 2004a ;Nicholsand Wright, 2004, 2006 ;Nichols, 2003 ;Rillig et al., 2001b ;Schindleret al., 2007 ;Wang et al., 2015 ;Wright and Anderson, 2000 ;Wrightand Upadhyaya, 1998 )(Fig. 2 ). Besides C, N, H and O, it also containsFe, P, Al, Na, Ca, K, Mg and Si. Seven dominant functional groups suchas aromatic, aliphatic, carboxyl and carbohydrate type C, along with pro-teins and carbohydrates are prevalent ( Wang et al., 2015 ). The basicchemical structure ( Fig. 2 ) contains functional groups that are identi ﬁedthrough ﬂuorescencing in UV light ( Wang et al., 2015 ). However, thecomplex nature of GRSP structure still warrants a more detailed exami-nation ( Holátko et al., 2021 ). When released from hyphae, GRSP displaya high degree of hydrophobicity and ﬂoats on the water surface beforebinding to mineral or organic particles ( Nichols and Wright, 2004 ). Typ-ically, when sand-based cultures are immersed, GRSP forms a brownfoam on the water surface ( Nichols and Wright, 2004 ).GRSP exist in soil mainly as easily extractable (EE) and total-GRSP(T-GRSP), analytically differentiated by their extraction procedures(Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996 )(Table 1 ). The EE-GRSP is recently pro-duced GRSP fraction with high immunoreactivity and solubility inwater, and thus is more labile than T-GRSP ( Wright and Upadhyaya,1998 ). EE and T-GRSP increase with increasing AMF colonization andAMF-speci ﬁc fatty acid signatures (phospholipid fatty acid 16:1 ω5cis)(Agnihotri et al., 2018, 2021 ).2.2. Analyses of GRSP in soilGRSP were initially detected as a dark red to brown compounds insoil, whereas the brown color was associated with iron ( Wright andUpadhyaya, 1998 ). The EE-GRSP and T-GRSP pools are extracted byautoclaving the soil with alkaline citrate buffer followed by centrifuga-tion ( Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996 ). The molarity of citrate buffer andthe autoclaving duration determine the GRSP pool and can be extracted(Table 1 ). The T-GRSP, being recalcitrant, requires 50 mM citrate buffer(pH 8.0) and prolonged autoclaving. The extraction of T-GRSP is re-peated until a straw-colored or slightly colorless extract is obtained.This requires up to seven cycles ( Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996, 1998 )of autoclaving and centrifugation with citrate buffer. The yellow colorof the extract indicates an inherent non-speci ﬁcity of the extractionmethod: some fulvic- and humic-like substances are also co-extractedat pH 8.0. The EE-GRSP pool is extracted with 20 mM sodium citratebuffer (pH 7.0) followed by centrifugation ( Nichols, 2003 ;Wright andUpadhyaya, 1998 ). Unlike T-GRSP, one extraction cycle is suf ﬁcient toobtain the EE-GRSP pool.Table 1Terminology, extraction and descriptions for glomalin related soil proteins (GRSP) given by various literature sources.Extraction/Description GRSP fractiona,bReferenceExtracted from soil using 20 mM sodium citrate followed by30-60 min of autoclaving and centrifugationEasily extractable glomalin (EEG)(Wright andUpadhyaya, 1996, 1998 ) Extracted from soil using 50 mM sodium citrate followed by60-90 min of autoclaving and centrifugationTotal glomalin (TG)Immunoreactive fraction of TG IRTG (Immunoreactive total glomalin) ( Wright andUpadhyaya, 1998 ) Immunoreactive fraction of EEG IREEG (Immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin)Previously called glomalin and include both total glomalin (TG)and easily extractable glomalin (EEG) fractionsGRSP (Glomalin related soil protein)(Rillig, 2004 ) New terminologies for easily extractable glomalin (EEG)EE-BRSP (Easily extractable-Bradford reactive soil protein)EE-IRSP (Easily extractable immunoreactive reactive soil protein)New terminologies for total glomalin (TG)BRSP (Bradford reactive soil protein)/T-BR SP (Total-Bradford reactive soil protein)IRSP (Immunoreactive reactive soil protein)Other terms for glomalin and GRSPDE-GRSP (dif ﬁcultly-extractable glomalin-related soil protein)c(Wu et al., 2014 )Citrate extractable soil proteins (CESP) ( Holátko et al., 2021 )Autoclaved citrate extractable protein ( Hurisso et al., 2018 )SPRG (Soil protein related to glomalin)(Pérez et al., 2012)GAHS (Glomalin associated with humic substances)GRSP eand GRSP t(Easily extractable and total glomalin related soil protein) ( Liu et al., 2020 )BRF (Bradford reactive fraction) ( Whiffen et al., 2007 )BRS (Bradford reactive substance)(Janos et al., 2008 )Immunoreactive fraction of TG and EEG IRP (Immunoreactive protein)Extracted from root using 50 mM sodium citrate (90 min ofautoclaving)Glomalin-related root protein (GRRP) ( Wu et al., 2016 )BRP (Bradford Root Protein)(Rosier et al., 2008 ) Extracted from root using 20 mM sodium citrate (30 min ofautoclaving)IRP (Immunoreactive root protein)aExtracted protein may contain some thermostable compounds of plant origin, lipids, proteins, humic acid like substances and carbohydrates that sur vived autoclaving and couldinterfere with quanti ﬁcation.bImmunoreactive fractions are quanti ﬁed by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) through cross-reactivity to anti glomalin antibody MAb32B11; Bradford reactive fractions byBradford protein assay and all others by both the methods.cSame soil-sub-sample is used to extract EE and T-GRSP/DE-GRSP and at some places the sum of the two fractions is known as T-GRSP.R. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 1505713Despite efforts to purify GRSP by precipitation with trichloroaceticacid, many non-protein impurities have been detected in the extracts(Gillespie et al., 2011 ;Schindler et al., 2007 ). No acid-free glomalinwas obtained by extracting GRSP either before or after humic acid ex-traction that interferes with GRSP quanti ﬁcation ( Moragues-Saituaet al., 2019 ).The Bradford protein assay and enzyme linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) are used to quantify GRSP against the background of var-ious other compounds extracted by Na-citrate buffer (e.g., fulvic acids)(Table 1 ). Recovery in the indigenous state is hindered by the adsorp-tion and desorption of GRSP on various sorbents ( Jia et al., 2016 ), andstrong binding with soil components that includes clays, amorphousand crystalline sesquioxides, organic matter fractions such as humicand fulvic acids ( Fig. 3 ). The GRSP sorption depends on soil pH, organicmatter and clay contents ( Churchman et al., 2006 ;Jia et al., 2016 ;Paterson et al., 1991 ). These properties are critical to analyze beforestudying GRSP. Due to the differences in soil chemistry, the universalprotocol for GRSP extraction does not ensure its recovery in the nativestate because organic compounds (e.g., fulvic acids) are co-extracted,particularly in soils enriched with organic matter ( Nichols and Wright,2005 ). Many other plant-derived glycoprotein sources such as polyphe-nolic compounds and humic acids cross-react with the Bradford re-agent, leading to the misinterpretation of the real GRSP content(Jorge-Araújo et al., 2015 ;Whiffen et al., 2007 ). The covalent bonds gen-erated between proteins and polyphenolic compounds during extrac-tion make GRSP extraction and quanti ﬁcation dif ﬁcult and partlyuncertain ( Jorge-Araújo et al., 2015 ). The GRSP measured through theBradford protein is discussed in terms of fungal origin and the age ofFig. 2.

Wang et al., 2015 ;Wright and Anderson, 2000 ;Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998 ) (for details see Table S2).Fig. 1.

Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 1505714the EE and T-GRSP pools ( Staunton et al., 2020 ;Whiffen et al., 2007 ).GRSP are operationally de ﬁned based on the extraction method andtherefore recent studies have re ﬁned the terms such as autoclaved cit-rate extractable (ACE) protein and citrate extractable soil proteins(CESP) as more appropriate to designate GRSP ( Holátko et al., 2021 ;Hurisso et al., 2018 )(Table 1 ). This calls for better and uni ﬁed methodsto identify and quantify GRSP based on other organic compounds in-cluding proteins ( Roberts and Jones, 2008 ). ELISA using monoclonal an-tibody Mab32B11 is a better method to quantify GRSP ( Wright et al.,1998 ;Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996 ). However, impurities of plant ori-gin may replace GRSP and bind to the microtiter plate hindering theGRSP quanti ﬁcation ( Otten et al., 1997 ;Rosier et al., 2006 ). A modi ﬁedLowry method that yields separate measurements for protein and poly-phenols has also been recommended for GRSP estimation ( Redmile-Gordon et al., 2013 ). However, the Bradford assay remains a preferredmethod for GRSP estimation over the Lowry approach. The interferencecaused by polyphenols and other compounds is less likely to be encoun-tered in soils with low organic matter content ( Agnihotri et al., 2021 ).To improve the accuracy of the Bradford assay for GRSP measurement,modi ﬁcations have been suggested such as protein estimation usingthe dilution curve of the extract that includes the differential sensitivitytowards Coomassie brilliant blue-250 (CBB) ( Moragues-Saitua et al.,2019 ). However, the Bradford protein assay may over estimate GRSPdue to the possible cross-reactivity of Coomassie brilliant blue dyewith substances of plant origin and humic-acid like compounds thatcannot be ignored ( Holátko et al., 2021 ;Moragues-Saitua et al., 2019 ).Another study suggested that extract dilution and subtracting the pH-regulated absorbance prior to quanti ﬁcation enables to improve theprecision of Bradford assay to estimate GRSP content in organic matterrich forest soils ( Cissé et al., 2020 ).3. Functions of glycoproteins3.1. Functions of GRSP for AMFGRSP share some properties with the fungal hydrophobins andshield hyphae from nutrient losses ( Wessels, 1996 ). A conceptualmodel proposed in 2007 identi ﬁed three components of GRSP withthe following functions: i) as chaperonins at the cellular level, ii) ashyphal wall components at the AMF physiological level, and iii) assoil-aggregating substances at the edaphic level. The presence of GRSPin the hyphal cell walls has also been related to reduced mycelium pal-atability for fungal grazers ( Purin and Rillig, 2007 ). GRSP mitigate salin-ity stress ( Hammer and Rillig, 2011 ), sharing similarities with heatshock protein 60 (Hsp60) ( Gadkar and Rillig, 2006 ). GRSP are also in-volved in mitigating the cytosolic damage of sodium-induced proteinmisfolding ( Hammer and Rillig, 2011 ;Maathuis and Amtmann, 1999).To ease the hyphal proliferation through aggregates, AMF increasesGRSP production under abiotic stress conditions, e.g. droughts. Eventhough water-limiting conditions had adverse effects on living AMFbiomass (colonized roots and hyphae), the GRSP fractions (EE-GRSPand T-GRSP) increased along with portion of water-stable aggregates(0.25-1 mm) ( Zou et al., 2013 ).Together, GRSP protect AMF hyphae from drought and salinity stressas water-holding and lubricating substances, provide turgidity and ﬂex-ibility for the cell walls, and form protective coatings for hyphae andaggregates. We speculate that the high moisture within GRSP gelunder drought is the wet channel, through which nutrients move tothe roots and to AMF hyphae even at low water content in bulk soil.3.2. Contribution of AMF and GRSP to soil C sequestration3.2.1. Direct contribution of AMF hyphae and GRSP to C sequestration in soilThe direct contribution of mycorrhiza to C accumulation in soil canbe summed up in three process groups: i) formation and deposition ofmycorrhizal residues, ii) release of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymesby mycorrhiza mediating the decomposition of plant and microbial res-idues as well as SOM, and iii) stimulation of plant growth ( Treseder andHolden, 2013 ). AMF increases plant growth which translates into in-creased biomass above- and belowground, and increases the C inputin the soil (especially by roots and rhizodeposition) ( Jones et al., 2004 ;Treseder and Holden, 2013 ;Zhou et al., 2020 ). The two types of AMF hy-phae include runner hyphae and absorptive hyphae ( Fig. 4 ). The runnerhyphae grow into the soil, infect other roots and connect the surround-ing roots with hyphal bridges, and reside in the soil for a few weeks(Friese and Allen, 1991 ;Zhu and Miller, 2003 ). Absorptive hyphae areshort-lived (5-7 days) and are characterized by dichotomous branching(Fig. 4 ), subsequently developing a fan-shaped network ( Friese andAllen, 1991 ;Staddon et al., 2003 ). Although it remains unknownwhich hyphal pool is associated with larger GRSP amounts, the coarsehyphae clearly contain more GRSP than ﬁner ones ( Lovelock et al.,2004b ).The mean residence time (MRT) of C stored inside the aggregatesdoes not exceed the MRT of C stored by soil-GRSP complex, whereasthe resistant chitinous materials (amino sugars) of the hyphal cellwalls is responsible for C accumulation ( Chen et al., 2021 ;Cui et al.,2020 ;Zhu and Miller, 2003 ).The GRSP contribution to total C is larger than that of microbialbiomass and that of hyphal biomass ( Rillig et al., 2001b ). In the upper0-10 cm soil depth, GRSP typically contains 5% of total N and 3.2% oftotal C ( Lovelock et al., 2004a ) (Table S2). This is a very large GRSP con-tribution to the soil C and is common in natural ecosystems, whereas ahigher ratio of T-GRSP to SOC is common in grasslands ( Bai et al., 2011 ).3.2.2. Indirect contribution of AMF hyphae and GRSP to SOC sequestrationThe indirect contribution of GRSP to C sequestration is crucial be-cause it operates mainly through soil aggregation ( Miller and Jastrow,2000 ) and consequently, occluding organic compounds from plantand microbial necromass ( Awad et al., 2013 ) protects them from micro-bial and enzymatic attacks ( Fig. 4 ). The indirect effects of GRSP on SOCsequestration include the formation and stabilization of aggregatesresulting in increased C sequestration through i) physical protection ofSOC, ii) better plant growth and deeper root growth at the site of AMFspores, iii) increased microbial activity by contributing to active Cpools ( Subramanian et al., 2019 ;Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998 ), andFig. 3. Precipitation and sorption mechanisms of glomalin related soil proteins (GRSP)released from AMF hyphae in soil: the most common sorption on speci ﬁc substances insoils depending on soil pH and organic matter content. GRSP is strongly bound toorganic matter, sesquioxides and clay minerals. Outer sphere and inner spherecomplexes are formed with GRSP. GRSP is released faster from the outer than from theinner sphere complex due to the strong bonds in the last one ( Churchman et al., 2006 ;Jia et al., 2016 ;Paterson et al., 1991 ).R. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 1505715iv) increasing locally soil moisture during drought periods, similarly toroot mucilage ( Carminati et al., 2011 ).AMF contributes to C sequestration by translocating exudates awayfrom the rhizosphere –the zone of higher microbial activity and fromrespiratory zones in the soil matrix ( Treseder and Allen, 2000 ;Zhuand Miller, 2003 ). Moreover, AMF stabilizes the soil structure by mark-edly increasing the SOC content and the mean weight diameter of ag-gregates ( Xu et al., 2014 ). GRSP sorbed on the organic substances,clays and silt particles, and AMF hyphae mechanically bind particlesthereby enabling aggregate formation and stabilization ( Comis, 2002 ;Rillig et al., 2002a ). The second role of AMF is to produce GRSP andalso to increase plant growth by improving soil structure, deep rootgrowth, aeration and improving soil moisture status. In doing so, AMFensures its own survival ( Rillig and Steinberg, 2002 ;Wright andUpadhyaya, 1998 ). Assimilate allocation to AMF increases nutrient up-take by plants and consequently photosynthetic activity and generatesa sink for active C (e.g. carbohydrates), concomitantly increasing micro-bial and enzymatic activity and available C in the soil ( Sommer et al.,2017 ;Subramanian et al., 2019 ).Contradicting its hydrophobic nature, GRSP could contribute to dis-solved organic C pool ( Singh et al., 2017 ). GRSP also increases C seques-tration by maintaining labile C compounds within the aggregates andreducing the degradation of available organic matter ( Rillig, 2004 ).3.3. Role of GRSP in C sequestration depending on physical and biochemicalsoil propertiesThree principal mechanisms are responsible for SOC stabilization:physical protection, chemical and biochemical stabilization ( Six et al.,2002 ). The physical protection by AMF involves the formation of a‘sticky-string bag ’by the co-action of roots and hyphae binding soilparticles together to form micro- and macroaggregates ( Miller andJastrow, 2000 ;Yudina et al., 2018 ). Binding agents are critical to eachof the mechanisms listed above. Based on the mean residence timeand relative contribution to SOC, three classes of binding agents canbe distinguished i) transient/labile (microbial and plant-derived),ii) temporary (roots and hyphae), and iii) persistent (humi ﬁed organicmatter, polyvalent metal complexes, aluminosilicates and sesquioxides)(Miller and Jastrow, 2000 ;Gupta, 2011 ;Tisdall and Oades, 1982 ;Yudinaet al., 2018 ). AMF belongs to the second category of binding agents andconfers to temporary stabilization of macroaggregates ( Tisdall andOades, 1982 ;Yudina et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2016 ). GRSP belong tothe third category of binding agents, viz., persistent binding agents(Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996 ) through active contribution to micro-and macroaggregate formation and stabilization ( Nichols andHalvorson, 2013 ). The aggregate hierarchy concept ( Tisdall and Oades,1982 ) explains the steps of aggregate formation, with GRSP as integralparts/components of aggregate-binding agents. The GRSP content posi-tively correlates with aggregate stability ( Nautiyal et al., 2019 ;Wrightand Anderson, 2000 ;Wu et al., 2014 ) as well as with water-stableaggregates of 0.25-0.50 mm diameter ( Wu et al., 2012 ). GRSP facilitatesadhesion between and within microaggregates ( Wright et al., 2007 ).Thus, the microaggregates bind together into macroaggregates(>250 mm) by forming a mechanical framework of macroaggregatesthrough AMF roots and hyphae, but also by microbial- and plant-derived transient/labile binding agents ( Kleber et al., 2007 ;Six et al.,2002 ;Totsche et al., 2018 ). Hence, AMF increases SOM residence timeby stabilizing macroaggregates ( Miller and Jastrow, 2000 ).Iron constitutes a considerable portion of GRSP (Table S2, Fig. 2 )a n dis responsible for its typical red-brown color ( Wright and Upadhyaya,1998 ). Iron also converts monomeric GRSP units into a multimeric com-plex and is involved in creating a folding pattern in the protein to inten-sify the hydrophobic interactions between the monomeric units(Nichols, 2003 ). Phytopathogenic fungi have reduced access to ironwhen sequestered within GRSP molecules ( Rillig et al., 2001b ).Although iron remains central to most studies with GRSP and metalions, other polyvalent cations (Al3+,C a2+,M g2+)p r o b a b l yh a v es i m i l a reffects on GRSP structure and stabilization.GRSP have been speci ﬁcally related to β-glucosidase activity andcarbohydrate content. Similar to extracellular polysaccharides (EPS),GRSP act as a sticky and insoluble bio ﬁlm that glues together organicmatter, clays, minerals, (oxyhydr)oxides, and microorganisms ( Costaet al., 2018 ;Martinez-Salgado et al., 2010 ;Redmile-Gordon et al.,2014 ;Wu et al., 2012 ). The resulting microenvironment enables micro-bial degradation of organic matter and produces EPS for additionalaggregate stabilization ( Awad et al., 2013 ;Wright and Upadhyaya,1998 )(Fig. 4 ). The EPS function is to support plants with water andnutrients and to protect against drought stress ( Carminati et al., 2011 ;Costa et al., 2018 ). The labile organic compounds (such as polysaccha-rides) and persistent binding agents (humic-like acids, aluminosilicates,crystalline oxides) stabilize microaggregates ( Tisdall and Oades, 1982 ;Yudina et al., 2018 ). GRSP contains up to 85% polysaccharides that areresistant to microbial decomposition, and therefore, are involved inbinding mineral and organic particles to aggregates for long periods(Gunina and Kuzyakov, 2015 ). Hence, independent of origin (roots,hyphae, bacteria), GRSP strongly in ﬂuence the physical and biologicalsoil properties ( Ahmed et al., 2018 ;Majumder and Kuzyakov, 2010 ).Soil aggregation and stabilization facilitated by GRSP and AMF can besummarized into the following steps: i) adhesion within and betweenmicroaggregates by GRSP, ii) microaggregate stabilization by labileorganic compounds (extracellular polysaccharides) produced underthe in ﬂuence of GRSP, iii) the binding of microaggregates to formmacroaggregates by AMF hyphae and plant roots, iv) aggregatestabilization by bridging the gaps within aggregates by organic agentssuch as GRSP, and v) the formation of a protective coat of GRSP onmacroaggregates ( Miller and Jastrow, 2000 ;Wright and Upadhyaya,1998 ).Fig. 4. Glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) production on hyphae, arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi (AMF) infectious propagules, i.e., arbuscules, spores, vesicles, intraradical andextraradical (absorptive and runner) hyphae. The three principal functions of GRSP insoil are presented in loupes: 1) forming a protective coat on hyphae (to prevent nutrientloss), 2) production of microbial extracellular polysaccharides (ESP), and 3) soil aggrega-tion through the binding of soil particles together by AMF hyphae and GRSP and C seques-tration therein.R. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 15057163.3.1. GRSP decomposition and its mean residence time in soilThe recalcitrant nature of GRSP is evident based on their recoveryafter autoclaving ( Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996 ) and their long resi-dence time in soil ( Rillig et al., 2001b ). GRSP residence time in soilsunder ﬁeld conditions is between 6 and 42 years ( Fig. 5 ,14C based),which con ﬁrms the medium to long GRSP storage ( Rillig et al., 2001b ).This MRT of GRSP is similar to that of the total SOM of 50-60 years(Schmidt et al., 2011 ;Zang et al., 2018 ). Because GRSP contains 2-4%N, it is prone to microbial attacks and mineralization to reduce N limita-tion in soil ( Treseder and Turner, 2007 ). In incubation experiments,however, the GRSP content decreased much faster, e.g. by 25% over150 days whereas the hyphal length decreased by 60% ( Steinberg andRillig, 2003 ). After 413 days incubation, 50% GRSP was still present inagricultural and forest soils, indicating its high resistance to decomposi-tion ( Rillig et al., 2003b ).GRSP loose immunoreactivity after sloughing off from hyphae andwith increasing hyphal age. Accordingly, immunoreactivity is a com-mon characteristics of the newly produced GRSP ( Wright andUpadhyaya, 1998 ). Among all GSRP fractions, the EE-GRSP and T-immunoreactive soil proteins were lost most rapidly before reaching asteady state between production and decomposition ( Preger et al.,2007 ). Over the years, GRSP accumulation in soil represented a substan-tial GRSP absorption to SOM (10-100 g C m-2yr-1)(Treseder and Turner,2007 ). This governs C sequestration, especially in forests soils ( Zhanget al., 2017 ). The recalcitrance indices (the ratio of the sum of alkyland aromatic C, over the totality of O-alkyl C and carboxyl C) wereapproximately 2 times higher in GRSP than in SOM ( Zhang et al., 2017 ).4. Factors affecting GRSP production and releaseSeveral climatic, biotic and soil factors in ﬂuence GRSP productionand release by AMF ( Fig. 6 ). The GSRP content in soil is regulated bythe balance between its production by AMF and its microbial decompo-sition. GRSP production largely depends on the assimilates that AMF re-ceives from the host plants ( Treseder and Turner, 2007 ). After beingreleased into the soil, the GRSP fractions lose their immunoreactivity(Nichols and Wright, 2004 ).GRSP production and AMF-mediated aggregate formation and stabi-lization depend on a broad range of conditions ( Fig. 6 ): i) climate(temperature, precipitation and drought frequency) ( Wang et al.,2020 ), ii) season, which can in ﬂuence AMF biomass ( He et al., 2010 ),iii) soil properties (structure, texture, pH, electrical conductivity, nutri-ent and water status, iron and phosphorus content, organic mattertype and content, as well as polyvalent cations that in ﬂuence AMFhyphal growth), iv) various cycling processes: wetting and drying;freezing and thawing; clay shrinking and swelling, v) architecture andmorphology of hyphae and roots, vi) AMF species, vii) AMF metabolicproducts (their diffusion and persistence), viii) plant biomass and be-lowground assimilate allocation, rhizodeposits, litter amount and qual-ity, and ix) soil management history that includes vegetation, tillage andcropping systems ( Comis, 2002 ;He et al., 2010 ;Lovelock et al., 2004b ;Fig. 5. Mean residence time (MRT) of glomalin related soil proteins (GRSP) in soil.14C(radiocarbon) dating based on the stock- ﬂow model assumptions of14C content in GRSPin the O and A horizons of a tropical forest; the MRT of GRSP ranged from 6 to 42 years(Rillig et al., 2001b ). Field studies: The conversion of grasslands to arable landsexponentially decreased GRSP content and, after 11-92 years, a steady state equilibrium(when about 39-69% of the original contents remained) was reached ( Preger et al.,2007 ). Incubation experiments: after a 150-day incubation of ﬁeld soil in dark, GRSPc o n t e n t sd e c r e a s e db y2 5 %( Steinberg and Rillig, 2003 ); in a 413-day laboratoryincubation of agricultural and native soils, 50% of GRSP remained ( Rillig et al., 2003b )(for details see Table S1).Fig. 6. An overview of glomalin related soil proteins (GRSP) functions, properties and factors affecting its production. These GRSP properties complicate their extraction from soil. Factorsare responsible for increasing/decreasing GRSP production ( ↑↓). The physical functions of GRSP for protection of soil aggregates, AMF survival and growth promotion.

ForFactors: the arrows show the effect of each factor on GRSP production; for Functions: the arrows show the effect of GRSP on speci ﬁc function.R. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 1505717Miller and Jastrow, 2000 ;Nichols, 2003 ;Rillig et al., 2002a ;Treseder andTurner, 2007 ;Wang et al., 2020 )(Fig. 6 ).4.1. Effects of climateTemperature and precipitation are especially important parametersfor GRSP production and decomposition ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Low tem-peratures inhibit AMF hyphal decomposition ( Miller et al., 1995 ) andensure continued GRSP production. Higher temperatures, stimulate mi-crobial activity which accelerates organic matter mineralization, whileGRSP become susceptible to microbial attacks, loose its immunoreactiv-ity and thereby, its content decreases ( Adame et al., 2012 ;Comis, 2002 ).Although higher temperatures increase the C allocation to AMF byplants, and subsequently increases the AMF biomass, warming de-creases the immunoreactive GRSP content and aggregate stability dueto higher microbial activities decomposing GRSP ( Rillig et al., 2002b ).Microbial processing of GRSP results in i) increased solubilizationand ii) decreased sorption on mineral particles ( Steinberg and Rillig,2003 ). EE and Total-GRSP content decreases with increasing soil mois-ture ( Vasconcellos et al., 2016 ). However, in littoral (intertidal zone)seagrass meadows, GRSP increases along with high annual rainfall dur-i n gt h er a i n ys e a s o n( Adame et al., 2012 ). Climatic factors such as tem-perature and precipitation accounted for 29% and 20% of variations inGRSP accumulation in sub- and topsoil, respectively ( Wang et al., 2017 ).GRSP production is seasonally dependent; AMF biomass peaks in thespring and summer, and consequently, GRSP strongly increases in thesummer ( Emran et al., 2012 ;He et al., 2010 ). As a result, the EE-GRSP in-creased more than the T-GRSP from spring to autumn ( Turgay et al.,2015 ). Stress conditions such as drought stimulate GRSP production asa byproduct of the plant survival strategy by increasing the assimilateallocation to AMF ( Emran et al., 2012 ). Producing GRSP, AMF promotesaggregation to enable hyphal proliferation ( Rillig and Steinberg, 2002 ).This, in turn, enables better and deeper root growth and AMF prolifera-tion and thereby increases the AMF-mediated nutrient allocation to theplant. These mechanisms are crucial to the survival of both symbioticpartners.4.2. Effects of elevated CO 2Elevated CO 2levels increase AMF colonization and GRSP content(Rillig et al., 2000 ) due to induced nutrient-limiting conditions forplants belowground against the background of C excess aboveground(Kuzyakov et al., 2019 ). Hence, more assimilates are allocated for AMFgrowth and invested in GRSP production ( Haddad and Sarkar, 2003 ;Treseder and Turner, 2007 ) to mine for N and P. The active plant-AMFsymbiosis under elevated CO 2produces fresh immunoreactive GRSPon young hyphae ( Haddad and Sarkar, 2003 ).4.3. Effects of soil properties and nutrient content4.3.1. Soil physico-chemical propertiesVarious soil physico-chemical properties affect GRSP content withthe following decreasing intensity: bulk density > pH > electrical con-ductivity ( Z. Zhang et al., 2017 ). Total and EE-GRSP contents decreasewith increasing bulk density ( Vasconcellos et al., 2016 ). Well aggre-gated soils have a lower bulk density, support AMF growth and there-fore, a higher GRSP content ( Zhong et al., 2017 ). The GRSP content insoils is associated with organic matter and clay contents ( Nichols andWright, 2005 ). A lower GRSP content is common in iron-de ﬁcient cal-careous soils and soils with carbonate as the aggregate binding agent(Rillig et al., 2003a ;Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998 ).Soil pH in ﬂuences both the GRSP composition and content ( Wanget al., 2014 ) because of the strong effect of soil acidity on AMF. Amongthe soil types, acidic Ultisols have the highest GRSP content that de-creases with increasing soil pH ( Wang et al., 2014 ). The GRSP decompo-sition rate in acidic soils is slow because Fe and Al sesquioxides increaseits resistance to degradation. Soil salinity decreases the GRSP content(Kohler et al., 2010 ). Although GRSP reduces salinity stress for AMF,NaCl concentrations beyond a threshold of 150 mM decreased theGRSP content ( Hammer and Rillig, 2011 ). Even in reclaimed coastalland, salinity decreased the AMF biomass and GRSP content(Krishnamoorthy et al., 2014 ). Highly saline soils not only decreasethe GRSP content but also changes the GRSP structure, i.e., higher N,lower C and lower C \\O and Si-O-Si functional groups ( Zhang et al.,2017 ).Soil pH and bulk density directly in ﬂuence GRSP content, whereaselectrical conductivity and soil moisture affect GRSP indirectly throughpH and the bulk density ( Zhong et al., 2017 ). Infrared functional groups(IR-II, IRV) and ﬂuorescent substances (tyrosine-like and humic acid-like) are also directly affected by soil moisture, pH and electrical con-ductivity, thus affecting GRSP composition ( Zhong et al., 2017 ).4.3.2. Soil nutrient contentsThe GRSP content is generally larger in soils with low fertility(Lovelock et al., 2004a ). A high soil P content decreases AMF coloniza-tion ( Sharma and Adholeya, 2015 ) and the EE-GRSP content ( Lovelocket al., 2004a ). The GRSP content decreases with increasing Ca, Mg, Pand K levels, which are high soil fertility indicators ( Lovelock et al.,2004a ). In contrast, the GRSP increases with the indicators of lowersoil fertility such as high C:N ratio, Al and Fe contents ( Lovelock et al.,2004a ). However, increasing GRSP content with increasing SOC, totalN, available P and K have also been observed ( Šarapatka et al., 2019 ).The reasons for higher GRSP production in low-fertility soils arei) increased AMF colonization and growth, corresponding to larger as-similate portion allocated belowground, ii) increased GRSP productionper AMF unit, iii) persistent hyphae, iv) slower GRSP decomposition,and v) a shift towards AMF communities that produce a larger hyphalbiomass and more GRSP than the other species ( Lovelock et al.,2004a ). GRSP is also important for nutrient cycling because it providesgood conditions for microbial enzyme production and increases the ac-tivities of acid phosphatase, urease, dehydrogenase, and β-glucosidase(Vasconcellos et al., 2016 ;Wu et al., 2012 ). GRSP have therefore beenused to assess soil fertility and degradation ( Bedini et al., 2007 ;Šarapatka et al., 2019 ). The immunoreactive fraction that confers GRSPtheir sticky nature and strongly increases with the carbonate contentand inorganic C/N ratio ( Haddad and Sarkar, 2003 ).4.4. AMF speciesAMF species have various gene sequences responsible for the GRSPproduction and for speci ﬁc GRSP functions such as the aggregation ef ﬁ-ciency ( Magurno et al., 2019 ).Glomus species differ from other generain their response to nutrient addition and C requirements. They ﬂourishunder N fertilization and increase under elevated CO 2(Egerton-Warburton and Allen, 2000 ;Rillig et al., 2001a ;Rillig et al., 2000 ).Thus, the lower C requirements of Glomus species decrease the GRSPproduction, which requires substantial C investment by AMF(Lovelock et al., 2004b ;Rillig et al., 2001b ).5. Effects of land use on GRSP productionAgricultural practices in ﬂuence GRSP production ( Fig. 7 ) because thegrowth and proliferation of AMF communities depends on fertilization,land use, crops, farming practices and disturbances by tillage. Reducedphosphorus fertilization and absence of tillage are the key factors forhigh AMF abundance and undisturbed GRSP production ( Nichols andWright, 2004 ). The GRSP content across all soil horizons was highestin forest soils and lowest in agricultural soils under corn and soybeans(Rillig et al., 2003b ). The prairie ecosystem had up to 111 m cm-3soil hy-phal lengths (475 μgc m-3hyphal dry biomass), whereas pasture had81 m cm-3soil (339 μgc m-3hyphal dry biomass) ( Miller et al., 1995 ).R. Agnihotri, M.P. Sharma, A. Prakash et al. Science of the Total Environment 806 (2022) 15057185.1. Tillage practicesTillage destroys AMF hyphae, reduces AMF species richness ( Daiet al., 2015 ;Oehl et al., 2003 ) and thus reduces GRSP production. Soilmixing during tillage mechanically disrupts and damages the AMF hy-phal network. No-till as well as minimum tillage practices, crop rota-tions and diversi ﬁed cropping systems increase AMF and contribute tohigher GRSP production in the same growing season and in subsequentyears. It was reported that no-tillage plots have higher GRSP contentand larger aggregates than chisel tillage or intensively tilled organicplots ( Wright et al., 2007 ).No-tillage retains a higher AMF biomass in terms of root colonizationand AMF spore density compared to conventional tillage ( Borie et al.,2006 ;Castillo et al., 2006 ;Lu et al., 2018 ). AMF propagules and GRSPcontent increases in plots without tillage for 6 years than in plots withconventional tillage and in those with reduced tillage ( Curaqueo et al.,2011 ). Thus, conservation tillage maximizes AMF growth, GRSP produc-tion, and improves the soil structure ( Wilkes et al., 2021 ). Undisturbedsoil maintains a stable hyphal network and consequently strengthensthe GRSP-mediated aggregate formation and stabilization.A continuous GRSP production can be achieved by preventing dis-ruption of the hyphal network ( Wright and Upadhyaya, 1998 ). For ex-ample, the abandonment of agricultural land to forest successionincreases SOC stocks ( Kurganova et al., 2014 ;Ovsepyan et al., 2019 ),and discontinued use of agricultural land reinstates GRSP ( L i ue ta l . ,2020 ). Thus, intensive land use, tillage and fertilization decrease AMFformation and GRSP production, whereas its content strongly increasesunder natural ecosystems, especially under forests.5.2. Crop rotation and farming practicesRotation with mycotrophic hosts maintains AMF live biomass,increases GRSP content and improves plant growth ( Selvakumar et al.,2018 ). In contrast, AMF populations decrease following non-mycorrhizal crops (e.g. members of Brassicaceae family such ascauliﬂower, cabbage, rapeseed) and shortening the fallow periods(Comis, 2002 ). Plots with diverse plant species have a higher GRSPcontent than monocultures ( Burrows, 2014 ). Inclusion of Nitrogen-ﬁxing leguminous crops such as chickpea in the crop rotation increasesrhizodeposition, this subsequently stimulates AMF growth and GRSPproduction. Hence, systems with a pearl millet-chickpea had a higherGRSP content than a pearl millet-wheat system ( Singh et al., 2018 ).Among the crop combinations such as wheat, corn, proso millet, andsunﬂower, the most successful system that produces high GRSP contentwas in wheat-corn-proso millet managed with no-till ( Wright andAnderson, 2000 ). Sorghum-wheat-soybean rotation under no-tillageharboured a higher microbial community richness, total organiccarbon (TOC), as well as carbohydrate and GRSP pools as compared tocontinuous conventional tillage ( González-Chávez et al., 2010 ). Thissorghum-wheat-soybean rotation system was therefore considered asthe best practice to increase SOC sequestration. The GRSP content inmycorrhizal-inoculated plants (higher in maize than soybean) grownunder organic management practices was larger than in a non-inoculated soybean-maize cropping system managed with organicpractices and mineral fertilization ( Agnihotri et al., 2014 ).Organic farming supports AMF diversity ( Oehl et al., 2004 ). In com-parison to conventional systems, organic farming (amended with ma-nure and compost) increased AMF abundance, species richness anddiversity as well as Bradford reactive and immunoreactive soil proteins(Turgay et al., 2015 ;P. Wang et al., 2015 ). Consequently, organic inputsincreased the portion of macroaggregates and the mean weight diame-ter of aggregates in parallel with increasing microbial biomass, organic Cand the GRSP fractions ( Zhang et al., 2014 ). Similarly, organic orchardsalso contained a higher AMF species richness and T-GRSP than conven-tional orchards ( Song et al., 2019 ). Long-term application of poultry, pigor cattle manure ( Bertagnoli et al., 2020 ;Guo et al., 2019 ), and the appli-cation of compost or farmyard manure also increases GRSP content(Turgay et al., 2015 ).5.3. GRSP in sedimentsGRSP can be occluded with clay particles into eroded out into the riv-ers, thus contributing to sediment structuring and serving as a nutrientsource for marine organisms ( Harner et al., 2004 ). A higher GRSP accu-mulation in the sediment below a Posidonia oceanica seagrass mat thanin the mat itself suggests a reclamation of sediment quality and anoxicenvironment that prevents GRSP degradation ( Lopez-Merino et al.,2015 ). Owing to its C-sequestration potential, GRSP could be a traceror biomarker for terrestrial-marine transport compared to other biolog-ical, chemical and biochemical tracers ( Adame et al., 2012 ). Inﬂoodplainsoils, as determined through the relationship with site age, GRSP had aturnover time of 35 years ( Harner et al., 2004 ). The AMF contributionto long term SOC sequestration in sediments was evident from theclose positive correlation between GRSP, AMF spores and SOC content(Wang et al., 2018 )Das et al., 2020 ).6. Conclusions1. The AMF production of GRSP is a strategy for survival in less aggre-gated soils by acting as a particle binding, lubricating, and andwater- holding agent. This results in i) improved soil quality, ii) in-creased water retention and aeration, iii) increased nutrient storageand availability, iv) increased microbial biomass and activities,v) increased activities of nutrient-cycling enzymes such as phospha-tases, aminopeptidases, and β-glucosidases, and vi) better anddeeper root and hyphal growth.2. GRSP are heat-stable, sticky and hydrophobic glycoproteins pro-duced on AMF hyphal walls. GRSP are recalcitrant, resistant to micro-bial attacks and reside in soil for years, enabling long-term Csequestration and aggregate stability. The glycoprotein content insoils ranges up to 15 mg g-1and increases with the clay and organicFig. 7.

The contribution of AMF and GRSP to SOC sequestration involves thefollowing mechanisms i) soil aggregate formation by physicallyentrapping organic particles, ii) by increasing hyphal biomass, iii)by enhancing belowground plant C-allocation (including rootgrowth) because AMF are obligate symbionts needed assimilates,and iv) GRSP itself works as a C-source. The AMF and GRSP indirectlycontributes to SOC sequestration through aggregation, which is byfar more important than their direct involvement as a C-source.AMF and GRSP both physically and biochemically stabilize the soilstructure.4. GRSP production increases under i) nutrient-limiting conditions(especially phosphorus limitation) to increase nutrient acquisitionand to support better plant growth, ii) stressed conditions such asdrought due to the resemblance of their protein sequence withhsp60, iii) drying and rewetting cycles protecting AMF hyphaefrom nutrient losses, iv) elevated CO2due to increasedbelowground assimilate allocation, especially to AMF, v) soils withpoor aggregate stability to increase plant root and AMF hyphal prolif-eration, vi) diversi ﬁcation of plant species (crop rotation andintercropping) due to host-speci ﬁc interactions of AMF species,vii) conservation tillage practices due to less hyphal disruption, andviii) organic amendments, which increase AMF biomass.5. GRSP are not currently included in soil health assessment programs,despite the fact that they are linked to a variety of ecosystem pro-cesses and serve as a low-cost proxy for soil quality, and as well asAMF biomass and the success of agricultural management and reme-diation approaches.6. To raise awareness among researchers and farmers about the poten-tial of GRSP as a C-sequestration and quality indicator, controlled ex-periments involving AMF quanti ﬁcation (quantitative PCR assays,AMF-signature lipids, microscopic measurements) and GRSP (ELISAand advanced spectroscopic characterization) followed by ﬁeld dem-onstrations are required.7. Finally, AMF-produced GRSP improves several soil biochemical pro-cesses as i) a stress protectant, ii) a soil conditioner, and iii) C seques-tration agent, mainly by structuring aggregates, making them morestable and thus, establishing and improving the habitat for rootsand microorganisms.FundingThis compilation was done in the framework of NPCS-Soil C seques-tration research at the Department of Science and Technology, a Govt. ofIndia sponsored project on soil C sequestration through AM fungi andsoil and crop management practices (DST/IS-STAC/CO2-SR-11612)awarded to MPS.
