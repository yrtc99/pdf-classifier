Mycorrhiza and Biochar Effects on Carbon Sequestration  İbrahim ORTAS 1,  Gülistan Özer, Burak Koçak, Çağdaş Akpinar  Department of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, University of Cukurova, Adana, Turkey Since  the onset  of industrial revolution  around  1850,  the concentration  of carbon  dioxide  (CO2) has increased  by 31% from 280  ppm to 380  ppm year in 2005,  and is presently  increasing  at 1.7  ppm year or 0.46% yr−1 (WMO 2006; IPCC 2007), presently  is 400 ppm. 400 Increasing CO2 have a significant effect on cimate change .  •Atmospheric  CO2 concentrations  have  significant  effects  on climate  change  and concequently have  effects  on sustainability  of ecosystem .  •At the same time,  soil quality  and productivity is decline . Atmospheric Carbondioxide (CO2)  •Soil can be a sink for atmospheric CO2, thus reducing  the net CO2 emissions  normally  associated with agricultural  ecosystems,  and mitigating  the ‘greenhouse  effect’ .   •There  are several  techniques  to mitigate  atmospheric CO2 which can be fixed  to terrestrial  ecosystems . There are several techniques to mitigate atmospheric CO2   There  are three strategies  of lowering  CO2 emissions  to mitigate  climate  change  (Schrag  2007):  •1) reducing  the global  energy  use,  •2) developing  low or no-carbon  fuel, and  •3) sequestering CO2 from  point  sources or atmosphere  through  natural  (photosynthesis)  and engineering techniques.  Carbon Strategy Carbon Cycle or c arbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere much more related with soil and crop management.  Crop Residues Animal  Manure Microbial Activity  Carbon Dioxide Soil Reactions CO3, HCO3  CO2 Leaching Losses Litter  CO2 CO2 Microbial Activity  Organic Horizons O2 Mycorrhizae Roots  Above- Ground Crop The basic processes of the carbon cycle are:  CO2 in through photosynthesis, and CO2 out through decomposition.  The net gain of C in the soil is a function of the balance between inputs (i.e., net primary productivity plus any external inputs) and losses (i.e.,decomposition, erosion, leaching).  CO2 H2O O2 Light  6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light  C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O  Carbon through plant root and hyphae Through the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, transform it into plant carbon, and sequester it in either above-  or below -ground biomass and/or soil carbon.  Fixing CO2 from atmospher to soil through phostosentesis is one of the powerful natural mechanisms  Photosynthesis  Agricultural soils can be both a sink and source of atmospheric CO2 and can be managed to moderate CO2 emissions. Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important component  of soil fertility, productivity and quality because of its crucial role in soil chemical, physical and biological properties.  •Since  plant  root and mycorrhizal  fungi  are demanding more  carbon, plant  are fixing more  atmospheric  CO2 via natural  process  of photosynthesis  to the soil and biota . Mycorrhizae  also can contribute  to the carbon  sequestration . Mycorrhiza Can Contribute to The Carbon Sequestration  •Both  carbon  and mycorrhizal  associations  are pottentially  important  in ecosystem  services provided  by soils and hence  mitigation  of global  climate  change . Mycorrhiza and Carbon  The carbon-limitation hypothesis  •Gehring and Whitham, (2002) predicted the carbon-limitation hypothesis in which removal of above ground biomass by clipping or mowing will reduce AMF growth because there is a reduced amount of photosynthate available for the symbionts.  In generally protected land use and soil management improves soil organic carbon storage and can reduce the carbon emission and soil erosion.  Mycorrhizal fungi have more carbon •Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5 -20% of total plant carbon uptake (Pearson and Jakobsen, 1993), and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots.  Carbon is Drain to Rhizosphere Greater amounts of carbon are transferred to the roots in mycorrhizal compared with non- mycorrhizal plants.  Mycorrhizal fungi of both modulated and non-modulate roots consumed approximately 4 % of C fixed; 1% entered fungal biomass and 3 % is respired.  Nodules consumed approximately 7% of carbon fixed in non- mycorrhizal plants but 12 % in mycorrhizal plants.  Recent results shown that between 12 and 22 % of photosentate is drain in root area.  Carbon From Leaves To Rhizospher The most efficient method of carbon mitigation is photosets mechanism which can download the atmospheric carbon to the surface. Plant species and soil management is important.  Plant species have different root systems. Root and mycorrhizae are the main sources of SOC . More root and mychorrhizae means more C in the soil    Ortas, 2012 Mycorrhizae fungus mediated effects on plant growth can potentially improve carbon sequestration by increasing net primary production, especially in nutrient -limited environments. Mycorrhzae Can Increase Net Primary Production Quercus robur L. With and without mycorrhizal inoculation  Zhu and Miller, 2003 The AMF can influence carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere through different pathways (Fig. 1).   A key AMF -mediated process involved in the storage of carbon in soils is the transfer of photosynthate from host plants to AMF hyphae.  Mycorrhiza Help Soil Development  •Mycorrhizae also play a key role in soil aggregate formation  and aggregates  can keep carbon in soil. • In order  to keep  carbon  in soil very recently biochar  application is used very commonly.  • Without  burning  organic  material  producing biochar  is very important  agricultural  strategy.  Mycorrhizae increase C sequestration through aggregate  •Recent research suggests that mycorrhizal fungi might be an important component of the SOC pool, in addition to facilitating carbon sequestration by stabilizing soil aggregates.  Conceptual diagram of soil aggregation What is aggregate? How soil aggregate formed What is the major component of aggregate? What is the role of organic carbon on aggregate? ROLE OF MYCORRHİZAE IS SIGNIFICANT?  Other important sources of organic compounds on aggregation are polysaccharides, carbohydrates, lignin and lipids.  Extensive soil based mycelium of fungus around roots can help soil aggregation processes.  Ortas 2011 Macroaggregates  OR Microaggregates? ● The results showed that MWD values of soil aggregates were positively correlated with values of total hyphal length and hyphal density of the AM fungi utilized. They also showed that the mean weight diameter (MWD) of macro ggregates of 1- 2 mm diameter,  was significantly higher in mycorrhizal soils compared to the non- mycorrhizal soil.  Disrupts of macroaggregates and breaks them  into microaggregates by letting in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. From Dr. João de Moraes Sá.  Aggragate and CO2 release More aggregate formation can result in more soil carbon storage  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as soil microorganisms appear to play a predominant effect on aggregates formation because the symbiosis significantly changes the root functioning (, Miller and Jastrow, 1990; Rillig 2004a,b).  There is much evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase soil aggregate formation, and that aggregate formation may be mediated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal protein glomalin. A diagrammatic view of mycorrhizosphere Aggregation tends  to increase with increasing root length density, , root turnover, hyphal growth, microbial association and glomalin,  among other effects (Rillig et al., 2002).  Axenic cultures show that glomalin, originally present in AMF wall hyphae in a 80% and secreted into the environment in a minor proportion is accumulated in air-water interface (Haddad and Sarkar, 2003).  It has been described a glycoprotein produced by AM fungi with a strong cementing capacity of soil particles (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996;Rillig 2004).  Glomalin is very difficult to solubilize and it is resistant to most chemical used.  Via the glomales (glomalin)? What is the role of glomalin on aggragation? How Mycorrhiza Contribute to Soil  Colure of glomalin under microscope  Figure  The relationship between water -stable aggregates and relative root and AM hyphal length in a prairie restoration chronosequence  The studies indicate that hyphae are the primary mechanism for binding sand particles into aggregated units.  Hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered to be primary soil aggregators and there is a positively correlation between AMF hyphae and aggregate stability in natural systems.   The aggregate keep and protect carbon in soil  •The aggregates are very important soil properties for soil quality and provide physical fertility.  •The aggregates also play an important role in stabilizing SOC and act and play a significant role to storage more carbon in soil.  •Also the aggregates protect SOC against mineralization What are we doing about carbon studies  A) Effect of on long term soil and crop managements SOC budget and carbon sequestration.  B) Searching soil carbon stocks and under different managements systems  Semi -arid Turkish soils have low SOC contents because of high temperatures and decomposition rates. Since climate change is directly related with soil carbon storage and release it is important to keep more carbon in the soil with several new techniques. Also for sustainable agriculture there is need to keep SOC at certain level. The type of land use and soil cultivation  are also important  factors  controlling organic carbon storage in soils. It is important  to keep carbon in soil rather  than biomass .  Carbon remain  in biomass for 10 years,  remain in soil is about  35 years.   So there  is a need to give importance to the new techniques  for carbon sequestration.  Soil biotechnology  can help to keep  more  carbon  in soil rather  than  plant tissue.  Soil keep carbon for long term  Carbon Sequastration Works in Turkey  •Since 1996 we have several long term experiments and regularly we measure soil organic C and N. •We have searched C sequestration of several soil profiles.                Carbon sequestration  Carbon sequestration can be defined as the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere into long- lived pools of carbon.  Still it is not easy to calculate the net C sequastration because of several reasons such as belowground C mesurementes  Include pictures of trees, roots and microbes,  recalcitrant SOC  trees  Carbon sequestration rates in the Menzilat soils from 1974 to 2010    Horizon  Soil  depth    Texture g kg -1 pH Salt P2O5 CEC Cmol+  CaCO2  OM Organic carbon  Bulk density  Soil OC  Inorganic carbon  Rate of CSQ 1974 -2010     cm Sand  silt Clay   % kg ha-1  kg-1 % % % g cm-3  Mg ha-1  Mg ha-1 Kg C ha-1  Ap 0-30 30 32.5  27 40.5  7.43  0.113  43.6  17.6  21.9  1.51  0.87  1.6 41.9  87.4  997.9   CA 30-60 30 30 24.5  45.5  7.62  0.123  14.2  17.6  30.4  0.49  0.28  1.3 11.1  98.8  -353.4  2010  C1 60-94 34 16 30 54 7.50  0.133  10.9  21.2  28.4  0.51  0.30  1.3 13.1  104.6  -534.8   C2 94-125 31 14.5  31.5  54 7.59  0.131  9.5 18.0  33.6  0.52  0.30  1.35  12.6  117.2  -106.2   Total                            78.7  408.0  3.7  Ap 0-6 6 344 402 254 7.50  0.250  15.4  18.3  51.48  1.59  0.92  1.44  8.0 37.1   1974  A12 6-21 15 360 370 270 7.70  0.230   31.7  28.8  1.91  1.11  1.39  23.1  50.0    A13 21-47 26 120 594 286 7.80  0.140   29.6  37.22  1.47  0.85  1.41  31.3  113.7     C 47-74 27 337 418 246 7.70  0.130    13.1  53.46  0.73  0.42  1.42  16.2  170.8     Kızıltapır soil series carbon sequestration change from 1974 to 2010 on olive tree  Not: Carbon and nitrogen sequestration was calculated on base of 1974 year ’s data ( Ozbek  et al. , 1974 ) Rhizosphere =R Non- Rhizosphere = NR   Soil  Soil  Organic  Bulk  SOC CSQ SCQ Differences between   Horizon  Depth  Carbon  densit y   NR R R-NR CSQ   cm % G cm-3  Mg ha-1 kg C ha-1 kg C ha-1 kg C ha-1 Non-rhizosphere 2010 Ap 0-13 1.45 1.3 24.5 176.7       Bt1(BA)  13-28 0.93 1.3 18.1 -636.5     Bt2 28-43 0.99 1.4 20.7 153.8                      Rhizospher  Ap 0-20 2.43 1.25 60.8  1183.7  36.3 2010 Bt1 20-40 1.62 1.3 42.2  33.7 24.2  B2t 40-60 2.11 1.5 63.3  1338.0  42.6                   1974 Ap 0-11 1.32 1.25 18.1    Non-rhizosphere  B1 11-38  1.21 1.25 41.0     B2t 38-50  1.11 1.15 15.2        Long- term effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on carbon sequastration •Since 1996 we regularly measure the soil organic C and N.

Ortas and Lal, 2012 Why Biochar Rather Than OM Application?  •Since  the organic  material esealy  decomposes  and released to the atmosphere as the CO2, new approaches  are needed  to keep organic  carbon in soil.  •Converting OC in to stabel  C as a biochar which is logical  to keep C in the soil for long term. Biochar is olso a important  technique  for mitigating  atmospheric  CO 2 Half- life of biochar is ~1400 years . Biochar  can be used lor long term Biochar can hold carbon in the soil for hundreds  and even  thousands  of years .  Additional  effects  from  adding biochar  to soil can further  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions and enhance  carbon storage  in the soil. We are working biochar  •Since 2013 we are working on biochar effect on soil amendment and plant growth,  nutrient uptake.  •We developed a biochar production unites. Biochar are producing at different temperatures by using several plant materials.  Biochar C an Improve Soil Fertility  •Biochar  is a stable,  recalcitrant  organic  carbon (C) compound,  created  when  plant  biomass is heated  usually  in between  300° C and 700° C temperatures,  under very low oxygen concentrations.    •Biochar  application  to soil can improve  soil fertility  and long- term  C storage,  thus leading  to multiple  benefits regarding  climate -change  mitigation  and adaptation . How We Can Produce Biochar  We have developed a biochar production oven We have Produced Biochar   •We have  produced biochar  from four different  plant  (Mulberry,  Oleander,  Eucalyptus  and Phragmites)  branchs  under  different  temperatures  ( 3500 C ,4000C,  4500C,  5000C  and 5500C).   Biochar Have High C Concentration  •The highest  carbon contents of biochar were  obtained respectively,  at 400°C  for Mulberry at 450°C for Eucalyptus and Oleander and finally  at 500 °C for Phragmites.   •The highest  nitrogen contents of biochar were  obtained respectively at 350°C for Phragmites   at 400°C  for Mulberry and Oleander  and lastly  at 500 °C for Eucalyptus.

Effect of temperature on nutrients concetration of different biochar Mulberry, Nerium oleander, Eucalyptus and Phragmites  ● The results showed that MWD values of soil aggregates were positively correlated with values of total hyphal length and hyphal density of the AM fungi utilized. They also showed that the mean weight diameter (MWD) of macro aggregates of 1-2 mm diameter,  was significantly higher in mycorrhizal soils compared to the non-mycorrhizal soil   RESULTS     ● Mycorrhizal  inoculation + compost  were more  effective  in improving  soil physical  properties  than the inorganic  treatment .  Soil aggregation,  represented by MWD,  was significantly  affected by the mycorrhizae,  compost  and manure treatments . RESULT   •Biochar is a very important C source. •Biochar production depend on plant material and temperature. •A good biochar can enrich the nutrients concentrations. RESULT   CONCLUSIONS   Soil and crop management may affect many soil properties, such as enhancing the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, the development of the soil structure and the transfer of atmospheric CO2 to soil through photosynthesis is very important . It is also important to manage mycorrhizal fungi which is a powerful tool to fix more CO2 from atmosphere to soil  through plant leaves and roots.   CONCLUSIONS   It is important to produce high quality biochar. Also to use biochar as a soil amendment material which is a strong carbon sources to keep in soil for long term .
