However, the transcriptional patterns thatunderlie this process remain unclear. In order to better understand the regulation ofN cycling in soil microbial communities, we conducted a 48-h laboratory incubationwith agricultural soil where we stimulated the uptake of inorganic N by amendingthe soil with glucose. We analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of themicrobial communities at four time points that corresponded with changes in Navailability. The relative abundances of genes remained largely unchanged through-out the incubation. In contrast, glucose addition rapidly increased the transcriptionof genes encoding ammonium and nitrate transporters, enzymes responsible for Nassimilation into biomass, and genes associated with the N regulatory network. Thisupregulation coincided with an increase in transcripts associated with glucose break-down and oxoglutarate production, demonstrating a connection between C and Nmetabolism. When concentrations of ammonium were low, we observed a transientupregulation of genes associated with the nitrogen- ﬁxing enzyme nitrogenase.Transcripts for nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation were downregulated throughout theincubation, suggesting that dissimilatory transformations of N may be suppressed inresponse to labile C inputs in these soils. These results demonstrate that soil micro-bial communities can respond rapidly to changes in C availability by drastically alter-ing the transcription of N cycling genes.IMPORTANCE A large portion of activity in soil microbial communities occurs in shorttime frames in response to an increase in C availability, affecting the biogeochemicalcycling of nitrogen. These changes are of particular importance as nitrogen repre-sents both a limiting nutrient for terrestrial plants as well as a potential pollutant.However, we lack a full understanding of the short-term effects of labile carboninputs on the metabolism of microbes living in soil. Here, we found that soil micro-bial communities responded to labile carbon addition by rapidly transcribing genesencoding proteins and enzymes responsible for inorganic nitrogen acquisition,including nitrogen ﬁxation. This work demonstrates that soil microbial communitiesrespond within hours to carbon inputs through altered gene expression. Theseinsights are essential for an improved understanding of the microbial processes gov-erning soil organic matter production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling in naturaland agricultural ecosystems.KEYWORDS carbon metabolism, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, microbialecology, nitrogen ﬁxation, nitrogen metabolism, nitrogen regulation, nutrienttransport, soil microbiologyCitation Chuckran PF, Fofanov V, Hungate BA,Morrissey EM, Schwartz E, Walkup J, Dijkstra P.2021.

The transformation of N by soil microbial commun-ities is directly tied to the pool of bioavailable N in soils (4, 5). Thus, understanding thecontrols of N metabolism in soil microbes is key to determining, and potentially man-aging (6), the cycling of N in soils. Although genes and regulatory mechanisms for mi-crobial N cycling processes have long been identi ﬁed in laboratory studies (7 –9), theshort-term dynamics and controls of N cycling in complex soil communities remainpoorly understood. The availability of shotgun sequencing technologies to analyze mi-crobial functioning in soil communities provides an opportunity to enhance our under-standing of microbially mediated soil N cycling.Measuring short-term responses of soil microbial populations to changes in theenvironment is crucial in understanding the role of microbes in biogeochemical cy-cling. Most biogeochemical transformations occur during short periods of intense mi-crobial activity, when the active fraction of microbes may be up to 20 times higherthan that in bulk soil (10). This stimulation is often the result of a localized increase innutrient concentrations, such as in the rhizosphere or an area of fresh organic matterdecomposition. Despite the importance of these “hot moments, ”only a few studies(11, 12) have tracked changes in N cycling gene transcription in soils.Notably, the short-term (hours to days) transcriptional response of N cycling genesto labile C inputs has yet to be determined. Microbial communities experience suddenchanges in C and N availability associated with plant root exudation (13), trophic inter-actions (14, 15), and litter leachate (16). Since soil microbes are typically limited by la-bile C and energy (17 –19), the addition of a C-rich substrate is expected to stimulategrowth and activity (20), increasing the demand for N (21). Whether N is derived fromthe uptake of organic N present in the substrate or mineral N available in the soildepends largely on the C-to-N (C:N) ratio of the substrate (22). For example, in a studyby Yang et al. (23), soil microbial communities assimilated organic N during the miner-alization of added glycine, but in the presence of glucose, the mineralization of glycinewas initially suppressed, and ammonium served as the main source of N. Simple sugarssuch as glucose have accordingly been shown to in ﬂuence protease activity (24). Themetabolic pathways for N immobilization have been well characterized in vitro (25). Amajority of N assimilation into biomass occurs through the conversion of NH41intothe amino acids glutamine and glutamate, which are used as sources of N for all otheramino acids. Under low-to-moderate intracellular concentrations of NH41, the enzymesglutamine synthetase (GS) (encoded by glnA ) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) ( gltS)convert NH41to glutamate in a two-step reaction referred to as the GS-GOGAT path-way (26). Under high concentrations of NH41, the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase(GDH) ( gudB and gdhA ) converts NH41directly to glutamate in a one-step reversiblereaction (27).Since both the GS-GOGAT pathway and GDH require N as NH41, other forms of inor-ganic N must be converted to ammonium before conversion into biomass. In the caseof nitrate and nitrite, the reduction to ammonium occurs through either assimilatorynitrate reduction or, under anoxic conditions, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammo-nium (DNRA) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (28). The conversion ofatmospheric N2to ammonium by diazotrophs is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase(nifDHK ) (29).The mechanisms regulating N uptake in response to C have been extensively stud-iedin vitro (8, 25). The complex regulatory network includes a specialized sigma factor(s54;rpoN ), three transcriptional regulators, and a phosphorylation cascade comprisedof postmodi ﬁcation enzymes, PII proteins, and a two-component regulator (30). The ac-tivity of many of the enzymes and proteins in the phosphorylation cascade is tightlycontrolled by cellular concentrations of glutamine and oxoglutarate (31). Since theconcentration of oxoglutarate is impacted by the activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)cycle, the regulation of N cycling is directly tied to C metabolism (32).Chuckran et al.May/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 2Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.Carbon substrate addition is also thought to in ﬂuence dissimilatory N cycling processessuch as nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation. In nitri ﬁcation, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite andthen nitrate. Often, the steps of this process occur in different organisms (33); however, com-plete ammonia oxidizers have also been described (34, 35). In denitri ﬁcation, nitrate isreduced to nitrite, nitric oxide, and then nitrous oxide and N2.N i t r i ﬁcation and denitri ﬁca-tion, beyond their ability to draw from the pools of ammonium and nitrate, also representimportant avenues of inorganic N loss from soils via nitrate leaching and the release of N2and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas (36). The addition of glucose is expected tohave both positive and negative effects on nitri ﬁcation. Rates of autotrophic nitri ﬁcationtend to decrease as heterotrophs outcompete autotrophic nitri ﬁers for ammonium (37), butrates of heterotrophic nitri ﬁcation may increase after labile C inputs (38). Denitri ﬁcation ismore directly in ﬂuenced by C availability and quality (39), and the abundance of mRNA tran-scripts associated with denitri ﬁcation was stimulated with the addition of glucose in anoxicsoil microcosms (40).Despite our knowledge of the mechanisms and controls of N cycling and N metabo-lism, we do not yet fully understand how these genes are regulated within complexsoil microbial communities. Metatranscriptomics allows us to capture the transcrip-tional pro ﬁle of a microbial community, providing insight into the potential activity ofa community at a given moment in time (41 –43). Many studies utilizing this techniquehave focused on the in ﬂuence of ecosystem-level characteristics/properties on tran-scription, such as land use, aboveground cover, seasonality, and climate (44 –49).Although these studies contribute greatly to our understanding of community genetranscription, there is an additional need to study the dynamic short-term responses ofmicrobial communities to changes in C and N availability (50).In order to ﬁll this knowledge gap, we conducted a soil incubation study where weinduced rapid immobilization of inorganic N by adding glucose. We selected glucoseas it is a form of labile C commonly found in soils (51) and has been widely used to alle-viate C limitation in soil microbial communities as a means to study growth (52, 53)and metabolic activity (50). We analyzed metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of thesoil microbial community using high-throughput shotgun sequencing to identify theresponse of N cycling genes over a 48-h period. We hypothesized that the abundanceof N cycling genes in the metagenomes would not signi ﬁcantly change throughoutthe course of the 48-h incubation but that changes in activity would be immediatelydetected in the metatranscriptomes. We further hypothesized that there would be anupregulation of genes associated with inorganic N transport, N assimilation into bio-mass, and N metabolism regulation in response to labile C inputs and that the abun-dance of these transcripts would track the concentrations of inorganic N. This workprovides an in-depth look at the short-term transcriptional response of soil microbialcommunities during a central biogeochemical process in soils.RESULTSBiogeochemical measurements. The concentration of NO32decreased in the 24 hafter glucose addition and remained low for the remainder of the incubation (Fig. 1A).The concentration of NH41also decreased during the ﬁrst 24 h of the incubation andincreased thereafter (Fig. 1B). Rates of CO2production increased from 4 to 16 h andthen decreased from 28 to 48 h in response to glucose (Fig. 1C). We found that theaddition of water only slightly in ﬂuenced CO2production (see Fig. S1 in the supple-mental material), indicating that the majority of the stimulation was due to theaddition of labile C. K2SO4-extractable organic carbon decreased for the ﬁrst 20 h andplateaued thereafter (Fig. 1D). Based on these biogeochemical measurements, weselected 4 time points (0 h [ t0],t8,t24, and t48) from which we extracted DNA and RNA.These time points captured distinct phases of C and N availability that enabled us totest our hypotheses.Microbial biomass C (MBC) moderately decreased throughout the incubation (Fig. S2A),and microbial biomass N (MBN) remained constant (Fig. S2B).

Since the method of microbial bio-mass extraction used involves two extractions on the same sample (one before and one af-ter fumigation), incomplete extraction of the added glucose in the ﬁrst extraction couldresult in an arti ﬁcially high estimate of biomass C. We believe that it is far more likely that mi-crobial biomass and stoichiometry did not change and that changes in the estimated MBCare likely the result of unextracted glucose remaining from the initial K2SO4extraction.Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assembly and annotation. Out of 16 soilsamples from which DNA and RNA were extracted, 12 were successfully sequencedand assembled for metagenomic analysis, and all 16 were successfully sequenced andassembled for metatranscriptomic analysis. For the metagenomes, the proportion ofgenes successfully annotated against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) database varied from 23.4% to 25.6% of all genes per sample. Of the 6,876functional KEGG orthologs identi ﬁed in the metagenome analysis, 671 genes werepresent in higher abundances, while 332 were present in lower abundances (false dis-covery rate [FDR] ,0.01), after the addition of glucose. Glucose caused a shift in therelative abundance of functional genes (permutational multivariate analysis of variance[PERMANOVA], F3.11= 3.24 [ P,0.01]) (Fig. 2, top). The genes that were most differentin gene abundance relative to t0varied for each time point (similarity percentage[SIMPER] analysis) (Table S3A), and not one of these genes was directly related to Nuptake. Among these were the subunits of RNA polymerase rpoB and rpoC , which werepresent in slightly lower abundances at t8(log2fold change [LFC], 20.1; FDR .0.1),and the regulatory gene for the lacoperon, lacI, which was present in a higher abun-dance at t24and t48(LFC, 0.7; FDR ,0.01). The largest changes were found at t24forlow-abundance spore germination proteins (Table S3B), speci ﬁcally gerKC (KEGG num-ber K06297) and yfkQ (KEGG number K06307), which were 8.8 and 7.4 log2-fold moreabundant than at t0.FIG 1 Mean concentrations ( 6standard errors [SE]) of nitrate (A) and ammonium (B) and rates of carbondioxide production (C) and K2SO4-extractable C (D) as a function of time after glucose amendments.Chuckran et al.May/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 4Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.The proportion of transcripts successfully annotated against the KEGG database var-ied between 12.6% and 32% of all transcripts in a metatranscriptome. Transcripts for5,448 functional genes were identi ﬁed, of which 1,141 were increased and 855 weredecreased in response to glucose. PERMANOVA indicated signi ﬁcant shifts in the abun-dance of transcripts between time points ( F3,15= 8.07 [ P,0.01]) (Fig. 2, bottom).Transcripts encoding amt and glnA contributed the most to the dissimilarity with t0(SIMPER analysis); combined, they explained 1% of the differences at t8, 1% of the dif-ferences at t24, and 0.9% of the differences at t48.Gene and transcript abundances of nitrogen cycling processes. The abundanceof N cycling genes was generally stable over time (Fig. 3A), with changes in gene abun-dance often being several orders of magnitude smaller than changes in transcript abun-dances. For metatranscriptomes, many genes associated with N uptake were highly up-regulated in response to glucose (Fig. 3). The expression levels of genes encoding theGS-GOGAT pathway (GS, glnA; GOGAT, gltS,gltD,a n d gltB) were consistently upregulatedafter glucose addition (FDR ,0.01), peaking at 8 h (Fig. 3B; Table S2). We did not ﬁnd asimilar trend for transcripts associated with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) ( gudB andgdhA ). Instead, we found variable increases and decreases in the expression levels ofthese genes, which corresponded to different classes of GDH enzymes (Fig. 3B; Table S2).In prokaryotes, GDH often uses NADH (EC 1.4.1.2) and NADPH (EC 1.4.1.4) as cofactors,while GDH in eukaryotes can use both [NAD(P)H] (EC 1.4.1.3) (55). The transcription ofgenes for EC 1.4.1.4 signi ﬁcantly increased early ( t8, LFC of 1.542 60.312 and FDR of,0.01), and transcription for EC 1.4.1.2 trended higher later ( t48, LFC of 2.229 60.884 andFDR of,0.1). The eukaryotic EC 1.4.1.2 gene GDH2 (K15371) was upregulated at t24(LFCof 1.350 60.434 [Table S2] and FDR of ,0.01), and EC 1.4.1.3 was slightly downregulatedthroughout (signi ﬁcantly at t8[FDR,0.01]).FIG 2 Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Bray-Curtis distance of normalized KEGGannotation abundances for metagenomes (top) and metatranscriptomes (bottom) 0, 8, 24, and 48 hafter the addition of glucose.Rapid Transcription of Nitrogen Cycling Genes in SoilMay/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 5Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.FIG 3 (A) Log2fold changes (mean LFCs 6SE) relative to t0of normalized gene (left) and transcript (right) abundances versusnormalized counts for N cycling genes from glucose-amended soils.

A similar upregulation was found for genes associ-ated with nitrate and nitrite transport across the membrane: 1,500-fold increases com-pared to t0(from 2.6 to almost 2,800 transcripts per sample at t24) (Fig. 3B).Genes associated with assimilatory nitrate reduction (Fig. 3; Table S2) were stronglyupregulated at t8and remained upregulated over the 48-h incubation period. In con-trast, we found variable responses of genes associated with DNRA. Most genes associ-ated with the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite were downregulated or notsigni ﬁcantly affected, with a few exceptions. Nitrate reductase gamma subunits ( narI-narV ) were upregulated at t24and t48, and the genes nirB and nirD, which encode thesmall and large subunits of the cytosolic enzyme nitrite reductase, were signi ﬁcantly(FDR,0.01) upregulated throughout the incubation (LFC, 6.18 to 7.70) (Fig. 3B). Incontrast to these enzymes, the abundances of transcripts that encode a periplasmiccytochrome cnitrite reductase ( nrfA and nrfH) did not signi ﬁcantly change in responseto C amendment.The expression levels of all genes involved in nitri ﬁcation were downregulated inresponse to glucose, and a majority of these genes (5 of 6) were signi ﬁcantly(FDR,0.01) downregulated at some point during the incubation (Fig. 3B). Similarly,the expression levels of most denitri ﬁcation genes were downregulated throughoutthe incubation, with the exception of narI and narV , which encode gamma subunits ofnitrate reductase.Transcripts for three genes that encode subunits of nitrogenase ( nifK,nifD, and nifH)were detected, all of which were present at very low abundances at t0,t8, and t48. Onlyatt24did we observe a strong signi ﬁcant (FDR ,0.01) upregulation for all 3 genes, upto 410-fold higher than that at t0fornifH (798 transcripts at t24versus 1 at t0) (Fig. 3B).We found that the vast majority of N cycling gene transcription could be attrib-uted to bacteria and archaea (Fig. 4). Dissimilatory processes were largely fromThaumarchaeota and Nitrospirae , while assimilatory processes tended to be repre-sented by Proteobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,a n d Acidobacteria .N i t r o g e n ﬁxation washeavily dominated by Proteobacteria (Fig. 4).Regulation of N cycling genes. Generally, transcripts of genes associated with theregulation of N metabolism increased after glucose addition (Fig. 5; Fig. S3). The abundancesof uridylyltransferase (UTase; glnD) but not adenylyltransferase (ATase; glnE), used for post-modi ﬁcation of glutamine synthetase (GS) and regulatory PII proteins, respectively, initiallyincreased at t8(2.1860.41 LFC and 4.31 60.36 LFC; FDR ,0.01) (Fig. 5; Fig. S3). UTase(glnD)b u tn o tA T a s e( glnE) continued to be signi ﬁcantly upregulated at t24(3.7960.36 LFC)and t48(2.7560.36 LFC) (Fig. S3). A similar upregulation was noted for the PII proteins GlnB(glnB)( L F C ,.2.9; FDR ,0.01) (Fig. S3) and GlnK ( glnK)( L F C ,.3.9; FDR ,0.01) (Fig. S3) andthe NtrC family genes glnL (FDR,0.01) and glnG (FDR,0.01 at t8and t24) (Fig. S3). No sig-niﬁcant changes in transcript abundances were found for the transcriptional regulators nacand lrp,w h i l e crpand rpoN were slightly downregulated (LFC of less than 21) at t8and t24(FDR,0 . 0 1 )( F i g .5 ;F i g .S 3 ) .C metabolism. The LFC and the total number of normalized transcripts for processesinvolved in glucose breakdown (KEGG modules M00001, M00003, M00004, M0008, andM00009) increased from t0tot8and t24(Fig. S4) ( P,0.05 by Tukey ’sh o n e s t l ys i g n i ﬁcantdifference [HSD] test). Signi ﬁcant changes in transcript abundances after glucose amend-ment were found for the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the TCA cycle, including theenzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase ( icd), which produces oxoglutarate, a metabolite thatdirectly connects C and N metabolism (Fig. 5; Fig. S4B; data not shown).DISCUSSIONOver a period of 48 h after glucose addition, we observed a substantial decrease inK2SO4-extractable organic C, an increase in the CO2production rate, and an increase inthe abundance of transcripts for genes associated with glucose breakdown.

These results demonstrate that soil microbial communities respond to la-bile C not only by upregulating genes associated with C metabolism but also by rapidlyincreasing the transcription of genes responsible for N acquisition. Furthermore, wefound that genes for several forms of N acquisition (e.g., N ﬁxation, assimilatory nitratereduction, and ammonium transport) were differentially transcribed over the 48-hincubation, indicating that changes in multiple microbially mediated N transformationsoccur within this small temporal window.Inorganic N uptake and assimilation. The GS-GOGAT pathway appeared to be thepredominant pathway through which ammonium was assimilated into biomass. Theother main avenue of ammonium assimilation into biomass, the enzyme GDH, did notshow a similar increase in transcript abundance, and the abundance of GDH transcriptswas substantially lower than that of GS-GOGAT. This suggests that GS-GOGAT may bethe dominant pathway for the assimilation of inorganic N in soil microbial communitiesresponding to labile C inputs. This ﬁnding is consistent with the notion that GDH ismost active when the NH41concentration is high and the availability of C is low (27).Assays of soil microbial communities have also shown that GS activity increases inresponse to higher C-to-N ratios, whereas GDH activity decreases (56). Furthermore, wefound that the regulation of GDH transcription appeared to be gene speci ﬁc, with tran-scription for EC 1.4.1.4 increasing early and that for EC 1.4.1.2 increasing late. Theseresults nicely follow the concentrations of NH41,a sN A D P H - s p e c i ﬁc enzymes (EC 1.4.1.4) aregenerally used for ammonium assimilation (57), whereas NADH-speci ﬁc enzymes (EC 1.4.1.2)are commonly used for the breakdown of glutamate to ammonium (58). These ﬁndingshighlight the potential utility of measuring GDH and GS-GOGAT gene transcription for track-ing the C and N balance within microbial communities at a given moment in time, whichFIG 4 Relative transcript abundances of major taxa for reactions and pathways of N cycling 0, 8, 24, and 48 h after glucose amendments.Chuckran et al.May/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 8Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.could be a useful approach when, for example, assessing how speci ﬁc land-use practicesinﬂuence microbial metabolism and N cycling.Various mechanisms for transporting inorganic N across the cell membrane wereupregulated in response to glucose inputs. Notably, the gene amtB , which encodes theammonium transporter AmtB, was the second most abundant upregulated gene dur-ing the incubation (behind glnA ). Similarly, we observed an upregulation of genesassociated with nitrate and nitrite transport (KEGG module M00615) and assimilatorynitrate reduction, which coincided with a precipitous drop in the concentration ofNO32. Most genes involved in DNRA were not differentially expressed, indicating thatFIG 5 Abundances and log2fold changes of transcripts 8 h after glucose addition for C and N metabolism,including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the N regulatory network, and GS-GOGAT.

Notable exceptionswere the genes nirB and nirD, which encode the cytosolic enzyme nitrite reductaseNirBD (59), which has been shown to be active in aerobic soils (60, 61) and may func-tion as the nitrite reductase in assimilatory nitrate reduction (62). Although the upregu-lation of N transport genes in response to glucose is certainly not novel (30), theseresults are the ﬁrst demonstration of this response in a soil microbial community meta-transcriptome. Furthermore, these responses show the short time frames (within 8 h)in which soil microbial communities can respond to changes in C and N availability.The ﬁnding that glucose addition strongly upregulated genes encoding nitroge-nase, especially when NH41concentrations were low, is consistent with the idea thatnitrogen ﬁxation increases when N concentrations are low (63). N ﬁxation has beenshown to be activated by the addition of other limiting nutrients such as carbon orphosphorus (64, 65). We therefore believe that the upregulation of nitrogenase genesis a response to low concentrations of NH41and the availability of labile C. The promptupregulation, and subsequent downregulation, of nitrogenase genes also suggeststhat some portion of biological nitrogen ﬁxation occurs rapidly in soils or at the veryleast that the process is highly sensitive to concentrations of NH41.Connections between C and N metabolism. Interestingly, transcripts associatedwith NH41and NO32transport maintained their high abundances despite concentra-tions of NO32stabilizing and concentrations of NH4increasing (24 to 48 h into theincubation). One possible explanation is that the activity of these proteins is dictatedthrough allosteric regulation, which is tightly connected to the activities of both C andN metabolism (Fig. 5). For example, the ammonium transporter AmtB is allostericallyinhibited by the PII protein GlnK, which is indirectly controlled by internal concentra-tions of glutamine, an intermediate of N uptake through GS-GOGAT (Fig. 5), and oxo-glutarate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle (Fig. 5) (32, 66). In this way, internal concen-trations of metabolites from both C and N metabolism may dictate N uptake.The transcription of N regulatory genes re ﬂects the importance of intermediatemetabolites in regulation. We found that the abundances of transcripts for transcrip-tional regulators (such as nac,lrp, and crp) ands54were either not affected or slightlyreduced (Fig. 5). In contrast, transcripts for genes in the phosphorylation cascade,which links C and N metabolism through intermediate metabolites, were more abun-dant after the addition of glucose (Fig. 5). The upregulation of the two-component reg-ulatory system NtrB ( glnL and ntrB) and NtrC ( glnG and ntrC) within this cascade isespecially noteworthy as this system regulates ;75 genes associated with N acquisi-tion, including glutamine synthetase (Fig. 5) (67).Since the activity of this regulatory network is tightly controlled by internal concen-trations of metabolites (30), it is not possible to determine the activity of many of theseproteins through the metatranscriptome alone. However, it is noteworthy that almostall of the genes within this regulatory network were upregulated, even if the encodedprotein potentially inhibited N transport or assimilation (e.g., GlnK) (Fig. 5). This broadupregulation of genes in the phosphorylation cascade may be bene ﬁcial during Cuptake, as it allows the concentration of nutrients and metabolites to control N uptake,thereby ensuring that N uptake matches the supply of C (25, 32).Nitriﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation. Most genes associated with nitri ﬁcation and deni-triﬁcation were signi ﬁcantly downregulated. Since nearly all nitri ﬁers in this soil wereautotrophic archaea (68), this ﬁnding is consistent with the premise that the additionof glucose reduces the rates of autotrophic nitri ﬁcation by reducing the amount ofavailable ammonium (37). It is not especially surprising that we did not ﬁnd an upregu-lation of denitri ﬁcation genes, as denitri ﬁcation is most prevalent in anoxic systemswith high availabilities of nitrate.Genetic potential versus transcription. Notably, although we observed a slightshift in the functional composition of our metagenomes, these changes did not trackthose found in the metatranscriptomes in either magnitude or direction. Changes con-tributing the most to dissimilarity tended to be slight shifts in highly abundant genes,such as rpoB ,rpoC , and lacI. We found interesting differences in the abundances ofChuckran et al.May/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 10Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.spore-forming proteins as nutrient availability declined; however, since many of theseproteins were uncommon and present in low abundances, the chance of obtaining afalse-positive result is much greater, and we are therefore cautious to draw any conclu-sions based on these data alone. Changes in gene abundance for most N cycling geneswere absent. These results suggest that understanding the response of soil microbialcommunities to short-term changes in the environment necessitates looking beyondthe metagenome, as consequential microbial responses occur through changes ingene expression. This is in line with other studies where the composition of transcriptsshifts over hours or days (12, 69), whereas shifts in metagenomic community composi-tion have been shown to occur after weeks or months (70).Our work represents a preliminary look into the short-term transcriptional responseof microbial communities to a change in C availability; however, there are a number ofconsiderations moving forward. More work needs to be done focusing on thisresponse in a variety of soils, as nutrient availability and other soil properties willundoubtedly in ﬂuence this process. For example, soils high in C and low in N wouldlikely not demonstrate a response similar to the one observed for this agricultural soil.Understanding how ecosystem properties in ﬂuence the dynamics of transcriptionalproﬁles is therefore necessary for determining short-term microbial contributions tobiogeochemical cycling. Furthermore, this work focused on a relatively short timeframe; however, whether this increase in transcription persists or in ﬂuences nutrientcycling on the scale of weeks to months remains to be seen. Finally, future effortsshould be made to observe these short-term effects in situ . Laboratory incubations areextremely useful for controlling environmental variables and isolating a particularresponse. However, it is likely that under ﬁeld conditions, and in the presence of plantroots, factors other than C availability will affect gene expression at the same time andto different degrees, potentially masking the response observed in this short-term lab-oratory experiment.Conclusions. Our results indicate the strong and rapid upregulation of genes asso-ciated with the uptake of inorganic N, assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction, the GS-GOGAT pathway, and the regulatory network underlying N cycling. Furthermore, themajority of upregulation occurred in pathways that are largely aerobic and heterotro-phic, suggesting that these processes dominate the short-term response to labile C inthese soils. Perhaps most importantly, this work highlights the importance of microbialgene transcription in controlling short-term biogeochemical cycling in soils. Within the48-h incubation, we found that microbially mediated transformations of N were wellreﬂected in the metatranscriptome but not in the metagenome or in microbial bio-mass. The short-term transcriptional responses of soil microbes may therefore serve animportant role in determining how biogeochemical ﬂuxes respond to immediatechanges in the environment.MATERIALS AND METHODSSoil sampling and site description. Soils were collected in the fall of 2017 from a long-term croprotation experiment at the West Virginia University Certi ﬁed Organic Farm near Morgantown, WV(39.647502°N, 79.93691°W; 243.8 to 475.2 m above sea level) (68, 71). Samples were taken from plotssubjected to a 4-year conventionally tilled crop cycle consisting of corn, soybean, wheat, and a mix ofkale and cowpea. Manure was added every 2 years (during corn and wheat planting), and rye-vetch wasadded as a winter cover crop before replanting corn in the spring. From each plot, 10 cores at a 0- to 10-cm depth were collected and pooled.Laboratory incubation. Soil samples were shipped on ice to Northern Arizona University inFlagstaff, AZ. Soils from 3 plots were pooled, cleaned of roots and large debris, passed through a 2-mmsieve, and distributed among 64 glass Mason jars (500 ml), generating microcosms containing 30 g ofsoil each. The soil was preincubated at laboratory temperature ( ;23°C) for 2 weeks prior to glucoseaddition.The microcosms received 1.6 ml of a 0.13 M glucose solution, which added 0.7 mg of glucose Cg21dry soil and raised the moisture content to 60% water-holding capacity. Concentrations of glucosein this range have been demonstrated to stimulate soil microbial communities without creating a detri-mental increase in osmotic pressure (52). Moreover, a brief trial incubation was conducted to ensurethat this concentration of glucose would stimulate CO2production. Soils were incubated at laboratorytemperature ( ;23°C) under ambient lighting but never direct sunlight. Every 4 h, over a 48-h period, 5Rapid Transcription of Nitrogen Cycling Genes in SoilMay/June 2021 Volume 6 Issue 3 e00161-21 msystems.asm.org 11Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 21 March 2023 by 140.116.25.141.jars were randomly selected and destructively sampled. From each jar, we measured the headspace CO2concentration, concentrations of NO32and NH41, and microbial biomass. A portion of each sample wasimmediately frozen using liquid N2and stored at 280°C for DNA and RNA extraction.Since the addition of water may stimulate community activity and respiration, especially when start-ing with very dry soil (72, 73), we measured respiration in a parallel incubation wherein the same volumeof water was added without glucose. The headspace CO2from these jars was measured and comparedagainst the glucose additions in order to determine the overall effect of glucose and water on microbialrespiration.Biogeochemical measurements and analysis. To measure soil NO32and NH41concentrations, 8 gof soil from each destructively sampled jar was added to 40 ml of a 1 M KCl solution, shaken for 1 h, andﬁltered through Whatman no. 1 ﬁlter paper. Extracts were analyzed on a SmartChem 200 discrete ana-lyzer (Westco Scienti ﬁc Instruments, Brook ﬁeld, CT, USA). Microbial biomass was measured using anextraction-fumigation-extraction technique (74) consisting of a 0.5 M K2SO4extraction step followed bya subsequent K2SO4extraction step with the addition of chloroform. The ﬁrst extraction provided an esti-mate of the K2SO4-extractable organic C and N from each sample, while the second extraction providedan estimate of microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN). Concentrations of extractable organic C and Nwere measured on a TOC-L instrument (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The concentration of CO2fromthe headspace of each microcosm was measured using an LI-6262 CO2/H2O analyzer (Li-Cor Industries,Omaha, NE, USA) as described previously by Dijkstra et al. (75).DNA and RNA extraction and sequencing. We extracted DNA and RNA just before ( t0) and 8 h ( t8),24 h ( t24), and 48 h ( t48) after glucose addition ( n= 4). DNA and RNA were extracted using the RNeasyPowerSoil total RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. DNA was separated fromRNA using the RNeasy PowerSoil DNA elution kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were treated with an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) to remove any DNA. Nucleic acid concentrations were determined with a Qubitﬂuorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and purity was assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectro-photometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). High-quality samples were sent to the JointGenome Institute (JGI) for sequencing (76). Paired-end, 2- by 151-bp libraries were prepared using theIllumina NovaSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).Metagenome and metatranscriptomic analyses. Metatranscriptomes were assembled by the JGIusing MEGAHIT v1.1.2 (78) (parameters “megahit ––k–list 23,43,63,83,103,123 ––continue –o out.mega-hit”), and metagenomes were assembled using SPAdes version 3.13.0 (79). Assembled metatranscrip-tomes and metagenomes were uploaded to the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) (80) pipeline for annotation. Full details of the bioinformatics pipeline, as well as SRA accession num-bers, can be found in the data release (77). From IMG/M, we retrieved the number of reads for all genesattributed to functional orthologs in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthologydatabase (81) as well as taxonomic annotations against the IMG database.Normalization of KEGG functional annotations was performed using the Bioconductor (82) programDESeq2 (83) in R. DESeq2 uses a negative binomial distribution to normalize read counts and estimatesthe average log2fold change (LFC) between harvests. Signi ﬁcant LFCs for each KEGG functional geneand transcript were determined by both a likelihood ratio test (for overall signi ﬁcance) and a Wald test(for speci ﬁc contrasts between time points) provided in DESeq2. Signi ﬁcance for both tests was assumedat a false discovery rate (FDR) of ,0.01. Prior to analysis, genes with fewer than 60 reads summed overall samples were discarded in an effort to reduce the FDR correction and improve the detection of signif-icant LFCs (84).To assess differences in gene and transcript compositions over time, we performed permutationalmultivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on our metagenomes and metatranscriptomes.PERMANOVAs were conducted using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices of the square root-transformednormalized read counts with 999 permutations. A SIMPER analysis was used to determine genes thatmost strongly in ﬂuenced differences between harvests. PERMANOVAs and SIMPER analyses were con-ducted using the vegan package (85) for R.To assess the response of N metabolism to the addition of glucose, KEGG Orthology identi ﬁers (Knumbers) were grouped according to KEGG pathways and modules associated with N cycling (86), andK numbers representing regulatory genes controlling N metabolism were identi ﬁed (8, 25) (see Table S1in the supplemental material). The response of C metabolism was determined by grouping K numbersby KEGG modules associated with glucose uptake, speci ﬁcally the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (KEGGmodule M0008), the TCA cycle (M00009), the pentose phosphate pathway (M00004), gluconeogenesis(M00003), and glycolysis (M00001). From the TCA cycle, we also determined the response of isocitratedehydrogenase ( icd), which produces oxoglutarate, an important metabolite linking C and N metabolism(32). Counts and LFCs for K numbers were then averaged for each module to assess the overall responsefor each process. Results were visualized using the ggplot2 package (87) in R v3.6.1 (88).Data availability. Raw sequence reads and assembled contigs were uploaded to the JGI genomeportal ( https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/) under GOLD project identi ﬁerGs0135756 .
