This study summarizes exposures to and emis sions of VOCs in 17coffee roasting and packaging facilities that included 10 c afés. We collected 415personal and 760 area full-shift, and 606 personal task-bas ed air samples for diacetyl,2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-hexanedione, and acetoin using sil ica gel tubes. We alsocollected 296 instantaneous activity and 312 instantaneou s source air measurementsfor 18 VOCs using evacuated canisters. The highest personal full-shift exposurein part per billion (ppb) to diacetyl [geometric mean (GM) 21 ppb; 95th percentile(P95) 79 ppb] and 2,3-pentanedione (GM 15 ppb; P95 52 ppb) wer e measuredfor production workers in ﬂavored coffee production areas.

Coﬀee consumption in the United Statesincreased from 1.43 billion kilograms (kg) in 2013/2014 to 1 .55billion in 2017/2018 ( 1). The United States is forecast to bethe second-largest importer of coﬀee beans (1.57 billion kg)behind the European Union (2.88 billion kg) in 2019/2020(2). In 2016, the US coﬀee industry (NAICS 311920) had15,911 full-time and part-time employees ( 3) with 11% insmall-sized ( <20 employees) businesses representing 73% ofestablishments, 37% in medium-sized ( ≥20 to<500 employees)businesses representing 7% of establishments, and 52% inlarge-sized (500 +employees) businesses representing 20% ofestablishments( 4).Roasted coﬀee production and café workers can be exposedto a variety of chemicals at work. Roasted coﬀee emits carbonmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and a wide range ofVOCs (5–10). Emitted VOCs include alpha-diketones such as2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), 2,3-pentanedione (acetyl propi onyl),and 2,3-hexanedione. Grinding roasted coﬀee beans produces agreater surface area for oﬀ-gassing (sometimes called degas sing)of CO, CO 2,and VOCs ( 11,12). In addition to occurringnaturally in roasted coﬀee, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione ar eadded as ingredients in food ﬂavorings used in some foodproducts, including ground or whole bean coﬀee to makeﬂavored coﬀee ( 13–15). Acetoin and 2,3-pentanedione arecommonsubstitutesfordiacetylinﬂavorings( 16).The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health(NIOSH) has published full-shift Recommended ExposureLimits (RELs) of 5.0 parts per billion (ppb) for diacetyland 9.3 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione. The NIOSH short-termexposure limits (STELs) are 25 ppb for diacetyl and 31 ppbfor 2,3-pentanedione averaged over a 15min time period.Short-term peak exposures might be relevant for respiratoryhealth, particularly when tasks are repeated multiple timesperday.The NIOSH objective in establishing RELs for diacetyl and2,3-pentanedioneistoreducetheriskofrespiratoryimpairme nt(decreasedlungfunction)andthesevereirreversiblelungd iseaseobliterative bronchiolitis associated with occupational e xposureto these chemicals. These exposure limits were derived from arisk assessment of ﬂavoring-exposed workers. At an exposureequaltothediacetylREL,theriskofadversehealtheﬀectsisl ow.NIOSH estimated about 1 in 1,000 workers exposed to diacetyllevels of 5 ppb as a time-weighted average (TWA) for 8h aday, 40h a week for a 45-year working lifetime would developreduced lung function (deﬁned as forced expiratory volume in1s (FEV1) below the lower limit of normal) as a result of thatexposure. NIOSH predicted that around 1 in 10,000 workersexposedtodiacetylat5ppbfora45-yearworkinglifetimewoulddevelop more severe lung function reduction [FEV1 below 60%predicted, deﬁned as at least moderately severe by the Americ anThoracic Society ( 17)]. Workers exposed for less time would beat lower risk for adverse lung eﬀects. NIOSH RELs should beused as a guideline to indicate when exposure reduction stepsshould be taken in the workplace. The American Conference ofGovernmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIHR/circlecopyrt) has a thresholdlimit value (TLVR/circlecopyrt) for diacetyl of 10 ppb, as a full-shift time-weighted average exposure and a STEL of 20 ppb. Diacetyl ison the 2020 ACGIH TLV list of chemicals under study. ACGIHdoes not have a TLVR/circlecopyrt-TWA or a STEL for 2,3-pentanedione.Occupationalexposurelimitsfor2,3-hexanedioneandacetoi ndonotexist.Inhalational exposure to diacetyl has been associated with alung disease called obliterative bronchiolitis ( 18). Obliterativebronchiolitis is a severe, often disabling, lung disease tha tinvolves scarring of the very small airways (i.e., bronchio les).Symptomsofthisdiseasemayincludecough,shortnessofbrea thon exertion, or wheeze, and do not typically improve awayfromwork( 19).Occupationalobliterativebronchiolitishasbeenidentiﬁed in ﬂavoring manufacturing workers and microwavepopcornworkerswhoworkedwithﬂavoringchemicalsorbutterﬂavorings ( 14,20,21). A diacetyl substitute, 2,3-Pentanedione,was found to have respiratory toxicity in animal studiessimilar to that of diacetyl ( 22,23). In one animal study,there was evidence that 2,3-hexanedione might also damagethe lungs, but it appeared to be less toxic than diacetyland 2,3-pentanedione ( 24). Obliterative bronchiolitis has beenreported among workers at two coﬀee roasting and packagingfacilities that produced both unﬂavored and ﬂavored coﬀee(13,25,26). At one of those facilities, all former workersdiagnosed with obliterative bronchiolitis had worked in th eﬂavoring area ( 13). Current workers at that facility had excessshortness of breath and obstruction on spirometry, consistentwith undiagnosed lung disease. Respiratory morbidity amongcurrent workers was associated with working in areas wherecoﬀee was ﬂavored, and areas where grinding and packaging ofunﬂavored coﬀee occurred ( 13). However, to our knowledge, nocases of obliterative bronchiolitis have been reported in wo rkersFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 561740LeBouf et al.

The mediannumber of production workers was seven (range: 3–100). Themajority of facilities produced unﬂavored whole-bean coﬀee.Fourof17facilitiesﬂavoredcoﬀeeduringthesurvey;onefac ilityﬂavored ground coﬀee and three facilities ﬂavored whole-bea nand then ground the ﬂavored beans. One facility ﬂavored coﬀeeon occasion but did not do so during the survey. Eight faciliti eshad either one onsite or one oﬀsite café; one facility had twooﬀsite cafés. Facilities were sampled between July 2015 andSeptember 2017 during a variety of seasons and in a number ofgeographicallocations,whichinﬂuencedthetemperaturedur ingsamplingandamountofnaturalventilationoccurringfromopendoorsorwindows.Process and Task DescriptionThe main steps in roasting and packaging coﬀee are typically:(1) receiving green (raw) beans, (2) roasting green beans, (3)grinding roasted beans, (4) weighing and packaging roasted a ndground coﬀee, and (5) shipping. Some facilities also ﬂavoredroastedgroundorwholebeancoﬀeewithliquidﬂavoringbefor epackagingorgrinding.Green beans were received in jute or burlap bags fromcountries around the world and stored in designated areas orin the main production space. Workers moved bags of greenbeans on pallets using a forklift or carried bags to a storagearea. The ﬁrst step in the production process was weighingand transferring the green beans to a conduction or convecti onroaster. Some facilities pneumatically fed green beans intothe roasters. Some facilities blended green coﬀee beans befor eroasting and others blended roasted beans after roasting. Aroaster operator monitored roasting time and temperature tha tdepended on the green bean origin and desired roast level (e.g .,light, medium, dark). Occasionally, the roaster operator wo uldpull a sample of beans from the roaster to check the color andsmellofthebeans.Inamajorityoffacilities(16of17),the roastedcoﬀee beans were sent to downdraft or updraft cooling drumsand mixed by an agitator to accelerate cooling.

The ﬂavoring room attendant manuallymixed the liquid ﬂavorings in an 18-kg pail, then poured itinto an automatic ribbon blender, which mixed the ﬂavoringswith the whole beans or ground coﬀee. Some coﬀee was groundbefore packaging. Grinders were manual 0.45-kg (1-lb) to 2.3-kg (5-lb) machines or automated machines capable of grindingup to 318kg per hour. Whole-bean and ground coﬀee weremanually packaged into bags (with and without one-way valves )or other containers, or automatically packaged using weighi ngand packaging lines. These lines were monitored to assurequality of packaging. In the event of packaging defects, somere-work of product was required. Re-work involved manuallycutting open defective packaging and returning coﬀee to apackaging line. Bags were generally heat-sealed to complete th eﬁnishedproduct.During the production process, companies tested green androastedbeanstoensurequality.Thefacilitieshadqualityc ontrolareaswhereroastedbeansandbrewswerepreparedandassessed .Upon receipt, a worker proﬁled the green beans to determinethe best roast temperature and time. Green beans stored insilos were monitored over time as they aged and roastingspeciﬁcations were adjusted to account for any changes inthe green beans. Within each speciﬁc type of roast, the beanswere generally packaged in the order they were roasted toensurefreshness.Various cleaning techniques were used throughout theproductionareas.Workersusedbroomstosweeptheproductionﬂoor,wetordrywipesontabletopsandequipmentsurfaces,andcompressed air to remove coﬀee bean dust from surfaces andequipment. In some facilities, maintenance workers maintai nedand repaired production equipment and customers’ coﬀeeroasting equipment (roasters, grinders, and espresso machin es)asneeded.Tasks performed by workers during the production processincluded miscellaneous production (e.g., moving, loading, orscooping green beans; making labels; and moving pallets ofcoﬀee), roasting coﬀee beans, pulling samples of beans duringroasting, quality control, moving roasted beans or groundcoﬀee (e.g., scooping roasted whole bean coﬀee into packagingmachine, pouring whole beans into buckets to hand blend,pouring beans into storage bins, etc.), grinding coﬀee beans,ﬂavoring coﬀee, packaging coﬀee, packaging rework, cleaningmachines, maintenance of machines, and miscellaneous cafétasks (SupplementaryTable1 ). Suspected sources of emissionsincluded roasting, roasted coﬀee, roasted coﬀee in bag, roast edcoﬀee in container, roaster cooling drum, roaster door, sample rroaster, QC grinder, miscellaneous QC, ground coﬀee, heatsealing bags, packaging roasted coﬀee, ﬂavoring, ﬂavored coﬀe e,cafégrinder,andmiscellaneouscafé( SupplementaryTable2 ).Workers were not required to wear company uniformsor protective clothing. We did not observe workers wearingrespiratory protection for chemicals. In three facilities, du stmaskswereoccasionallyusedwhileworkingwithgreenbeans.Insixfacilities,hearingprotectionwasavailableforvolunta ryuse.Work Area and Workforce DescriptionThe work areas and workforce were divided into three maingroups of activities and site: production (e.g., administrat iveproduction, roaster, production, production support, qualitycontrol, grinder, ﬂavoring, and packaging), non-production(e.g., administrative non-production), and café (e.g., bar istaand other café) to segregate the exposure groups into generalareas of roasted coﬀee production, administration and supportactivities, or cafés, respectively. Work areas within these maingroupswereconsistentregardlessofwhetherthefacilityﬂa voredcoﬀee during the survey ( SupplementaryTable3 ). Consistentwork areas among facilities were roasting, grinding, packagi ng,shipping, and storage, with diﬀerences among facilities arisin gfrom individual facility layouts and level of segregation ofprocesses. Some additional work areas were only present inﬂavoring facilities (e.g., ﬂavoring). Workers duties neces sitatedmovement throughout the facility to perform tasks in diﬀerentareas, or the facility was small and open, meaning workers hadthe opportunity to be exposed to multiple emissions sourcesduring their shift. Many facilities were small to medium siz ebased on total number of production and non-productionworkers (range: 4–150) and had facility designs with occasi onalsegregation of production/non-production spaces and sharedgeneral exhaust ventilation. No local exhaust ventilation wasintentionally used for controlling exposures, but the roasti ngmachineshadexhauststhatweresentoutsidethebuilding;mo stfacilities had downdraft cooling bins for roasted beans that a lsoincidentally contributed to exposure mitigation. Administr ativeareasweresometimeswithinthemainproductionareaespeciall yfor smaller facilities with little to no separation of workspace s.Industrial hygienists, who were present during the sampling,assigned the workforce to job exposure groups (administrativenon-production, administrative production, barista, ﬂavori ng,grinder, other café, packaging, production, production support ,quality control, roaster) based on job title, job description , andwhether they spent a majority of their time in the productionareaofthefacility( SupplementaryTable4 ).Jobexposuregroupswere assigned to group workers with similar job duties andpotential for exposure. Workers who could not be assigned toa single job group because they performed multiple jobs wereassignedtothegenericproductionjobexposuregroup.Sampling ApproachMonitoring at each facility was initiated by an HHE request.Outdoor full-shift area samples for alpha-diketones werecollectedtoensureambientairwasnotcontributingtowork placeair.Ateachfacility,workerswereaskedtovoluntarilyparti cipatein the exposure assessment.

Repeat sampleswere collected for full-shift (over multiple days), task (on thesame day and over multiple days), and instantaneous samples(on the same day and over multiple days) whenever possible.Personal sampling of the worker’s breathing zone consisted o ffull-shift,task-based,andinstantaneoussamplesfordiace tyland2,3-pentanedionetoidentifytasksandprocessesthatcontri butedto exposures.

Two glass silica gel sorbent tubes were connected withtubing and inserted into a protective, light-blocking cover andsampled at a ﬂow rate of 50 mL/min. For full-shift sampling,we collected two consecutive 3h samples and calculated thetime-weightedaverage(TWA)concentration,assumingthet otal6h monitoring results reﬂected a full work shift (8h) TWAexposure. We refer to these samples as “full-shift samples”throughout this paper.

The median LODs for all the VOCsquantiﬁed are reported in SupplementaryTable5 , and were 0.6ppb for diacetyl, 0.8 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione, and 1.4 ppb for2,3-hexanedione, based on a 1.5-times dilution factor, whi ch istypical for instantaneous samples. However, individual LODconcentrations varied because they depended on the samplevolumeinsideeachcanister.Data AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using R 3.5.2 (R Foundatio nfor Statistical Computing), JMP 12.0 and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,Inc., Cary, NC).

The AIHA exposure assessment strategy ofcomparing group-level P95 exposure estimates to the RELswas used as an approach to identify groups with potential forexposures exceeding the REL thus identifying particular jobgroups within coﬀee roasting facilities and cafés that are out ofcompliance with the REL ( 36). The P95 applies to all workerswithin a deﬁned group and represents the exposure distributio nof the group as it incorporates the mean and variance of thelog-transformed exposures. The fraction of measurementsabove the NIOSH RELs were also calculated where appropriate.Given similarity in toxicological endpoint of diacetyl and 2 ,3-pentanedioneexposures,theACGIHR/circlecopyrtadditivemixtureformulawas used to calculate a mixed exposure index as the summationof the quotients of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione exposuresto their respective REL (Concentration diacetyl/RELdiacetyl+Concentration 2,3−pentanedione /REL2,3−pentanedione ). When thisindex exceeds 1.0, the mixture index has been exceeded ( 37);we use a generic term mixture index here as NIOSH has notspeciﬁed an approach to compare exposure mixtures to RELs. Aheatmap was generated to display the distribution of the meanconcentration (log-transformed ppb) of eight VOCs collectedby instantaneous activity or source samples during diﬀerentproductionactivities.RESULTS1013/1016 Field and Media BlanksAnalyte mass detected on the ﬁeld blanks was low for mosttubes (diacetyl <LOD to 0.092 µg/mL; 2,3-pentanedione <LODto 0.056 µg/mL; 2,3-hexanedione <LOD for all; acetoin <LODfor all but one sample that measured at 5.6 µg/mL and waslikely contaminated in the ﬁeld).

Area concentrations of 2,3-hexanedione were mostly observed at low concentrations inﬂavoring areas and in grinding areas within both ﬂavoring an dnon-ﬂavoringfacilities( SupplementaryTable7 ).Comparison of Diacetyl and2,3-PentanedioneLinear regression of log-transformed diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione air concentrations ( n=1,175, personal andarea samples) revealed a positive association with a slope of 1. 0,a positive y-intercept of 0.33 and a coeﬃcient of determinatio nof 0.92 (Figure2). The regression indicates diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione air concentrations track well together. Simil artrends and estimates were obtained when the regression mode lwas stratiﬁed by facility, ﬂavoring use, or personal vs. areasample type (data not shown). Similar trends were expectedamongfacilitiesandbetweensample typesbecause both diacety land 2,3-pentanedione are naturally produced and emittedduring roasting, grinding and packaging coﬀee beans. However,diﬀerences may arise between measurements of ﬂavored andnon-ﬂavored coﬀee depending on the addition of diﬀerentﬂavoringproducts.Personal Task ExposuresWe collected 606 personal task-based exposure measurementsfrom 134 workers.

The highest activity concentrations inﬂavored coﬀee facilities were ﬂavoring coﬀee (GM 62, P95 5,311ppb diacetyl) and in non-ﬂavored coﬀee facilities were grindingcoﬀee beans (GM 25, P95 314 ppb diacetyl). The distributionsof all additional VOC mean activity exposures are displayedin a heat map ( Figure3). The highest measured exposure toadditional VOCs was for ethanol during ﬂavoring coﬀee, whichwas observed at a GM of 8,765 ppb (P95 263,320 ppb; GSD8.0) (SupplementaryTable9 ). Acetaldehyde exposures whileﬂavoring coﬀee varied widely (GM 156 ppb; GSD 8.1) and hada P95 concentration of 4,846 ppb, which is 5.4 times lower thanthe ACGIH TLVR/circlecopyrtceiling of 25 ppm.

Thehighest emission sources of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione w ereroasted whole bean and ground coﬀee, grinding, and ﬂavoring(Table10). The two highest sources for diacetyl based on GMwere ground coﬀee (GM 488, P95 21,788 ppb) and roastedcoﬀee in a container (GM 225, P95 7,168 ppb), both innon-ﬂavored coﬀee facilities. The two highest sources for 2,3 -pentanedione based on GM were ﬂavoring (GM 1,882, P95185,446 ppb) and ground coﬀee (GM 251, P95 12,674 ppb, non-ﬂavored coﬀee facility). The highest source for diacetyl and 2 ,3-pentanedione based on P95 was ﬂavoring (P95 354,158 ppbdiacetyl; P95 185,446 ppb 2,3-pentanedione). The distributionsof instantaneous source means for alpha-diketones and otherVOCs are displayed in a heat map ( Figure4).

The mainsources of VOC exposures in coﬀee facilities and cafés wereroasted coﬀee and ﬂavorings. Roasted coﬀee contains a complexchemical mixture of over 850 compounds ( 38). Many of thesecompounds are VOCs including diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, an d2,3-hexanedione, and other chemicals such as CO and CO 2,which are naturally produced when coﬀee beans are roasted ( 5–8,11,39–41). High CO source emissions were observed wherecoﬀee was stored and ground in a number of the facilities,and the results from one facility are discussed elsewhere ( 12).We observed varying concentrations of diacetyl relative to 2,3-pentanedione in the same air sample in non-ﬂavoring facilitie spresumably because of diﬀerences in green beans and roastingpractices among these facilities; coﬀee roast temperature andtime aﬀect aroma formation and VOC proﬁles ( 42).

Air sampleswere collected for short durations ranging from ∼30s to86min to eﬀectively capture high exposures to emitted alpha-diketones. Flavoring coﬀee, grinding and packaging coﬀee werethe most concerning short duration tasks for exposures todiacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione; ﬂavoring was associated wit hhighest exposures for 2,3-pentanedione, but not for diacetyl.In non-ﬂavoring facilities, grinding and moving coﬀee hadthe highest task exposures to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione.Gaﬀney et al. ( 47) found grinding to be the greatest source ofexposure in a roasting facility. In our study, silica gel sorb enttubes were eﬀective at sampling for a few minutes because of amodiﬁcation to the analytical method that enhanced sensiti vity(30). GSDs were higher for some tasks compared to personalfull-shiftestimatesbecauseofinherentenvironmentalva riabilityin shorter term measurements (i.e., environmental variabi lity isdampened in full-shift sampling because of a longer averaginginterval). Short duration task exposures were generally over anorder of magnitude higher than the full-shift exposures andprovided important information on tasks that can be targetedforintervention.We also collected instantaneous activity exposures fromthe workers’ breathing zones during certain activities, an dinstantaneous source measurements at the emission source t oinforminstantaneouspeakexposuresforactivitiesandatsour ces.As with short duration tasks, these instantaneous activitie sand source peak exposures may be important for respiratoryhealth as well as in identifying contributions to emissions . Weidentiﬁedtheactivityofgrindingandthesourceofgroundc oﬀeeto be some of the greatest contributors to worker exposuresto volatile emissions from unﬂavored coﬀee. The source andactivity of ﬂavoring coﬀee were also strong contributors toexposure especially for 2,3-pentanedione, a common diacetylsubstitute. The instantaneous source measurements were mu chgreater than the instantaneous activity exposures and providecritical information on options for controlling exposuresat the source; information on activity exposures may beuseful for planning administrative controls while implementi ngengineeringcontrols.Canister sampling was used for instantaneous grab samplingto complement sorbent tube sampling but could have beenused for any sampling period. An added beneﬁt of canistersampling was the collection of additional VOC analytes thatallowed for quantiﬁcation of ethanol and acetaldehyde amon gothers. Measured ethanol concentrations are indicative ofresidual solvent in ﬂavoring formulations.

Inthis study, we created a mixture index to account forsimultaneous exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione usin gthe ACGIHR/circlecopyrtformula ( 37). OSHA uses a similar equationof summing the quotients of the components of the mixtureto evaluate whether an exposure limit has been exceeded(49). We limited the components to two substances that havebeen associated with obliterative bronchiolitis and that h aveexposure limits. Our results show that most job groups inﬂavored coﬀee facilities had 100% of measurements abovethe mixture index, and for non-ﬂavoring facilities onlythe Administrative job groups had <50% of measurementsabove the mixture index.

Exposures Among Coffee Workersaddress the eﬀects of this complex exposure mixture onrespiratoryhealth.In our assessments, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedionebackground air concentrations increased over the workshif tindicating a lack of adequate ventilation to keep concentra tionsto pre-shift levels. To address these potentially harmful lev els ofalpha-diketones,changesshouldbemadeaccordingtothetypi calhierarchy of controls: eliminate/substitute, engineerin g controls,administrative controls, and personal protective equipment.This approach prioritizes actions by their likely eﬀectivenessin reducing or removing hazards. In most cases, the preferredapproach is to eliminate or substitute hazardous materials.Chemicals known to be hazardous should not be substitutedwithchemicalsofunknowntoxicity,whichwasthecasewith2 ,3-pentanedione prematurely replacing diacetyl in some ﬂavoringformulations. Elimination/substitution is not entirely f easibleas diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione exposures arise not only fro mthe addition of ﬂavorings, but are also generated when roast ingcoﬀeebeans.Thus,installationofengineeringcontrolssho uldbeconsideredtoreduceexposuresorshieldworkers.Controlling emissions using local exhaust ventilation atsources,suchasgrindingmachinesandﬂavoringstations,m ightbe the most eﬀective means of reducing worker exposuresto alpha-diketones. Local exhaust ventilation and enclosur esthat separate the roasted coﬀee or ﬂavoring source from theworker should be designed and incorporated at grinding andﬂavoring areas. Isolating the coﬀee emission source from theworkers by using loose-ﬁtting lids on bins or silos of roaste dcoﬀee might reduce exposures by reducing emissions into theworkspace, but care should be taken when opening the binsbecause peak exposures may occur. Isolation of the ﬂavoringroom or area from the main production space along witheﬀective ventilation and isolation of the production space fro mthe administrative or non-production space is essential formaintaining pollutant control. Note, however, that isolati onof a source or process will increase worker exposures in orfrom the isolated areas if eﬀort is not made to simultaneouslycontrolemissionsintheisolatedareasusingventilation. Wehaveseen substantial reductions (one to three orders of magnitu de)in diacetyl air concentrations by segregating processes andby using local exhaust ventilation at a microwave popcornplant (14). General dilution ventilation is not recommendedto control toxic chemical emissions because they are noteﬀectively removed from the environment, just diluted anddispersed. A well-designed general ventilation system, how ever,might reduce air concentrations of toxic chemicals such asdiacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione by providing outdoor air thatis presumably contaminant-free and exhausting contaminant sfromtheindoorair.The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) andASHRAE have developed consensus standards and guidelinesfor general dilution ventilation systems. ANSI/ASHRAE 62. 1-2019recommendsoutdoorairsupplyratesthattakeintoaccoun tpeople-related sources as well as building-related sources. Thereare no speciﬁc recommendations in the standard for coﬀeeroasting, packaging and ﬂavoring facilities, or for coﬀee caf és.However, therearerecommendations forsimilarspacesthatc anbe used as a starting point for dilution ventilation systems. Forinstance, small to medium coﬀee production spaces could usethe recommendation for sorting, packing, and light assemblyareas. Those spaces should receive fresh, outdoor air at therate of 7.5 cubic feet per minute (cfm)/person for people-related sources, and an additional 0.12 cfm for every squarefoot (cfm/ft2) of occupied space to account for building-relatedsources (50). Medium to large production areas could use therecommendationformanufacturingareasof10cfm/personplus0.18cfm/ft2.Therecommendationsforrestaurantdiningrooms,café/fast-fooddining,andbarsandcocktailloungescouldb eusedfor coﬀee cafés. They are recommended to be ventilated at 7.5cfm/person plus 0.18 cfm/ft2(50). Engineering controls shouldbe designed and implemented by qualiﬁed ventilation enginee rsand companies. Process modiﬁcation or automation to reducethe time workers spend around the emission source are furtherexamplesofengineeringcontrols.Modifyingworkpracticesth atrequire workers to place their heads near open containers ofroasted coﬀee might reduce exposures. Automatic weighing andmixing of roasted coﬀee and ﬂavoring of roasted coﬀee wouldalsoreduceexposures.Administrative controls are next in the hierarchy afterengineering controls. An eﬀective administrative control i sworker education on potential occupational hazards (e.g.,diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, CO, CO 2, green bean and roastedcoﬀeedust)andrespiratoryhealthconsequencesofexposure.Respiratory protection should be the last line of defense,but respirators might be needed as an interim control whilepermanent engineering and administrative controls can beimplemented, and eﬃcacy assessed. If respiratory protection i sused, selection of the appropriate respirator should be guidedby personal exposure sampling ( 51) and a written respiratoryprotection program should be implemented as required bythe OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134),including training, ﬁt testing, medical evaluation, maint enanceanduserequirements.Limitations and Further ResearchA potential limitation of the study is exposure misclassiﬁcatio nduring assignment of job groups in the production area asthe administrative job titles were broad. Information obtai nedduring the survey was used to assign these groups based onstandardized sample data collection sheets and observations bythe sampling team; thus, we expect this misclassiﬁcation to beminimal. When an exposure is misclassiﬁed to an inappropriatejob group, the group means and variance can be artiﬁciallyincreased or decreased.

Theexposure estimates for jobs and tasks reported here are withinsimilar ranges to those reported in other published studies ( 45–47).

Additionally, we could not balance t heexposuregroups,orthesizeofthefacilitiesbeingtestedasw ehadno control over the selection. This analysis did not include largefacilities (i.e., >500 employees), where over 50% of employeesin the coﬀee industry work. Most of the facilities in this studyweresmalltomediumsizebasedonthetotalnumberofworkers ,which likely aﬀected work processes, production volumes, andexposure levels. Thus, large facilities were not represented inthis study and their exposures remain uncharacterized. Somefacilities had segregation of production and non-productionspaces. Finally, the exposure estimates should be interpretedcarefully, especially the estimates of P95 for short-durati onand instantaneous tasks, activities and sources due to the l argevariability (GSD) and censored data, combined with sometim essmall sample size. Furthermore, the Bayesian analysis assume sthat the priors selected were reasonable. While most priorswere left vague to allow the data to drive the inference, we di drestrict the GSDs in the repeated measures ANOVA in order torestrict possible GSDs to ranges typically seen in personal tim e-weighted averages. We also assume that measurements belowthe limit of detection follow similar trends as the observedmeasurements ( 52,53). Additional assumptions associatedwith ANOVA include normality of errors, independence ofindividuals (or observations within a non-repeated measure sANOVA), and constant variances within- and between-worker s.The P95 estimates also assume lognormality of exposures.

Recently, obliterativebronchiolitis was reported in an individual in India who hadworked for 20 years in a coﬀee facility that roasted andground coﬀee; he quit after developing respiratory symptoms(56). Exposure assessments at 17 coﬀee roasting and packagingfacilities revealed exposures to diacetyl above the REL in 95%and to 2,3-pentanedione in 77% of production samples infacilities that ﬂavored coﬀee. The mixed exposure index forthese two chemicals exceeded the mixture index among 96% ofproductionsamplesinfacilitiesthatﬂavoredcoﬀee,72%innon -ﬂavoredcoﬀeefacilities,and67%incafés.Grindingandﬂavo ringcoﬀee were the main tasks associated with elevated exposures.Controlling emissions at grinding machines and ﬂavoring ar easmightbethemosteﬀectivemeansofreducingworkerexposures.Isolating higher exposure concentration areas (e.g., ﬂavor ing,grinding, and packaging areas) from the main production spaceand administrative or non-production spaces is essential formaintaining exposure control.
