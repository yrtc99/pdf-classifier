Plant root exudates playindispensable roles in inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms, whilealso promoting the growth of bene ﬁcial microbes and attracting symbioticpartners. Root exudates contain a complex array of primary and specializedmetabolites. Some of these chemicals are only found in certain plant speciesfor shaping the microbial community in the rhizosphere. Comprehensiveunderstanding of plant root exudates has numerous applications from basicsciences to enhancing crop yield, production of stress-tolerant crops, andphytoremediation. This review summarizes the metabolomics work ﬂow fordetermining the composition of root exudates, from sample preparation todata acquisition and analysis. We also discuss recent advances in the existinganalytical methods and future perspectives of metabolite analysis.KEYWORDSroot exudates, rhizosphere, metabolomics, sampling, multivariate analysisIntroductionThe term “rhizosphere ”is commonly used to describe the soils modi ﬁed by plantroots and the area around a plant root (plant-root interface) that is inhabited by apopulation of several organisms ( Hartmann et al., 2008 ). The rhizosphere is one of themost signi ﬁcant hotspots of the plant ecosystem, determining nutrient acquisitions andpathogens control ( Kuzyakov and Razavi, 2019 ). The chemicals released by plant roots inthe exudates, include high and low molecular weight compounds from diverse chemicalclasses, such as amino acids, organic acids, alcohols, polypeptides, sugars, phenolics,enzymes, proteins, and hormones ( Baetz and Martinoia, 2014 ). The amount and natureof the released exudates are in ﬂuenced by many factors, such as plant taxa, age, rootFrontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 01OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYAttila Ördög,University of Szeged, HungaryREVIEWED BYPierre Leglize,Universite ´de Lorraine, FranceLinkun Wu,Fujian Agriculture and ForestryUniversity, ChinaXingang Zhou,Northeast Agricultural University,China*CORRESPONDENCESalim Al-Babilisalim.babili@kaust.edu.saSPECIALTY SECTIONThis article was submitted toPlant Physiology,a section of the journalFrontiers in Plant ScienceRECEIVED 06 October 2022ACCEPTED 21 November 2022PUBLISHED 06 December 2022CITATIONSalem MA, Wang JY and Al-Babili S(2022) Metabolomics of plant rootexudates: From sample preparation todata analysis.Front.

Albeit theprogress that has been recently made in plant metabolomics,comprehensive analysis of a metabolome in the rhizosphere is stillchallenging. Despite the growing number of reviewsdemonstrating potential plant-microbiome interaction ( Jacobyand Kopriva, 2019 ;Trivedi et al., 2020 ;Pang et al., 2021 ;Guptaet al., 2022 ;Trivedi et al., 2022 ), sampling root exudates ( Oburgerand Jones, 2018 ;Pantigoso et al., 2021 ), and analysis of exudates(Van Dam and Bouwmeester, 2016 ;Canarini et al., 2019 ;EscolàCasas and Matamoros, 2021 ), relatively few reviews haveattempted to integrate the strategies for metabolomics analysisof plant root exudates from sample preparation to data analysis.Thus, this review presents a concise overview formetabolomics methods used in studying the chemistry of rootexudates ( Figure 1A ). We discuss the existing sampling methodsand extraction and describe how extracted samples are subjectedto analysis using different analytical techniques. Moreover, wehighlight the most commonly used methods that are based onhyphenated analytical methods, such as chromatography, eitherliquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC),coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), as well as nuclearmagnetic resonance (NMR). We also cover data miningstrategies that are required for processing and evaluation.Finally, we discuss data analysis by multivariate statisticalapproaches for biological interpretation.Overview of root exudates inorganismal communicationsLiving organisms could generally shape their local bioticenvironment. Indeed, plants utilize their root exudate tomodulate nearby growth conditions, change the soilenvironments, recruit bene ﬁcial microbes for their survival,and communicate with microorganisms ( Figure 1B )(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009 ). Although many aspects ofthis process are still arguable ( Reinhold-Hurek et al., 2015 ),numerous lines of evidence have reported the ability of the plantmicrobiome to regulate plant growth and development inresponse to different stresses ( Lugtenberg and Kamilova,2009 ). Moreover, plant root exudates also positively impactplant development and enhance ﬁtness in response to plantpathogens ( Yuan et al., 2018 ;Mavrodi et al., 2021 ). On the otherhand, more than 40% of the carbon ﬁxed during photosynthesisis released by plant roots in the form of exudates, secretions, andlysates ( Badri and Vivanco, 2009 ), with highly variablecompositions depending on plant species and environmentalconditions ( Phillips et al., 2004 ;De-La-Peña et al., 2008 ).Primary metabolites include sugars, amino acids, polypeptides,proteins, carboxylic acids, and fatty acids, have been well-A BFIGURE 1(A)Schematic representation of collection and high throughput analysis of metabolites secreted by plant roots.

Apart from supporting microbialproliferation, these exudate metabolites are also responsiblethe formation of distinct microbial assemblages in therhizosphere ( Berendsen et al., 2012 ).Besides primary metabolites, countless secondary/specializedmetabolites, generally overlooked compounds with signi ﬁcantbioactivities, are present in the root exudates ( Jacoby andKopriva, 2019 ;Pang et al., 2021 ), functioning as stimulants,inhibitors, or signaling molecules ( Baetz and Martinoia, 2014 ;Fiorilli et al., 2019 ). For example, benzoxazinoids released bymaize roots act as important herbivore and pathogen resistancefactors and trigger rhizosphere colonization by the bacteriumPseudomonas putida (Neal et al., 2012 ;Pe ́triacq et al., 2017 ). Inaddition, root released camalexin and coumarins can increaseplant growth and positively affect root microbiota under nutrient-limited conditions ( Koprivova et al., 2019 ;Harbort et al., 2020 ). Inaddition, the carotenoid-derived plant hormones strigolactones(SLs) are important rhizosphere signals in the communicationwith arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi ( Fiorilli et al., 2019 ;Itoet al., 2022 ), while the AM symbiosis is also regulated by severalcarotenoid-derived signaling molecules, such as zaxinone andblumenols ( Wang et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2020 ;Wang et al.,2021 ). Notably, the biosynthesis and/or exudation of thesespecialized metabolites are h ighly correlated to nutritiondeﬁciency, especially phosphate and nitrogen, suggesting thebeneﬁcial functions of plant-microbe interactions ( Fiorilli et al.,2019 ;Wang et al., 2020 ;Ablazov et al., 2022 ;Votta et al., 2022 ).However, SLs are also used by root parasitic plants, such as Strigathat causes up-to 10 billion yield losses in Africa ( Jamil et al.,2022 ), to localize a suitable host and coordinate their germinationwith its presence ( Wang et al., 2022 ). The dependency of obligateroot parasitic plants on host released SLs has been recently used tocontrol these weeds by inducing their seeds germination in theabsence of the host by applying SL analogs, a promising strategyreferred to suicidal germination ( Jamil et al., 2020 ;Jamil et al.,2022 ). These examples highlight the importance of secondarymetabolites in rhizosphere organismal communications and theneed for more research to uncover and understand the ecologicalfunction of released specialized metabolites. This knowledge couldvery useful for engineering root exudate compositions to attractbeneﬁcial microbiome, improve pathogen defense and enhancetolerance to abiotic stress ( Li et al., 2021 ;Zhou et al., 2022 ).Sample preparationPlant metabolomics methods have been used for identifyingprimary and specialized metabolites in root exudates. Severalexisting methods for collection of root exudates have beendescribed and reviewed ( Oburger and Jones, 2018 ;Vives-Periset al., 2020 ;Pantigoso et al., 2021 ;Wang et al., 2022 ). However,the collection approaches vary substantially among studies dueto limitations in the accessibility of roots or experimental scales.The method used for root exudates collection depends on theobjective of the study, such as SL research ( Wang et al., 2022 ).Sampling can be done either from soil-grown plants orhydroponic culture systems. In soil, the chemical compositionof root exudates usually varies due to adsorption on soilparticles. Further, it can be altered when subjected tomicrobial degradation ( Vives-Peris et al., 2020 ). In addition,the plant exudation pro ﬁle is also dynamic and in ﬂuenced by thecomposition of the surrounding microbiome ( Oburger andJones, 2018 ).One of the main advantages of in vitro cultures over ﬁeldconditions is the higher reproducibility, which is required forcrucial studies on the effects of abiotic stress factors, includingnutrient availability, temperature, moisture content, and osmoticstatus ( Vranova et al., 2013 ). While the samples are obtained, incase of in vitro cultures, from a hydroponic system or liquidmedium, collection of samples from plant grown in soil requiresthe use of sorption ﬁlters buried in the ground close to roots(Haase et al., 2007 ). Methods to collect leachate samples fromgreenhouse pots have also been established ( Zhu et al., 2016 ;Pantigoso et al., 2021 ). Collection of root exudates from in situ innatural growing environment can lead to partial disruption ofroots during collection, inducing stresses and causing samplecontamination from the rhizosphere and the collection ofmetabolites that are not speci ﬁc to the target exudation pro ﬁle(e.g., microbial metabolites) ( Vranova et al., 2013 ;Pantigosoet al., 2021 ). Additionally, changes in the physical characteristicsof the soil can lead to severe changes in the root exudation pro ﬁle(Sasse et al., 2018 ;Miller et al., 2019 ).One of the major disadvantages of the in vitro cultures is theinterference from the exogenously supplemented nutrients andions in analysis. This has been avoided in some studies throughcollection of exudates from plants immersed in distilled water(Badri et al., 2013b ). Further, one of the major limitations of invitro grown plants is that the morphology and physiology of theroots is different from soil-grown plants, due to the lack ofnatural conditions such as soil clods and microorganisms(Vranova et al., 2013 ;Miller et al., 2019 ;Wang et al., 2019 ).To mimic plant ’s natural environment in soil, sterile arti ﬁcialsoil mixtures (e.g. silica sands) suspended in liquid medium havebeen introduced more than 50 years ago ( Harmsen and Jager,1962 ;Curl and Truelove, 1986 ). The introduction of syntheticsoil particles provides mechanical forces simulating naturalsettings ( Vranova et al., 2013 ). To better simulate soilenvironment, microorganisms have been also introduced tothe in vitro growing systems. Novel methods for non-destructive in situ and in vitro collection of root exudates havealso been introduced and improved ( Phillips et al., 2008 ;Gaoet al., 2018 ). Spatial dynamics of the root exudates is quiteSalem et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1062982Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03challenging to analyze, however, soil-based sampling approachesof unaltered soluble exudates from the whole root system includeusing Soil-Hydroponic-Hybrid as well as rhizoboxes incombination with a root exudate collecting tool (SOIL-REC)(Oburger et al., 2014 ;Canarini et al., 2016 ;Oburger et al., 2022 ).To better discriminate target-speci ﬁc metabolites from the rootexudation pro ﬁle, the utilization of isotope labelled substrate(e.g.13CO 2incubation to quantitatively trace thephotosynthesis-assimilated carbon) has been comprised toobtain labelled exuded metabolites ( Seto et al., 2014 ;Simonand Haichar, 2019 ;Chen et al., 2022 ).Since the exudation pro ﬁles differ depending on plantdevelopment, the targeted stage should be carefully de ﬁnedprior to the collection of the root exudates ( Chaparro et al.,2013 ). The plants should be removed from growth media, rinsedwith water to get read of adhering media and transplanted inwater for a pre-de ﬁned time ( Badri et al., 2013a ;Ray et al., 2018 ;Jin et al., 2019 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). The collected samples arepooled to have enough biological replicates, and the ﬁnalsolution is ﬁltered and subjected to analysis. Sampling rootexudates in salt solutions can result in high backgroundmatrix, particularly, when sample concentration is necessaryprior to analysis ( Oburger and Jones, 2018 ). Thus, sampling rootexudates in water reduces the effect of salts. However, samplingin distilled water can damage the root cell membranes, alteringthe exudate concentrations. This can be reduced by submergingthe roots in water solution for few minutes prior to ﬁnalsampling ( Oburger and Jones, 2018 ). In addition, by usingreverse phase C 18silica columns for sample collection can alsoreduce the salt content ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Further, ﬁltration(through membrane ﬁlters, < 0.45 or 0.2 mm) or centrifugation isdone to remove root debris. The samples can be concentrated toremove excess water through freeze-drying (lyophilization),while enough biological replicates should be considered ( Salemet al., 2020 ). The inclusion of quality control (QC) samples, suchas pooled samples allows for following metabolite recovery andtechnical errors during sampl e preparation and analysis(Broadhurst et al., 2018 ;Martins et al., 2018 ).Analytical methods for metaboliteproﬁling of root exudatesTraditional photochemistry methods for extraction,fractionalization, puri ﬁcation and identi ﬁcation of pure chemicalcompounds require tens of kilograms of plant material in alaborious and time consuming process ( Salem et al., 2020 ).Thus, these methods might not be suitable for labor sensitiveand high throughput analysis of hundreds to thousands ofmetabolites in root exudates. Plant metabolomics representslarge scale analysis of all metabolites within biological samples(Salem et al., 2020 ). Plant metabolomics methods have been usedfor identifying diverse metabolites for basic and applied research.The most widely used methods in plant metabolomicsinclude gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry(GC-MS), liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) and nuclearmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Other techniquessuch as capillary electrophoresis-MS (CE-MS), Fouriertransform-near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy, MS imaging(MSI), and live single-cell mass spectrometry (LSC-MS) werealso reported ( Pang et al., 2021 ). Combination of theaforementioned methods may provide complementaryinformation for in-depth analysis of metabolites. Since MS-and NMR-based detection methods are the most frequentlyused techniques in recent years, we summarize theirapplications, advantages and disadvantages in Table 1 . BesidesMS and NMR, non-destructive physical methods such as FT-NIR spectroscopy can also be quick, cheap, and easy to usemethod for the identi ﬁcation of functional groups in speci ﬁcmetabolites. However, furt her optimization in samplepreparation is indispensable for better spectral quality ( Diaset al., 2016 ). Further, MSI-based techniques were utilized todirectly depict the spatial distribution of metabolites in therhizosphere of Zea mays L. plants, Brachypodium distachyonroots, Arabidopsis seedlings, Asparagus roots, tomato roots andMarchantia polymorpha gemmalings ( Sasse et al., 2020 ;Korenblum et al., 2020 ;Döll et al., 2021 ;Gomez-Zepeda et al.,2021 ;Lohse et al., 2021 ). Additionally, LSC-MS allows for thedetection of hundreds of plant-speci ﬁc metabolites acquiredfrom a single plant cell, dis criminating them from thoseproduced by soil microbes ( Masuda et al., 2018 ;Tayloret al., 2021 ).Data processing and analysisMetabolomics experiments generate very complex data, thevast majority of which are derived from biological signi ﬁcance,while others from sample processing, background noise andcontaminations also contribute to the obtained data ( Duan andQi, 2015 ). MS-based analysis is the most technical andconventional platform used for large scale analysis ofmetabolites, but it is not the m ost reliable for structuralconﬁrmation when compared to NMR ( Salem et al., 2020 ).The raw data obtained from plant metabolomics studies arenot suitable for direct analysis and need to go through processingstrategies to obtain pure spectra including noise ﬁltering,smoothing, deconvolution, peak alignment ( Duan and Qi,2015 ;Tahir et al., 2019 ). Processing of MS raw data formetabolomics analysis requir es several steps, including ﬁleformat conversion for the vendor-dependent binary format(e.g.wiff,.D,.RAW …etc.) into other common formats (e.g.NetCDF, mzML, mzXML …etc.) for further processing.Several open source and commercial software and web-toolsare currently available for MS (e.g. XCMS, MZmine, MSDIAL,Open MS, Decon2LS, …etc.) data processing ( Salem et al., 2020 ).Salem et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1062982Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04TABLE 1 The key differences between the most frequently used techniques in plant metabolomics.Techniques Metabolites coverage Advantages DisadvantagesGC-MS Thousands of metabolites, mainly, volatile organic compounds, fatty acids, sugars, nucleotides, organic acidsand amino acids▪Sensitive forvolatilemetabolites▪Availability ofstandardlibraries foridenti ﬁcation▪Relativelyinexpensiveinstrumentation▪Highreproducibility▪Insensitive forthermo-labilemetabolites▪Analysis isdestructiveinnature▪Derivatiztion isnecessary fornon-volatilemetabolites▪Matrix andIonizationdependentresponse▪Novelcompoundidenti ﬁcationis dif ﬁcultLC-MS Thousands of most organic and some inorganic metabolites, particularly, secondary metabolites ▪Sensitive forthermo-labileand polarmetabolites▪Superior fortargetedanalysis▪High numberofdetectedmetabolites▪Direct injectionwithoutseparation ispossible▪Affected by highsaltcontent▪Analysis isdestructiveinnature▪Limitedstructuralinformation▪Many detectedmetabolitesoftenremainunidenti ﬁed▪LessreproducibilityandrobustnessNMR Hundreds of metabolites, from most organic classes ▪Minimalsamplepreparation▪Independent ofmatrixeffects▪Powerful instructuralelucidation▪Identi ﬁcationofnovelcompounds▪Non-destructive innature▪Permits in vitroandin vivo ﬂuxanalysis▪Precisequanti ﬁcation▪Less sensitivitythanMS▪Peak overlap▪Expensiveinstrumentation▪Structuralelucidationis verycomplexSalem et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1062982Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 05Data pretreatment strategies such as scaling and normalizationreduce the systematic bias, while maintaining the biologicalvariation. Data scaling aims at minimizing the impact ofdimension differences (e.g. different concentration ofmetabolites) giving all variables the same weighting, reducingthe bias and improving the predictive ability of statistical models(Gromski et al., 2015 ).Identifying marker metabol ites and their biologicalsigniﬁcance is achieved through in-depth multivariate andunivariate data analysis strategies ( Gorrochategui et al., 2016 ;Rosato et al., 2018 ). To generate an overview of the relationshipamong the datasets, unsuperv ised analysis is a type ofmultivariate machine learnin g algorithm that attempts toanalyze a dataset without prior knowledge of sample grouping.Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clusteranalysis (HCA) are the most extensively used multivariateunsupervised statistical met hods. Additionally, multiplemachine learning algorithms have been developed forsupervised analysis includin g partial least squares (PLS)regression, PLS-Discrimina nt Analysis (P LS-DA), lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor analysis(KNN), random forests (RF) and arti ﬁcial neural networks(ANN) that contribute to the identi ﬁcation of potentiallysigniﬁcant marker metabolites. Several open source as well ascommercial web tools and softwares, such as MetaboAnalyst,Cytoscape, SIMCA (Umetrics) and SPSS (IBM), offercomprehensive metabolomics data analysis, visualization, andbiological interpretation ( Peters et al., 2018 ).The complex and diverse chemistry of plant metabolitesmakes the identi ﬁcation process very challenging. Further,several plant specialized metabolites have no commercially-available standards, and also many have not been recorded byspectral databases. Most of the existing metabolomics databasesdo not contain a satisfying proportion of plant metabolites. Themetabolite annotation, according to the MetabolomicsStandards Initiative (MSI) ( Sumner et al., 2007 ;Blaz ̌enovic ́et al., 2018 ), is divided into four levels: 1) the ﬁrst level:conﬁdently identi ﬁed compounds based on co-characterizationwith authentic samples; 2) the second level: putatively annotatedcompounds based on spectral similarity with spectral libraries;3) the third level: putatively characterized compound classes,and 4) the fourth level: unidenti ﬁed or unclassi ﬁed unknowncompounds. Although plant metabolites are diverse in theirchemistry, they are composed of basic structural units withdifferent substitutions e.g. ﬂavonoids, fatty acids, alkaloids,terpenoids, and coumarins. Compounds that originate fromthe basic building unit will produce similar fragmentationpattern, allowing the determination of compound class anddeduction of the substitution ( Perez De Souza et al., 2020 ).In GC/MS, several mass spect ral libraries of standardcompounds have been established. In addition, thechromatographic behavior and retention time can beconverted to a more robust retention index giving anadditional parameter for structural identi ﬁcation. Hugenumber of libraries for GC-MS analysis is available, includingGolm Metabolom Database, Wiley, NIST, and Fiehn GC-MSlibrary ( Vinaixa et al., 2016 ). Standard mass spectra libraries forLC-MS are limited, and the metabolite identi ﬁcation is moredependent on the availability of authentic standards. Thus,metabolite identi ﬁcation is mainly based on chromatographicpattern of the target class, isotope pattern-assisted prediction ofthe molecular formula as well as MSnfragmentation pattern.Searching using various databases such as PubChem,C h e m S p i d e r ,M a s s B a n k ,H M D B ,K E G G ,N I S T ,W I L E Y ,METLIN, MoNa, mzCloud, GNPS and ReSpect, among others,provide information about the possible structures ( Blaz ̌enovic ́et al., 2018 ). For the annotation of unknown molecules, in silicofragmentation tools such as MS-FINDER, MetFrag, CFM-IDand CSI : FingerID are recommended ( Blaz ̌enovic ́et al., 2018 ).Further, bioinformatics tools based on molecular networking,such as GNPS, are powerful in structural elucidation of knownand novel compounds of interest based on spectra similarity(Quinn et al., 2017 ;Perez De Souza et al., 2020 ).Diverse databases provide de tailed information aboutmetabolomics data collected from multiple platforms alongwith searching, visualizatio n, downloading tools and/orimplementing biological relationships between metabolitesthrough metabolic pathways. Examples are Plant MetabolomeDatabase (PMDB), KNApSAcK , Metaboanlyst, PlantCycdatabase, Metabolomics.jp, KEGG, BioCyc, among others(Rosato et al., 2018 ). Recent advances in bioinformatics toolsand other computer-aided approaches play a central part insystems biology approaches ( Kumar et al., 2017 ). The concept ofintegrated omics is gaining much attention in the last decade as aSystem Biology tool for unraveling the holistic molecularperspectives of the complex biological processes ( Pinu et al.,2019 ). Metabolites are directly closer to the phenotype thangenes and proteins; thus they directly re ﬂect the biochemicalpathways. Different approaches for multi-omics data integrationalongside their limitation have been extensively reviewed ( Fondiand Liò, 2015 ;Misra et al., 2019 ;Pinu et al., 2019 ).Concluding remarks: Challengesand future perspectivesMetabolites from root exudates play important roles inmediating organismal interacti on and response to environmentalstresses. Studies have revealed that root-released metabolites canshape the root microbiome, and in turn, the microbiome has animpact on the host plant metabolome. However, little is knownabout the temporal and spatial dynamics of the root exudate pro ﬁle.Root exudation is mostly analyzed from hydroponic cultures due tothe chemical complexity of soil. He nce, analysis of metabolites fromroot exudates under normal physiological conditions with morenatural settings is necessary. T he choice of sampling strategy,Salem et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1062982Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 06sampling duration, time of collection, plant type as well as plantdevelopmental stage will ultima tely have a great impact on theobtained exudation pro ﬁles. The recent developments in theanalytical approaches and methods in the metabolomics ﬁeldhave increased our understanding of the chemistry of rootexudates. Several techniques such as GC-MS, LC-MS, CE-MS,FT-NIR, and NMR have been used for analysis of different classesof metabolites secreted by plant r oots. Distinguishing plant-speci ﬁcmetabolites from those produced by associated microbes is a greatchallenge in analysis. However, the recent analytical developmentssuch as mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), matrix-assisted laserdesorption ionizati on (MALDI), laser ablation electrosprayionization (LAESI) and live single-cell mass spectrometry (LSC-MS) allowed metabolite analysis at a single-cell level, enabling thediscrimination of plant-speci ﬁc metabolites from those produced byassociated microbiomes.Aside from the recent advancements in metabolite dataacquisition, several bioinformatics tools have been developedfor peak annotation, statistical analysis, multi-omics dataintegration and potential mol ecular biomarker discovery.Though these improvements, the annotation of a wholemetabolome is still challenging. A key bottleneck in metabolitecharacterization is the progress of metabolite annotation. Next,the strategies for integration of metabolomics with other omicsapproaches have not provided in-depth understanding ofmolecular interactions. Thus, the development of furthermachine learning computational approaches such as neuralnetworks is stilled needed. Generating specialized databases forthe chemistry of the root exudates is also important.The current studies obtained so far will help us for betterunderstanding of plant-microbiome interactions and shouldshape the future for crop breeding and sustainable cropproduction. However, many biological questions remain to beanswered for deeper insights into the role of root exudates inshaping the organismal communications. For example, whichspecies of the microbiome are attracted by a speci ﬁc metabolite?How the combination of primary and specialized metabolitesshape the plant microbiome? What are the dynamic changes ofexudate metabolites at different developmental changes? Whichclasses of plant metabolites are secreted for attracting bene ﬁcialmicrobiome and which ones repel pathogenic microbiome? Whydifferent plant species attract different microbiomes? Whichclasses of released metabolit es are consumed by microbes?Answering these questions will signi ﬁcantly increase ourknowledge about the ecological and physiological aspects ofthis largely overlooked aspect in plant ’s life and may allow usto engineer the microbiome and increase plant ’sp a t h o g e ndefense, towards improving crops performance and decreasingthe ecological and economic costs of agriculture.Author contributionsMAS, JYW and SA-B conceived, structured, and ﬁnalizedthe manuscript.
