LETTER Ectomycorrhizal fungi slow soil carbon cyclingColin Averill* andChristine V. HawkesDepartment of Integrative BiologyUniversity of Texas at Austin,Austin, TX 78712, USA*Correspondence: E-mail:caverill@bu.eduAbstractRespiration of soil organic carbon is one of the largest ﬂuxes of CO 2on earth. Understandingthe processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent workhas suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen betweensymbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free-living microbial decom-posers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems glob-ally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here weshow that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67%under ﬁeld conditions in two separate ﬁeld exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via com-petition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 °C soil warming. These ﬁndings support mycor-rhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstratethe need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks toglobal climate.KeywordsBiogeochemistry, ecosystem ecology, mycorrhizal fungi, soil carbon, soil ecology, soil nitrogen.Ecology Letters (2016) 19: 937–947INTRODUCTIONCarbon (C) storage in terrestrial ecosystems is regulated by Cinputs from net primary production and C outputs due todecomposition and respiration by microbial decomposers(Schlesinger & Bernhardt 2012). Nitrogen (N) limitation ispervasive in terrestrial ecosystems, and can limit ﬂuxes of Cthrough both primary producers and free-living microbialdecomposers (Schimel & Weintraub 2003; LeBauer & Trese-der 2008). Plants with root-associated ectomycorrhizal (EM)fungal symbionts dominate boreal, temperate, montane andsome tropical ecosystems (Read 1991; Torti et al. 2001). Thesefungi produce enzymes that degrade organic N, which canunlock N trapped in soil organic matter to fuel plant primaryproduction (Rineau et al. 2012; Shah et al. 2015). However,by doing so EM fungi may induce or exacerbate N limitationof free-living microbial decomposers. Theoretical models pre-dict that competition between EM fungi and free-livingdecomposers for N will slow soil C cycling and increase soil Cstorage (Orwin et al. 2011), which is supported by a globalpattern of increased soil C storage in EM ecosystems (Averillet al. 2014). Yet, despite the potential importance for predict-ing soil and ecosystem C storage, there is still no direct test ofthe mechanism of action (Fernandez & Kennedy 2015).Previous work on this topic has focused on laboratory stud-ies which have shown evidence that EM fungi selectively mineorganic N (Abuzinadah et al. 1986; Bending & Read 1995;Rineau et al. 2012) and slow decomposition of plant litter(Gadgil & Gadgil 1975). Although these laboratory studiesare compelling mechanistically, they cannot evaluate the rele-vance of ectomycorrhizal-decomposer competition for biogeo-chemical cycling in real-world conditions. There are notablecorrelations between fungal community composition and soilC sequestration, however these remain to be experimentallyand mechanistically vetted (Clemmensen et al. 2013, 2015).Furthermore, while some ﬁeld experiments report changes indecomposer activity and soil C turnover when roots and EMfungi are excluded (Gadgil & Gadgil 1971; Lindahl et al.2010; Ekblad et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2013; Brzostek et al.2015), they cannot account for disturbance effects of treat-ments that may generate a temporary increase in labile Cinputs to soil, increasing free-living microbial activity. Forestgirdling experiments have shown positive effects of EM fungiand plant roots on soil C cycling, however again communityeffects are confounded with disturbance of the treatments(H€ogberg et al. 2001; Subke et al. 2004, 2011). Finally, it hasbeen suggested that inhibition of soil C cycling by the pres-ence of EM roots may be driven by a soil drying effect ratherthan competition between EM fungi and soil saprotrophs perse(Bending 2003; Koide & Wu 2003). Because of theseshortcomings, there is still no clear biogeochemical test ofEM-decomposer competition altering soil C and N cycling.We conducted two complementary ﬁeld experiments to testfor and quantify EM-root inhibitory effects on soil C and Ncycling. Both explicitly included controls for the disturbanceinvolved in experimentally excluding EM fungi. First, wetested the effect of EM exclusion on soil C and N cycling overthe course of one growing season in an old growth temperateforest using mesh exclusion bags (‘EM-exclusion experiment’).Second, we determined if the effect of EM fungal inhibitionwas quantitative by leveraging a gradient of EM fungal abun-dance over the course of an entire year, which included EMexclusions across the gradient created by trenching (‘EM-gra-dient experiment’). The gradient study allowed us to controlfor the role of soil drying, as drying effects should be presentin both the low- and high-EM forest sites. We measuredchanges in soil respiration per gram microbial biomass (here-after, ‘biomass-speciﬁc respiration’) and per gram soil, as wellas indicators of microbial N availability. Biomass-speciﬁc res-piration rates have been widely used to better understand soil©2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRSEcology Letters , (2016) 19: 937–947 doi: 10.1111/ele.12631respiration responses to temperature (Bradford et al. 2008;Hartley et al. 2008; Karhu et al. 2014) and soil moisture(Waring & Hawkes 2014), and allow us to detect shifts inmicrobial activity due to release from N limitation.METHODSSite description and experimental designThe experiments were conducted at the Harvard Forest inPetersham, MA, USA (42 °320N, 72 °110W). Experimentalplots were established within three forest types, chosen to rep-resent low-, medium- and high-EM abundance. Low-EM siteswere girdled, ~130-year-old Tsuga canadensis stands, origi-nally designed to simulate hemlock woolly adelgid infestation.Since girdling in 2005, the forest has been re-growing as EMblack birch. Medium-EM abundance sites were ~132-year-oldsecond growth Tsuga canadensis stands used as experimentalcontrols from the girdling treatments. High-EM abundancesites were 200 +-year-old, Tsuga canadensis stands. Sites havepreviously been described in Finzi et al. (2014). The old growthsites were used for the EM-exclusion experiment, whereas allsites were used for the EM-gradient experiment. Figure S1 inSupporting Information shows the spatial distribution of sites.Within each experiment we used a different method toexclude roots and mycorrhizal fungi. The EM-exclusion exper-iment used a ﬁne mesh, while the EM-gradient experimentused a trenching technique. In addition to our goal of reduc-ing EM abundance, mycorrhizal exclusion has an obvious dis-turbance effect. By severing roots and fungal hyphal networkswe create a pulse of fresh substrates that may increase micro-bial activity, which would be confounded with the predictedrelease from EM inhibition. We controlled for this distur-bance by explicitly incorporating disturbance controls intoour design with both methods.In the EM-exclusion experiment we constructed two typesof mesh bags: (1) mycorrhizal exclusion bags made of 1- lmnylon mesh to exclude both roots and mycorrhizal fungi and(2) disturbance controls constructed of 2-mm ﬁbreglass win-dow screen to allow entry of roots and mycorrhizal fungi.Both types of mesh bags (12 912 cm2) were ﬁlled with~100 g of sieved, ﬁeld moist organic horizon material. Threereplicates of each treatment were installed in each of six plotswithin the high-EM site ( n=36). Bags were placed approxi-mately in the centre of the soil organic horizon. Treatmentswere installed during the ﬁrst week of June 2013 and har-vested during the third week of August 2013. Harvested bagswere homogenised by hand, roots were removed and subsam-pled for chemical analyses.In the EM-gradient experiment, four 30 930 m2plotswere established in each of the low-, medium- and high-EMsites as described in Finzi et al. (2014). In 2011, trenchingwas used to experimentally reduce EM abundance using two60960 cm2trenches per plot. The trenches were dugthrough the soil organic horizon to 30- cm depth from thetop of the mineral soil horizon, lined with 2-mm thick plas-tic and then back ﬁlled. In-growth bags made of 2-mm win-dow screen as above were ﬁlled with sieved organic horizonmaterial and placed both inside and outside trenches at anequal distance from the trench perimeter. Bags were incu-bated for up to 13 months in the ﬁeld, in the approximatecentre of the soil organic horizon. Two in-growth bags wereplaced inside and outside of each trench, resulting in fourdisturbance control and four exclusion observations per plot.Bags were harvested from the ﬁeld in June and August 2012and transported on ice to Boston University where they wereprocessed within 24 h.Quantiﬁcation of ECM abundance using sand in-growth techniqueWe quantiﬁed EM abundance across the forest-age gradient,using the sand in-growth technique (Wallander et al. 2013).Mesh bags of 50- lm( 89891c m3) were ﬁlled with~100 g of acid-washed sand. The 50- lm mesh allows forthe in-growth of fungal hyphae, but not roots. Furthermore,because the sand is depleted of C, mycorrhizal fungi thatreceive C from plants dominate. The sand in-growth bagstherefore act as a hyphal ‘trap’, in which EM fungi survivelonger than free-living fungi. This approach has been vali-dated using trenching and13C analysis of in-growth hyphae(Wallander et al. 2001), and ITS sequencing showing thatEM fungi dominate fungal community composition withinthe in-growth bags (Parrent & Vilgalys 2007; Wallanderet al. 2010, 2013). Four sand bags were installed in eachplot, outside of trenches, in July 2011 and harvested inAugust 2012. We quantiﬁed fungal abundance in sandin-growth bags by extracting and quantifying the fungalbiomarker ergosterol.Ergosterol was extracted and quantiﬁed from sand using themethods of Hobbie et al. (2009), extraction details are pre-sented in Appendix S1. Two samples returned values an orderof magnitude greater than the rest, and were determined tomost likely be a result of contamination. These samples wereexcluded from the ﬁnal analysis.Fungal community characterisationDNA was extracted from in-growth cores (0.2 g) using stan-dard methods. Puriﬁed DNA extracts were ampliﬁed by PCRin triplicate using the ITS1F/ITS2 primer pair (White et al.1990; Gardes & Bruns 1993) and sequenced (2 9250 bp) onan Illumina MiSeq V2 (for details, see Appendix S1). Pairedend sequences were assembled and quality ﬁltered, and down-stream OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment were per-formed using the QIIME pipeline (v. 1.7) (Caporaso et al.2010), the uclust algorithm and the UNITE fungal database(Edgar 2010; K ~oljalg et al. 2013). Further details on sequenceanalysis are present in Appendix S1.Fungal to bacterial ratiosWe used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine relativeabundances of fungi and bacteria. We used the 5.8S/ITS1f pri-mer pair for fungi, and the Eub338/Eub518 primer pair forbacteria as described in Fierer et al. (2005). qPCR reactionconditions are described in Appendix S1. Fungal to bacterial(F : B) ratios were calculated based on the number of ITSand 16S copies detected in each sample.©2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS938 C. Averill and C. V.

Ammoniumand nitrate concentrations were determined colorimetrically(Sims et al. 1995; Doane & Horwath 2003). Extractableorganic N in KCl extracts was measured in microplates usingthe OPAME method (Jones 2002). Soils were dried at 100 °Cto constant mass, ground with mortar and pestle, weighed,wrapped in tin capsules and run on an NC2500 Element Ana-lyzer for total C and N (CE Elantec, Lakewood, NJ, USA).Gravimetric soil moisture was measured on 5 g soil subsam-ples dried for at least 24 h at 100 °C.Microbial biomass was quantiﬁed using chloroform fumiga-tion and extraction with 0.5MK2SO4(Vance et al. 1987).Controls were immediately extracted in 50 mL centrifugetubes. Fumigation was performed by placing a cotton ballwithin the centrifuge tube, pipetting 3 mL of chloroform ontothe cotton ball, capping the tube and then incubating the sam-ples in the dark for 7 days (Wallenstein et al. 2006). Afterincubation, samples were vented and extracted. Organic Cand N content of extracts was determined with an Apollo9000 TOC/TN Analyzer (Teledyne Tekmar, Mason, OH,USA) using an arginine standard. We applied correction fac-tors to scale from extractable microbial C and N to totalmicrobial C and N (Vance et al. 1987).Soil microbial C and N ﬂuxesSoil respiration was measured by placing 20 g of ﬁeld moistsoil into a 488-mL glass mason jar ﬁtted with a septum forheadspace sampling. Soils equilibrated for 24 h after beingweighed into jars. Three gas samples were taken from each jarover 3 h. CO2was measured using an infra-red gas analyser(EGM-4; PP Systems, Amesbury, MA, USA). We measuredgross N depolymerisation rates using the assay described inWatanabe & Hayano (1995), modiﬁed by Lipson et al. (1999).We quantiﬁed potential net N mineralisation by incubatingsoils for 7 days at laboratory temperature before extractionwith 2MKCl as described earlier. Daily net N mineralisationwas calculated as the difference in inorganic N between incu-bated and non-incubated soil subsamples divided by thenumber of days incubated.Soil enzyme activitiesWe measured the activities of four hydrolytic enzymes involved inthe decomposition of C and N: beta-glucosidase (BG), cellobio-hydrolase (CBH), n-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and leucineaminopetidase (LAP). These were chosen because they are con-sidered important indicator enzymes for understanding microbialfunction (Sinsabaugh et al. 2008). Soil enzyme activities weremeasured ﬂuorometrically (German et al. 2011) on frozen(/C020°C) soil subsamples at saturating substrate concentrations.Biomass-speciﬁc activitiesBecause EM fungi can represent one-third or more of thetotal soil microbial biomass (H €ogberg & H €ogberg 2002),exclusion of EM fungi may lead to a net decline in totalmicrobial biomass and associated ﬂuxes, even if free-livingdecomposer biomass has increased, as well as the turnover ofsoil C. This is because the source of respiration measured withEM fungi present is a mixture of recent photosynthate trans-ferred to EM fungi and soil organic C processed by free-livingdecomposers, while the source of respiration when EM fungiare excluded is solely soil organic matter. For this reason, wereport both respiration mg/C01microbial biomass (herein bio-mass-speciﬁc respiration) as well as respiration g/C01soil C.This allows us to capture changes in the rate of soil C turn-over due to a comparatively more active microbial biomass.Potential enzyme activities as well as the gross N depoly-merisation rate were also analysed per unit microbial biomass.Biomass-speciﬁc enzyme rates and potential activities canreﬂect microbial investment or allocation in these resourceacquisition strategies. These activities and rates are hereinreferred to biomass-speciﬁc activities and rates.Statistical analysisErgosterol concentrations of sand in-growth bags were aver-aged within plot, and then analysed as a function of site usingANOVA . We analysed all other response variables in a mixed-effects framework using the lme function in the nlme packagefor R-statistical software (Pinheiro et al. 2014; R Core Team2014). Plot was coded as a random effect so that treatmentsand disturbance controls from within the same plot werepaired (Gelman & Hill 2007). In the EM-gradient experiment,we ﬁrst tested for an effect of trenching on soil moisture, oran interaction between trenching and site, given past reportsthat trenching can increase soil moisture (Koide & Wu 2003).We found no effect of treatment or treatment 9site andtherefore proceeded with analysis without modelling soil mois-ture effects. We tested for main effects of stand age and myc-orrhizal exclusion (trenching), as well as an interactionbetween the two predictors. Season (June or August harvest-ing) was initially included as a random effect, but wasremoved from models in the EM-gradient experiment becauseit was not signiﬁcant. When interactive effects were not signif-icant predictors for a response variable in the full model, weonly included main effects. If interactive effects were signiﬁ-cant we tested for differences between trench and controltreatments within each site using the glht function withinthe multcomp package in R (Hothorn et al. 2008). In theEM-exclusion experiment, we tested for main effects of myc-orrhizal exclusion. Furthermore, the 1- lm mesh used toimplement mycorrhizal exclusions increased gravimetric soilmoisture by ~5% relative to controls ( P=0.07). To accountfor this we ﬁtted all models with soil moisture as a covariate.We calculated variance inﬂation factors (Zuur et al. 2010),modiﬁed for a mixed-effects framework, to ensure that treat-ment and soil moisture were not collinear. The highest modelvariance inﬂation factor was 1.13, implying that collinearitywas not an issue and effects of soil moisture and treatmentcould be reliably separated with statistical models. Responsevariables were natural log transformed if the model residualsdid not meet the assumptions of the linear regression as indi-cated by heteroscedasticity of errors.

We present theresponse of total enzyme activity as well as subsets of enzymesthat target on C-containing compounds (BG +CBH) andenzymes that target compounds that contain both C and N(NAG +LAP). We did not perform any multiple comparisoncorrections, as this reduces Type I errors at the expense ofType II errors. In either case, we are more concerned abouterrors of magnitude and direction, both of which are betteraddressed by ﬁtting multilevel models, as done in this analysis.This topic is discussed at length in Gelman et al. (2012).Fungal community composition was analysed as a functionof site, trenching treatment, plot and their interaction withPERMANOVA using the adonis function in the vegan package(Oksanen et al. 2015) for R statistical software (R Core Team2014) based on Bray –Curtis dissimilarities calculated from anabundance matrix of fungal OTUs. Results were visualisedwith non-metric multidimensional scaling in PC-Ord (McCune& Mefford 2011). All mixed-effects regression output can befound in Appendix S2.RESULTSIn the EM-gradient experiment, EM abundance based onergosterol concentrations within sand in-growth bagsincreased signiﬁcantly across the stand age gradient ( P<0.05,Fig. 1a). Molecular metrics of EM sequence relative abun-dance and fungal : bacterial gene copy ratio trended toincrease across the gradient, although differences were not sig-niﬁcant (Fig. 1b), consistent with the ﬁndings of the ergosterolanalysis. Both EM sequence relative abundance and fun-gal : bacterial gene copy ratio were reduced within the trenchtreatments ( P<0.01, Fig. 1c), resulting in conditions similarto the low abundance EM black birch stands (Fig. 1b).Fungal communities differed across the EM-gradient sites(F=5.26; partial r2=0.099, P<0.001) and between theEM-exclusion treatments ( F=4.62; partial r2=0.043,P<0.001) based on PERMANOVA (Fig. 2). Trenching had aunique effect in each site ( F=2.05; partial r2=0.038,P<0.001), resulting in subsets of the local fungal community.The ﬁrst two axes captured 31% of the variation. Axis 1 wascorrelated with % soil C ( r2=0.41; P<0.001). Based on the20 most abundant OTUs by sequence abundance, we saw thatcontrol treatments were dominated by taxa in the generaAmanita ,Lactarius and Russula , as well as 14 fungal OTUsunresolved to genus level, representing 70% of all controlsequences.

We caution against over interpreting themost abundant OTUs, as it has been well demonstrated thatsequence abundance of individual OTUs does not necessarilyreﬂect the abundance of fungal taxa within or across sample(Nguyen et al. 2015).Total microbial biomass varied across treatments andexperiments. Total microbial biomass declined in responseto EM exclusion within the EM-exclusion experiment(Fig. 3a). Within the EM-gradient experiment, total micro-bial biomass declined in low-, but not medium- or high-EMsites (Fig. 3b).In the EM-exclusion experiment, we found that the exclu-sion of EM fungi increased soil C respiration by 39%(Fig. 4a) and biomass-speciﬁc soil respiration by 64%(Fig. 4b). EM exclusion was associated with multiple signals ofincreased microbial N availability, including a 181% increasein the N mineralisation rate (Fig. 4c), a 441% increase in bio-mass-speciﬁc N mineralisation (Fig. 4d), 41% decline in thegross N depolymerisation rate (Fig. 4e) and a 38% decline inbiomass-speciﬁc N depolymerisation (Fig. 4f), an indicator ofmicrobial allocation to N acquisition. Despite the decline inmicrobial allocation to N acquisition, there was no change intotal enzyme activity g/C01soil (Fig. 4g), but overall microbialallocation to decomposition increased when EM fungi wereexcluded, resulting in an 87% increase in biomass-speciﬁcenzyme activity (Fig. 4h).Across the EM gradient, microbial biomass C : N was high-est at the high-EM sites ( P<0.01, Fig. 5a). Trenching didnot alter biomass C : N. Biomass-speciﬁc N depolymerisationrates increased across the gradient and were highest in thehigh-EM sites ( P<0.01, Fig. 5b). Microbial biomass per unitsoil C was lowest in high-EM sites ( P<0.001, Fig. 5c). Therewas a signiﬁcant interaction between site and treatment suchthat biomass per gram soil C declined in trenches within thelow-EM sites ( P<0.001), but not medium- or high-EM sites.N depolymerisation rates declined in trench treatments(P<0.01, Fig. 5d). Biomass-speciﬁc C and N degrading activ-ities (BG +CBH and NAG +LAP) followed the same pat-tern across sites, with high-EM sites having the highestbiomass-speciﬁc activities ( P<0.05). Biomass-speciﬁc enzymeactivity increased in trenches ( P<0.05, Fig. 5e). Trenchingdid not change biomass-speciﬁc N-degrading enzyme activity.Biomass-speciﬁc respiration was highest in the high-EMsites ( P<0.05). There was an interaction between site andtrenching treatment such that biomass-speciﬁc respirationincreased within the trenches only at the high-EM site, butnot medium- or low-EM sites ( P<0.05, Fig. 6a). N minerali-sation also increased within trenches and the effect was drivenby the high-EM site (site by treatment interaction P=0.06,Fig. 6b). Total respiration per gram soil C declined in low-,but not medium- or high-EM sites (Fig. 6c).DISCUSSIONMultiple lines of evidence have led to the emerging idea thatEM fungi signiﬁcantly contribute to the decomposition andselective mining of organic N from soils (Lindahl et al. 2010;Rineau et al. 2012; B €odeker et al. 2014; Lindahl & Tunlid2015; Shah et al. 2015). This leads to the theoretical predic-tion that selective decomposition and uptake of organic N byEM fungi will drive N limitation of free-living decomposers,thereby slowing soil C respiration and increasing soil andecosystem C storage (Orwin et al. 2011). Here we demonstratethat EM saprotroph competition is occurring under ﬁeld con-ditions and resulting in reduced rates of both soil C and Ncycling when EM abundance is sufﬁciently high. Exclusion ofEM fungi led to increases in soil C respiration and N mineral-isation compared to disturbance controls, shifts in microbialallocation to decomposition and a shift to a more bacteria-dominated microbial community. Furthermore, EM inhibitionof soil C and N cycling was limited to old-growth temperateforests where EM fungi were greatest in abundance.

Resultsfrom past studies are equivocal, with both increases anddecreases in microbial activity in response to experimentalEM or root plus EM exclusion (Gadgil & Gadgil 1971, 1975;Lindahl et al. 2010; Brzostek et al. 2015). However, none ofthese experiments controlled for disturbance caused by theexperimental treatments, preventing separation of EM anddisturbance effects. Hence, prior results showing increases inmicrobial activity in response to EM exclusion may be anartefact of experimental treatments.Factors other than EM fungal exclusion were unlikely toexplain our results. For example, there was a small, 5%increase ( P=0.07) in gravimetric soil moisture when rootsand EM fungi were excluded in the EM-exclusion experiment,but changes in soil moisture are insufﬁcient to explain theobserved responses for several reasons. First, all models wereﬁt with soil moisture as a covariate when testing for exclusioneffects in the mycorrhizal exclusion experiment. Varianceinﬂation factors justiﬁed inclusion of soil moisture, as soilmoisture and treatment were not so confounded as to pre-clude separating their effects in any multiple regression model(Zuur et al. 2010). All reported exclusion effects were signiﬁ-cant despite inclusion of soil moisture in every statisticalmodel. Second, roots were excluded in both the high- andlow-EM stands in the EM-gradient experiment. If soil dryingwere driving the increase in decomposition observed in exclu-sion treatments, then we would expect to see increases indecomposition in both the low- and high-EM sites. This wasnot the case, as increases in C cycling were limited to exclu-sion treatments within high-EM sites. Finally, no differencesin soil moisture could be detected in the EM-gradient experi-ment exclusion treatments ( P>0.40).Similar to our argument against soil moisture driving theobserved responses to EM exclusion, our experimental designeliminates the possibility that biogeochemical differences weresolely artefacts of our exclusion treatments. Disturbance alonecannot explain observed responses, because both control andexclusion treatments were disturbed in a similar manner.

Different exclusion treatments(mesh vs. trenching) also produced C and N cycling responsesof a similar magnitude in high-EM sites. It is possible that dif-ferences in ﬁne root N uptake may explain differences acrossthe EM gradient; however, ﬁne root biomass did not differsigniﬁcantly ( P=0.19) within the 2-mm in-growth bags usedas disturbance controls and the trend was towards increasedﬁne root density in the low-EM sites. Hence, if ﬁne roots con-trolled the observed effects, we would expect to see the stron-gest inhibition of soil C cycling at the low-EM sites, which isdirectly opposite to the measured rates. It is also possible the1-lm mesh in the EM-exclusion experiment excluded soilpredators, confounding microbial predation and the presenceof EM fungi. However, predation generally increases ratherthan decreases decomposer activity (Ingham et al. 1985;Moore et al. 2003), and therefore cannot explain our ﬁndings.Finally, inhibition of decomposer activity by EM fungi mayhave been driven by competition for some soil nutrient otherthan N. We cannot rule out this possibility, but do note theextensive literature on the role of EM fungi on N acquisitionwithin the soil horizons observed here (Read 1991; Lindahl &Tunlid 2015).Despite the increases in soil C and N cycling, we observed adecline in microbial biomass when EM fungi were excluded inthe ﬁrst experiment (Fig. 3a) and either a decline or nochange in microbial biomass at the highest EM sites in thegradient experiment (Fig. 3b). This is unsurprising, however,considering that EM fungi can represent one-third or more ofthe total soil microbial biomass (H €ogberg & H €ogberg 2002).Therefore, exclusion of EM fungi may lead to a net decline intotal microbial biomass, even if free-living decomposer bio-mass has increased, as well as the turnover of soil C. This alsosupports our use of biomass-speciﬁc respiration, as it allowsus to capture changes in the rate of soil C turnover due to acomparatively more active microbial biomass in the absenceof EM fungi.We also observed an inconsistency between the response ofpotential N-targeting enzyme activities and the gross rate ofN depolymerisation in response to EM exclusion. Gross Ndepolymerisation declined in both experiments, whileN-degrading enzyme potentials were constant or increased.We believe this may be due to the fact that N-degradingenzymes also return organic C to microbes, and increasinginvestment in N-degrading enzymes has been shown to be anoptimal strategy to maximise microbial C acquisition when Nlimitation is relieved (Averill 2014). Hence, these contrastingﬁndings are not necessarily inconsistent with a shift frommicrobial N to C limitation, especially in conjunction withobserved increases in N mineralisation and C respiration inEM-exclusion treatments.Our design is not perfectly controlled, as there are C inputsfrom primary productivity present in the root and EMin-growth disturbance controls that are absent in theEM-exclusion treatments. EM hyphal turnover itself can alsobe an important component of ecosystem C input (Wilkinsonet al. 2011; Clemmensen et al. 2013). Ideally we would createtreatments where roots could grow in without EM fungi, andalso add EM fungal necromass equal to any EM fungal**024603690.00.10.20.30.48 years 130 years 200+years8 years 130 years 200+years8 years 130 years 200+yearsug C (mg biomass C)–1h–1ug N (g soil)–1day–1 ug C (g soil C)–1h–1ControlExclusionBiomass-specific respirationN mineralizationTotal respiration(a)(b)(c)Figure 6 The x-axis age gradient reﬂects an ectomycorrhizal (EM)abundance gradient, from lower to higher across younger to older sites.

Because we cannotinclude these inputs in the EM-exclusion treatments, we havelikely underestimated the inhibitory effect of EM fungi on soilC cycling, as these organic matter inputs would likely furtherincrease soil microbial activity in the EM-exclusion treatmentscompared to disturbance controls.Recently, Clemmensen et al. (2015) showed a shift fromEM to ericoid mycorrhizal dominated fungal communitiesacross a boreal forest gradient in C storage. It may be thatspeciﬁc members of EM and other mycorrhizal fungi play animportant role in stabilizing soil C. It is possible that certainspecies of EM and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi engage more inN-competitive mechanisms than other species, and this isreﬂected in the shift in community composition by Clem-mensen et al. (2015). We observed a different set of speciesdominating our soils by sequence abundance in the presentstudy, however we caution against over interpreting commu-nity composition data based on sequence abundance.Based on these ﬁeld experiments, we support a novelmechanism of soil C storage predicted from ecological theory(Orwin et al. 2011), with the potential to explain the globalpattern of elevated soil C storage observed in EM ecosys-tems (Averill et al. 2014). The effect of EM fungi on soil res-piration is larger than the 21% increase found for 2 °Cforest soil warming (Wang et al. 2014). Changes in plantallocation to EM fungi due to warming, forest age, elevatedCO2and other global change factors will likely alter thestrength of the competitive interaction between EM fungiand free-living decomposers (Garcia et al. 2008; Clemmensenet al. 2013). Positive or negative feedbacks to climate changeare possible, depending on whether or not this interaction iscommon, and whether global change results in a net decreaseor increase in the abundance of EM fungi relative to othermicrobial functional groups in soil. Acknowledging andmodelling ecological interactions within soil microbial com-munities, and in particular with EM fungi, has the potentialto transform our understanding of how C is distributedacross the Earth.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSCA was supported by a National Science Foundation Gradu-ate Research Fellowship (DGE-1110007) and Doctoral Disser-tation Improvement Grant (DEB-1401299).
