OPEN ACCESS ABSTRACT The continuous increases of atmospheric temperature and CO 2 concentration will impact global photosynthesis. However, there are few studies considering the interaction of elevated temperature (eT) and elevated CO 2 (eCO 2) on dynamic photosynthesis, particularly for C4 species. We examine dynamic photosynthesis under four different temperature and [CO 2] treatments: (1) 400 ppm × 28°C (CT); (2) 400 ppm × 33°C (CT+); (3) 800 ppm × 28°C( C+T); and (4) 800 ppm × 33°C( C+T+). In Glycine max L., the time required to reach 50% (T50%A) and 90% (T90%A) of full photosynthetic induction was smaller under the CT+,C+T, and C+T+ treatments than those under the CT treatment. In Amaranthus tricolor L., however, neither T50%A nor T90%A was not signiﬁcantly affected by eT or eCO 2. In comparison with the CT treatment, the achieved carbon gain was increased by 58.3% (CT+), 112% (C+T), and 136.6% (C+T+)i n G. max and was increased by 17.1% (CT+), 2.6% (C+T) and 56.9% (C+T+)i n A. tricolor . The increases of achieved carbon gain in G. max were attributable to both improved photosynthetic induction efﬁciency (IE) and enhanced steady-state photosynthesis, whereas those in A. tricolor were attributable to enhanced steady-state photosynthesis.

Introduction Atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by half since the Industrial Revolution, and the annual global mean temperature has also risen by more than 0.6°C since 1950 (IPCC 2014 ). A large volume of studies have reported that elevated CO2 concentration (eCO 2) enhances photosynthetic capacity (Drake et al. 1997 ; Ainsworth and Long 2005 ; Ainsworth and Rogers 2007 ), whereas the eﬀects of elevated temperature (eT) on photosynthetic capacity are complex, depending on both the initial leaf temperature and the degree of warming (Dusenge et al. 2019 ). However, the stress of eCO 2 and warming does not occur in isolation. Under climate change, the two stresses occur simultaneously (Norby and Luo 2004 ; Luo et al. 2008 ). Photosynthetic responses to the two stresses may be synergistic in some circumstances, but antagonistic in others (Dieleman et al. 2012 ; Smith and Dukes 2013 ). To project photosynthesis in a future of climate change, studies on the interactive eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on photosynthesis are urgently needed (Xu et al. 2013 , 2014 ). Most studies on photosynthesis were carried out under constant light conditions, where light was well controlled. However, in natural environments, light is constantly ﬂuctuating, leading to ﬂuctuations in operating leaf photosynthesis (Chazdon and Pearcy 1986 ; Pearcy 1990 ; Pearcy et al. 1996 ; Tang 1997 ). Investigating photosynthesis in ﬂuctuating light; i.e. dynamic photosynthesis, will improve our understanding of photosynthesis in natural environments. There have been some studies addressing the eﬀects of eT or eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis in C3 plants. Below the temperature optimum point, short-term eT can T. Zheng et al. Functional Plant Biology promote photosynthetic induction (the time course of photosynthetic rate in response to a sudden increase in light intensity) by reducing the biochemical limitation of RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) regeneration and Rubisco activa-tion (Kaiser et al. 2015 ). In contrast, elevating temperature above the temperature optimum point may inhibit photosyn-thetic induction by depressing Rubisco activation (Leakey et al. 2003 ; Kang et al. 2020 ). Short-term eCO 2 can promote photosynthetic induction by reducing the biochemical limitation of Rubisco activation and stomatal limitation (Tomimatsu and Tang 2016 ; Kaiser et al. 2017 a, 2017 b; Tomimatsu et al. 2019 ; Kang et al. 2021 ). As far as we know, there has been no study addressing the eﬀects of the interaction of eT and eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis. Elevating temperature decreases the solubility of CO2 in water but eCO 2 can compensate this factor (Jordan and Ogren 1984 ; Foyer et al. 2009 ). Another source of uncertainty regarding the interaction of eT and eCO 2 results from the inconsistent results about the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on stomatal limitation in previous studies (Naumburg et al. 2001 ; Leakey et al. 2002 , 2003 ; Tomimatsu and Tang 2012 ; Kaiser et al. 2017 a). Elevating CO2 reduces stomatal limitation, whereas eT could increase or reduce stomatal limitation (Kaiser et al. 2015 , 2017 a; Wachendorf and Küppers 2017 b), probably due to the trade-o ﬀ between carbon gain and evaporative cooling (Moore et al. 2021 ). Elevating temperature generally increases post-illumination CO2 ﬁxation and post-illumination CO2 burst at low and medium leaf temperature (Sun et al. 1999 ; Foyer et al. 2009 ), but eCO 2 decreases post-illumination CO2 burst by inhibiting photorespiration (Leakey et al. 2002 ). Therefore, studies are needed to address the uncertainty of the eﬀects of the interaction of eT and eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis. About 3% of the Earth ’s angiosperm species utilise the C4 photosynthetic pathway, yet C4 plants contribute about 25% of the net terrestrial primary productivity on Earth (Sage 2004 ). There have been many studies on the steady-state photosynthesis in C4 plants (Furbank et al. 1990 ; Sage and Kubien 2007 ; Sage and Zhu 2011 ; Sage et al. 2012 ; Long and Spence 2013 ; von Caemmerer 2021 ), but rare on their dynamic photosynthesis (Furbank and Walker 1985 ; Horton and Neufeld 1998 ; Pignon et al. 2021 ; Wang et al. 2021 ). Kubásek et al. (2013) have shown that C4 plants lost more carbon in ﬂuctuating light than in steady light compared with C3 plants, which they assumed was a result of an increase of bundle sheath cells (BSC) leakiness to CO2 in C4 plants in ﬂuctuating light. However, Stitt and Zhu (2014) proposed that the two-cell Kranz system of C4 photosynthesis ensures large pools of metabolites that could drive diﬀusion between BSCs and mesophyll cells (MC) for buﬀering ATP and NADPH, which may provide powerful protection against ﬂuctuating light intensities. Recently, Li et al. (2021) have proposed that the accumulation and diﬀusion of metabolites in C4 plants from MCs to BSCs take more time, which may delay the photosynthetic induction. Therefore, the diﬀerences between C3 and C4 plants in their dynamic photosynthesis are still under debate. In this study, we characterised photosynthetic responses to the simulated changes of light intensity in a C3 species and a C4 species under four diﬀerent treatments, aiming to address: (1) the eﬀects of the interaction of short-term eT and eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis; and (2) the diﬀerences between C3 and C4 plants in their dynamic photosynthetic responses to eT and eCO 2. We hypothesised that: (1) the short-term eT and eCO 2 would promote photosynthetic induction and enhance carbon gain; and (2) the promotion of photosyn-thetic induction and the enhancement of carbon gain were greater for C3 plants than for C4 plants. Methods and materials Plant materials The seeds of the C3 species, Glycine max L. and the C4 species, Amaranthus tricolor L. (NAD-ME subtype) were sown in pots (the circular radius was 5 cm and the height was 14 cm) ﬁlled with composite soil. Each of the two species was grown within a growth chamber (E-36L1, Percival, Perry, Iowa, USA). After germination, seedlings were thinned. The plants were watered with distilled water regularly and supplied with 5 mL full concentration formula nutrient solution (nitrogen 17 g/L, phosphorus anhydride 17 g/L, potassium oxide 17 g/L, organic matter 25 g/L, and amino acid 12 g/L) every 3–5 days. These ensure that all plants can obtain suﬃcient nutrients and water, which helps reduce the degree of growth limitation (Poorter et al. 2012 ). Growth environments was kept constant and consistent throughout the experiment in both growth chambers. Photosynthetic photon ﬂux density (PPFD) incident on the top of both canopies was about 600 μmol m−2s−1. The photoperiod was 14 h. Day/night air temperature was set to 28/22 °C, [CO 2] was the same as ambient CO2 concentration and relative humidity was maintained at 70%. Leaf gas exchange measurements Leaf gas exchange was measured on plants 25 days after germination using a Li-6800 portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a Li-6800-01 ﬂuorometer (90% red and 10% blue) on the most recently fully expanded leaves (n = 4). The measured plants were moved to another growth chamber 60 min before the start of the measurement to acclimate to the target temperature and [CO 2] in advance. The measured leaves were enclosed in the Li-6800 leaf chamber, and were ﬁrst acclimated in the chamber to a PPFD of 100 μmol m−2s−1 until steady-state net assimilation rate (A) and stomatal conductance for H2O(gsw) were visibly reached, after m−2s−1which PPFD was raised to 600 μmol and kept 996 CiðtÞ−ΓAðtÞ=VcðtÞCiðtÞ+Km–RL (2)www.publish.csiro.au/fp  Functional  Plant Biology steady for 60 min. Then, PPFD was decreased  to 100 μmol m−2s−1 until A reached steady states again.Gas exchange  parameters,  including  A, gsw, intercellular  CO2concentration  (Ci), and transpiration  rate (E), were logged every second. To avoid any swinging  from correctional  changes in temperature  or relative humidity,  the temperature  of the heat exchanger  (Texchg) was controlled.  All measure -ments were repeated  under four diﬀerent combinations  of temperature  and CO2 concentration:  (1) 400 ppm × 28°C, denoted as CT; (2) 400 ppm × 33°C, denoted as CT+; (3) 800 ppm × 28°C, denoted as C+T; and (4) 800 ppm × 33°C, denoted as C+T+. The vapour pressure diﬀerence between leaf and ambient air ranged from 0.9 kPa to 1.1 kPa at 28°C and from 1.1 kPa to 1.5 kPa at 33°C. Data analysis Steady-state  A, gsw, and Ci reached at each PPFD level were calculated  by averaging  the single values over the last minute of each period; T50%A and T90%A were deﬁned as the time required to reach 50% and 90% of the diﬀerences between A100 and A600. We calculated  the induction  state (IS) after Chazdon  and Pearcy (1986) : AðtÞ − AISðtÞ =100× 100% (1)A600 − A100where A(t) is the transient  A at time t. For C3 plants, under Rubisco limitation,  A(t) can be calculated  after Farquhar  et al. (1980) : where Vc(t) and Ci(t)i s Vc and Ci at time t, respectively.  Km is the Michaelis –Menten constants  of Rubisco and Γ* is the CO2compensation  point, they were both taken from Bernacchi  et al. (2003) . RL is mitochondrial  respiration  rate in the light and assumed to be 40% of dark respiration  rate between 25 and 35°C(Way et al. 2019 ). The time courses of Vc(t) were then ﬁtted to the model proposed  by Woodrow  and Mott (1989) , and we use Vc(t) to replace A(t) after correction  of Ci(t). where Vc,ini and Vc,max are the initial and maximum  Vc(t) after correction  to 25°C(Bernacchi  et al. 2003 ), respectively;  τR is the apparent  time constant of Rubisco activation.  The achieved  carbon gain (ACG) and ideal carbon gain (ICG) were calculated  after Kang et al. (2021) :   Zt ACG ðtÞ = AðtÞdt − A100 × ðt − t0Þ (4) t0ICG ðtÞ = ðA600 − A100Þ × ðt − t0Þ (5) where t0 is the time when PPFD was increased.  The ratio of ACG to ICG is photosynthetic  induction  eﬃciency (IE), which is calculated  after Yanhong  et al. (1994) :  tACG t A tdt − A100 × t − t0 IEðtt ð ÞRð Þ ð ÞÞ= =  0(6)ICG ðtÞ ð A600 − A100Þ × ðt − t0Þ Eqn 4 indicates  that ACG during photosynthetic  induction  can be decomposed  into ICG, which is only inﬂuenced by steady-state  A; and IE, which is inﬂuenced mostly by the time course of photosynthetic  induction.  Short-term  eT and eCO 2 can inﬂuence ACG via changes in ICG and/or those in IE. We assumed that changes in IE reﬂected the responses  of photosynthetic  induction  to diﬀerent treatments  per se. Post-illumination  carbon gain (PICG) due to the simulated  lightﬂeck was calculated  as follows: where t1 is the time when PPFD was decreased,  A100post is the steady-state  A at the end of post-illumination  period. Intrinsic water use eﬃciency (iWUE) was calculated  by dividing the transient  A by the transient  gs (Farquhar  and Sharkey 1982 ): AðtiWUE = Þ(8)gsðtÞ Statistical  analysis To determine  the eﬀects of measurement  temperature  and CO2 concentration  ([CO 2]) on gas exchange  parameters  for two species, when the requirement  of the normality  and homogeneity  of variances  were met, we used two-way  ANOVA with temperature  and [CO 2] as the main factors and temperature  × [CO 2] as interaction,  and Duncan test was used for post hoc multiple comparisons.  When the requirement  of the normality  and homogeneity  of variances  were not met, we used a Kruskal –Wallis test to perform the same analysis. All tests were conducted  using SPSS Statistics  ver. 18.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk,  NY, USA) and R ver. 3.6.1. Results Steady-state  photosynthesis  under different  temperature  and CO 2 treatments  In G. max, the mean A600 was increased  by 20.0% and 61.5% under the CT+ and C+T treatments  compared  to the CT treatment.  However,  the mean A600 was increased  by 74.8% under the C+T+ treatment,  which was less than the sum of the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 alone (Table 1). In A.tricolor , the mean A100 and A600 were not signiﬁcantlyaﬀected by eT, eCO 2 or their interaction  (Table 1).997 VcðtÞ=Vc, max−ðVc, max−Vc,ini Þ×e−tτR (3)tPICG ðtÞ=ZAt1½AðtÞ− 100post dt, when AðtÞ>A100post (7)T.

AStatistical analysis using a Kruskal –Wallis test. Dynamic photosynthesis under different temperature and CO 2 treatments In comparison with CT treatment, the transient A in G. max were higher under the other three treatments, and evident diﬀerence was observed in the ﬁrst minute of photosynthetic induction (Figs 1a,2a). The transient IS was highest under the CT+ treatment during the ﬁrst 5 min of induction; after that, IS was much higher under the C+T and C+T+ treatments (Fig. 1c). In A. tricolor , the transient A was almost the same in the ﬁrst minute between all treatments; after that, the transient A was highest under the C+T+ treatment and still similar in the other three treatments (Figs 1b,2b). The transient IS was always similar between all treatments (Fig. 1d). Bars for s.e. in Figs 1 and 2 were omitted for visual clarity. In addition, iWUE was higher under the C+T and C+T+ than other two treatments during photosynthetic induction in both species (Fig. S1). In comparison with CT treatment, the mean T50%A, T90%A, τR, T50%g and T90%g in G. max were decreased under the other three treatments. However, e ﬀects on the mean T 50%A, T90%A and τR under C+T+ treatment was less than the sum of the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 alone (Fig. 3a, b), while eﬀects on the mean T50%g and T90%g under C+T+ treatment was smaller than the eﬀects of eCO 2 alone (Fig. 3c, d). In A. tricolor , the mean T50%A and T90%A did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between treatments (Fig. 3a, b). The mean T50%g and T90%g still had no diﬀerence between the CT, CT+ and C+T treatments, but signiﬁcant higher under the C+T+ treatment (Fig. 3c, d). ACG and IE In G. max, ACG 60 min was increased by 58.3% and 111.9% under the CT+ and C+T treatments compared to the CT treatment. However, ACG 60 min was increased by 136.4% under the C+T+ treatment, which was less than the sum of the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 alone (Fig. 4a).

A, photosynthetic rate; gs, stomatal conductance. ACG 60 min under the CT treatment was also less than the other three treatments, but the promotion eﬀect on the C+T+ treatment was larger than the sum of the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 alone (Fig. 4b). In comparison with CT treatment, PICG in G. max and A. tricolor were higher under the other three treatments, but the eﬀects on the C+T+ treatment was less than the eﬀects of eT alone (Fig. 4c, d). In G. max, ACG and IE were higher under the other three treatments than those under the CT treatment (Fig. 5a) and ACG were always highest under the C+T+ treatment at diﬀerent time points (Fig. 5c). In A. tricolor , IE did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between all treatments at any time (Fig. 5b, d), despite there were changes in ACG 60 min in A. tricolor (Fig. 4b). To further assess the contribution of ACG and IE on increasing ACG 60 min, we estimated the potential ICG 60 min by assuming that eT and eCO 2 had no eﬀect on photosynthetic induction (equivalent to no changes in IE). In comparison with CT treatment, the increase in ICG 60 min enhanced ACG 60 min by 16.9%, 55.3% and 73.1% in G. max and also enhanced ACG 60 min by 27.7%, 11.4% and 64.5% in A. tricolor under the other three treatments (Fig. 6a, b). Then, we assumed no eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on steady-state A (equivalent to no changes in ICG) to assess the separate contribution of IE. Compared to the CT treatment, the increase in IE60 min increased ACG 60 min by 31.5%, 31.4% and 34.3% in G. max under the other three treatments, but decreased ACG 60 min by 6.5%, 5.4% and 3.5% in A. tricolor (Fig. 6a, b). In summary, ACG 60 min in G. max was aﬀected by both IE60 min and ICG 60 min. eT had a similar eﬀect on IE60 min as eCO 2 but a lower eﬀect on ICG 60 min than eCO 2 (Fig. 6a). However, ACG 60 min in A. tricolor was only aﬀected by ICG 60 min and the eﬀect of eT on it was higher than that of eCO 2 (Fig. 6b). The correlations between photosynthetic steady-state and induction parameters We assessed the correlations between steady-state and induc-tion parameters using Pearson ’s coeﬃcients. In G. max, ACG 60 min was not only positively correlated with A100 (P < 0.001), A600 (P < 0.001) and IE60 min (P < 0.001), but also negatively related to T50%A (P < 0.001), T90%A (P < 0.001) and T50%g (P < 0.01) (Fig. 7a). But in A. tricolor , ACG 60 min was only positively correlated with A600 (P < 0.001); not related to T50%A, T90%A, T50%g and IE60 min (Fig. 7b). Discussion Differential effects of eT and eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis in G. max In G. max, both eT and eCO 2 promoted photosynthetic induction, but their eﬀects were diﬀerential: eT alone 999 T.

This result indicates that few genes are involved in photosyn-thetic responses to sudden changes in light. We focused on the physiological responses of photosynthetic induction to short-term eT and eCO 2. Photosynthetic induction at the early stage is widely a s s u m e dt ob el i m i t e d b yt h et i m el a g si nb i o c h e m i c a l processes, especially RuBP regeneration and Rubisco activation (Pearcy et al. 1996; Tomimatsu and Tang 2016 ). We found moderately eT decrease the T50%A and τR in this study (Fig. 3a; Table 2). Kaiser et al. (2015) reported a parabolic relationship betwe en photosynthesis induction rate and temperature, with the fastest induction occurring at about 30°C. Such a parabolic relationship would be related to the activation rate of Rca (Rubisco activase) on Rubisco (CarmoSilva and Salvucci 2011). Elevating CO2 reduces biochemical limitation by accelerating the Rubisco activation (a smaller τR), which may be ascribed to CO2-stimulated Rca upregulation (Zhao et al. 2019). However, in this study, eT had a greater impact on the transient IS than eCO 2 in the ﬁrst 5 min (Fig. 1c). At a longer timescale (~60 min), photosynthetic induction is mainly limited by diﬀusional limitation (Way and Pearcy 2012 ; Kaiser et al. 2015; Lawson and Vialet-Chabrand 2019 ). Diﬀusional limitation can be alleviated more rapidly by higher initial gs and faster stomata opening (McAusland et al. 2016 ; Wachendorf and Küppers 2017a ). However, eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on gs and stomata opening rate are conﬂicting between studies; increases (von Caemmerer and Evans 2015; Urban et al. 2017 ), decreases, (Sage and Sharkey 1987 )o rn oc h a n g e s (von Caemmerer and Evans 2015)o f gs under eT have been reported before. Elevating CO2 generally reduces gs but its eﬀect on stomatal opening can be positive (Naumburg et al. 2001; Leakey et al. 2002; Kaiser et al. 2017a )o r n e g a t i v e (Tomimatsu and Tang 2012). In this study, both eT and eCO 2 reduced diﬀusional limitation by accelerating stomata opening (Fig. 3c), without signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the initial gs (Table 1). Both eT and eCO 2 enhanced carbon gain in ﬂuctuating light by improving photosynthetic induction eﬃciency and photosynthetic capacity in G. max. The enhancement of ACG under eT was mainly attributable to the improved IE, while that under eCO 2 was mainly attributable to the improved photosynthetic capacity. The eﬀects of eCO 2 were consistent with Kang et al. (2021) , where ICG had a larger eﬀect than IE on ACG during induction in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice. 1001 T. Zheng et al. Functional Plant Biology Fig. 6. The effects of eT and eCO 2 on ACG 60 min via changes in photosynthetic induction and steady-state photosynthesis in G. max (a) and A. tricolor (b) leaves. The ACG under the CT treatment was calculated by integrating A over a time period of 60 min following an increase in light intensity from 100 to 600 μmol m− 2 s−1. Carbon gains under other hypothetical conditions were calculated by multiplying IE60 min and ICG 60 min measured under different three treatments, as the subscripts indicate. Values are means of four biological replicates; i.e. individual plants for each species. Blue bars indicate the effect of changing ICG and red bars indicate the effect of changing IE. Numbers indicate the percentage changes in ACG 60 min, taking ACG 60 min under the CT treatment as the base value. Minor effects of eT, eCO 2, or their interaction on dynamic photosynthesis in A. tricolor In A. tricolor , photosynthetic induction was not signiﬁ cantly aﬀected by eT, eCO 2 or their interaction (Table 3, Fig. 3b, d). In particular, during the ﬁrst minute of photosynthetic induction, the time course of transient A under each of the four treatments almost overlapped in A. tricolor (Fig. 2b), indicating that factors insensitive to both temperature and [CO 2] are dominating photosynthesis during this time. This result is consistent with the report on photosynthetic Fig. 7. The correlations between photosynthetic traits measured in G. max (a) and in A. tricolor (b).

Rubisco activity and stomatal conductance (Fig. 2d) change little during this period (Kaiser et al. 2015 ; Tomimatsu and Tang 2016 ), thus we propose that the enhancement of photosynthetic rate is associated with the build-up of metabolite concentration 1002 www.publish.csiro.au/fp Functional Plant Biology Table 2.

In C4 photosynthesis, atmospheric CO2 is ﬁrst assimilated as C4 acids in a C4 cycle before entering the Calvin-Benson cycle, or referred to as C3 cycle (Bräutigam and Weber 2011 ). The C4 and C3 cycle is coordinated by intracellular transport of C4 acids and C3 metabolites (Furbank et al. 2000 ), or light regulation of key enzymes (Furbank et al. 1997 ). Light regulation of the key enzymes takes minutes and should impose relatively small limitation on photosynthesis during the initial stage of the induction (Usuda et al. 1984 ). Intracellular transport of C4 acids and C3 metabolites is widely believed to occur by symplastic diﬀusion and require metabolite concentration gradients between the compartments (Sowi ński et al. 2008 ). Isotopic labeling experiments have revealed the establishment of metabolite pools and the concentration gradients during induction (Moore and Edwards 1986 a, 1986 b). C4 species have low levels of RuBP and its precursors even at high light (Borghi et al. 2022 ), but maintain high levels of C4 acids at both low and high light (Moore and Edwards 1986 a). Such large pools of C4 acids facilitate a fast build-up of suﬃcient metabolite concentration gradients (Wang et al. 2021) and thereby provide additional abilities to buﬀer the redox and energy status against ﬂuctuating environments (Stitt and Zhu 2014) . Diﬀerent from G. max, the increases of ACG in A. tricolor were almost independent of the changes of IE, but were mainly attributable to the enhancement of ideal carbon gain (ICG) (Fig. 6b). The enhancement of ICG in A. tricolor was less than G. max. The transient iWUE of C4 plants were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of C3 plants under C+T+ treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S1). These ﬁndings suggest C3 plants will beneﬁ t more from the simultaneous eT and eCO 2 under the background of future climate change than C4 plants. The effects of the interaction of eT and eCO 2 on dynamic photosynthesis The eﬀects of simultaneously eT and eCO 2 on T50%A, T90%A, ACG 60 min and IE60 min in G. max were lower than the sum of the sole eﬀect of eT and eCO 2, indicating that the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on photosynthetic induction were partially oﬀset. We hypothesised that this ﬁnding was a result of an oﬀset in the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on stomatal behaviour. Elevating CO2 decreased the gs600 but promoted the rate of the increases in gs during induction, both of which shortened the time required for stomatal opening (Fig. 1e). The eﬀects of eCO 2 on stomatal behaviour observed in this study were consistent with previous reports (Kaiser et al. 2017 b). In contrast, eT increased the gs600 and promoted the rate of the increases in gs during induction; yet the eﬀect of the latter dominated over that of the former. We were not clear on the mechanism that underlies the increases of gs600 under eT. An increases of the guard cell metabolic activity or of the evaporative demand under eT could drive the increases of gs600. The interaction of eT and eCO 2 had no inﬂuences on T50%A, T90%A and IE60 min in A. tricolor . The eﬀect s of simultaneously eT and eCO 2 on A600 in G. max were in close proximity to the sum of the sole eﬀect of eT and eCO 2 and the eﬀects of simultaneously eT and eCO 2 on A600 in A. tricolor are higher than the sum of t h es o l ee ﬀect of eT and eCO 2.T h e s e ﬁndings are diﬀerent from some studies, where eT inhibited the positive eﬀect of eCO 2 on steady-state photosynthetic rate and photosyn-thetic eﬃciency (Lambreva et al. 2005; Cai et al. 2016). In contrast, Sage and Kubien (2003) found that the eﬀects of eCO 2 on C3 and C4 photosynthesis were greater at warmer than at cooler temperatures . Some studies have also found the enhancement of photosynthesis by eCO 2 is larger at higher temperature (Long 1991; Morison and Lawlor 1999 ). 1003 T. Zheng et al. Functional Plant Biology Table 3.

That is because eCO 2 suppresses photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration in C3 plants, expanding the photosynthetic thermal optimum range (Long 1991; Way et al. 2015). Low steady-state photosynthetic rate in A. tricolor In general, the steady state photosynthetic rate of C4 plants is higher than that of C3 plants. A lower A600 in A. tricolor than that in G. max in this study may result from the low growth light intensity. Due to biochemical and energetic Photosynthetic rate was reduced to a greater extent in low light in the six C4 grasses relative to the two C3 species, and C4 grasses also tended to have a lower stomatal conductance and stomatal aperture than C3 species (Israel et al. 2022 ). However, C4 plants grown in low light or medium light still have a large metabolites pool because BSC leakiness was found to be similar for C4 plants grown in diﬀerent light intensity (Pengelly et al. 2010 ; Bellasio and Griﬃths 2014 ; Ma et al. 2017 ). Above researches suggest that the CCM is still robust and the biochemical eﬃciency of the C4 cycle does not decrease for C4 plants grown in low light or medium light. Therefore, the low growth light intensity may have little inﬂuences on the eﬀects of eT, eCO 2, and their interaction on photosynthetic induction in A. tricolor observed in our study. Conclusion By examining dynamic photosynthesis under four diﬀerent temperature and [CO 2] treatments, this study showed that for G.max, the T50%A and T90%A were signiﬁcantly aﬀected by eT and eCO 2; whereas for A. tricolor , they were almost unaﬀected by eT or eCO 2. This study suggests that the eﬀects of eT and eCO 2 on photosynthetic induction were partially oﬀset in C3 plants and greater enhancement of photosynthesis in ﬂuctuating light for C3 plants than for C4 plants in a warming and CO2-enriched future. More research is needed to address how the interaction of eT and eCO 2 inﬂuences dynamic photosynthesis in future experiments. Supplementary material Supplementary material is available online .
