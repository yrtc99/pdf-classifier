Saleska8, Virginia i. rich2 & Gene W . t yson1*As global temperatures rise, large amounts of carbon sequestered in permafrost are becoming available for microbial degradation. Accurate prediction of carbon gas emissions from thawing permafrost is limited by our understanding of these microbial communities. Here we use metagenomic sequencing of 214 samples from a permafrost thaw gradient to recover 1,529 metagenome-assembled genomes, including many from phyla with poor genomic representation. These genomes reflect the diversity of this complex ecosystem, with genus-level representatives for more than sixty per cent of the community. Meta-omic analysis revealed key populations involved in the degradation of organic matter, including bacteria whose genomes encode a previously undescribed fungal pathway for xylose degradation. Microbial and geochemical data highlight lineages that correlate with the production of greenhouse gases and indicate novel syntrophic relationships. Our findings link changing biogeochemistry to specific microbial lineages involved in carbon processing, and provide key information for predicting the effects of climate change on permafrost systems.Permafrost thaw induced by climate change is predicted to make up to 174 Pg of near-surface carbon (less than 3 m below the surface) avail -able for microbial degradation by 21001. Prediction of the magnitude of carbon loss as carbon dioxide (CO 2) or methane (CH 4) is hampered by our limited knowledge of microbial metabolism of organic matter  in these environments. Genome-centric metagenomic analysis of microbial communities provides the necessary information to examine how specific lineages transform organic matter during permafrost thaw. However, these methods are challenged by the inherent complexity and spatial heterogeneity of near-surface soil communities that sup -port diverse functional processes2–4. Previous metagenomic studies in  permafrost-associated soils from Alaskan tundra5,6 and a mineral  soil permafrost7 recovered a small number (14–33) of metagenome-  assembled genomes (MAGs), which represent only a fraction of the species present in these systems. However, the ability to recover MAGs from complex microbial communities is continually improving in parallel with advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatic techniques8,9.Recovery and distribution of MAGsThe discontinuous permafrost at Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden is a model Arctic peatland ecosystem for studying thaw progression10. To gain an understanding of the microbial communities at this site and their associated carbon metabolism, soil samples were collected from the active layer (seasonally thawed) of three sites across a thaw gradient: an intact palsa (thawed to approximately 30 cm), a partially thawed bog (approximately 60 cm), and a fully thawed fen. Although bogs and fens exist in diverse landscapes, thaw-associated shifts in hydrology cause them to be a common feature of thawing northern peatland perma -frost systems (see Methods). Triplicate soil cores and biogeochemical  measurements were taken at each site from four active layer depths (near surface, mid, deep and extra-deep; 1–51 cm; Fig.  1, Supplementary Data 1) over three growing seasons. In total, 1.7 Tb of metagenomic sequence data were generated from 214 samples (2–165  Gb per sample), with supporting metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data from a subset of these samples (Supplementary Data 1, 2). Metagenome assembly and differential coverage binning yielded 1,529 medium- to high-quality MAGs (more than 70% complete and less than 10% contaminated) from a diverse range of bacterial (1,434 genomes) and archaeal phyla (95 genomes; Extended Data Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 3). The Stordalen Mire MAGs expand the number of genomes recovered from permafrost-associated soils by two orders of magnitude.To resolve the taxonomic distribution of the Stordalen Mire MAGs, phylogenetic trees were inferred from concatenated sets of single-copy marker genes (120 bacterial or 122 archaeal genes). The recovered MAGs spanned 30 phyla, including Bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria (385 genomes), Acidobacteria (364), Proteobacteria (205) and Chloroflexi (66), and Archaea from the Euryarchaeota (85). The Stordalen genomes substantially expand representation of  several common soil-dwelling lineages (Extended Data Fig. 1), such as the ubiquitous Acidobacteria, for which genomic representation was increased threefold. MAGs were also recovered from many poorly char -acterized phyla, including 47 genomes from the bacterial candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota (AD3), 53 from Eremiobacteraeota (WPS-2), six from FCPU426 and eight archaea from the Bathyarchaeota (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 10, 11). The Stordalen genomes broadly represent the major groups present in the  system (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b) as well as many lineages previously detected in other permafrost-associated environments6,11.

The Stordalen MAGs represent about 60% of microorganisms in the mire at the genus level (Supplementary Note 2), making this, to our knowledge, the most  comprehensive recovery of genomes from a complex, natural soil  environment to date.Stordalen genomes were explicitly linked to the changing  habitats by mapping their abundances across the thaw gradient  (Fig.  1, Supplementary Data 4). Communities shifted substan -tially between sites (Extended Data Fig. 2c), with MAGs belong -ing to the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Eremiobacteraeota, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria predominant in the palsa and bog (5–41% of the community), whereas Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Ignavibacteriae were almost exclusively observed in the fen (8–14%; Extended Data Fig. 2e, f). The extra-deep bog samples had the lowest diversity (Shannon index 3.74  ± 0.24; Fig. 1), potentially owing to the ombrotrophic and anaerobic conditions in this environment, whereas the shallow samples from the minero -trophic fen were the most diverse (Shannon index 4.55  ± 0.05; Fig.  1). The fen also had 2.6 times more microbial cells per gram of soil relative to the palsa and bog (Extended Data Fig. 2d). In the bog, decreasing oxygen availability with depth is likely to drive changes in community structure, with Euryarchaeota and Dormibacteraeota increasing in  relative abundance with depth, and Eremiobacteraeota decreasing. In the fen, the Planctomycetes, Omnitrophica and Spirochaetes increased in abundance with depth (Extended Data Fig. 2e, f). Consistent with the heterogeneity of soil environments12,13, individual MAGs were typically found only at high abundance (over 1%) in a limited number of samples (fewer than 4). However, a small number of MAGs belonging to the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota were ubiquitous at specific depths within the palsa, bog or fen (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Table 1). For several genera, closely related MAGs were abundant at different depths (Extended Data Fig. 3c), reflecting fine-scale adaptation to distinct niches in the soil column.Polysaccharide degradationMetabolic reconstruction of the MAGs, combined with 24 metatran -scriptome and 16 metaproteome datasets (Extended Data Table 2), allowed examination of the key microorganisms, pathways and inter -actions responsible for organic matter degradation and the produc -tion of greenhouse gases at Stordalen Mire (Fig.  2; Supplementary Data 1). The first stage in degradation involves the breakdown of high-  molecular-weight plant-derived polysaccharides, primarily cellulose and hemicellulose, which make up a large proportion of peatland  carbon14. The ability to degrade these polysaccharides was a dominant  feature of the Stordalen MAGs across all three thaw environments (Supplementary Data 5; Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’ and ‘distribution box plots’), with many encoding cellulases and xylanases (39% and 37%, respectively; average 3.8 and 2.6 copies per genome). This is consistent with gene-centric metagenomic studies of Arctic fens and tundras15,16; however, the genome-centric approach used here links these metabolic functions to specific populations.Cellulase- and xylanase-encoding microorganisms, primarily belonging to the Acidobacteria (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’), were most abundant in the palsa surface (68% and 59% of the recovered  community, respectively), and decreased with depth (Fig.  2 ‘distribution  box plots’). The surface bog had the lowest percentage of micro-organisms encoding these genes (34% and 24%, respectively), probably  owing to breakdown inhibition through the production of acids by Sphagnum  moss17.

Metatranscriptomic data confirmed these genomic inferences,  with Acidobacteria producing the majority of cellulase and xylanase transcripts at these sites (Extended Data Fig. 4). Metaproteomic analysis revealed protein expression for 45 cellulases and 27 xylanases primar -ily belonging to Acidobacteria in the bog (Supplementary Data 2). A wider range of microorganisms are responsible for this functionality in the fen, including members of the Proteobacteria, Ignavibacteriae, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria. However, the metatranscriptomic data indicate that the Proteobacteria, Ignavibacteriae and Bacteroidetes have the highest expression of these genes in the fen, although only a limited number of proteins were detected. Notably, most putative cellulose hydrolysers also encode a xylanase (59% of genomes), with the exception of actinobacterial hydrolysers, which typically encode only cellulases (87%). However, unlike findings in other Arctic systems18, both metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data show that the actinobacterial cellulases are not highly expressed, indicating that these microorganisms play a minor role in polysaccharide degradation at Stordalen Mire. The high abundance of hydrolysers in the palsa suggests that the microbial com -munity contributes to physical compaction through decomposition of surface organic matter, as evidenced by increases in bulk density with depth (Supplementary Note 3), and that this contribution is likely to augment thawing of underlying permafrost as the primary driver of subsidence.Fig. 2 | Carbon metabolism across the thaw gradient.

The metaproteomes supported the high expression of β -glucosidase proteins by Acidobacteria in the bog (198 out of a total of 216 detected proteins). Degradation pathways for the monosaccharides glucose, galactose and xylose were also prevalent in the MAGs (Supplementary Note 4, Extended Data Fig. 5). Of the 237 microorganisms potentially capable of xylan degradation, 108 appear to be involved in xylose degradation using the canonical bacterial isomer -ase pathway19 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These genomes were common in the surface palsa (40% of the microbial community), deep bog (49%) and throughout the fen (51%), similar to the distribution of micro-organisms capable of degrading the precursor xylan. Transcription of this pathway in the fen was highest by Bacteroidetes and Ignavibacteriae (Fig.  2 ‘pathway expression’; Extended Data Fig. 6). Members of the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia showed highest  transcription of this pathway in the bog, whereas expression was  limited to Actinobacteria in the palsa (Extended Data Fig. 6c–h). Notably, 50 actinobacterial MAGs encoded genes necessary for xylose degradation, despite 44 being unable to degrade the precursor xylan, indicating that they are reliant on the activity of xylan hydrolysers.Only a small fraction of the dominant acidobacterial xylan hydro -lysers encode the necessary genes for the canonical isomerase pathway for xylose degradation (30 out of 111 genomes). Few acidobacterial genomes (23) encoded the alternative xylonate dehydratase pathway, indicating that they might degrade xylose through a membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase, as previously observed only in Gluconobacter oxydans20 (Supplementary Note 5). A closer inspection of acido-bacterial xylan-hydrolysing MAGs revealed an oxidoreductase pathway  for the conversion of xylose into xylulose, previously identified only in fungi21–23 (37 genomes; Supplementary Note 5). MAGs belonging  to the Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi also encoded this pathway, together comprising 13% of the community across the thaw gradient. Acidobacterial and actinobacterial genes for the oxidoreductase pathway were expressed in metatranscriptomes from across the mire, and were more highly expressed than the canonical isomerase pathway in both the palsa and bog (Fig.  2 ‘pathway expression’ , Extended Data Fig. 6c–h). Nine MAGs expressed proteins for this pathway, primarily in the bog, confirming that this novel pathway is in use and is likely to account for a substantial fraction of xylose degradation at the mire (Supplementary Data 2). The detection and expression of several distinct pathways for xylose degradation, often occurring in the same genome (Extended Data  Fig. 6b), reveals that one or multiple pathways may be active under  specific environmental conditions (Supplementary Note 5).FermentationIn the anaerobic layers of the peat column, where inorganic terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) are rare24,25, fermentation and acetogenesis are essential pathways for the further degradation of monosaccharides, and supply the substrates for methanogenesis. Fermentation produces low-molecular-weight alcohols and organic acids such as ethanol, pro -pionate, acetate and lactate, as well as hydrogen and carbon dioxide24,26. In the palsa and bog, lactate fermentation is a common metabolism encoded by actinobacterial and acidobacterial MAGs (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’), which are particularly abundant in the bog surface (36% and 16% of the community, respectively), but decrease with depth (Fig.  2 ‘distribution box plots’). Transcript expression of this pathway, while low across all sites, appears to be mostly limited to these lineages in the bog (Extended Data Fig. 7). Conversely, populations belonging to the Chloroflexi, Ignavibacteriae, Bacteriodetes, and Proteobacteria appear to be the primary lactate metabolizers in the fen (9%, 7%, 5% and 5%, respectively), with Ignavibacteriae the most transcriptionally active (Extended Data Fig. 7). A small fraction of Stordalen genomes are capable of ethanol and propionate fermentation (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’), and expression of these pathways is low and mainly limited to the palsa and bog (Extended Data Fig. 7). The abundance of these microorganisms in the palsa suggests that they are potentially important fermenters during the early stages of thaw (Fig.  2 ‘distribu -tion box plots’). Acetogens were most abundant in the fen across all depths, which suggests increased acetate production and is consistent with a preference for pH-neutral environments24,25 (Fig.  2 ‘distribution box plots’). Fen acetogens belong to the Ignavibacteriae, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia, whereas in the palsa and bog this metabolism was limited to a small number of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’). These distributions were also observed in the metatranscriptomes (Extended Data Fig. 7), with Bacteroidetes, Ignavibacteriae and Proteobacteria contributing to the slightly higher expression of acetogenesis transcripts in the fen, com -pared to expression by Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia in the bog (Extended Data Fig. 7). While acetate can be oxidized using available inorganic TEAs27 (for example, sulphate or nitrate), these are at very low concentrations in Stordalen Mire (Supplementary Data 6). The unexpectedly high ratio of CO 2 to CH 4 produced at the site28 (16:1 in the bog and 7:1 in the fen; Extended Data Fig. 8a) may signal the oxi -dation of fermentation products including acetate using organic TEAs such as humic substances27,29,30.Methane metabolismMethanogenesis is the final step in anaerobic carbon transformation and is of critical concern in thawing permafrost peatland systems where CH 4 release is increasing rapidly31. Of the 95 archaeal genomes recovered  (Extended Data Fig. 1), 76 were identified as hydrogenotrophic  methanogens (H 2- and CO 2-utilizing), which alongside high transcript and protein expression (Extended Data Fig. 8d, e) suggests that this is the dominant form of CH 4 generation at the mire. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased in abundance, diversity and activity as thaw progressed from bog to fen (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’), consistent with the increase in CH 4 flux10, with mid- and deep-fen samples having the highest relative abundance of these methanogens (Fig.  2 ‘distri -bution box plots’). Only six low-abundance acetoclastic methanogens were recovered, primarily from the fen, where acetogenesis was also prevalent (Fig.  2 ‘MAG abundances’). In addition, two H 2-dependent methylotrophic methanogens from the order Methanomassiliicoccales  were recovered, but were present at very low abundance (0.1% in the fen) with low transcriptional activity, making it unlikely that they contribute substantially to CH4 production at the mire (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Methanotrophs from the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were identified across the thaw gradient. High abundances in the bog suggest that methanotrophs may oxidize  substantial proportions of CH 4, limiting emissions to the atmosphere (Supplementary Note 6).Microbial and geochemical interactionsThe activity of methanogens and methanotrophs alters the 13C/12C iso -topic ratio of CH 4 dissolved in the porewater32. A previous 16S rRNA gene amplicon survey at Stordalen Mire revealed that the abundance of Candidatus  (Ca.) ‘Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis’ was the best single  predictor of carbon isotopic fractionation during CH 4 production at the bog in 201133,34. The recovery of 51 additional genomes here greatly expands the representation of the order Ca . ‘Methanoflorentales’ , and revealed the presence of two habitat-specific clades derived from the bog and fen, respectively (80–85% average amino acid identity (AAI); Ca. ‘M. stordalenmirensis’ from the bog and Ca . ‘Methanoflorens crillii’ from the fen). The 16S rRNA gene-based correlation of Ca . ‘M.  stordalenmirensis’ to the isotopic signature of CH 4 was confirmed by the metagenomic data for both 2011 and 2012, with the relative abundance of 19 Ca. ‘M. stordalenmirensis’ MAGs in the bog explaining more  variation than bulk environmental variables (2011 R2 = 0.43, P = 6 × 10−4; 2012 R2 = 0.48, P = 2 × 10−4; Extended Data Fig. 8c, e).  Notably, the relative abundance of a previously uncharacterized  52 | NA tUre  | VO l 560 | 2 AUGUS t 2018© 2018 Springer Nature Limited. All rights reserved.Article reSeArcHacidobacterial population, Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens stordalenmirensis’ , was sig -nificantly correlated with the isotopic composition of CH 4 (R2 = 0.40, P = 2 × 10−6), and even more strongly correlated with the relative abun -dance of Ca . ‘M. stordalenmirensis’ (R2 = 0.82, P < 2 × 10−16 in bog sites; Fig.  3, Supplementary Note 7).A detailed metabolic analysis of Ca . ‘ A. stordalenmirensis’ and the 49 other genomes belonging to the genus Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ revealed metabolic capabilities that suggest that members of this lineage are facultative syntrophs (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Members of Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ contain genes for the fermentation of a wide range of substrates including xylan, fatty acids, oxalate and fructose, and encode numerous hydrogenases, indicating the potential for H 2 production and consumption (Fig.  3d, Supplementary Note 8). We hypothesize that the correlation between Ca . ‘ A. stordalenmirensis’ and Ca . ‘M. stordalenmirensis’ and the CH 4 isotopic composition indicates that these lineages are in a syntrophic relationship based on inter-species hydrogen transfer. Hydrogen consumption by Ca . ‘M. stordalenmiren -sis’ is likely to lower the hydrogen partial pressure and thereby make fermentation more thermodynamically favourable for Ca . ‘ A. stord -alenmirensis’35,36 (Fig.  3d). This syntrophy is also observed in the fen sites between closely related populations, as the relative abundances of a Ca. ‘Methanoflorens’ species (Ca . ‘M. crillii’; see above) and a second Ca. ‘ Acidiflorens’ species (Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ sp. 2), both of which are detected only in the fen, were also correlated (R2 = 0.19, P = 1 × 10−4; Fig. 3c). The species-level resolution afforded by the genome-centric metagenomic approach allowed identification of potential interactions between microorganisms and biogeochemistry that would have been missed using traditional gene amplicon surveys.Another key but poorly constrained biogeochemical parameter in global CH 4 models37 is the percentage of carbon mineralized to  CO 2 versus CH 4. We directly examined the relationship of microbial lineages in the bog with the porewater CH 4:CO 2 ratio and identified a significant positive correlation with a genus within the candidate  phylum Dormibacteraeota38, named here Ca . ‘Changshengia’ (R2 = 0.19, P = 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 9a, c). Ca . ‘Changshengia’ was found to oxidize glycerol, an important cryoprotectant in this Arctic environment39,40, and its derivatives glycerol 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone. On the basis of the transcript and protein expression of genes for glycerol oxidation (Extended Data Fig. 9b, Supplementary Note 9), it is possible that Ca . ‘Changshengia’ ferments glycerol lead -ing to the production41 of H 2, which is transferred to methanogens, increasing the CH 4 to CO 2 ratio in the porewater.ConclusionHere, genome-centric metagenomic analysis of a permafrost  thaw gradient allowed the recovery of 1,529 MAGs, substantially increasing the number of genomes sequenced from permafrost- associated environments. Analysis of these genomes and their  abundances and expression enabled us to identify correlations between specific microbial populations and biogeochemistry, and revealed Fig. 3 | Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ geochemical correlations and metabolic reconstruction.  a, Correlation of relative abundances of Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens stordalenmirensis’ with δ13C of porewater CH 4 in bog sites. b , Correlation of the relative abundances of Ca . ‘Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis’ and Ca. ‘ Acidiflorens stordalenmirensis’ in bog samples. c , Correlation of the relative abundances of Ca . ‘Methanoflorens crillii’ and Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ sp. 2 in fen samples. d , Metabolic reconstruction of Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ .

All rights reserved.Article reSeArcHMEthodSStudy site.  As described previously34, Stordalen Mire is a peatland in northern Sweden (68 22ʹ N, 19 03ʹ E), 10 km southeast of Abisko. The three sub-habitats of the study site are common to northern wetlands, and together cover ~98% of Stordalen Mire’s non-lake surface10. These proceed from well-drained palsas underlain by permafrost, and dominated by ericaceous and woody plants, to intermediate-thaw bogs with variable water table depth, dominated by Sphagnum  spp. mosses, to fully thawed and inundated fens dominated by sedges such as Eriophorum angustifolium . A thaw-associated shift in these habitats was docu-mented between 1970 and 2000, as palsa collapsed and bogs and fens expanded by 3% and 54%, respectively10. These habitats exist in an intermingled mosaic, as is common in discontinuous permafrost zones, and the specific palsa, bog and fen that were sampled in this study are directly adjacent such that all cores were collected within a 120 m radius.This formation of wetlands after permafrost thaw is a widespread characteristic of peatlands affected by permafrost loss42–45. As frozen ground thaws it collapses, forming bogs and fens. Where this subsidence increases hydrologic connectivity, as at Stordalen, it can create a progression from ombrotrophic bogs to minerotrophic fens. A similar successional shift from bogs dominated by Sphagnum  spp. to tall sedge fens has been observed in other northern peatlands42,43,46,47. The uncertainty surrounding the extent and characteristics of wetland formation from permafrost thaw is a critical limitation to modelling and understanding carbon–climate feedbacks48,49. Improved characterization of post-thaw microbial communities and carbon transformation processes, as advanced in this study, can directly address this uncertainty.Geochemistry.  Across the thaw chronosequence, porewater CH 4 and CO 2 meas -urements and their 13C isotopic composition were sampled as described previ -ously28. The δ13C-CH 4 is affected by the δ13C-CO 2, because of the use or production of CO 2 during CH 4 generation, so the isotopic fractionation factor is used to report the isotopic separation of CH 4 and carbon dioxide50. The α C value reports the effective fractionation of C in CH 4, as the δ13C-CH 4 relative to source material  represented by δ13C-CO 2. The effective fractionation factor of carbon in the  porewater CH 4 relative to CO 2 (αC) was calculated as described previously33,50.αδδ=−+−+CC O1 ,000CC H1 ,000c132134DNA extraction and metagenome sequencing.  DNA extractions were under -taken as described previously34, with additional extractions from samples taken in 2012. Metagenome sequencing was performed for 2011 and 2012 using 100 ng of the DNA in TruSeq Nano (Illumina) library preparation. For low concentration DNA samples, libraries were created using 1 ng of DNA with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). 2012 libraries were sequenced on 1/12th of an Illumina HiSeq2000 lane producing 100 bp paired-end reads, although some 2012 and 2011 samples were selected for deeper sequencing. Libraries from 2011 were sequenced 1/24th of an Illumina NextSeq, producing 150 bp paired end reads. See Supplementary Data 1 for details of sequencing depth per sample.Quantitative real-time PCR . A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was performed on selected samples to quantify microbial load. After pre-diluting 1/100, PCR was set up using 5 µl of 2×  SYBR Green/AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase mix (Life Technologies, Applied Biosystems), 4 µl of microbial template DNA and 1 µl of primer mix. The 16S 1406F/1525R primer set (0.4 µM) was designed to amplify bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes:  F - GYACWCACCGCCCGT and R - AAGGAGGTGWTCCARCC. The rpsL F/R primer set (0.2 µM), used for inhibition control, amplifies Escherichia coli  DH10B only: F - GTAAAGTATGCCGTGTTCGT and R - AGCCTGCTTACGGTCTTTA. Three dilutions, 1/100, 1/500 and 1/1,000 (microbial template DNA, 16S 1406F/1525R primer set) as well as an inhibition control (E. coli DH10B genomic DNA, rpsL primer set), were run in triplicate for each sample. The PCR was run on the ViiA7 platform (Applied Biosystems) including a cycle of 10  min at 95  °C (AmpliTaq activation) and 40 cycles of (15 s at 95 °C followed by 20 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C). A melt curve was produced by running a cycle of 2  min at 95  °C and a last cycle of 15 s at 60 °C. The cycle threshold (C t) values were recorded and analysed using ViiA7 v1.2 software.CopyRighter51 v0.46 was applied to qPCR counts to correct for 16S copy number  variation. CopyRighter normalizes the relative abundances across OTUs for each sample after dividing by the estimated copy number in a pre-computed table. The OTU genomic abundance is then obtained by multiplying by the total abun-dance number. A new CopyRighter database table was generated for the 2013 GreenGenes taxonomy (Supplementary Data 8), with copy number estimates for leaf OTUs as the average copy number of IMG version 4.1 genomes mapped to GreenGenes genomes and clustered at 99% sequence identity, and for higher  taxonomic levels inferred copy numbers for the clade common ancestor. The inferred copy numbers for higher taxonomies were propagated to descendent  lineages without known copy numbers.SingleM . To determine microbiome diversity and community structure, SingleM was applied to reads from each sample (B.J.W . et al., unpublished materials, source code available at https://github.com/wwood/singlem).Diversity calculations.  Shannon diversity52 was calculated based on SingleM counts, rarefying to 100 sequences per marker gene when > 100 sequences were detected and excluding samples otherwise. Vegan53 was used to calculate the diver -sity given the rarefied SingleM OTU table across each of the 15 marker genes, and the average was plotted in Fig.  1.Genome assembly and binning.  Each sample’s reads were assembled individually using CLC Genomics Workbench version 4.4 (CLC Genomics) with an estimated insert size of 50–500, generating 214 assemblies. Differential coverage binning was undertaken by mapping all reads from each sample of site (palsa, bog or fen) to all assemblies of that site, using BamM ‘make’ (M. Imelfort, unpublished mate-rials, http://ecogenomics.github.io/BamM/) version 1.3.8-1.5.0, BW A 0.7.1254, samtools55, and GNU parallel56. Each sample’s scaffolds were then binned using MetaBAT 3127e20aa4e757 using the sample’s contigs and each of the BAM files as points of differential coverage.The CheckM58 v1.0.4 ‘lineage_wf ’ pipeline was used to determine completeness and contamination of the MAG bins through the identification and quantifica -tion of single-copy marker genes, making use of pplacer 1.1 alpha 1659. Genomes estimated to be more than 70% complete and less than 10% contaminated were designated the ‘Stordalen MAGs’ .MAG dereplication and taxonomic classification . When calculating relative abundance, to alleviate multi-mapping issues, genomes were first dereplicated at 97% average nucleotide identity (ANI). First, amino acid identity was calculated between all genomes using the CompareM (v0.0.17) AAI workflow (‘comparem aai_wf ’ , D. H. Parks, unpublished materials, https://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM ). Genomes with an AAI of > 95% were compared with each other using ‘calculate_ani.py’ (L. Pritchard, unpublished materials, https://github.com/widdowquinn/scripts ). Genomes with > 97% ANI over > 70% alignment were clustered together using single-linkage clustering, and the genome with highest quality in each cluster was chosen as the representative, where quality was cal -culated as ‘completeness – 4 × contamination’ , as estimated by CheckM above. The cluster representative for each recovered MAG is provided in Supplementary Data 3. The CompareM AAI workflow was also used to determine average amino acid identities between cluster representatives to determine the specific clades (Supplementary Note 7).Genome tree and phylogenetic inference of 1,529 population bins.  Phylogenetic inference was conducted in order to classify the MAG bins and used an in-house pipeline described in detail previously60, the genome taxonomy database (GTDB v2.1.15)92. In brief, sets of 122 archaeal and 120 bacterial specific single-copy marker genes were used to infer domain-specific trees incorporating the 1,529 MAGs, a reference set of genomes from NCBI (RefSeq61 release 80), and the recently published UBA genomes62. The concatenated alignment of these marker genes was created using HMMER v3.1.b2, and used as a basis for FastTree v2.1.963 tree building under the W AG + GAMMA model and using the approximately maximum likelihood method. This tree was then bootstrapped using genometreetk  v0.0.35 (D. H. Parks, unpublished materials, https://github.com/dparks1134/GenomeTreeTk), calculating bootstrap support from 100 FastTree iterations. The associated taxonomy was derived using NCBI annotations, and was used to decorate the tree using tax2tree64 and adjusted manually. Trees were visualized in ARB v6.0.665, and exported into ITOL66 for further refinements before final editing in Inkscape. For the overall Bacteria and Archaea tree the dereplicated set of 647 genomes were selected in ARB and exported for viewing in ITOL. For the Acidobacteria tree (Extended Data Fig. 1b), Aminicenantes, including two Stordalen MAGs, and the recently reported Ca . ‘Fischerbacteria’9 were included as likely classes within the Acidobacteria based on GTDB analysis (http://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). The bootstrapped Newick trees for the overall Bacteria and Archaea trees are found in Supplementary Data 10 and 11, using the alignments from Supplementary Data 12 and 13. Phylogenetic gain (Fig.  1, Extended Data Fig. 1) was calculated using genometreetk pd_clade, and based on the added  phylogenetic distances introduced to current phyla (comprising RefSeq release 80 and UBA genomes) by including the 1,529 Stordalen MAGs.Calculation of relative abundance.  To calculate the relative abundance of each genome in each lineage, reads from each sample were mapped to the set of  dereplicated genomes using BamM ‘make’ . Low quality mappings were removed with BamM v1.7.3 ‘filter’ (minimum identity 95%, minimum aligned length 75% of each read) and the coverage of each contig calculated with BamM ‘parse’ using ‘tpmean’ mode, so calculating the coverage as the mean of the number of reads aligned to each position, after removing the highest 10% and lowest 10% of  positions. The coverage of each MAG was calculated as the average of contig  coverages, weighting each contig by its length in base pairs. The relative abundance of each lineage in each sample was calculated as its coverage divided by the total coverage of all genomes in the dereplicated set.© 2018 Springer Nature Limited. All rights reserved.Article reSeArcHGenomes that were differentially abundant by depth.  To determine which  lineages were differentially abundant between surface and deep samples, the set of relative abundances from each surface sample was compared to the set of relative  abundances in the deep samples. The mean and statistical significance of the  difference was calculated use R v3.3.267. To determine the average amino acid identity between pairs of samples, the ‘aai_wf ’ of CompareM v0.0.7 (D. H. Parks, unpublished materials, https://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM) was used using the protein sequences predicted by Prokka as input.Annotation.  Gene calling and preliminary annotation were undertaken with Prokka 1.1168. The genome was either annotated as Archaea or Bacteria, based in an inferred domain derived from the genome tree detailed above.Annotation of glycoside hydrolase genes.  All proteins predicted from all recovered genomes were screened using HMMSEARCH69 using the dbCAN HMMs v570, using default parameters, then results post-processed to remove hits with e  > 1 × 10–18 and HMM coverage of < 0.35, where coverage was calculated as (hmm_  to - hmm_from/qlen). Any genes with a hit passing these thresholds was then mapped to an EC number71 using DIAMOND v0.8.27.8972, with a database of all genes annotated with a fully defined (four number) E.C. number. This database of E.C. annotated genes was generated by gathering a list of GenBank identifiers of all characterized genes from each CAZy webpage73 (listed at http://www.cazy.org/Glycoside-Hydrolases.html ) using a custom Ruby script and then downloading the corresponding protein sequences from GenBank.Annotation of carbon metabolism . Annotation was undertaken using in-house scripts, which assign KEGG orthology to each gene via HMMs, taking the best hit and requiring an e <1 × 10–5. Encoding of whole pathways was inferred from genomes through the application of KEGG modules, both those available from KEGG as well as a number of custom modules (Supplementary Data 9).Etymology .

The delineation of genus is based on average  amino acid identity between encoded proteins.Description of ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorentales’ order nov.‘Candidatus  Methanoflorentales’ (N.L. masc. adj. ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorens’ , type genus of the order; suff. –ales, ending to denote an order; N.L. fem. pl. n. ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorentales’ the order of the genus ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorens’).The description is the same as given for the type genus ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorens’ and the family ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorentaceae’ Mondav et al. (2014) with the following modifications. The delineation of the order is determined by phylogenetic analyses showing that the Methanocellales would otherwise be paraphyletic. The order currently comprises two species ‘Candidatus  M. stordalen -mirensis’ and ‘Candidatus  M. crillii’ . The type genus is ‘Candidatus  Methanoflorens’ .Production and consumption rates of methane.  Per-cell methane production and consumption rates were taken from studies of isolate cultures (for production74–76 0.19–4.5 fmol CH 4 cell–1 h–1 and for consumption77–79 0.2–40 fmol CH 4 cell–1 h–1). Rates were taken as the mean of these rates for production and consumption rates, respectively.Bulk density measurements.  Data are from one palsa core sample taken from July 2013. In the field, 50 cm3 aliquots of fresh peat from each core section were removed and frozen. In the laboratory, each 50 cm3 section of peat was weighed, freeze dried and then reweighed. Bulk densities were determined gravimetrically and calculated from the freeze-dried weights of the volumetric sections. Water contents were determined by the per cent change in weight of the peat before and after freeze-drying.Metatranscriptomics.  Metatranscriptome sequencing was conducted on select samples from 2010, 2011 and 2012, comprising four palsa, eight bog and twelve fen samples. ScriptSeq Complete (Bacterial) low-input library preparation kits (Epicentre) were used with 240 ng of sample RNA that had been co-extracted along -side the DNA from the initial sample material as input as described previously. DNAse I (Roche) was used to remove residual DNA from the RNA after extractions. Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Agilent 2200 Tapestation (Agilent Technologies) were used to check the quality of RNA and libraries during processing, with Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific) used to determine quantity. These samples were run on 1/8th of a NextSeq (Illumina) lane, with initial shallow runs conducted on 1/11th of a HiSeq (Illumina) and MiSeq (Illumina) lanes. Files originating from the same metatranscriptome libraries were concatenated before analysis.SeqPrep (J. A. St John, https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) was used to remove sequencing adaptors. PhiX contamination was removed by mapping the reads against the PhiX genome using BamM, and reads that aligned were removed. SortMeRNA v2.180 was used to remove non-coding RNA sequences (tRNA, tmRNA, 5S, 16S, 18S, 23S, 28S). To assign expression values to each gene, reads were first mapped in pairs to the dereplicated set of MAGs using BamM make, and filtered using BamM filter with cutoffs of 95% identity and 75% alignment. The count of reads mapped to each gene was calculated using DirSeq ( https://github.com/wwood/dirseq , internally using BEDTools81) based on any overlap of forward reads with the open reading frame of the gene, tabulating the sense and antisense mappings independently. To avoid the potential for DNA contamination of the RNA libraries to provide a misleading interpretation of a gene being expressed, the number of reads mapping in the sense direction were compared to the number mapping in the antisense direction using a one-sided binomial test. Genes with a significantly more reads mapping in the sense direction (P  < 0.05) were classified as ‘expressed’ . For each significantly expressed gene, the number of antisense reads was subtracted from the number of sense reads to correct for metagenome contamination. These normalized expression estimates were used to calculate the TPM score82, using only protein coding genes (CDS regions defined in the Prokka annotated GFF files) in each sample.Pathway expression was calculated as the average expression of the steps within a pathway. If a pathway step included an enzyme complex, the average expression of each subunit was used as the expression value of that step. If a reaction could be catalysed by more than one enzyme, or if multiple copies of an enzyme were encoded by a genome, then their summed expression was used as the expression value of that step.Metaproteomics.  Protein extraction, purification, and digestion.  Metaproteome analysis was conducted on 22 samples from 2012, collected from the same cores and depths as material used for metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Three metaproteomes were created by pooling replicate cores (3 × 3 replicates). Sample nomenclature denotes year and month, followed by habitat (P  = palsa, S =  bog, E = fen), core number (123 indicates replicate cores 1, 2 and 3 were pooled) and depth (surface = S, mid  = M, deep = D, extra-deep = X). The 16 resulting metaproteomes were as follows: four palsa (20120600_P123M, 20120700_P3M, 20120700_P3D, 20120800_P2M) six bog (20120600_S123M, 20120600_S123D, 20120700_S2M, 20120700_S1D, 20120800_S1M, 20120800_S1X), and six fen samples (20120700_E3M, 20120700_E3D, 20120700_E2X, 20120800_E2M, 20120800_E2D, 20120800_E3D) (Supplementary Data 1). Proteins were extracted and digested using substantial modifications of methods developed previously for our site34. In brief, samples were thawed and 35 g of peat per sample was split equally into two 50 ml tubes, and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-resuspension buffer was added to a final volume of 30 ml. SDS-resuspension buffer (pH 8) was freshly prepared as: (1) an SDS buffer of 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 10 ml of 4% SDS, (2) a separate resuspension buffer of 50  mM trisaminomethane (Tris) Buffer (2.21 g Trizma-HCl and 4.36 g Trizma Base (Millipore Sigma)), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and HPLC-grade water up to 1 l, (3) the 10 ml SDS buffer (warmed at 60 °C for 2 min) was mixed with 40 ml of resuspension buffer, and the final pH was adjusted to 8. Samples were vortexed for 10 min using a tabletop vortexer with adapters for 50 ml conical tubes, and then 10 g of 0.1 mM glass beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were added, followed by 30 min of vortexing. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000g  for 20 min, the supernatant transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 4,800g  for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, to which 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a final concentration of 30%. Samples were shaken and then stored at 4 °C overnight.Samples were centrifuged at 4,800g  for 1 h 30 min at 4 °C, and then supernatant was decanted and pellets from the same sample were combined. The following steps were repeated three times: pellets were washed with 1 ml cold acetone, placed on ice for 5 min, vortexed briefly, centrifuged at 24,000g  for 25 min at 4 °C, and then © 2018 Springer Nature Limited. All rights reserved.Article reSeArcHsupernatant was removed. Pellets were dried under N 2 gas, and then 1–1.5 ml of denaturing buffer was added. Denaturing buffer was prepared as follows:  (1) a digestion buffer was prepared with 4.88 g of Trizma-HCl, 2.30 g of Trizma Base, and 1.11 g of CaCl 2 brought to a 1 l volume with HPLC-grade water,  (2) guanidine-HCl was added to digestion buffer to a final concentration of 6 M in a 50-ml tube. Samples were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h, vortexing for 5 s every 10 min, then transferred to a new tube, to which digestion buffer was added to a final  volume of 15 ml. Proteins were digested by adding 20 µg trypsin (NEB) and  incubating on a nutating mixer at 37 °C overnight.A further 10 µg of trypsin was added to each sample, followed by incubation on a nutating mixer at 37 °C for 4 h. DTT was added (approximately 100 mg), then samples were returned to the 37 °C nutating mixer for 45 min and then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Similar to previously reported peptide purification protocols83, Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridges (Waters) were conditioned with 10 ml of acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid, then washed with 10 ml of 0.1% formic acid (in water), then the samples were added and the flow-through was refiltered through the cartridges three additional times, followed by a wash with 10 ml of 0.1% formic acid (in water). Peptides were eluted with 5 ml of acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid, then added to 0.45 µm Ultrafree-MC filter tubes according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore Sigma).Peptide fractionation and mass spectroscopy . A bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was performed to determine the peptide mass in each sample. The samples were then diluted with 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 (‘buffer A ’) to a volume of 930 µl, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2–5 min to remove any precipitates, and transferred to snap-cap ALS vials. The diluted samples (pH 10)  were resolved on a XBridge C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µ M with 4.6 × 20 mm guard column (Waters). Separations were performed at 0.5 ml/min using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with mobile phases (A) buffer A and (B) buffer A/acetonitrile (10:90). The gradient was adjusted from 100% A to 95% A over the first 10 min, 95% A to 65% A over minutes 10 to 70, 65% A to 30% A over minutes 70 to 85, maintained at 30% A over minutes 85 to 95, re-equilibrated with 100% A over minutes 95 to 105, and held at 100% A until minute 120. Fractions were collected every 1.25  min (96 fractions over the entire gradient) and every 12th fraction were pooled for a total of 12 fractions per sample. All fractions were dried under vacuum and 20 µl of nanopure water was added to each fraction for storage at –20 °C until LC–MS/MS analysis.Fractions were analysed by reversed-phase LC–MS/MS using a Waters nanoAquity UPLC system coupled with a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole/Orbitrap mass spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The analytical  column was packed in-house by slurry packing 3-µ m Jupiter C 18 stationary phase (Phenomenex) into a 70-cm long, 360 µm OD × 75 µm ID fused silica capillary tubing  (Polymicro Technologies Inc.). Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (MP-A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (MP-B). Samples were adjusted to a concentration of ~ 0.1 µg/µl and 5 µl injections were directly loaded onto the analytical column at a flow rate of 300 nl/min and 1% MP-B. The full loading, gradient elution, and column regeneration profile was as follows (min:%MP-B); 0:1, 30:1, 32:8, 50:12, 105:30, 110:45, 120:90, 125:90, 130:1, 170:1. Data acquisi -tion (100 min) was started at the end of the sample loading period (30 min). The analytical column was coupled to the Q-Exactive using a home-built nanospray adaptor interface with 2.2 kV applied to achieve electrospray ionization. The MS inlet was maintained at a temperature of 300 °C. A precursor scan was performed from m/z 300 to 1800 at a resolution of 30k and an automatic gain control (AGC) of 3 × 106. Operated in data dependent mode, the top 12 most intense ions from the precursor scan were selected for high energy collision dissociation (HCD) MS/MS  at a resolution of 17.5k, AGC of 1e5, isolation window of 2 m /z, and a max ion time of 100 ms. Only ions identified as having a + 2 charge or higher were subjected to HCD and subsequently excluded from further analysis for 30 s thereby allowing for deeper coverage. In total, 192 mass spectra files were generated (12 fractions for each of the 16 samples).Database search and expression analysis.  A sensitive and universal database search tool, MSGFPlus84 v2017.01.13, was used to conduct the metaproteome searches in this study. Prior to searching the metaproteomes, the mass spectrometer RAW output  files were converted to the mzML format using msConvert of ProteoWizard85 3.0.10200, accepting the default parameters. The mzML files were then searched against a targeted protein database containing protein sequences predicted from the metagenome-assembled genomes across the permafrost thaw gradient and involved in metabolic pathways examined in the manuscript, as well as the entire CDS regions of Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ , Ca. ‘Methanoflorens’ and AD3 (Supplementary Data 14). Proteins in the targeted database were dereplicated at 100% amino acid identity using usearch v9.2.64 (–fastx_uniques)86 after converting all isoleucine  residues to leucine (due to identical masses). In order to calculate the false  discovery rate (FDR), a parallel search of a decoy protein database was conducted by using the (-tda 1) parameter of MSGFPlus during the indexing and searching  steps of the targeted database. After conducting the searches, the FDR was  calculated as: FDR(t ) = #DecoyPSMs at (t )/#TargetPSMs at (t ), where (t ) is the highest Q value that gives a FDR of  ≤ 1%, and #DecoyPSMs and #TargetPSMs are the numbers of Decoy and Target Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSM), respectively, at that Q -value threshold. Only PSMs with Q  ≤ (t = 0.0145) were considered in the results of this study. The maximum precursor mass tolerance allowed during the searches was specified by the (-t 20 ppm) parameter for parent mass tolerance and the (-ti ‘-1,2’) parameter for isotope error range. Trypsin was specified as the digestion method (-e 1) and only full tryptic digestion was allowed (-ntt 2). Minimum and maximum peptide lengths to consider were 6 and 50, respectively. Minimum and maximum precursor charges to consider were 2 and 5, respectively. For each spectral scan, only the PSMs with the highest MSGF score (-n 1) were considered for subsequent analyses.The detection of a unique peptide in at least one sample was considered  evidence of expression of a specific enzyme. A specific pathway was designated as expressed when at least one enzyme from a pathway was detected in the metap-roteome. Further, that enzyme had to be encoded in a genome where >50% of genomes in the 97% ANI genome cluster encoded all steps of that pathway. Only a very small number of proteins (< 1%) were detected where the sequence of that protein was 100% identical to a protein from a different ANI genome cluster.The limited number of proteins detected for the fen hydrolysers is likely a  consequence of the diversity and complexity of the fen community, and the variety of proteins produced, compared to the palsa and bog. The metaproteomes were searched against a targeted protein database containing only those sequences pre -dicted from the MAGs. Peptide-spectrum matching requires 100% matches, which means that variations in sequence due to population heterogeneity/diversity, which is greatest in the fen (Fig.  1; Extended Data Fig. 2), are not captured, reducing the number of successful matches. Our approach is conservative following the genome-centric focus, and used purely to show that the populations of interest are translating proteins in situ.Statistical analyses.  Analysis of variance (ANOV A) tests, Mann–Whitney U -tests, and least squares regressions were calculated using R67. Box plots were created using ggplot287, with the boxes representing the 1st to 3rd quartiles and the whiskers  the highest (upper whiskers) or lowest (lower whiskers) observation within  1.5×  the interquartile range. The centre line represents the mean. Figure  2 sample numbers were as follows: palsa surface n  = 18, palsa mid n  = 18, palsa deep n  = 17, bog surface n  = 19, bog mid n  = 20, bog deep n  = 20, bog extra-deep n  = 6, fen surface n = 23, fen mid n  = 18, fen deep n  = 23, fen extra-deep n  = 6 biologically independent samples. A square root scale was used on the y  axis. P values for signif -icant differences among depths assessed with ANOV A were 4 × 10−7, 2 × 10−5, and 2 × 10−5 for palsa, bog and fen respectively for cellulose degradation, and 4 × 10−2, 3 × 10−8 and not applicable (n/a, no significant differences were found) for xylan degradation, 5 × 10−3, n/a, n/a for xylose degradation (dehydratase), n/a, 2 × 10−12, 1 × 10−4 for xylose degradation (oxidoreductase), 3 × 10−4, 9 × 10−7, 6 × 10−3  for xylose degradation (isomerase), 2 × 10−4, 5 × 10−9, n/a for lactate fermentation, n/a, 3 × 10−2, n/a for ethanol fermentation, 8 × 10−5, 5 × 10−7, n/a for propionate fermentation, n/a, 2 × 10−4, 5 × 10−2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, n/a, 2 × 10−3, 4 × 10−3 for acetoclastic methanogenesis. Figure  3 sample numbers were as follows: 3a, n  = 47, 3b, n = 65, 3c, n = 70 biologically independent samples.To test for associations between microbial populations and geochemical  variables, the abundance of genus- to family- level lineages was calculated using phylogenetic tree insertion of open reading frames derived from individual reads into single-copy ribosomal protein marker trees using GraftM88 and phylogenetic trees derived from both contigs assembled from data presented here and reference datasets (data not shown). To avoid statistical complications arising from multiple hypothesis testing, only the ten most abundant lineages in the bog and fen were tested for significance using least squares regression. Lineages correlating signifi-cantly were then linked to MAGs for correlations between individual MAGs and geochemical variables as well as between Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ sub-lineages.Figure generation.

Sample numbers: n = 8, 9, and 8 for biologically independent samples palsa surface, mid and deep, respectively, n  = 9, 8, 9 and 10, 7 and 9 for bog and fen, respectively. e, f, Relative abundances of phyla and classes within the Proteobacteria across the thaw gradient, respectively. The depth of each sample is indicated by the colour of the box (surface: red, mid-depth: green, deep: blue, extra-deep: purple). Each data point is the sum of relative abundances of all lineages assigned to the phylum in a sample after adding a 0.1% pseudocount to all phyla (so the y  axis is not dominated by small values visually). Box plots are shown plotted on a log-scale y  axis, with phyla and classes ordered by decreasing average relative abundance across all samples. Relative abundance was calculated based on the fraction of the community with recovered genomes (see Methods). Sample numbers: n = 53, 65 and 70 biologically independent samples for palsa, bog and fen, respectively.© 2018 Springer Nature Limited.

Vertical red lines indicate the number of samples sequenced in total from that  environment. Only one MAG, ‘Deltaproteobacteria_fen_1087’ , was  found in a high abundance across fen sites, detected at > 1% relative  abundance in 96% of fen sites. b , The same information stratified by  depth of the sample in the soil column. The specific MAGs prevalent  are detailed in Extended Data Table 1, showing that a small number of  populations were prevalent at a specific depth of a specific site. c , Stordalen genomes that changed significantly in abundance with depth. For each  site, genomes that show the largest absolute difference in abundance  between shallow and deep samples are shown. Genomes that are more  abundant in shallow samples compared to deep are positive, and those more abundant in deep samples relative to shallow samples are negative. Only those lineages with a mean absolute difference of > 1% and that are significantly different (P  < 0.05, two-sided Mann–Whitney U -test) are shown. Sample numbers: n  = 53, 65 and 70 biologically independent samples for palsa, bog and fen, respectively. Each bar indicates a 97%  dereplicated MAG that changes in relative abundance between surface  and deep samples and the colour of each indicates the phylum the genome belongs to. The fen is less stratified between the surface and deep, which is reflected in the fewer population abundances significantly changing in abundance between shallow and deep samples. Recovered congeneric genomes that showed significant but inverse differential abundance  between surface and deep samples are shown in Supplementary Data 7.

Percentages represent the proportion compared to all Stordalen genomes encoding a xylose degradation pathway. In the metaproteomes, genomes Acidobacteria_bog_390, Actinobacteria_fen_455 and Actinobacteria_bog_808 expressed a protein specific to oxidoreductase pathways and a protein specific to the isomerase pathway. In the metatranscriptomes, Acidobacteria_palsa_248, Acidobacteria_bog_370, Acidobacteria_bog_390, Actinobacteria_fen_455, Actinobacteria_bog_586, Actinobacteria_bog_808 and Planctomycetes_fen_1346 expressed a protein specific to oxidoreductase pathways and a protein specific to the isomerase pathway. c –h, Gene expression of xylose degradation pathways.

The blue line shown is a line of best fit, forced through the origin. Dots indicate the samples, with colours indicating the sample depth. The concentrations are correlated, and the CH 4 concentrations are much lower than the CO 2 concentrations in both sites. Sample numbers: n  = 51 (bog) and 61 (fen) biologically independent samples. b , Methanogenesis versus methanotrophy rates. Each point represents the average relative abundance of methanotrophs and methanogens across all samples in a single core, multiplied by the rate of methane generation or consumption inferred from previous culture-based measurements (2.345 and 20.1 fmol CH4 h–1 per cell of methanogenesis and methanotrophy, respectively, see Methods). The line represents the 1:1 ratio. Inferred fluxes were calculated using relative abundance of methanogenic or methanotrophic lineages so rates are only intended for comparison between the x  and y  axes, rather than as an absolute measure of CH4 flux. Methanotrophy appears to mitigate a significant proportion of the CH 4 generated in the bog sites. c , Correlation of the relative abundance of Ca . ‘Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis’ with the isotopic fractionation of methane (α C) dissolved in paired porewater samples taken from the bog. Previously observed in 2011 using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing33, the correlation is confirmed here using genome-centric metagenomic techniques on the 2011 samples, as well as in a new year of sampling in 2012. Sample numbers: n  = 23 (2011) and 24 (2012) biologically independent samples. d , e, Expression of methanogenesis marker gene mcrA across the thaw gradient. Samples analysed with metatranscriptomics are described by the date of sampling, core number and depth. d , Relative contribution of each methanogenic order to the total TPM. e , Relative contribution of all mcrA genes in the metatranscriptome. Metaproteomes revealed the expression of 289 hydrogenotrophic McrA proteins across 13 samples, as well as 78 acetoclastic McrA proteins across eight samples (Supplementary Data 2).  f, Linear regression analysis for predicting effective fractionation (αc) of CH 4 from environmental variables and Ca . ‘Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis’ abundances in the bog. Ca . ‘Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis’ abundance exceeds bulk geochemical parameters in predicting the effective fractionation of CH 4. Each line is the result of a linear regression of the specified measurement against the α c of CH 4 in bog porewater samples taken in 2011 and 2012 (n  = 47 biologically independent samples).© 2018 Springer Nature Limited. All rights reserved.Article reSeArcHExtended Data Fig. 9 | Candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota (AD3) genus Ca. ‘Changshengia’ at Stordalen Mire. a, Total relative abundance of the genus Ca . ‘Changshengia’ correlated with the fraction of the concentration of C mineralized to CO 2 versus CH 4 in the bog porewater samples (R2 = 0.19, P = 0.001, n = 51 biologically independent samples). Each point represents an individual sample from 2012, with its colour representing the depth in the core from which the sample was taken. b, Metabolic reconstruction of genomes belonging to the candidate phylum AD3 genus Ca . ‘Changshengia’ correlating with the CH4:CO 2 concentration ratio in porewater from 2012 bog samples. Genomes from four clades within the AD3 were assembled from across Stordalen Mire. Enzyme colour indicates the families that share that metabolic potential, as outlined in the legend on the left. Arrow colouring indicates whether expression was detected (red arrows) or not detected (black arrows) for genes encoding the enzyme in any of the 24 metatranscriptomes. Orange stars indicate detection of protein expression in any of the 22 metaproteomes from the Ca . ‘Changshengia’ and related genomes. All four lineages encode the potential to oxidize glycerol anaerobically through glycerol transporter (glpF), glycerol kinase (glpK) and a membrane-bound glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpABC), entering glycolysis via dihydroxyacetone phosphate processed to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by the triosephosphate isomerase (tpiA). Other glycerol derivatives such as glycerol-3-phosphate could be imported (glpT) by this and other family members, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate can also be processed using the PTS-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhaLMK) complex. Sinks for the electrons generated from the oxidation of glycerol also varied between the different lineages, with Ca . ‘Changshengia’ and clade 1 having a H+-translocating complex I NADH:oxidoreductase, while clade 1 also has a high affinity cytochrome oxidase complex IV , clade 2 genomes encode only a nitrate reductase (narGHI) and clade 4 genomes only a fumarate reductase (sdhABCD). These differences are likely to lead to the differentiation of the niches that each lineage occupies across different sites and depths of the mire. Lineages were considered positive for genes or complexes based on the presence of sequences with 80% homology in 50% of the genomes. c , Phylogenetic subtree showing the family groupings of AD3 for the metabolic analysis. Representative genomes from the 97% average nucleotide identity (ANI) dereplication are indicated in red.
