The rhizosphere is the soil environment where the plant root is available and is a zone of optimum microbial ac-tivity resulting in a constricted nutrient pool in which necessary macro and micronutrients get extracted (Bhatt & Bhatt,  2021). The microbial population in the rhizo -sphere is significantly distinct from its surrounding area due to root exudates that function as a nutrient source for microbial growth (Zhao et al.,  2021). Ryan (2009) con-firmed that the small rhizosphere region is abundant in microbial nutrients relative to the bulk soil; this is seen by the number of bacteria present around the roots of the plants, typically 10 to 100 times higher than in the bulk soil Received: 19 March 2022 | Revised: 7 August 2022 | Accepted: 15 August 2022DOI: 10.1111/jam.15796  REVIEW ARTICLEThe role of plant- associated rhizobacteria in plant growth, biocontrol and abiotic stress managementBasharat Ahmad Bhat1 |   Lubna Tariq2 |   Showkat Nissar3 |   Sheikh Tajamul Islam1 |   Shahid Ul Islam2 |   Zahid Mangral2 |   Noshin Ilyas4 |   Riyaz Z. Sayyed5 |   Govarthanan Muthusamy6 |   Woong Kim6 |   Tanvir Ul Hasan Dar2Basharat Ahmad Bhat, Lubna Tariq and Showkat Nissar contributed equally to this work.  1Department of Bioresources, School of Biological Sciences, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India2Department of Biotechnology, School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, BGSB University, Rajouri, India3Department of Botany, School of Biological Sciences, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India4Department of Botany, PMAS-  Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi, Pakistan5Asian PGPR Society, Auburn Ventures, Auburn, AL, USA6Department of Environmental Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South KoreaCorrespondenceRiyaz Z.

In the rhizosphere, microorganisms' beneficial and harmful activities affect plant growth and development. The mutualistic rhizospheric bacteria which improve plant growth and health are known as plant growth- promoting rhizobacte-ria (PGPR). They are very important due to their ability to help the plant in diverse ways. PGPR such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Arthrobacter, Achromobacter, Micrococcus, Enterobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Pantoea and Serratia are now very well known. Rhizomicrobiome plays critical roles in nutrient acquisition and assimilation, improved soil texture, secreting and modulating extra-cellular molecules such as hormones, secondary metabolites, antibiotics and various signal compounds, all leading to the enhancement of plant growth and development. The microbes and compounds they secrete constitute valuable biostimulants and play pivotal roles in modulating plant stress responses. In this review, we highlight the rhizobacteria diversity and cutting- edge findings focusing on the role of a PGPR in plant growth and development. We also discussed the role of PGPR in resisting the adverse effects arising from various abiotic (drought, salinity, heat, heavy metals) stresses.KEYWORDSabiotic stress, inorganic fertilizers, PGPR, rhizosphere, sustainable agricultureDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232718 |   BHAT et al.(Ryan et al.,  2009). Microflora found in the rhizosphere is dominated by bacteria, followed by fungi, protozoa, algae and actinomycetes (Kour et al.,  2019; Poria et al.,  2021). Various studies confirm the role of the microbial popu-lation in enhancing plant growth (da Silva et al.,  2021; Fincheira et al.,  2021). Kloepper et al., (1980) referred to such advantageous rhizobacteria as growth-  enhancing rhizobacteria (PGPR) (Kloepper et al.,  1980). The defini-tion of PGPR is limited to bacterial strains that may satisfy at least two conditions, such as vigorous invasion, stimula-tion of plant growth and biocontrol (Arjumend et al.,  2022; More et al.,  2022). Phytomicrobiome has recently emerged as a primary plant trait that affects crop production. The phytomicrobiome also acts as an essential modifying fac-tor in plant root exudation and vice versa, resulting in bet -ter plant health and crop yield both in terms of quantity and quality. Not only supports better plant growth but also involved in the degradation of toxic materials (Akhtar et al.,  2021, 2022) alleviating the stress conditions (Ilyas et al.,  2022) that adversely affect plant development (Bhat, Tariq, Mir, et al.,  2022; Bhatt, Verma, et al.,  2020). The role of these PGPR is not only restricted to plant development but also to controlling the growth of phytopathogenic microorganisms (Gouda et al.,  2018; Gupta et al.,  2015; Sudha et al.,  2022; Sukmawati et al.,  2021). They reflect the importance of PGPR as one of the active ingredients in the formulation of biofertilizers. Rhizobacteria can be divided into two major groups according to their rela-tionship with the host plants: (1) symbiotic rhizobacteria and (2) free- living rhizobacteria (Saharan & Nehra,  2011; Turan,  2022), which could invade the interior of cells and survive inside intracellular PGPR (e.g., nodule bacteria), or remain outside the plant cells, extracellular PGPR (e.g., Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, etc.) (Sagar, Rai, et al.,  2022; Sagar, Sayyed, et al.,  2022). These microor -ganisms affect plant growth in three different ways (1) by synthesizing and providing particular compounds to the plants (Qu et al.,  2020), by facilitating the uptake of certain nutrients from the environment (Mohanty et al.,  2021; Qu et al.,  2020), and (2) protecting plants from certain dis -eases (Sofy et al., 2019).Generally, rhizobacteria improve plant growth by syn-thesizing phytohormones precursors (Dodd et al.,  2010; Tsukanova et al.,  2017), vitamins, enzymes, sidero -phores, antibiotics (Prakash et al.,  2022) and inhibiting ethylene synthesis. Plant growth- promoting rhizobacte -ria (PGPR) promote plant development through a broad range of mechanisms, such as biological nitrogen fixa-tion, phosphate solubilization, rhizosphere engineering, siderophore output, 1-  Aminocyclopropane- 1-  carboxylate deaminase (ACC) output, quorum sensing (QS) signal intervention, production of phytohormone and inhibition of biofilm production (Kapadia, Kachhdia, et al.,  2022; Kapadia, Patel, et al.,  2022), having antifungal activity, synthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), promot -ing beneficial plant- microbe symbioses, systemic resis -tance induction (Prakash et al.,  2022), etc. In the present review, we highlight recent studies addressing the role of PGPR as a biofertilizer, biopesticides and photostimula-tion used in equitable agriculture. Meanwhile, the molec-ular and physiological mechanism behind plant growth promotion by rhizobacteria and combating abiotic stress will also be discussed.INSIGHTS INTO THE RHIZOBACTERIAVarious plants can have explicit predominant PGPR gen-era and species. The root microbiome of plants relies upon different ecological (biotic and abiotic) factors, for exam-ple, plant species, root type, soil type, plant age and sort of plant species. PGPR has been classified in numerous gath-erings based on their capacities and taxonomical status. PGPR strains broadly have a place with five primary taxa: Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Figure  1; Parray & Shameem,  2019; Singh et al., 2020).Among these five primary taxa reported PGPRs to in-clude Azotobacter, Arthrobacter, Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Allorhizobium, Agrobacterium, Azoarcus, Azorhizobium, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Caulobacter, Chromobacterium, Delftia, Enterobacter, Frankia, Flavobacterium, Gluconacetobacter, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Mesorhizobium, Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, Pantoea, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, Serratia, Thiobacillus (Olson,  2006; Singh et al.,  2016, 2017, 2020). Some of the main PGPRs and their functions are explained further below (Table 1).Azotobacter speciesMartinus Beijerinck (1851– 1931), a Dutch scientist, discov-ered the Azotobacter genus in 1901 (Gurikar et al.,  2016). Azotobacter spp. is a Gram- negative diazotrophic bacte-rium with pleomorphic forms ranging from spherical to bacillary (Gurikar et al.,  2016). A. vinelandii, A. paspali, A. chroococcum, A. beijerinckii, A. armeniacus, A. insignis, A. nigricans, A. Brasiliense, A. salinestris and A. tropica-lis have been investigated extensively in the previous two decades (Shelat et al.,  2017). A. vinelandii and A. chroo-coccum are the most common in rhizospheric soils. The population of Azotobacter is mainly determined by other soil microbes and other variables such as organic matter, pH, phosphate, potassium and calcium (Billah et al.,  2019; Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 2023   | 2719RHIZOBACTERIA IN PLANT HEALTH AND ABIOTIC STRESSItelima et al.,  2018; Sattar et al.,  2019). Bagyaraj and Patil found Azotobacter in ragi, sugarcane, cereals, soybeans and rice. Azotobacter spp. produces melanin, making food additives, biopolymers and biofertilizers (Itelima et al.,  2018). Azotobacter spp. can fix atmospheric- free ni-trogen (Backer et al.,  2018; Chennappa et al.,  2019). These growth- promoting chemicals influence shoot and root length and seed germination.Bacillus speciesBacillus species are a prominent PGPR group that may form spores and persist in soil long (Bhatti et al.,  2017; Paul et al.,  2019; Radhakrishnan & Hashem,  2017). PGPR induces systemic tolerance, antibiotics and competitive omissions (Hashem & Tabassum,  2019; Wang et al.,  2018). Bacillus species like Bacillus subtilis use direct and indi-rect biological control to keep pathogens at bay (Fira et al.,  2018). These bacteria can produce stress- tolerant spores and compounds that help plants thrive and prevent pathogen infestation. Bacillus subtilis also increases biotic stress resistance (Hashem & Tabassum,  2019). The ex-pression of genes and hormones, such as ACC, has a role in developing disease susceptibility. Bacillus spp. produce siderophores and exopolysaccharides that help regulate ion balance, transport water in plant tissues, and inhibit pathogenic microbe growth (Bhandari & Garg,  2019; Patel et al.,  2018; Shaikh et al.,  2016). Bacillus is harmless bac-teria that produce chemicals beneficial to agriculture and chemical research. These species synthesize antimicrobial metabolites that can be utilized to manage plant diseases instead of artificial pesticides (Fira et al.,  2018; Wang et al., 2018).Pseudomonas speciesPseudomonas species are currently receiving a lot of at-tention from researchers studying sustainable agricul-ture due to their role in promoting plant growth and inducing systematic resistance (ISR) through a variety of mechanisms including the suppression of plant dis-eases, enhanced nutrient uptake and phytohormone pro-duction. Pseudomonas is a family of 191 diverse species of aerobic, gram- negative, Gamma proteobacteria called Pseudomonadaceae. Pseudomonads are common in the soil environment because of their adaptable metabolism and genetic plasticity. They frequently live in the rhizos-phere of a variety of agricultural crop plants, where they contribute significantly to the encouragement of plant growth and the development of biocontrol agents that improve plant growth, yields and disease management (Jain & Pandey,  2016; Kumar et al.,  2016; Lugtenberg & Kamilova,  2009; Pathma et al.,  2011). Large amounts of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids are found in the secretions of root exudates in the rhizospheric regions of plants, and these substances serve as chemoattractants for bacteria. Chemoattractants are important in the interac-tions between microbes. The previous study concluded that some carbohydrates or amino acids acted as potent chemoattractants for microorganisms. Chemoattractants FIGURE 1 The existing rhizobacteria of a plant.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232720 |   BHAT et al.TABLE 1 Role of PGPR in regulating metabolism of crop plantsPGPR PGPR Mechanisms Crops Application mode Observation/Findings ReferencesAzoarcus Nitrogen fixation Rice Plants were developed genotobiotically with a mutant of strain BH72 that expresses b- glucuronidase gene constitutivelyThe existence of Azoarcus in the stele, particularly in the stellar tissue of culms, represents that these bacteria may spread systemically in situ, and highlighting their endophytic life style(Reinhold- Hurek & Hurek, 1998)Azobacter Cytokinin synthesis Cucumber - - (Aloni et al., 2006)Azorhizobium Nitrogen fixation Wheat 2 ml of rhizobial culture was supplemented with four times to each wheat plant, once during the seed planting, and consequently three times after one- week intervalFive times more short lateral roots were observed in wheat each up to the length of 3 mm, when inoculated with Azorhizobium caulinodans IRBG314(Sabry et al., 1997)Azospirillum Nitrogen fixation Sugar cane - - Azotobacter Nitrogen fixation Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rice, Sunflowers, Maize, line, Beetroot, Tobacco, Tea, Coffee and Coconuts- - (Wani et al., 2013)Bacillus Auxin synthesis Potato Seed- dipping (108 ml cfu) Both the strains increased the amount of auxin in the inoculated plants up to 71.4% and 433%, respectively, in contrast to non- inoculated plants(Ahmed & Hasnain, 2010)Bacillus Cytokinin synthesis Cucumber Seed- dipping 106 cells/ml (106 CFU/ml) Enhancement in root development was found in cucumber seedlings which were subjected to bacterization(Sokolova et al., 2011)Bacillus Gibberellin synthesis Pepper - - (Joo et al., 2005)Bacillus Potassium solubilization Pepper, Cucumber 1 ml of inoculum containing approximately 108 cells was used to inoculate the seedlingThe soils planted with pepper than with cucumber, had comparatively higher content of P and K(Han & Lee, 2005)Bacillus Induction of plant stress resistancePeanuts Maize 1 ml of a 108 cfu suspension Seed- dipping for 30 min was employed to inoculate the plantsIncrease in the salt concentrations, biological nitrogen fixation may be competitive, becoming more economic and sustainable alternative to chemical fertilization.

The previous study concluded that some carbohydrates or amino acids acted as potent chemoattractants for micro-organisms. P. fluorescens demonstrated high chemoat-tractants toward certain amino acids, including cysteine, glycine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine and serine in the case of tomato plants, which promoted successful root colonization (Oku et al., 2012).Pseudomonas putida is a saprotrophic soil bacte -rium. Using 16S rRNA, P. putida was affirmed to be a Pseudomonas animal group and placed in the P. putida gathering, with which it shares its name. It can also de -grade natural solvents like toluene (Volke et al.,  2020; Wijte et al.,  2011). This ability has been used in bioremediation or microbes to debase ecological toxins. Pseudomonas putida is a plant growth- promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR). There was less anthocyanin colour for all plants with P. putida strains, yet biomass was consistently more prom-inent with PGPR strains (Ali & Glick,  2019; Singh,  2019; Volke et al.,  2020; Zulueta- Rodriguez et al.,  2014). Plant growth promoting strain P. putida BSP9 and the rham-nolipid biosurfactant it produces is a novel technique for enhancing the productivity of Brassica juncea. It was observed that the combination of P. putida BSP9 and rhamnolipid BS showed the maximum enhancement in the growth parameters of B. juncea, including root and shoot length, total fresh and dry weight, number of pods, total oil content, total chlorophyll and flavonoid content (Mishra et al., 2020).StreptomycesActinomycetes are gram- positive bacteria with a more G+C genome ratio (Bhatti et al.,  2017; Subramani & Sipkema,  2019). They are primarily aerobic, although some are anaerobic. Actinomycetes are unusual among rhizosphere microorganisms in promoting plant growth (Javed et al.,  2021; Olanrewaju & Babalola,  2019). The Streptomyces genus is a significant source of bioactive nat-ural products (Hifnawy et al.,  2020; Sarmiento- Vizcaíno et al.,  2018). Actinobacteria create around two- thirds of natural antibiotics, with Streptomyces producing approxi-mately 75 per cent (Moumbock et al.,  2021). Most soil actinobacteria thrive in alkaline to neutral environments (Anilkumar et al.,  2017). They are now called growth- promoting rhizobacteria (Anilkumar et al.,  2017). Most plant growth- promoting actinomycetes have antifungal or antibacterial activity, indicating their potential as biologi-cal control agents (Ma et al.,  2019). Recently, a relationship between endophytic Actinobacteria and medicinal plants from Northeastern India was described. It was proposed that this might be a source of bioactive compounds and antibacterial and plant growth- promoting uses (Passari et al.,  2020). Streptomyces have evolved various compounds competing with hydroxyl ions for ferric iron (Khoshru et al.,  2020; Varjani et al.,  2020). Most nitrogen- fixing bac-teria produce siderophores to get iron. Streptomyces acti-vates the nitrogenase enzyme (Alawiye & Babalola,  2019). Streptomyces MCR24 had the highest levels of siderophores production, whereas Streptomyces MCR30 had the lowest amounts (Schütze et al.,  2015). Most Streptomyces can invade the rhizosphere and rhizoplane. Endophytes colo-nize host plant inner tissues (Liu et al.,  2017; Olanrewaju & Babalola,  2019; Vurukonda et al.,  2018). Other factors that influence this process include quorum sensing, mul-tiplication rate of amino acids and siderophores, antibiotic production and development of 1- glucanases and chi-tinases (Olanrewaju & Babalola,  2019; Sayyed et al.,  2019; Vurukonda et al.,  2018). The introduction of PGPS as bi-ofertilizers or biocontrol agents has led to new advances in several areas where such bacteria may be valuable. Due to the high development of bioactive chemicals utilized as defense mechanisms, various studies have focused on these genera (Olanrewaju & Babalola, 2019).The Sesbania rhizomeSesbania plants and their associated rhizobia offer a non- polluting and more economically viable alternative to chemical fertilizers, herbicides and sewage sludge for enhancing soil fertility (Zainab et al.,  2021). As a result of the leakage of chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides into the groundwater, the fertility of the soil is a serious cause for concern due to numerous worrisome health haz-ards (Zainab et al.,  2021). Sesbania possesses a variety of characteristics that make them desirable as multipurpose plants and potentially valuable species in agricultural pro-duction systems (Evans & Rotar,  2020). Sesbania rhizobia are superior to other high- potential N2- exchanging sys-tems. Sesbania plants and their associated rhizobia are advantageous because they can adapt to acidic, alkaline and waterlogged soil conditions (Evans & Rotar,  2020). Seven unique genospecies of Agrobacterium, Ensifer, Neorhizobium and Rhizobium were identified among the Sesbania cannabina rhizobia, and they were all character-ized as symbiovar sesbaniae due to their highly conserved symbiosis genes and nodulation test results (Cummings et al.,  2009; Sindhu et al.,  2019). Several Sesbania plant rhizobia capable of tolerating extreme conditions of alka-linity, acidity, salinity, drought, metal toxicity and fertilizer were identified. The existence of Rhizobium- tree legume symbiosis, capable of fixing the appreciable amount of N2 under severe conditions, is fascinating. Thus, Sesbania represents the best source of ideal fertilizers in the present Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232724 |   BHAT et al.and subsequent crops, and therefore, commands great interest as the subject of future research. There is a need to implement the use of Sesbania plants and their respec-tive rhizobia as biofertilizers from lab to field so that in the upcoming years, soil health is maintained and the problem of soil infertility can be diminished. Recent high- throughput tools and techniques in the future can also help to increase our understanding of the Sesbania plants and their associated microbes (Singh et al., 2021).Azospirillum speciesBacteria belonging to the genus Azospirillum are free- living microbes that promote plant growth (PGPB). They affect the growth and yield of numerous plant species, many of agronomic and ecological importance (Pii et al.,  2015). The most accepted theory regarding the mechanism of ac-tion of Azospirillum spp is its growth promotion, which includes nitrogen fixation (Machado et al.,  1991; Santos et al.,  2017) and phytohormone, polyamine and trehalose production (Bashan & De- Bashan,  2010). The mode of ac-tion of the Azospirillum is multiple, and the importance of each of these mechanisms can vary depending on soil and climate conditions and the solubilization of miner-als such as iron and phosphorus, which the plant uses (Bashan & De- Bashan,  2010). These 1mechanisms even-tually produce larger, and in many cases, more produc-tive plants (Díaz- Zorita et al.,  2015; García et al.,  2017). Azospirillum has improved crop yields of wheat, corn, rice and sugar cane (Bashan & De- Bashan,  2010). It has also been used in chilli pepper, fruit trees and cacti (Bashan & De- Bashan,  2010). In the case of the genus Azospirillum, 25 species isolated from different niches have been re-ported (Table  1). Most of these species have been iso-lated from roots of wild plants (Dekhil et al.,  1997; Xie & Yokota,  2005) and cultured (Beijerinck,  1925; Khammas et al.,  1989) from aquatic environments (Lavrinenko et al.,  2010; Wu et al.,  2021; Yang et al.,  2019) and con-taminated areas (Zhou et al., 2013).ROLE OF PGPR IN AGRICULTURE: AN OVERVIEWThe PGPR use is theoretically improved in organic farm-ing because it can be used in synthetic nutrients and insec-ticides (Bhat et al.,  2020; Ijaz et al.,  2019; Thakur,  2017). The rhizobacteria develop many substances that, in any way, influence plant growth promotion. Increasingly, commercial biofertilizers containing the best strains of PGPR lead to a greater understanding of the role of PGPR (Figure  2; Riaz et al.,  2021). Plant growth regulators may be classified into three groups, namely phytostimulators, biopesticides and biofertilizers. This has resulted in multi-functional regimens for commercial agriculture based on PGPR (Riaz et al., 2021).PGPR as bioinoculantThe search for the best PGPRs strains and their action mechanism increases with each passing day due to their use as potential commercially available biofertiliz-ers (Hamid et al.,  2021; Mahanty et al.,  2017; Pathania et al.,  2020). Researchers have studied plants' growth, and development as living bacteria and fungi form colo-nies in the inner plant area after their injection into the soil or root seedlings (Bright et al.,  2022; Choudhary et al.,  2018; Khairnar et al.,  2022; Riaz et al.,  2020; Vafa et al.,  2021). The microorganisms present in the biofer-tilizer employ several mechanisms to benefit the crop plants (Manasa et al.,  2021; Mir et al.,  2022; Nithyapriya et al.,  2021). They can either be efficient in nitrogen fixa-tion, phosphate solubilization and plant growth promo-tion or possess a combination of all such traits (Asaf et al.,  2017; Mus et al.,  2016). Biofertilizers can fix atmos-pheric nitrogen through the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process, solubilize and provides nutrients such as phosphate (Kusale, Attar, Sayyed, Enshasy, et al.,  2021), zinc, and potassium (Baba et al.,  2021) to the plants, and secrete plant growth- promoting substances (hor-mones) (Gurikar et al.,  2016; Liu et al.,  2017). Further, when applied as seed or soil inoculants, biofertilizers can multiply, participate in nutrient cycling and help crop production for sustainable farming (Basu et al.,  2021; Shelat et al., 2017).Some strains of PGPRs, such as Azorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, etc., have been documented as potential biofertilizers (Keswani et al.,  2019; Mącik et al.,  2020). PGPR improves fertility in the rhizosphere across five distinct regions, such as im-proving nutritional status in exceptional roots proximity, facilitating the host plant symbiosis, increasing the root surface area, and integrating all of the above modes of action (Gupta et al.,  2015; Mishra & Arora,  2019; Patel et al.,  2019). Two potential methods for enhancing rhi-zosphere nutrient availability are nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization via beneficial living organisms.Endosymbiotic rhizobacteria, including Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium, cause nitrogen fixation in the legumes' root nodules and Frankia spp. in root nodules of non-  leguminous plants (Mahmud et al.,  2020; Raza et al.,  2020; Thorman et al.,  2020). Symbiotically, Azotobacter and Bacillus are considered two potential PGPR species Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 2023   | 2725RHIZOBACTERIA IN PLANT HEALTH AND ABIOTIC STRESSto fix atmospheric nitrogen upon inoculation to the leguminous crop plants. The non-  symbiotic species' counterpart includes Enterobacter, Gluconobacterium diazotrophicus, Azospirillium, Azoarcus, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, Burkholderia Anabaena, cyanobacteria and Nostoc (Arora & Tiwari,  2017; Bashandy et al.,  2019). Phosphorous is the second essential plant growth mac-ronutrient, as it contributes a lot to respiration, macro -molecule biosynthesis, cell signalling, photosynthesis and energy transfer (Malhotra et al.,  2018). It has been reported that PGPR plays a crucial role in the solubili-zation of precipitated phosphate and makes it accessible for the growth of the crop (Satyaprakash et al.,  2017). The plants cannot use the phosphorous unless it is con-verted into insoluble organic types (soil phytate, inositol phosphate, phosphomono-  and triesters) and inorganic minerals (iron phosphates, primarily apatite, calcium and aluminium (Satyaprakash et al.,  2017)). Plants take two soluble forms, monobasic ions (H2PO4−) and dibasic ions (HPO42−). PGPRs solubilize insoluble phosphates via two different strategies1. Hydrolysis of phosphoric esters that mineralize organic forms of phosphate via synthesis of extracellular en-zymes (phytases/phosphatases)2. Solubilization of inorganic phosphate compounds by releasing mineral dissolving agents or chelating agents containing hydroxyl or hydrogen ions, CO2 and organic acid anions (Adnan et al., 2017; Verma et al., 2017).Rhizobacterial strains are widely distributed among various genera like Achromobacter, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium Azospirillum, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Klebsiella and Ralstonia with ACC deaminase activity, that help in decreasing the ethylene accumulation due to which strong root structure is maintained in surviving abiotic stress (Kour et al.,  2019; Sagar, Sayyed, et al.,  2020; Verma, Mishra, & Arora,  2019). In canola plants, it has been documented that ACC-  deaminase- producing bacte -ria reduced salt- induced ethylene, improved salt tolerance and increased plant growth and crop productivity (Etesami & Maheshwari,  2018; Win et al.,  2018). For the growth and development of the plant, the presence of iron and detoxification of heavy metals from soil is of great impor -tance to the production of siderophores by various PGPR species (Khatoon et al.,  2020; Singh et al.,  2019). Tripathi et al. (2018) elucidated that Fe translocation to plants is seriously disrupted by heavy metal stress, drought and sa-line. Bacterial siderophores are a potential source of Fe3+ to plants under abiotic stress or decreased Fe conditions (Perez et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2017).PGPR as biocontrol agentPGPR is a considerable concept since it includes bacte-ria that encourage observable plant growth and increase productivity by protecting the plant against disease FIGURE 2 Plant- associated rhizobacteria and their role in plant growth and metabolism.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232726 |   BHAT et al.attacks (Benizri et al.,  2021; Benizri & Kidd,  2018). Phytopathogenic microorganisms are an essential and persistent barrier to organic agriculture and the ecosys-tem's health (Prasad et al.,  2019; Prasad & Prasad,  2001; Varjani & Singh,  2017; Zope et al.,  2019). The daily use of chemical pesticides and fungicides has contributed to environmental concerns and has led to disease resistance, leading to the continuous development of new agents (Ismail et al.,  2017; Lengai et al.,  2020). Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates substances that could cause a danger to the environment (Kassotis et al.,  2020). The EPA only requires confident chemicals/pesticides that are harmless in agricultural products; thus, it actively pro-motes biopesticides (DeJong,  2020; Kassotis et al.,  2020). EPA has announced and commercialized some fungus taxa as biopesticides. Using PGPR to provide biochemi-cal attributes that can reduce the magnitude of pathogens and diseases to the same degree as chemical pesticides, chemical pesticides can be altered (Prasad & Prasad,  2001; Ukhurebor et al.,  2021). A significant number of path-ways used by PGPR are involved in biocontrol, such as direct antagonism through the development of antibiot-ics, siderophores, HCN, hydrolytic enzymes (chitinases, proteases, lipases, etc.) or indirect mechanisms in which the biocontrol species function as a probiotic by compet-ing with the niche pathogen (Rehman et al.,  2020; Shaikh et al.,  2018; Verma, Shelake, et al.,  2019). Antibiosis is the most studied and commonly identified pathway for bio-logical control agents (Köhl et al., 2019).The most successful rhizobacteria belong to Arthrobacter, Alcaligen, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Serratia, Burkholderia, Klebsiella, Mesorhizobium, Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Streptomyces, etc. Bacillus and Pseudomonas are the two most relevant genera of all PGPR strains that have been widely investi-gated for antibiotic pathways in disease prevention activ -ities (Fira et al.,  2018). The B. amyloliquefaciens strains BPSRB4 and BPSR14 have been shown to have antago -nistic activity and PGP potential that might be used to generate biofertilizers and biocontrol agents for the de -velopment of chilli seedlings (Passari et al.,  2018). Due to the success of Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma spp. as biocontrol agents, scientists have been looking for substitutes. Recently, filamentous actinobacteria have shown promising results as an alternative. One more re -search study revealed that Acinetobacter lactucae Strain QL- 1, a novel quorum quenching candidate effectively degrades bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. Campestris ( Xcc) diffusible signal factor (DSF)- mediated quorum sensing (QS) system.PGPR as biostimulatorsPGPR can act as a phytostimulators via the synthesis of various phytohormones such as cytokinin, indole acetic acid (IAA), ethylene and gibberellin. Phytostimulators or plant growth regulators are organic substances that en-courage, impede or alter plant growth and development at low concentrations (1 mM) (Vejan et al.,  2016). The ability to produce phytohormones is widely distributed across soil and plant- related microbes. Like cyanobacte-ria, diverse fungal and bacterial species may have phy-tohormones (Verma, Mishra, & Arora,  2019). Symbiotic, rhizospheric and epiphytic bacteria known as PGPR can secrete hormones. Ironically, the development of these phytostimulators can also be caused by certain bacteria, such as PGPR in plants. Phytostimulators IAA synthesized by PGPRs influence cell division, cell enlargement, root initiation, phototropism, growth rate, apical dominance, geotropism, etc., in plants (Kour et al.,  2019; Rehman et al.,  2020). The development of phytostimulators such as IAA, cytokinin and gibberellins or 1- aminocyclopropane- 1- carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, an enzyme that can lower plant ethylene levels that are usually en-hanced by a wide range of environmental stresses such as floods, drought, heavy metals, organic pollutants (Arora & Jha,  2019; Prasad et al.,  2019). The IAA development ca-pability can enable bacteria to detoxify excess tryptophan/tryptophan analogues deleterious to the bacterial cell. Cytokinins promote plant cells' division and regulate root growth by inhibiting primary root elongation and lateral root formation (Márquez et al.,  2019; Motte et al.,  2019). PGPRs are associated with the development of phy-tostimulators, including the genera Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Bacillus, Pantoea, Rhanella, Burkholderia, Arthrobacter, Herbaspirillum, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Mesorhizobium and Brevundimonas (Prasad et al.,  2019). The rhizobacterial strains, namely Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Halomonas desiderata, Klebsiella pneumonia, B. cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli and B. subtilis, are known for cytokinin production (Prasad et al.,  2019). Actinomycetes, a group of these microbes referred to as plant growth- promoting bacteria (PGPB), are a signifi-cant source of bioactive and antibacterial compounds and can manage a variety of phytopathogens (Marimuthu et al.,  2020). Several agroactive chemicals and direct and indirect methods enable Actinomycetes as biostimulants, biopesticides, bioherbicides and biological control agents (Chaurasia et al.,  2018; Vurukonda et al.,  2018). The strains of Nocardiopsis aegyptica H14 and Streptomyces albidoflavus H12 also demonstrated the strongest in vitro biocontrol activity (Djebaili et al., 2021).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 2023   | 2727RHIZOBACTERIA IN PLANT HEALTH AND ABIOTIC STRESSMOLECULAR MECHANISM AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF PLANT GROWTH PROMOTION BY  RHIZOBACTERIAPGPR comprises many bacterial strains from diverse taxo-nomic groups that populate plants' roots and rhizosphere (Mustafa et al.,  2019). PGPR can enhance agricultural crop productivity and their resistance to pathogens by in-ducing intricate changes in the growth and development of plants (Kumar & Dubey,  2020). PGPR plays an essential role in promoting plant growth via a broad range of mech-anisms (Etesami & Adl,  2020). These microorganisms can operate as biofertilizers, promoting plant growth and development by improving biotic and abiotic stress tol-erance and supporting the host plant's nutritional needs (Mącik et al.,  2020; Mahmud et al.,  2020; Olanrewaju & Babalola,  2019; Sharma et al.,  2013). The molecular foun-dation of plant- bacteria interaction mechanisms responsi-ble for physiological changes is discovered, primarily due to the growing "omics" methodologies. The methods of action by which PGPRs enhance plant development have generally been divided into direct mechanisms occur-ring within the plant and indirect mechanisms occurring outside the plant (Rosenberg et al.,  2008). Direct modes of action of the PGPR include improving plant nutrition by providing phytonutrients such as fixed nitrogen or solubilized minerals from the soil (such as Zn, P, Fe, K and other essential mineral nutrients) and/or stimulating plant growth and development by regulating plant hor-mone levels in the plant's environment (like gibberellins, auxins, cytokinins, ethylene and abscisic acid) (Bashandy et al.,  2019; Singh et al.,  2017; Figure  3 and Table  2) (Choudhary et al., 2011; García- Fraile et al., 2015).Indirect effects of PGPRs on plant health include sup -pressing phytopathogens and other harmful microorgan-isms through parasitism, competing for nutrients and niches within the rhizosphere, producing antagonistic substances (such as hydrogen cyanide, siderophores, anti-biotics and antimicrobial metabolites), and lytic enzymes (such as chitinases, glucanases and proteases), inducing systemic resistance in plants against a broad-  spectrum range of root and foliar pathogens (Etesami et al.,  2017; Jadhav et al.,  2020; Reshma et al.,  2018, 2020; Riaz et al.,  2021; Vinay et al.,  2016). Therefore, direct mecha-nisms affect plant growth regulators' stability by releas -ing growth regulators or hormones derived from plants, which promote the plant's metabolism and enhance its capacity to adapt. While indirectly contributing to defen-sive processes, plants are affected by signals derived from bacteria. Due to the direct and indirect impacts of PGPRs on host plants have emerged as suitable candidates for formulation and commercialization as bio inoculants and photo- protective microbial products. On the other hand, the manner and mechanism of PGPR activity differ de -pending on the host plant type (Gupta et al.,  2015). PGPR action is also influenced by several other factors, includ-ing biotic factors such as plant genotype, developmental stages, plant defense mechanisms and the presence of other members of the microbial community, and abiotic factors such as soil type, structure, soil management his -tory and the occurrence of prevalent environmental con-ditions (Bashandy et al., 2019).Typically, rhizobacteria stimulate plant growth by syn-thesizing phytohormone precursors (Perveen et al.,  2002), enzymes, vitamins, antibiotics and siderophores, hinder -ing ethylene production. Besides, rhizobacterial strains can also solubilize inorganic phosphate; boost plant stress tolerance to metal toxicity, drought, salinity and organic phosphorus mineralization, leading to increased plant growth. Plant growth booster of rhizobacteria also stim-ulates plant growth by generating different enzymes that induce physiological changes in plants. Ethylene is critical in many developmental processes, such as leaf senescence, leaf abscission, epinasty and fruit ripening (Kusale, Attar, Sayyed, Malek, et al.,  2021; Vogel et al.,  1998). Ethylene synthesis also occurs at the time of plant infection with rhizobacteria. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers improve the growth of legumes by (1) raising the availability of nutri-ents in the rhizosphere, (2) supplying N to plants through N2 fixation, (3) mitigating or blocking the negative im-pacts of phytopathogenic species, (4) by improving other advantageous symbioses of the host and (5) by raising the root surface region.Various investigations demonstrate that bacteria di-rectly affect plant auxins homeostasis by producing it. There is copious information indicating auxin synthe -sis by diverse PGPR strains in culture. Intriguingly, high auxin levels are synthesized by nonpathogenic rhizobac-teria strains such as Enterobacter sp. I- 3 could have an in-hibitory result on plants. A study revealed an increase in the expression of IAA biosynthesis genes and the amount of endogenous IAA in the MR in the plants when inoc-ulated with the PGPR strains Phyllobacterium brassicace-arum STM196 and Bacillus sp. LZR216.PGPR can affect ethylene's homeostasis by influencing gene expression en-coding enzymes for ethylene synthesis, ACC-  synthase and ACC-  oxidase. For example (Burkholderia phytofirmans) PsJN enhances ACS and ACO gene expression in A. thali-ana (ACS5, ACO1 and ACO2) Panicum virgatum, while in A. thaliana, ACS7 and ACS11 gene was enhanced by PGPR Phyllobacterium brassicacearum STM196. Studies have shown that PGPR may regulate the concentration of plant cytokinin, and cytokinin can be produced by dif-ferent PGPR strains. It has been demonstrated that cyto -kinin levels in the shoots of Platycladus orientalis plants Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232728 |   BHAT et al.when inoculated with a cytokinin- producing PGPR strain Bacillus subtilis (AE016877)ROLE OF PGPR IN COMBATING THE ABIOTIC STRESSPGPR promotes plant growth by enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in plants, fixating nutrients for easy uptake by the plant, triggering the synthesis of plant growth regulators, forming siderophores, volatile organic com-pounds and protection enzymes glucanase, chitinase and ACC- deaminase for the prevention of plant diseases (Figure  4) (Bhat, Tariq, Nissar, et al.,  2022; Choudhary et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2021; Tariq et al., 2022) (Table 2).The mechanism of action of each PGPR varies depend-ing on the kind of host plant (García- Fraile et al.,  2015).

It has been shown that plant growth rhizobacterium (PGPR) may improve plant re -sponses to abiotic stresses and can also stimulate physical, chemical and biological activities (Sharma et al.,  2017) through a variety of mechanisms (Adnan et al.,  2017; Gupta et al.,  2015; Mahmud et al.,  2020; Mustafa et al.,  2019; Raza et al.,  2020). A great deal of study has been done on bac-terial isolates that can enhance abiotic stress mitigation in various crop species. By regulating osmolytes and stress- responsive genes and exacerbating changes in the roots, PGPR can increase drought tolerance by producing phyto -hormones, volatile chemicals, ACCD, exopolysaccharides and antioxidants as by regulating osmolytes and stress- responsive genes. By regulating osmolytes and stress- responsive genes, PGPR can augment drought tolerance in plants (Khan, Bano, et al.,  2020; Rehman et al.,  2020). Plants benefit from PGPR by enhancing nutrient absorp -tion, achieving ion homeostasis, decreasing oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant activity, lowering volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and improving photosyn-thesis (Etesami & Maheshwari,  2018; Hamid et al.,  2021; Kour et al.,  2019). Genera with cold- adapted PGPR include Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, Paenibacillus, Providencia and Serratia. Psychrotolerant PGPR has vari-ous properties that make them valuable biostimulants for reducing cold stress. Examples are nutrient solubilization, Fe- chelating chemicals, ACC deaminase synthesis, IAA and bioactive molecules. PGPRs regulate plant health by improving nutrient uptake, guarding against phytopatho -genic microorganisms and increasing tolerance to abiotic stressors (Milledge,  2011; Sattar et al.,  2019). It stimulates plant development by increasing abiotic stress tolerance, fixing nutrients for easy absorption, activating plant growth regulator synthesis, producing siderophores, vola-tile organic compounds and protective enzymes glucanase, chitinase and ACC-  deaminase (Choudhary et al.,  2011). The manner of action of each PGPR varies depending on the host plant (García- Fraile et al., 2015).Heat toleranceTemperature stress alters hormone formation, espe-cially ethylene, which can stifle plant growth (Young et al.,  2006). Temperatures between 60 and 75°F are ideal for plant growth (Banerjee & Roychoudhury,  2018; Marchin et al.,  2022). Abiotic stress reduces crop yields when temperatures rise over a safe threshold. Drought, salinity, heavy metal exposure and temperature affect plant metabolism and growth, but heat stress is the most damaging of these abiotic stresses. Heat stress occurs when the temperature rises above 75°F. Plant morbidity FIGURE 4 Role of PGPR in combating the abiotic stress in plants.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232730 |   BHAT et al.and mortality increase due to heat stress, and their quality declines (Bhat et al.,  2020; dos Santos et al.,  2022; Haider et al.,  2022; Perrella et al.,  2022). Plant cells may undergo permanent changes, like cellular death, if heat stress per-sists for an extended period. Weeding, leaf curling and fruit drop are just some symptoms plants exhibit when under too much heat stress (Faizan et al.,  2022). In plants, heat stress damages cellular machinery and alters chro-matin structure by increasing membrane fluidity, causing a reaction series to become uncoupled.Plant cells accumulate reactive oxygen species and in-termediate intermediates due to reaction decoupling. The cytoskeleton of plant cells is disrupted by heat stress that alters the fundamental dogma (Ali et al.,  2020; Hassan et al.,  2021; Shaffique et al.,  2022). Photosynthesis in photosystem II (PSII) is impaired when the chloroplast thylakoid membrane detaches from the chloroplast in re -sponse to heat stress (Naik et al.,  2019). High- temperature stress induces denaturation and accumulation of cellular proteins if left unchecked, leading to cell necrosis. Grain abortion may occur due to an imbalance between ABA and cytokinins resulting from excessive heat stress during the reproductive period (Hifnawy et al.,  2020). Inhibition of standard transcription and translation, enhanced ex -pression of genes coding for heat shock proteins, and ther -motolerance induction are all heat responses (Moumbock et al., 2021).On the other hand, low- temperature stress disrupts metabolic pathways, alters membrane properties and pro -tein structure, and prevents enzymatic reactions (Salwan & Sharma,  2020). The cold will induce flower steril-ity by interfering with meiosis during spore formation (Anilkumar et al.,  2017). The inoculation of microorgan-isms increases tolerance and resilience to heat stress. The cross- protection of plants would benefit significantly from the isolation and identification of helpful microorganisms. By synthesizing phytohormones and other metabolites, beneficial bacteria improve plant defense mechanisms while reducing the negative impacts of stress. Plant– microbial interactions activate the antioxidant defense system. They have also been found to improve ion homeo -stasis by maintaining osmoprotectant levels. Therefore, it is important to explore plant- associated microbial com-munities (Shaffique et al., 2022).Osmotic stressOsmotic stress in plants can be caused by dry and salty soils, resulting in cell dehydration due to a shortage of water (drought) or a lack of water supply (salinity). These two constraints are often agronomically significant since high salinity in the soil is primarily caused by irrigation, which is required for growing yields in many parts of the world where rainfall is scarce. If the amount of water needed to expel ions from the superficial soil layer is in-adequate, they collect, increasing salinity (Alawiye & Babalola,  2019). Plants growing in such soils are often subjected to osmotic stress, decreasing water absorption and raising tissue ionic concentrations to dangerous lev-els (Vurukonda et al.,  2018). PGPR reduces stress symp-toms via several mechanisms, including the development of Na+- binding exopolysaccharides (Liu et al.,  2017), improved ion homeostasis (Ijaz et al.,  2019), and reduc-tion of ethylene levels in plants through ACC deaminase (Thakur, 2017), and IAA synthesis (Riaz et al., 2021).Drought stressDrought severity that has increased as a result of human activity and global warming poses a serious threat to ag-ricultural productivity. The demand for environmentally friendly solutions to ensure the security of the world's food supply has increased as a result. Plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) application has potential benefits. The plant's survival during a drought is guaran-teed by PGPR through a variety of mechanisms, includ-ing osmotic adjustments, increased antioxidant activity, phytohormone production, etc., and these mechanisms also promote the plant's growth. Additionally, new devel-opments in omics technologies have improved our under-standing of PGPR, which makes it easier to investigate the genes involved in colonizing plant tissue (Baba et al.,  2021; Jabborova et al.,  2021, 2022; Kapadia et al.,  2021; Kapadia, Kachhdia, et al.,  2022; Kapadia, Patel, et al.,  2022; Khan et al., 2021; Khumairah et al., 2022).Beneficial microorganisms that facilitate drought tol-erance and boost plant water usage have recently gained much publicity. Technological advancements in next- generation sequencing and micro biomics have aided these attempts (Verma et al.,  2017). Plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are thought to be a long- term syn-ergistic biological way of dealing with water scarcity in crop production (Khan, Bano, et al.,  2020). By regulating osmolytes and stress- responsive genes and aggravating changes in the roots, PGPR can confer drought toler -ance via releasing phytohormones, volatile compounds, ACCD, exopolysaccharides and antioxidants (Khan, Bano, et al.,  2020; Rehman et al.,  2020). Pseudomonas putida MTCC5279 ameliorated drought stress in chickpea (Cicer arietinum) plants by modulating membrane integrity, os -molyte accumulation (proline, glycine betaine) and ROS scavenging ability. Stress responses were positively mod-ulated by the bacteria resulting in differential expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (ACO and Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 2023   | 2731RHIZOBACTERIA IN PLANT HEALTH AND ABIOTIC STRESSACS), salicylic acid (PR1), jasmonate (MYC2) transcrip -tion activation, SOD, CAT, APX and GST (code for an-tioxidant enzymes), DREB1A (dehydration responsive element binding), NAC1 (transcription factors expressed under abiotic stress), LEA and DHN (dehydrins) (Tiwari et al., 2016).Heavy metal stressEnvironmentalists are concerned about the toxicity of heavy metals due to their limited degradability and high persistence in the environment. The toxicity of metals varies depending on their concentration or type. Certain heavy metals are hazardous at doses. Cd and Hg ions are harmful at 0.001 0.1 mg l21; however certain elements change their nature in response to their surroundings (Singh et al.,  2019). Their buildup in the soil directly in-fluences its texture and pH, reducing crop development by interfering with various biological processes (Benizri & Kidd,  2018; Sagar, Riyazuddin, et al.,  2020). In plants, heavy metal stress has both direct and indirect consequences, including oxidative stress via a variety of indirect mecha-nisms (e.g., glutathione depletion or binding to proteins— sulphhydryl (SH) groups) or by inhibiting anti- oxidative enzymes, thereby inducing ROS- producing enzymes (e.g., Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidases) (Varjani & Singh,  2017). Heavy metal- tolerant PGPR like Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Methylobacterium and Bacillus can help mitigate heavy metals' adverse effects on crops while increasing their growth and productivity. PGPR biostimulants are incredibly efficient at reducing heavy metal toxicity in plants. They inhibit heavy metal translocation to various regions of the plant by modifying their mobilization via complexation, precipitation, redox processes, chelation and adsorption (Ismail et al.,  2017; Lengai et al.,  2020; Sayyed et al.,  2015). Additionally, rhizospheric bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Nasab et al.,  2022; Sheikh et al.,  2022) such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, lipopolysaccha-rides and soluble peptides that contain many anions bind-ing sites and thus aid in the expulsion or recovery of heavy metals from the rhizosphere via biosorption. Furthermore, heavy metals mobilization and subsequent bioavailabil-ity in excess by siderophores, organic acids or bioleach-ing remain questionable in heavily polluted areas. The frequently employed microbial species include Bacillus spp., Raoultella ornithinolytica, Pseudomonas floures-cens, Brevibacterium sp., Acinetobacter sp., Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Trichoderma sp. and Candia spp., can ef-fectively degrade pyrethroids toxic compounds into non- toxic compounds (Bhatt et al.,  2019). The plant- associated microbial species augment the metal solubility due to the production of important enzymes such as pyrethroid hy-drolase enzyme (pyrethroid catalysing esterase) which reg-ulates pyrethroid degradation (Bhatt, Bhatt, et al.,  2020). Several studies reveal that microbial and physicochemical paraquat degradation methods and pathways, analyse the potential of bioremediation in paraquat- contaminated en-vironments (Huang et al., 2019).Salinity stressIn the upcoming years, it is predicted that soil salinity will rise more quickly, which will harm agricultural produc-tion. It has been discovered that many conventional meth-ods for reclaiming salt- affected lands are unsustainable and economically less feasible. PGPR has become a versa-tile tool for reclaiming salty soil. They also aid in reducing the negative effects of salt stress on plants. PGPR has sev-eral mechanisms for enhancing plant survival in salty en-vironments. The biocontrol and plant growth- promoting properties of PGPR- based biostimulants against a variety of phytopathogens are well known.Soil salinization affects more than 6% of global soil, put -ting 22% and 33% of total cultivated and irrigated agricul-tural land under threat, lowering crop production (Gupta et al.,  2015). By 2050, almost half of all arable land will be affected by soil salinity, which grows at a rate of 10% each year due to several causes, including implausible irriga-tion activities, irrational fertilization, inadequate drain-age and climate change (Verma, Mishra, & Arora,  2019; Yadav et al.,  2017). PGPR can alleviate salinity stress in plants through many synergistic mechanisms, including osmotic regulation by prompting the accumulation of osmolytes and signalling of phytohormones, increasing nutrient uptake and attaining homeostasis of ions, and reducing oxidative stress through enhanced antioxidant activity (Najafi et al.,  2021), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Sudha et al.,  2022), and photosynthesis amelio -ration (Etesami & Maheshwari,  2018; Kour et al.,  2019). Studies have shown that several actinomycetes isolated from Algerian salt soil have been found to exhibit good in vitro and planta (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plant growth- promoting (PGP) properties under normal circumstances (Sharma et al.,  2019). These investigations showed salt tolerance up to 10% (i.e., 1.7 M). A decreased phosphate solubilization rate in a saline environment is also re -ported (Rangseekaew et al.,  2022). Another mechanism for PGPB to induce plant tolerance against various envi-ronmental stresses is the regulation of phytohormones synthesis (Subramaniam et al.,  2020). Phytohormones help plants tolerate salt stress by developing a protective response against stress promoting cell proliferation in the root system, and increasing the surface area for water and Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article/133/5/2717/6989072 by National Cheng Kung University user on 22 March 20232732 |   BHAT et al.nutrient uptake through the overproduction of root hairs (Paul & Lade,  2014). Growth regulators, such as auxins, reduce salinity- induced dormancy in wheat seeds. Many PGPBs can produce IAA and participate in plant growth and development. Studies have shown that marine actino -bacteria may boost plant development under salt stress, especially Dermacoccus (Rangseekaew et al.,  2022). Pseudomonas putida and Enterobacter cloacae improvise the plant resistance to salt stress (Cheng et al.,  2012). The plant biomass is enhanced through the inoculation of Pseudomonas putida under drought stress condition.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVEDemand for food production has increased due to the ex -panding world population. Nevertheless, the production of crops and food is seriously threatened by the grow -ing negative impacts of climate change, environmental pollution, the introduction of aggressive viruses, and ancient traditional agricultural practices. For better and sustainable agricultural production, preservation of food security, greater yields, efficient plant protection and the agroeconomic industry, PGPR has become a prominent alternative to conventional farming methods during the past several decades. Interactions between plants and microbes in the rhizosphere have made it possible for plants and the PGPR they are linked with to exchange vital compounds. The commercialization of PGPR as biofertilizers should get illustrated. In this context, sub -stantial development has been made worldwide in bi-ofertilizer production for PGPR. PGPR has also been very efficient and necessary to improve crop production and soil fertility. In general, we can assume many advantages have been achieved by incorporating microbial biotech-nology into agriculture. Still, many obstacles and oppor -tunities for future sustainable agricultural development remain to be addressed. India, an agricultural country with a large population size, largely depends on its agro-  economy. Keeping this in mind, the need for research and improvement in agriculture is the need for an hour. The role of PGPR in providing beneficial services, such as bio fertilization, photostimulation, biopesticides and bioremediation, exhibit a substantial influence on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, we should facilitate their successful implementation in the core agricultural system for better crop production and sustainable agriculture. The use of PGPR will become a reality with more meticulous research and growth and will be conducive to basic processes that drive the sus -tainability and productivity of agroecosystems, resulting in an ideal agricultural system that is efficient, preserves and improves human health, benefits the environment and provides the world's population with adequate food. Finally, it may also be helpful to search for new PGPR strains for biofertilizers and create a microbial diver -sity map for any region, just like nutrient mapping. The demand for biostimulants as growth promoters has in-creased since 2000, and publications and research inter -est in employing beneficial microorganisms to handle heat stress are rising. The injection of microorganisms increases tolerance and resilience to various stresses. The cross- protection of plants would benefit significantly from the isolation and identification of helpful microor -ganisms. Appropriate technical calibrations and tests to boost the development and maintenance of sustainable agriculture and microbial diversity can also be used to build advanced simulation models related to microbes and their behavioural patterns in changing edapho-  climatic conditions. Further studies on the selection of suitable rhizosphere microbes and the development of microbial species, together with the advancement of multidisciplinary research- integrating applications in agro- biotechnology, biotechnology, chemical engineer -ing, nanotechnology and material sciences, and putting together various ecological and functional biological approaches, will provide new formulations and pros -pects Developing alternative compositions viz., liquid inoculants/granular, PGPR identification for biocontrol against numerous plant pathogens in bioassays is a pre -requisite for sustainable agriculture.CONSENT TO PARTICIPATEAll authors have given their consent for participation in this submission and possible publication of this study.CONSENT FOR PUBLICATIONAll authors are aware of this submission and have con-sented to the publication of this study.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThe authors are thankful to the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Govt. of India, New Delhi, for the financial support.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors have no relevant financial or non- financial interests to disclose.ORCIDNoshin Ilyas   https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5942-5439 Riyaz Z.
