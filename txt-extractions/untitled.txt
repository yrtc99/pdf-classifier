Significance of microbial asynchronousanabolism to soil carbon dynamicsdriven by litter inputsZhaosheng Fan1*& Chao Liang1,2*1Biosciences Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA,2State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology,Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110164, China.Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, it remains largelyunknown how plant litter inputs impact magnitude, composition and source configuration of the SOCstocks over long term through microbial catabolism and anabolism, mostly due to uncoupled research onlitter decomposition and SOC formation. This limits our ability to predict soil system responses to changesin land-use and climate. Here, we examine how microbes act as a valve controlling carbon sequestrated fromplant litters versus released to the atmosphere in natural ecosystems amended with plant litters varying inquantity and quality. We find that litter quality – not quantity – regulates long-term SOC dynamics underdifferent plausible scenarios. Long-term changes in bulk SOC stock occur only when the quality of carboninputs causes asynchronous change in a microbial physiological trait, defined as ‘‘microbial biosynthesisacceleration’’ (MBA). This is the first theoretical demonstration that the response of the SOC stocks to litterinputs is critically determined by the microbial physiology. Our work suggests that total SOC at anequilibrium state may be an intrinsic property of a given ecosystem, which ultimately is controlled by theasynchronous MBA between microbial functional groups.Globally, soils hold a large amount of carbon (C); the size of the SOC pool is twice that of the atmosphereand greater than the atmospheric and terrestrial vegetation C pools combined1,2. Small changes in thebalance between inputs to and outputs from the SOC pool (especially the stable C pool) could have asignificant impact on atmospheric CO 2concentration3–5, which may either reduce or exacerbate the conse-quences of burning of fossil fuels. For example, global climate change due to rising atmospheric CO 2concen-tration will likely change aboveground vegetation dynamics. Such changes can then impact the quantity of litter Cinputs to soil by altering plant net primary productivity (NPP) and/or affect the quality of litter C inputs byaltering plant community structure (e.g., population sizes and species composition) and/or chemical composition(e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) of plant litter6–9.Impacts on plant-C inputs to soil are fairly well represented in current climate and Earth system models(CESMs) that are driven largely by plant productivity responses10,11. However, microbial roles in soil C cycling arestill poorly reflected in these models12, despite that dynamics of SOC is driven ultimately by microbial catabolicand anabolic activities2,13,14. In practice, microbial models can be both plausible and straightforward (but not easy)to parameterize; importantly they also show promise for improving overall knowledge and our ability to predictthe effects of global changes12,15.Calls for the explicit consideration of microorganisms and their activities in models are increasing15–17, thenecessary theoretical supporting research are growing18–21, and results are beginning to emerge14,22–26. Forexample, a recent study showed that performance of the Community Land Model (a global land surface model)was substantially improved by addition of microbial processes24. While microbial models are not absent in currentstudies, unfortunately most of them only target microbial biomass. Inevitably, microbial controls over SOCformation, transformation, and stabilization are engaged by numerous functional species that constitute themicrobial community. Yet so far, virtually few published models have incorporated dynamics of microbialcommunity and examine its relevance for SOC cycling27. Therefore, accounting for the responses of the microbialcommunity and its physiology in CESMs may be necessary to reliably predict SOC dynamics28.Emerging opinion suggests that soil microbes act as important agents of SOC formation13,29,30, in part, becauseof growing evidence that microbial-derived C forms are primary constituents of the stable SOC pool14,31–35. In thisview, microbial activities simultaneously lead to (1) significant CO 2emissions via decomposition of plant residuesOPENSUBJECT AREAS:MICROBIAL ECOLOGYTHEORETICAL ECOLOGYECOLOGICAL MODELLINGReceived22 December 2014Accepted9 March 2015Published2 April 2015Correspondence andrequests for materialsshould be addressed toC.L.

Hence, we believe that the balance of C response betweenmicrobial decomposition and deposition channels will be a key factordetermining changes in the magnitude, composition (labile vs recal-citrant) and source configuration (microbial-derived vs plant-derived) of SOC.Accordingly, we develop a mechanistic microbial model (Fig. 1)that represents and explores the coupled mechanisms behind SOCdynamics resulting from variations in plant litter inputs over decadaltime scales by taking into account (1) the origins of SOC (i.e.,microbial-derived and plant-derived), (2) the responses of variousSOC and microbial biomass C pools to plant litter inputs, and (3) thefeedbacks between SOC pools and microbial functional groups(fungi and bacteria). A global optimization strategy36and severalstrictly defined constraints (e.g., biomass, maintenance respiration)were used to ensure the validity and reliability of the calibrated modelparameters and enable reliable model simulations. After model para-meters and the corresponding equilibrium state were determined, wesystematically explored the responses of various SOC pools to dif-ferent litter C input scenarios by using our microbial model (Table 1).Our model is a biologically realistic model based on establishedtheory and microbial parameters. We expect our work serve as thefirst step towards a new generation of models that include key phys-ical and chemical mechanisms in the SOC cycling.ResultsInitially, we simulated the impacts of a change in the quantity of litterC inputs (doubled amount; i.e., LF) on the dynamics of SOC pools(Table 1). The simulation results showed that increasing the amountof litter C inputs alone eventually increased the size of living C pools(fungal and bacterial biomass C; Fig. 2, panels dande), but had noimpacts on the ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass C, the size of non-living C pools (labile and recalcitrant C; Fig. 2, panels a,b, and q), andthe source configuration of non-living C pools (i.e., the relative con-tributions of C derived from fungi, bacteria, and plant sources inlabile and recalcitrant C pools; Fig. 2, panels g–l). These results wereconsistent among three sets of modeling exercises in which weassumed that living fungal biomass C was the same as (Equal-Fungi), greater than (LowFungi), or less than (HighFungi) livingbacterial biomass C (Fig. 2, Supplementary S1–S5). Our simulationswith LF suggest that increases in litter C inputs due to increased NPPmay change the size of soil non-living C pools in the short term(assuming plant community structure maintains stable), but that thisresponse is transient. After ca. 3 years of increased litter C inputsalone, the non-living SOC pools returned to steady states equivalentto the equilibrium levels before NPP was increased. Basically, theextra C from doubled litter inputs increased microbial growth andeventually sustained a larger pool of living microbial biomass, with-out causing significant changes in non-living SOC pools.Next we simulated how a change in the quality of litter C (i.e., HQor LQ; hereafter referred to as ChangeQl) affected SOC dynamics(Table 1). We conducted these model runs under the assumptionthat fungal and bacterial communities have synchronous responsesto a change in litter quality (i.e., fungi and bacteria had the samepositive or negative percentage changes in biosynthesis rates), that isto say that fungal and bacterial groups were assumed to respond withthe same MBA. Under this assumption, ChangeQl had large impactson the size and composition of the living C pools and also altered thecomposition and source configuration of non-living SOC pools(Fig. 2, panels a,b,d,e,g–l; Supplementary S2 and S4). However,changes in the size of total non-living SOC were less than ,5%(Fig. 2, panel c; Fig. 3), and this limited response was unaffected bythe ratio of fungal-to-bacterial biomass (i.e., the three sets of model-ing exercises: EqualFungi, LowFungi, and HighFungi). Thus, whenplant community structure is altered by changes in land-use or cli-mate, these results suggest that a corresponding change in litterquality (whether increased or decreased) is likely to have limitedimpacts on the size of total non-living SOC, if microbial functionalgroups (fungi and bacteria) exhibit the same MBA.Figure 1 |Schematic of the model framework that was used tosimultaneously simulate the interactions among dynamics of litter Cinput (i.e., quantity and quality), dynamics of biomass and necromass ofmicrobial functional groups (i.e., fungi and bacteria), and dynamics ofsoil non-living C pools (i.e., labile and recalcitrant C).Table 1 |The summary of simulations for the set of modeling exercises (EqualFungi) with the assumption that the ratio between fungal andbacterial biomass is 1 51.

Under this assumption, our simula-tions for all sets of modeling exercises (EqualFungi, LowFungi, andHighFungi) suggested that ChangeQl significantly impacted the size,composition, and source configuration of non-living C pools over thelong term (Fig. 3, Supplementary S1 and S3).DiscussionOur study demonstrates that the equilibrium response of total non-living SOC to plant litter inputs might not be controlled by litterquantity and microbial biomass, and limitedly controlled by changein litter quality, but most significantly controlled by how MBA ofmicrobial functional groups (fungi and bacteria) differs from eachother. Considering the small fraction ( ,5%) of microbial living bio-mass in the total organic C in soils20, our results suggest that the totalSOC at an equilibrium state may be an ‘‘intrinsic’’ property of a givenecosystem and such intrinsic property is ultimately controlled by asyn-chronous change in MBA of different microbial functional groups.So far, microbial biomass is rarely considered as an additional Cpool37–39, and even when such a microbial C pool exists it is simplyrepresented as a C inventory rather than a driving factor of C decom-position (similar to soil temperature and moisture) in the existingCESMs13. Our model structure includes the under-explored micro-bial biomass as a fast turnover C pool and a major driver of SOCdecomposition, and more importantly our model also capturesmicrobial functional groups. Furthermore, our model has capabilityof differentiating the microbial-derived C from the C of other origins,from which we could explore the extent of how turnover of microbialcommunity biomass changes allocations of SOC between plant left-over and microbial recycled products. The clarification and quan-tification of the percentage of total SOC that is microbially derivedhave significant scientific implications as well as practical value, e.g.,it is a prerequisite to understanding soil processes on the Earth andparticularly useful for broad-scale calculations of global C modelparameters29. This is fundamental yet under-explored knowledge,as few of ecologists and soil scientists have even attempted to mea-sure it in a meaningful way. Our model simulations show that thecontribution of microbial-derived C to total non-living C stock atequilibrium state ranges from 47% to 80%, which is consistent withprevious studies indicating that microbial-derived C is important inFigure 3 |A stylized illustration integrating modelled results under various scenarios. It depicts the model simulation results with the assumption thatthe ratio between fungal and bacterial biomass C is 1.0 at the initial equilibrium state.

Although this range might be different inreality, these results do suggest that shifts in the source configuration(microbial-derived vs. plant-derived) of soil non-living C may besignificantly changed due to environmental changes, and suchchanges are controlled by plant-C quality and asynchronous MBA.We argue that our model framework provides a baseline to invest-igate microbial-centered soil processes in SOC cycling and is ready tobe coupled with models that simulate other abiotic factors such asoxidation and hydrolysis of SOC, soil habitat, physicochemical pro-tection, and spatial inaccessibility of SOC to microbes40. In particular,physical protections of SOC in micro-aggregates and chemically-bound to mineral particles have long been known to affect soil Cstorage41–43, and are drawing increasing attentions in recent years.New studies have shown that interactions between SOC andmicrobes and minerals play a more important role in SOC sequest-ration than chemical properties of SOC17,44. Critical evaluation ofthese mechanisms (i.e., physical and chemical protections) needsto be addressed in future model development. Also, it should benoted that the quality of fungal-, bacterial-, and plant-derived labileand recalcitrant C was assumed to be the same in the model, whilemany studies have shown that microbial- and plant-derived C likelyhave different vulnerability to decomposition5,45. Nonetheless, ourstudy highlights the important role of microbial community, andthat shifts in community biomass turnover change the size, composi-tion and source configuration of non-living C owning to ‘‘accelera-tion effect’’ (here is asynchronous MBA to C input between microbialfunctional groups) and further may have great impacts on the globalC cycling.More broadly, the driving force (plant litter inputs) in our micro-bial model could be extended to investigate SOC dynamics due toother events such as root exudate inputs and C amendment (e.g.,fertilization) or disturbances (e.g., land-use change, warming, fire,and species invasion). It is likely that, qualitatively similarly to thechanges of plant litter inputs, those events and disturbances will havegreat impacts on total SOC if MBA of fungal physiology differs fromthat of bacterial physiology. Overall, our model simulations suggestthat future experimental studies may improve our understanding ofplant-microbe-environment interactions by concentrating on themetabolic response of different microbial functional groups to globalchange and, most critically, the relative differences among thoseresponses.MethodsWe developed a mechanistic model to simulate and investigate the microbialcontrol over SOC cycling. In our modeling framework, the soil C pools areseparated into two categories: living and non-living C pools. The living C pools(i.e., biomass) are further divided into living fungal and bacterial C pools; the non-living C pools are further divided into labile and recalcitrant C pools. The labile Cpool depends on C loss due to microbial anabolism and catabolism (defined as thesum of biosynthesis and loss to respiration) and transformation of labile C torecalcitrant C, and C gain due to both microbial necromass and external litter Cinputs. The microbial biomass C pool depends on C loss (due to microbial deathand maintenance respiration) and C gain (due to biosynthesis). The recalcitrant Cpool depends on C loss due to the microbial anabolism and catabolism and C gaindue to microbial necromass input and transformation of labile C to recalcitrant C.Below we describe the processes that affect the dynamics of each C pool and thecorresponding mathematical equations. Table 2 provides a list of model para-meters and their definitions and units.Model development.

Five objective functions and threeconstraints were used to determine those unknown model parameters (seeSupplementary for details). Briefly, these five objective functions were the ratiobetween labile and recalcitrant C pools, the ratio of microbial biomass C to total soil C,the ratio of microbial maintenance respiration to total soil heterotrophic respiration,the ratio between fungal and bacterial biomass C, and the total soil non-living Ccontent. The three constraints were that 1) turnover rate of bacterial biomass isconstrained to be greater than that of fungal biomass, 2) biosynthesis rate of labile Cby bacteria is constrained to be greater than by fungi, and 3) biosynthesis rate ofrecalcitrant C by fungi is constrained to be greater than by bacteria. It is important tohave these objective functions and constraints in order to determine a set ofparameters that produce reasonable simulations on all of pools and processesincluded in our model.After the objective functions and constraints were defined, a global optimizationmethod (stochastic ranking evolutionary strategy36) was used to determine the modelparameters. This was done by minimizing the difference between the objectivefunctions and the simulations after model spinups to reach equilibrium state. Aftermodel parameters and the corresponding equilibrium state were determined, wesystematically explored the temporal responses of various SOC pools to different litterC input scenarios by using our microbial model (Table 1). Alternative reasonableobjective functions (e.g., different objective function on the ratio between fungal andbacterial biomass) might change the estimated parameters and quantitative results,but would not change the qualitative results.
