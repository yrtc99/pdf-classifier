While many carbon flux measurements and experiments are done at or below themesoscale ( ⩽1 km), modern ecosystem carbon modeling is often done at scales of 0.25◦–1.0◦latitude, creating a mismatch between processes, process input data, and verification data. Here wearrange the naturally complex terrain into mesoscale landscape types of varying microtopographyand moisture status to evaluate how landscape types differ in terms of CO 2and CH 4balances andtheir combined warming potential, expressed as CO 2equivalents (CO 2-eq). Using a continuous4 year dataset of CO 2and CH 4fluxes obtained from three eddy covariance (EC) towers, weinvestigate the integrated dynamics of landscape type, vegetation community, moisture regime,and season on net CO 2and CH 4fluxes. EC towers were situated across a moisture gradientincluding a moist upland tundra, a heterogeneous polygon tundra, and an inundated drained lakebasin. We show that seasonal shifts in carbon emissions buffer annual carbon budget differencescaused by site variability. Of note, high growing season gross primary productivity leads to higherfall zero-curtain CO 2emissions, reducing both variability in annual budgets and carbon sinkstrength of more productive sites. Alternatively, fall zero-curtain CH 4emissions are equal acrosslandscape types, indicating site variation has little effect on CH 4emissions during the fall despitelarge differences during the growing season. We find that the polygon site has the largest meanwarming potential (107 ±8.63 g C–CO 2-eq m−2yr−1) followed by the drained lake basin site(82.12±9.85 g C–CO 2-eq m−2yr−1) and the upland site (77.19 ±21.8 g C–CO 2-eq m−2yr−1),albeit differences were not significant. The highest temperature sensitivities are also at the polygonsite with mixed results between CO 2and CH 4at the other sites. Results show a similar meanannual net warming effect across dominant landscape types but that these landscape types varysignificantly in the amounts and timing of CO 2and CH 4fluxes.1.IntroductionArctic tundra is characterized by long non-growingperiods punctuated with short growing seasons anda high degree of landscape heterogeneity causedby freeze-thaw cycles. Because these ecosystems arelargely inundated or frozen for much of year, soildecomposition is slow, resulting in one of the largestterrestrial reservoirs of labile carbon (C) (Hugeliuset al 2014 ). Comprising only 15% of the globalland surface, Arctic tundra contain close to onethird of the Earth’s terrestrial soil C ( ∼1500 Pg-C)(Zimov et al 2006 , Tarnocai et al 2009 , Kirschkeet al 2013 ). As this region is undergoing acceleratedwarming (Serreze and Francis 2006 ), carbon dioxide(CO 2) emissions are increasing, causing a sink-source© 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdEnviron. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 035008 J Hashemi et altransition (Schuur et al2013 , Oechel et al2014 , Nataliet al 2015 ,2019 , Commane et al 2017 ). In addi-tion to CO 2, methane (CH 4) is an important green-house gas (GHG) in permafrost and wetland regionsas methanogens thrive in areas with large amounts ofanaerobic soil (Garcia et al 2000 ). Arctic wetlands areresponsible for ∼15% of global wetland CH 4emis-sions and ∼4% of all global CH 4emissions (Kirschke2013 ). As methanogenesis is a temperature sensitiveprocess (Dunfield et al 1993 ), it is likely that bio-genic CH 4emissions will increase (Tian et al 2012 ,Lawrence et al 2015 ). For this reason, attention tonatural sources of CH 4efflux has increased in Arcticregions.Landscape heterogeneity can contribute to thewide range of estimates in CH 4emission, ecosys-tem respiration (ER), and gross primary productiv-ity (GPP) (McGuire et al 2012 , Treat et al 2018b ).This heterogeneity is characterized by variability insoil moisture regime and develops from freeze-thawcycles into a patchwork of polygonized tundra, thawlakes, drained lake basins and moist upland tundra(Webber 1978 , Zulueta et al2011 , Liljedahl et al2016 ).Polygonized tundra occurs from the common devel-opment of ice wedges in the soil column. As icewedges degrade, inundated C rich low-centered poly-gons become drained high-centered polygons anddrier upland tundra (Liljedahl et al 2016 ). This shiftcan cause a decrease in CH 4emissions and an increasein CO 2emissions (Martin et al 2018 ). Degrading icewedges can also form trough ponds that facilitatewater movement, change the microbial communityand, by extension, change GHG fluxes (Koch et al2014 , Liljedahl et al 2016 ). Similarly, thaw lakes formfrom permafrost thawing and subsequent land sub-sidence (Jorgensen and Shur 2007 , Huissteden et al2011 ). Thaw lakes drain, forming vegetated drainedlake basins (Jorgenson and Shur 2007 ). This indicatesthat over short distances, the effects of climate changeand controls of emissions can be highly variable dueto soil moisture content and the resulting plant andmicrobial communities that develop.Recent studies have shown emissions of CO 2and CH 4occur well into the non-growing season(Euskirchen et al 2012 , Oechel et al 2014 , Zona et al2016 , Treat et al 2018a , Arndt et al 2019a ). Coldperiod emissions of CH 4can account for nearly 50%of the yearly budget, and largely occur during fallshoulder periods when air and surface soil temper-atures are below freezing, and subsurface temperat-ures are around 0◦C (20%–30%) (Zona et al 2016 ,Commane et al 2017 , Taylor et al 2018 ). This periodis referred to as the ‘zero-curtain’ and is associatedwith the presence of an unfrozen portion of the act-ive layer during freezing while phase transition occurs(Outcalt et al1990 ). This highlights the importance ofseasonality, yet there is still a paucity of data reflectinghow interseasonal C dynamics vary in terms of land-scape type.Figure1. WorldView-3 (Maxar Technologies) imageryacquired 24, July 2016 of Utqia ˙gvik, AK (a) and the threeeddy-covariance experimental sites, US-Beo (b), US-Bes(c), and US-Brw (d). Images generated using Environmentfor Visualizing Images V5.5 (Harris Geospatial) software.Quantifying ongoing changes to the pan-Arcticcarbon budget is important, but cannot be achievedwithout understanding how variability in landscapescale climate responses affect emissions. By partition-ing Arctic tundra ecosystems into sub-landscapes, thevariability in timing and magnitude of C fluxes can bebetter understood. Using a continuous 4 year data-set (2014–2017) of CO 2and CH 4fluxes obtainedfrom three eddy covariance (EC) towers, each in adistinct landscape type, this study aims to quantifythe integrated dynamics involved in CH 4, CO 2, andCO 2+CH 4(expressed as CO 2equivalent (CO 2-eq),hereafter referred to as combined C) budgetary con-tributions due to landscape type, vegetation com-munity composition, and seasonality.2.Methodology2.1.StudyareaEC study sites are located on continuous permafrosttundra on the North Slope of Alaska, near Utqia ˙gvik(figure 1(a)). The sites include the Barrow Environ-mental Observatory (US-Beo) (figure 1(b)), Biocom-plexity Experiment South (US-Bes) (figure 1(c)) anda site near the NOAA Earth System Research Labor-atory (US-Brw) (figure 1(d)). These sites were chosenfor long-term continuous data acquisition as theycapture dominant landscape variability of the region.US-Bes is in a drained lake basin containing the wet-test soils (table 1), with the water table above the sur-face for most of the growing season and is domin-ated by wet sedges and sphagnum moss (Davidsonet al 2016a ). US-Brw is a moist upland tundra con-taining the driest soils (table 1) and is dominated by2Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 035008 J Hashemi et alTable1.

US-Beo ischaracterized by ice wedge polygon formations thatarise from the freeze thaw cycle (Webber 1978 ). Dueto these polygon formations, US-Beo is a mixed land-scape, exhibiting both inundated and drained areasand consists of wet sedge/sphagnum moss domin-ated areas as well as drier graminoid/lichen domin-ated areas (Davidson et al 2016a ).2.2.EddycovarianceandmeteorologicaldataCH 4and CO 2fluxes were estimated at half-hourlyintervals from year-round data collected at 10 Hzfollowing the procedures outlined from LI-COR®EddyPro®. A double rotation was applied to the axisrotations of three-dimensional wind speeds accord-ing to Wilczak et al (2001 ) and a block averaginginterval was used to define turbulent fluctuations. Anin situ/analytic correction, according to Ibrom et al(2007 ), was applied to the gas analyzer data as thegreenhouse gas analyzer (GGA) has a closed path.Quality flags were output within datasets according toMauder and Foken ( 2011 ) and data that did not passthe quality requirements were removed. An internalchamber pressure of ⩾20.67 kPa (155 torr) in theGGA indicates line blockage or instrument failure,and these data were eliminated. Additionally, a tur-bulence threshold was applied, identifying conditionswith insufficient turbulence (indicated by low fric-tion velocity (u∗⩽0.1 m s−1)), and those data wereremoved in accordance with Reichstein et al (2005 ).A moving window of 2 weeks was applied and fluxesthat were three standard deviations away from themean were removed as outliers for CH 4and CO 2fluxes. EC tower site and instrumentation informa-tion can be found in table 1(Goodrich et al 2016 ,Arndt et al 2020 ).Meteorological data were obtained at 30 s inter-vals and averaged into half-hourly means. Each of thethree sites had independent meteorological instru-mentation and measurements used in defining thepeak thaw and zero-curtain period. Meteorologicalinstrumentation used in analysis included soil watercontent (SWC) (Campbell Scientific® CS616 WaterContent Reflectometer), soil temperature (OmegaEngineering™, type T thermocouples), air temperat-ure and humidity (Vaisala, HMP 45), and photosyn-thetically active radiation (PAR; LI-COR® LI-190Rquantum sensor). At each site, soil temperature wasmeasured at 0, −5,−15, and −30 cm from thesoil surface and soil moisture probes were insertedfrom the soil surface to a depth of 20 cm, provid-ing the average soil moisture in the top 20 cmof the soil column. Measurements of soil moisturewere taken at one location at US-Brw and US-Bes,and two locations at US-Beo (a high center poly-gon and polygon trough) for better relief repres-entation then averaged over the growing seasonswithin the study period. Data from both EC andmeteorological instrumentation were collected usingdatalogger/multiplexer arrays from Campbell Sci-entific® (i.e. CR-3000, CR-23X and AM-1632). Thawdepth was measured weekly during the growing sea-son by probing the land surface to the extent of theactive layer along a transect with a small diametermetal rod.2.3.Data/statisticalanalysesEC tower footprints were estimated with the analyt-ical footprint model of Korman and Meixner (KM)(2001 ) using the R package ‘FReddyPro’ v1.0 (Xenakis2016 ). The KM model calculates the density functionof the footprint contribution for a two-dimensionalarea surrounding the EC tower and was used toestimate the landscape area in which 80% of fluxesoriginated by averaging half-hourly single flux foot-prints during 2016. WorldView-3 (Maxar Techno-logies) imagery (1.24 m multispectral resolution)of Utqia ˙gvik, AK was used to show variability inthe WorldView normalized difference water index(NDWI) at each of the three sites. As SWC is meas-ured at one to two locations within each EC towerfootprint and site hydrology can be variable, NDWI isused in conjunction with SWC to characterize differ-ences in site moisture regime. The WorldView NDWIis calculated as the normalized difference betweenthe coastal band ( Rc, 400–450 nm) reflectance andthe second near infrared band ( RNIR2, 860–1040 nm)reflectance (equation ( 1)). This is because it has beenshown that the Rcand RNIR2bands show a better soil-water separation than the typical green (510–580 nm)and the first near infrared band (770–895 nm) com-binations and is indicative of surface water moisturelevels (Maglione et al 2014 ). The NDWI results invalues between −1 and 1 where more positive val-ues represent wetter landscapes. Pixels outside of thefootprint of the EC towers as well as those repres-enting structures within the tower footprints weremasked for statistical analysis. Before calculating stat-istics, pixels were aggregated into 3 ×3 pixel gridsusing the nearest neighbor approach to avoid biasby over sampling and to reduce high variability. Apairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests was used to com-pare NDWI values among sites. Additional imageryfor NDWI analysis across study period can be foundin supplementary information (figure S1 (availableonline at stacks.iop.org/ERL/16/035008/mmedia ))NDWI =RC− RNIR2RC+ RNIR2. (1)Daily average fluxes were calculated in R V 3.6.2 (RCore Team 2019 ) and R Studio software using the‘data.table’ package and were calculated with a min-imum of 30 half-hourly samples per day to ensureproper representation of the diurnal patterns of CH 4and CO 2fluxes. Daily averages of CH 4and CO 2fluxesfor purposes of the examination of site variability andC budgets are beneficial as they show an accuraterepresentation of the systems while qualifying data4Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 035008 J Hashemi et alcomplexity and size. Data gaps are unavoidable inthe harsh conditions characteristic of Arctic envir-onments. These gaps can be a result of power ornetwork outages as well as instrument failure. Totaldata coverage is between 61% and 71% dependingon the site with the best coverage during the sum-mer and fall periods. Detailed data coverage inform-ation by season and annual totals can be found inthe supporting information (table S1). Data gaps werefilled using random forest machine learning (R pack-age, ‘missForest’) utilizing a 300-decision tree design.Model validation can be found in supporting inform-ation (figure S2). Comparisons of model validationbetween the default half-hourly data output and dailyaverages show models perform much better whenusing a daily average. This method reduces the ‘noise’and is therefore better equipped to inform machinelearning processes.The beginning of the growing season was definedas the period where the top five cm of the soil areabove 0◦C, ending at the onset of the zero-curtain.The zero-curtain was defined as the period dur-ing the fall shoulder beginning when soil temperat-ure of the top 5 cm of the soil are less than 0◦Cfor 3 or more days, ending when the temperatureat−15 cm (roughly the middle of the active layer,table 1) dropped below −0.75◦C for 3 or more days.Non-growing season, as defined here, includes bothwinter and spring, beginning at the end of the zero-curtain period and ending at the beginning of thegrowing season.ER and GPP were partitioned from net eco-system exchange (NEE) according to Lasslop et al(2010 ) using the ‘REddyproc’ package in R (Wutz-ler et al 2018 ), as nighttime data is unobtainableduring Arctic summer. Temperature response rela-tionships were calculated using a weekly mean toreduce noise and to better represent annual trends.Models showing temperature response curves forCH 4were calculated using soil temperature, ratherthan air temperature, as this has been shown toact as a better predictor for CH 4fluxes (Arndt et al2019a ) (figure S3). All temperature response curveswere linearized by log transformation and com-pared using analyses of covariance (ANCOV A) totest for homogeneity among the regressions with the‘car’ R package (Fox and Weisberg 2019 ) and Q10values were calculated from temperature responseregressions with the ‘respirometry’ R package(Birk 2020 ).3.Results3.1.SitemoistureregimeNDWI as well as the KM model footprint of eachEC tower were used to establish differences in sur-face water content within each EC tower foot-print (figure 2). Using a pairwise Wilcoxon ranksum tests, NDWI was found to be significantlydifferent ( p< 0.001) among each of the threesites. The results of the NDWI, showing levelsof surface moisture, agreed with soil moisturedata at the sites (table 1) with US-Bes showingthe wettest conditions (NDWI (mean ±standarderror) =−0.079±0.005), US-Beo showing inter-mediate NDWI levels (NDWI =−0.144±0.003)and US-Brw with the lowest NDWI support-ing its position as the driest site in the study(NDWI =−0.204±0.003). Further analyses ofNDWI show that imagery acquired 24 July 2016was representative of site differences and while somevariability occurs, these positions are maintained(figure S1) as changes in vegetation community orhydrology at the landscape scale happens over longerperiods of time (Liljedahl et al 2016 , Arndt et al2019b ).3.2.SeasonalgasfluxPeak growing season CH 4emissions were higherat US-Bes (1.43 ±0.11 mg C–CH 4m−2h−1) andUS-Beo (1.35 ±0.31 mg C–CH 4m−2h−1) incomparison with US-Brw (0.76 ±0.10 mg C–CH 4m−2h−1), however, CH 4fluxes during the zero-curtain period showed lower variability across thethree study sites (figure 3(a)). The annual average ofpeak uptake in NEE was greatest at the driest site,US-Brw (75.26 ±8.9 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1), fol-lowed by US-Beo (60.5 ±7.9 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1)and least pronounced at wettest site, US-Bes(39±6.4 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1). The annual aver-age of peak emission in NEE followed the sameorder of US-Brw (44.25 ±4.9 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1),US-Beo (24.74 ±5.3 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1)and US-Bes (13.75 ±1.7 mg C–CO 2m−2h−1)(figure 3(b)).3.3.CarbonbudgetvariabilitySeasonal fluctuations (growing season to zero-curtain) of CO 2budgets are most pronounced atthe driest site, US-Brw, and least pronounced atwettest site, US-Bes (figure 4(a)). Due to the higherzero-curtain CO 2emissions dampening growing sea-son CO 2uptake, US-Brw is the weakest CO 2sinkon average. This trend holds with drier sites gen-erally emitting larger amounts of CO 2during thezero-curtain offsetting much of the uptake dur-ing the growing season (US-Brw: 75%; US-Beo:62%; US-Bes: 25%). Growing season CH 4emis-sions are highest at US-Beo and US-Bes (figure 4(b),p< 0.05). However, zero-curtain CH 4emissionsare roughly equal across all landscapes. This indic-ates that the percent contribution to local CH 4budget varies by site during the zero-curtain (US-Brw: 45%; US-Beo: 34%; US-Bes: 32%) and totalnon-growing season (US-Brw: 56%; US-Beo: 48%;US-Bes: 43%).5Environ.

(∗∗∗p< 0.001).WorldView-3 (Maxar Technologies) imagery acquired 24 July 2016 of Utqia ˙gvik, AK.Site variability in combined C budgets aremost pronounced during the growing season, yetstill occur, driven by CO 2emission, during thezero-curtain period (figure 4(c)). As US-Beo ischaracterized by low centered polygons, it exhib-its characteristics of both US-Brw and US-Bes. Thisaccounts for the larger values observed in CH 4emis-sion relative to US-Brw and the larger values in netCO 2uptake relative to US-Bes during the growingseason. The effect is that the mixed landscape, US-Beo, is the largest mean C contributor (table 2).More detailed information regarding C budget byyear/season can be found in supplementary informa-tion (table S2).Yearly cumulative emissions indicate that inter-annual variability in CH 4fluxes is limited in inund-ated sites (figure 5(a)). US-Bes exhibited the lowestinterannual variability (standard deviation—CO 2-eq(σ)=3.96), followed by US-Brw ( σ=15.2) thenUS-Beo ( σ=23.8). Interannual variability in CO 2fluxes is highest at US-Brw ( σ=34.98), followedby US-Bes ( σ=18.11) then US-Beo ( σ=10.65)(figure 5(b)). Most of the variability in combinedcumulative C emissions is therefore controlled byvariability in CO 2at US-Brw and US-Bes, and in CH 4at US-Beo (figure 5(c)).3.4.TemperatureresponseratesER temperature response relationships show that airtemperature increases in predictive strength as sitewetness decreases (figures 6(a)–(c)). In the inter-sitecomparison of linearized ER regressions, US-Beo andUS-Brw show significant similarity ( p< 0.05) whileUS-Bes is significantly different than both US-Brw(p=0.12) and US-Beo ( p=0.076). Q10is highestat US-Beo (3.5), followed by US-Brw (2.5) andUS-Bes (2.2). Methane temperature response rela-tionships show similar predictive strength across allsites (figures 6(d)–(f)). Q10for CH 4is again highest atUS-Beo (4.6), followed by US-Bes (4.2) and US-Brw(3.1). Contrary to ER, in the inter-site comparison oflinearized CH 4regressions, US-Beo and US-Bes showsignificant similarity ( p< 0.05) while US-Brw is sig-nificantly different than both US-Beo ( p=0.11) andUS-Bes ( p=0.14).4.Discussion4.1.CO2seasonalityandannualbudgetSeasonality appears to be the dominant factor inannual variation in NEE; however, we find the mag-nitude of that effect is dependent on local vari-ation in site hydrology (figure 4).

Shaded portionrepresents range of measurements across the 4 year studyperiod.the highest GPP yet was the weakest mean annualCO2 sink in comparison with the other wetter sites(table 2). Conversely, US-Bes exhibited the lowestGPP yet was the strongest mean annual CO2 sink(table 2). This is because sites with higher summerGPP exhibited larger zero-curtain CO2 emissions.The lower SWC at US-Brw likely leads to a sub-stantially larger portion of the soil column underoxic conditions, therefore supporting aerobic respir-ation, increasing CO 2emissions. While it is prob-able that this constitutes much of the budget dis-parity, the contribution of CH 4oxidation to ER inprimarily methanogenic areas has been found to beup to 35% (Nielsen et al 2019 ). As US-Brw containedthe deepest active layer (table 1) and largest GPP(table 2), soils may contain higher amounts of photo-synthates and labile C. This can increase methanogen-esis rates deeper in the soil column (Dorodnikov et al2011 ) and fuel CO2 producing methanotrophs closerto the surface that would be more active under theoxic conditions in drier areas relative to waterloggedareas (Megonigal and Schlesinger 2002 ). Alternat-ively, as US-Bes is inundated, methanotrophy is likelysubstantially lower during the zero-curtain periodwhen the highest amount of CO2 loss is observed.Moreover, the lower GPP at US-Bes may result inmore recalcitrant C and thus lower ER rates. TheUS-Beo site exhibited intermediate growing seasonGPP and zero-curtain CO2 emission relative to theother two sites likely due to US-Beo exhibiting amixed landscape regarding the prevalence of drainedand inundated areas (figure 4(a)).ER temperature response relationships show thatUS-Beo had the strongest temperature dependence(Q10=3.5) relative to US-Brw and US-Bes ( Q10=2.5and Q10=2.2) (figure 6). This may be linked to theintermediate soil moisture of US-Beo. Higher SWCcan limit the temperature sensitivity of soil respira-tion in wetland regions due to the restriction of oxy-gen and thus, aerobic respiration (Chen et al 2018 ).Alternatively, respiration can be limited by lowerSWC through a reduction in microbial mobility andsubstrate diffusion (Grant and Rochette 1994 ). Thetemperature sensitivity of belowground respirationcan also be dependent on productivity by providingphotosynthates as substrates (Hartley et al2006 ). Thismay contribute to US-Bes having the lowest temper-ature sensitivity, as this site exhibited the lowest pro-ductivity (table 2).Similar studies of annual CO 2budgets show thatthe largest annual net CO 2loss is seen during the non-growing season, particularly associated with earlywinter respiration (Oechel et al 2014 , Commane et al2017 , Euskirchen et al 2017 ), agreeing with datapresented here. As early winter respiration comprisesa large part of the CO 2budget, further increases inzero-curtain duration will likely result in winter CO 2emissions that exceed growing season uptake (Arndtet al 2019b ). Each of the sites in this study werefound to act as a weak sink for CO 2, yet others havereported relatively strong annual source signals fromsimilar systems (Commane et al 2017 , Eurskirchenet al 2017 ). This highlights the need for the monitor-ing and greater representation of mesoscale ( ⩽1 km)processes in climate projections, particularly at sub-grid scales.4.2.CH4seasonalityandannualbudgetGrowing season CH 4emissions are lowest at US-Brw(figure 4(b)). This is likely due to lower soil moistureincreasing the volume of soil experiencing aerobicconditions not conducive to methanogenesis (Gar-cia et al 2000 ). The polygon tundra site, US-Beo,had similar CH 4emissions relative to the inundatedUS-Bes site despite US-Bes being the site with thehigher SWC (figure 4(b)). This may be related to thevegetation community composition. As US-Bes con-tains a lower percent cover of sedges (Davidson et al2016b ), US-Beo may produce more photosynthates,9Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 035008 J Hashemi et alFigure6. Temperature response curves of ecosystem respiration (ER; (a)–(c) (air temperature)) and CH 4efflux (d)–(f) (soiltemperature)) at US-Bes (a) and (d), US-Beo (b) and (e), and US-Brw (c) and (f). All regressions had a p-value of >0.01.like acetate, that could leach into surrounding water-logged soil in polygonal environments, further fuel-ing methanogenesis via acetoclastic methanogenicpathway (King et al 2002 , Dorodnikov et al 2011 ).Further, sedge density is positively correlated to CH 4emissions as sedges provide a pathway for CH 4through the vegetation to the atmosphere (Lai 2009 ,Andresen et al 2017 ). Interannual variability in CH 4emissions is low at US-Bes compared with the othersites (figure 5). As US-Bes is consistently inundated,interannual differences in snow melt and rainfallwould have a larger impact on SWC and by proxy,oxygen availability at US-Brw, and US-Beo, possiblyexplaining this variability.Contrary to zero-curtain CO 2emission havingsite dependent variability, zero-curtain CH 4emis-sions are roughly equal across all sites. This may bedue to the frozen surface soils, creating an ice ‘cap’ ,and limiting oxygen diffusion into the soil columnthereby equalizing oxygen availability and by exten-sion, methanogenesis, across sites. This shows thatvariability in the growing season, rather than the zero-curtain, may have a stronger impact on annual CH 4variability across different landscapes. However, zero-curtain emissions may increase as the zero-curtainextends longer into the winter with a warming cli-mate (Arndt et al2019a ). Zero-curtain CH 4contribu-tions were found to be higher than in previous worksdue to the length of the study period capturing therange of annual variability (Zona et al2016 ). Methanetemperature response relationships also indicate thattemperature dependence was strongest at US-Beo(Q10=4.6), followed by US-Bes ( Q10=4.2), andUS-Brw ( Q10=3.1) (figure 6). As US-Beo, likeUS-Bes, contains large amounts of anaerobic soil,temperature sensitivity of methane production wouldbe stronger than US-Brw where soil moisture is a lim-iting factor.4.3.AnnualcombinedcarbonbudgetThe largest mean combined C emissions werefrom the mixed landscape US-Beo, exhibiting bothinundated and drained areas. These polygonizedlandscapes comprise close to 65% of the Alaskancoastal plain (Lara et al2018 ) and contain both anaer-obic areas that produce large quantities of CH 4aswell as drained areas where aerobic respiration canreadily occur. US-Beo exhibited the strongest tem-perature response, for both CO 2and CH 4. On thisbasis, it is possible that further climate change maydisproportionately increase C emissions from poly-gonized landscapes as rising temperatures will sup-port increased production and emission of CO 2andCH 4. However, rising temperatures will likely coin-cide with polygon succession and hydrologic trans-itions (Liljedahl et al 2016 ). These hydrologic trans-itions can significantly alter annual carbon budgets(Kittler et al 2017 ), stressing the importance of mon-itoring landscape heterogeneity for in these regionsfor carbon budget estimation.The interplay of CO 2and CH 4dynamics areaffected strongly by both seasonality and by mesoscale10Environ. Res. Lett. 16(2021) 035008 J Hashemi et allandscape variability. Though the variability in sum-mer C emissions is significant among the landscapesstudied, zero curtain releases of CO 2and CH 4tendto offset site differences. This acts as a buffer tovariability and leads to similar annual combined Cbudgets across the sites studied. However, the dif-ferences in timing and magnitude of CO 2and CH 4fluxes elevate the importance of mesoscale processesfor restricting uncertainty in Arctic model projec-tions. Arctic regions make up the largest portion ofuncertainty in climate global climate models (IPCC2014 ). Pan-Arctic models are typically run at coarsescales that describe landscape heterogeneity by thedominant landscape. It has been stressed that a higherdegree of spatial and temporal coverage is needed(Natali et al 2019 ) and that representation of wetand dry tundra at a finer scale ( ⩽4 km2) can res-ult in a threefold reduction in model error (Laraet al2020 ). Data presented here demonstrate the needfor this improvement, particularly for models thatcan represent mesoscale landscape heterogeneity andsubsequent differences in seasonal carbon emissionpatterns.5.ConclusionsAlthough the northern coastal tundra region inAlaska continues to be a weak CO 2sink in all observedlandscapes, CH 4emissions push the region to have anet warming effect on the atmosphere. Data show thesite with the largest mean GPP experienced the lowestmean annual CO 2uptake, while the site with the low-est mean GPP experienced the highest mean annualCO 2uptake. This is primarily due to zero-curtainCO 2emissions and indicates that zero-curtain CO 2emissions are positively correlated with growing sea-son GPP . Despite site variability in growing sea-son CH 4emissions, zero-curtain CH 4emissions arenearly equal across sites. This implies that the per-cent contribution of zero-curtain CH 4emissions toannual CH 4budget varies by site and can be largerthan previously thought, being as high as 45% ofthe yearly budget from the zero-curtain period aloneand over half of the yearly budget from the totalnon-growing season (including the zero-curtain).Tundra exhibiting both inundated and drained areasare the largest mean annual combined C source andshow a stronger ER and CH 4temperature responsethan either largely inundated or drained areas. Theseresults show that local variation in site hydrology,seasonality and interannual variability in regionaltemperature work in tandem to determine carbonbalance. This interaction may be indicative of avariable response under further climate change, yetseemingly lacking the strength to cause strong dif-ferences in annual C budgets at this time. As bothwetting and drying of Arctic tundra has beenreported, differential landscape development inresponse to climate change and subsequent C budgetdivergence may occur. Without improved repres-entation of landscape heterogeneity, this potentialdivergence would likely confound long term globalmodel predictions further, as changes would occur atsub-grid scales.DataavailabilitystatementThe data that support the findings of this study areopenly available at the following URL/DOI: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2X34MS1B .AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by the NASA ABoVE Pro-gram awarded to Walter C Oechel and DonatellaZona (No. NNX16AF94A) and the National Sci-ence Foundation—Office of Polar Programs awar-ded to Donatella Zona and Walter C Oechel (Nos.1204263 and 1702797).
