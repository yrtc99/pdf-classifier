Box 330440, 28334 Bremen, Germany; s_ado8ut@uni-bremen.de*Correspondence: breinhold@uni-bremen.deAbstract: Azoarcus olearius BH72 is an endophyte capable of biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation (BNF) andof supplying nitrogen to its host plant. Our previous microarray approach provided insights intothe transcriptome of strain BH72 under N 2-Ô¨Åxation in comparison to ammonium-grown conditions,which already indicated the induction of genes not related to the BNF process. Due to the knownlimitations of the technique, we might have missed additional differentially expressed genes (DEGs).Thus, we used directional RNA-Seq to better comprehend the transcriptional landscape under thesegrowth conditions. RNA-Seq detected almost 24% of the annotated genes to be regulated, twicethe amount identiÔ¨Åed by microarray. In addition to conÔ¨Årming entire regulated operons containingknown DEGs, the new approach detected the induction of genes involved in carbon metabolism andÔ¨Çagellar and twitching motility. This may support N 2-Ô¨Åxation by increasing energy production andby Ô¨Ånding suitable microaerobic niches. On the other hand, energy expenditures were reduced bysuppressing translation and vitamin biosynthesis. Nonetheless, strain BH72 does not appear to becontent with N 2-Ô¨Åxation but is primed for alternative economic N-sources, such as nitrate, urea oramino acids; a strong gene induction of machineries for their uptake and assimilation was detected.RNA-Seq has thus provided a better understanding of a lifestyle under limiting nitrogen sources byelucidating hitherto unknown regulated processes.Keywords: biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation; RNA-Seq; endophyte1. IntroductionNitrogen, a component of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, is importantfor the growth of plants [ 1]. In spite of its abundance in the atmosphere, plants cannotdirectly assimilate N 2and depend on the combined nitrogen sources from soil. Onlycertain prokaryotes have the capability to convert atmospheric N 2into combined formsfor plant assimilation. This process is termed biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation (BNF), andthe prokaryotes that perform BNF are referred to as diazotrophs. Harnessing the powerof BNF grants us a better alternative for chemical fertilizers, thereby taking us a stepcloser to sustainable agriculture [ 2]. Our model organism, Azoarcus olearius BH72, isa diazotroph belonging to the class Betaproteobacteria [3]. It is an endophyte that wasisolated from the surface-sterilized roots of Kallar grass ( Leptochloa fusca L. Kunth) fromthe Punjab region of Pakistan [ 4]. Earlier, it was conÔ¨Årmed that strain BH72 supplies Ô¨Åxednitrogen to its host plant, Kallar grass [ 5]. This strain has been shown to colonize rice rootsand endophytically express nitrogenase genes under gnotobiotic conditions within riceroots [ 6,7]. Another strain of this species, DQS-4, isolated from oil-contaminated soil inTaiwan can Ô¨Åx atmospheric nitrogen as well [ 8]. This strain is also able to colonize rice rootsendophytically and has exhibited plant growth-promoting activity [ 9]. Hence, studyinggene regulation in strain BH72 under BNF will strengthen our understanding of speciÔ¨Åcrequirements and activities of A. olearius while Ô¨Åxing nitrogen.Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9091888 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganismsMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 2 of 20As an initial step in this quest, we previously used microarrays to compare thetranscriptome of strain BH72 under N 2-Ô¨Åxing and ammonium-grown conditions [ 10]. Forthis analysis, we used transcriptome microarrays spotted with 70 mer oligonucleotideprobes as quadruplicates for the 3989 predicted protein-coding genes from A. oleariusBH72 [10]. As expected, this study revealed several BNF-related genes to be differentiallyexpressed. This included the genes encoding for the transcriptional regulator of BNF (NifA),components of nitrogenase, its maturation factors, and the energy transfer system (Rnf1complex). Simultaneously, it elucidated the regulation of processes that did not have a directlink to BNF such as type 2 and one of the two type 6 protein secretion systems (T2SS andT6SS-1). The T6SS is present in a wide range of endophytes [ 11], and especially in symbioticrhizobia, the T6SS-1 (Imp system) affected the host range of nodulation [ 12]. Therefore, instrain BH72, they may play an important role in plant colonization as well. Presumably,the bacterium already induces their expression under BNF as a preparatory step for itslifestyle. Remarkably, the microarray study was the Ô¨Årst to report a BNF-dependentinduction of T6SS expression [ 10,13]. Nevertheless, microarrays failed to detect genes thatwere previously shown to be differentially expressed under similar growth conditionssuch as nifH ,fdxN ,draG ,amtB , and amtE [7,14‚Äì17]. This phenomenon could be attributedto the known limitations of the microarray approach, such as lower detection range,cross-hybridization, non-speciÔ¨Åc hybridization, and spot inhomogeneity. These limitationsmight have prevented microarrays from identifying other vital components and regulationsduring BNF. This additional knowledge will help in answering several open questions.One of the persisting questions pertains to how Azoarcus provides the necessary energyfor BNF. A recent study has revealed that in E. coli that has been artiÔ¨Åcially engineeredto perform BNF, the metabolic Ô¨Çux shifted from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to thepentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and to ethanol fermentation to support BNF [ 18]. Instrain BH72, microarrays detected the genes involved in the Embden‚ÄìMeyerhof‚ÄìParnaspathway to be repressed but did not detect differential regulation in any of the alternatemetabolic pathways to sustain the energy supply.RNA-Seq overcomes many of the above limitations of microarrays. RNA-Seq hasa higher sensitivity, speciÔ¨Åcity, and increased dynamic range of detection. Additionally,studies have already shown that RNA-Seq approaches reveal information and regulatoryfeatures in addition to the data from microarray analysis [ 19‚Äì24]. Consequently, RNA-Seqhas superseded microarrays for transcriptome proÔ¨Åling. Nevertheless, the applicationof RNA-Seq to understand BNF is scarce. In Azotobacter vinelandii, almost 30% of theannotated genes were found to be differentially expressed during N 2-Ô¨Åxing growth incomparison to non-Ô¨Åxing growth [ 25]. The quantity was even higher for Paenibacillus sp.WLY78; roughly 60% of the genes were detected to be regulated [ 26]. These are remarkablyhigher compared to our previous microarray analysis (13%). This highlights the depth ofknowledge that could be obtained by implementing RNA-Seq to identify genes regulatedunder BNF in strain BH72. Hence, in this study, we ventured to analyze the transcriptomeof strain BH72 during diazotrophic growth in comparison to ammonium-grown conditionsusing directional RNA-Seq.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Growth and Harvesting of Bacterial CulturesAzoarcus olearius strain BH72 was initially grown in minimal medium (synthetic malate,SM) [ 27] without biotin. The cells were washed thrice with nitrogen-free SM-medium andwere used as an inoculant. For the N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions, strain BH72 was cultivatedmicroaerobically (0.3% O 2) in a bioreactor (Minifors, Infors HT, Einsbach, Germany) at37C with constant stirring at 600 rpm in 1.6 L of N-free SM medium in the presence of N 2.As a control, the strain was also grown in ammonium-based conditions by supplementingthe SM medium with 10 mM NH 4Cl. Under both conditions, three independent cultureswere set up. An amount of 30 mL of the cultures was harvested at an optical densityMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 3 of 20(OD 578) of 0.5‚Äì0.7 by centrifuging at 5500 gand 25C for 10 min. The supernatant wasremoved, and the pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored at  80C.2.2. Extraction of RNA from Bacterial CellsRNA extraction was performed by means of the hot phenol method, as describedpreviously [ 10]. In brief, frozen cell pellets were re-suspended in 8 mL of the hot phenolsolution. The hot phenol solution was prepared by mixing equal quantities of phenol‚Äìchloroform‚Äìisoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 ( v/v/v )) (pH 4.0) (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt,Germany; CAS registry numbers 108-95-2, 67-66-3 and 123-51-3, respectively) and NAES(50 mM Sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% ( w/v) SDS at pH 5.1) and was heated to65C. The cell suspension was incubated at 65C for 5 min, further incubated on ice for10 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 gand 12C for 15 min. The aqueous phase wasextracted again with an equal volume of phenol‚Äìchloroform‚Äìisoamyl alcohol (pH 4.0),and this step was repeated thrice. The resulting aqueous phase was mixed with an equalvolume of a chloroform‚Äìisoamyl alcohol mixture (24:1 ( v/v)) (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe,Germany, CAS registry numbers 67-66-3 and 123-51-3, respectively) and was extractedafter centrifugation at 6300 gand 12C for 5 min. After extraction, the nucleic acids wereprecipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt,Germany; CAS registry number 67-63-0), were incubated on ice for 60 min, and werecentrifuged at 13,000 gand 4C for 10 min. The pellet was washed with the same volumeof 70% ethanol (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany; CAS registry number64-17-5) and was centrifugated at 4C for 5 min. After drying, the pellet was re-suspendedin 30 L of RNase free water. The sample was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen andwas stored at 80C for further processing.From the extracted nucleic acids, genomic DNA was eliminated using the RNeasyPlus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog no. 74134) as per the protocol prescribedby the manufacturer for the puriÔ¨Åcation of total RNA containing small RNAs. In theprocedure, 10 g of the extracted nucleic acid was used as the sample instead of cells.2.3. Preparation and Sequencing of Directional RNA-Seq LibraryThe RNA samples were further processed and sequenced at Vertis Biotechnologie AG,Freising, Germany. The ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero rRNA RemovalKit for bacteria (Illumina, Berlin, Germany, Catalog no. MRZB12424). The samples werefragmented by four pulses of ultrasound that were 30 s each at 4C. To aid in directionalsequencing, a 30Illumina TruSeq sequencing adapter with barcodes was ligated to the30end of the fragmented RNA molecules. The Ô¨Årst-strand cDNA was synthesized usingM-MLV reverse transcriptase and a primer binding to the adapter sequence. SynthesizedcDNA was puriÔ¨Åed, and to its 30end, the 50Illumina TruSeq sequencing adapter, which alsocontained barcodes, was ligated. The cDNA was ampliÔ¨Åed through 13 cycles of PCR usinga high-Ô¨Ådelity DNA polymerase to obtain about 10‚Äì20 ng/ Lof DNA. The ampliÔ¨ÅedcDNA was puriÔ¨Åed using an Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics,Krefeld, Germany). The six samples were pooled in approximately equimolar amountsand were size-fractionated using a preparative agarose gel to obtain a size range between200 and 400 bp. The sample pool was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 systemusing a 75 bp read length. The sequence of the TruSeq adapters and the barcodes used inthis procedure are provided in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The reads obtained fromthe RNA-Seq have been deposited in the NCBI‚Äôs Gene Expression Omnibus [ 28] and areaccessible through the GEO Series accession number GSE176473 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE176473).2.4. Mapping of Reads to the Genome Sequence and Analysis of Differential ExpressionThe Illumina sequencing reads were trimmed using the fastptool [ 29] based on theadapter sequence (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA) and the readquality. Reads with at least one ‚ÄúN‚Äù base or more than 10 bases with a Phred score less thanMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 4 of 2010 were removed. From the 50and 30end of the reads, bases up to a 3-nucleotide windowthat had a mean quality score less than 10 were also dropped. Processed reads werealigned to the genome sequence of Azoarcus olearius strain BH72 using the READemptiontool [ 30] with its default parameters. Only reads that mapped uniquely were consideredfor quantiÔ¨Åcation. Raw coverage values for the annotated CDSs were rounded and wereused for differential expression analysis using the DEseq2 tool [ 31]. In the tool, the resultswere optimized for an FDR cutoff value of 0.05 by means of the independent Ô¨Åltering ofthe genes based on mean normalized counts.2.5. VeriÔ¨Åcation of RNA-Seq Data by Quantitative RT-PCRThe differential expression of selected targets identiÔ¨Åed by RNA-Seq was veriÔ¨Åedthrough quantitative RT-PCR of RNA samples. For each target, the Ô¨Årst-strand cDNA wassynthesized by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (ThermoFischer ScientiÔ¨Åc, Darmstadt,Germany, Catalog no. 18080093). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, 2.5 M of gene-speciÔ¨Åc reverse primerand 20 ng of total RNA were used in a 10 L reaction volume and were incubated at55C. Other components and steps were followed as per the prescribed protocol. Ineach reaction, 10 U of Recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, Walldorf,Germany, Catalog no. N2515) was added instead of RNaseOUT. For quantiÔ¨Åcation, 1 Lfrom the reverse transcription reaction was further ampliÔ¨Åed using SsoAdvanced UniversalSYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Feldkirchen, Germany, Catalog no. 1725271)with 0.3 M of both forward and reverse primers in a 20 L reaction volume. The reactionwas initiated with an initial denaturation (98C for 2 min) followed by 40 cycles of two-stepampliÔ¨Åcation (10 s each at 98C and respective annealing temperatures) in a CFX96 Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Feldkirchen, Germany). The meltingcurve of the product was analyzed by heating the samples from 65C to 95C in 0.5Cincrements with a 5 s incubation period at each step. The PCR efÔ¨Åciency was veriÔ¨Åed usingthe LinRegPCR tool [ 32]. Relative change in the expression of the targets was calculatedthrough the ‚Äòdelta-delta Ct‚Äô method using gapA gene ( azo2837 ) as the internal reference.A list of gene-speciÔ¨Åc primers and annealing temperatures for each pair are provided inTable S1.3. Results and Discussion3.1. New Information on the Transcriptome under N 2-Fixing Conditions Provided by RNA-SeqCompared to Previous Microarray-Based Transcriptome AnalysesIn this study, we performed a directional RNA-Seq analysis to compare the tran-scriptome of diazotrophic Azoarcus olearius BH72 grown microaerobically under N 2-Ô¨Åxingand non-Ô¨Åxing conditions (with ammonium chloride as nitrogen source). Cells and RNAwere obtained from three independent experiments for each condition. The RNA-Seqapproach yielded more than 10 million reads for each processed sample. Out of these,83‚Äì88% of the reads aligned to the genome of Azoarcus (Table S3). For this study, we onlyconsidered the reads that aligned uniquely along the sense strand of the annotated genes.Under N 2-Ô¨Åxing and ammonium-grown conditions, 3221 and 3094 open reading frames(ORFs), respectively, were detected to be transcribed with a minimum reads per Kilobaseper Million mapped reads (RPKM) value of 10 in all three biological replicates. Together,this constituted 3300 unique ORFs (82% of the 3989 annotated ORFs). As expected, theEuclidean distance between the samples, using the count data after variance-stabilizedtransformation, indicated a closer relationship between the biological replicates grown inthe same conditions compared to the distance between the replicates from different growthconditions (Figure S1).Using the DESeq2 tool [ 31], differential expression analysis of the data revealed966 genes (24% of the annotated genes) to be signiÔ¨Åcantly regulated with the criteria of afold-change more than 1.8 and a Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg adjusted p-value (padj) less than0.05 (Table S4). Out of these, 533 and 433 genes were up-and down-regulated under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions, respectively. Only a couple of previous studies have utilized similarMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 5 of 20RNA-Seq platforms to explore the transcriptome under diazotrophic growth. In the Gram-negative bacterium A. vinelandii , almost 30% of the annotated genes were identiÔ¨Åed tobe differentially regulated (fold-change > 2 and adjusted p-value < 0.01) under N 2-Ô¨Åxingconditions [ 25]. In Paenibacillus sp. WLY78, an astounding 60% of the annotated genes werereported to be differentially regulated (fold-change > 2 and p-value < 0.05) under N 2-Ô¨Åxingconditions [ 26]. In contrast to our analysis, this study used aerobically (21% O 2) grownculture as the control. Hence, a considerable portion of the genes that were detected tobe differentially expressed might be functionally important for growth at high versus lowoxygen concentrations. In a microarray-based transcriptome study in Azoarcus , we showedthat at least 8.7% of the annotated ORFs were differentially expressed during microaerobicgrowth when compared to aerobic conditions [33].We had previously compared the transcriptome of N 2-Ô¨Åxing and ammonium-grownA. olearius using the microarray approach under otherwise comparable experimental condi-tions [ 10]. This study identiÔ¨Åed 523 genes to be differentially regulated. Roughly, twicethis quantity has been identiÔ¨Åed by the current RNA-Seq approach (Figure 1). As shownin Figure S2, 751 genes were uniquely identiÔ¨Åed using RNA-Seq alone. These additionaldata shed a brighter light on the currently unknown differentially expressed genes (DEGs)during the diazotrophic growth of A. olearius . DEGs uniquely identiÔ¨Åed by RNA-Seqincluded genes that encoded for proteins involved in vital pathways such as those fornitrogen assimilation, energy production, motility, and vitamin biosynthesis.Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 20   Using the DESeq2 tool [31], differential expr ession analysis of the data revealed 966 genes (24% of the annotated gene s) to be significantly regulated with the criteria of a fold-change more than 1.8 and a Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05 (Table S4).

Different outputs from RNA-Seq and microarrayapproaches have been observed in previous studies that compared these methodologieswhile analyzing the transcriptome of various organisms [ 19‚Äì24]. In all of these studies,RNA-Seq detected more differentially expressed genes than microarray approaches, lead-Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 6 of 20ing to the identiÔ¨Åcation of additional regulatory pathways. This could be attributed tolimitations of microarrays such as cross-hybridization, non-speciÔ¨Åc-hybridization, and alower detection range. RNA-Seq overcomes these limitations with its higher sensitivity,speciÔ¨Åcity, and increased dynamic range of detection.Henceforth in this article, regulation, both up and down, will refer to the differentialexpression observed under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions. To further comprehend the list of DEGsdetected by RNA-Seq, we classiÔ¨Åed them based on the cluster of orthologous groups(COGs) of the proteins encoded by them (Figure 2). A larger fraction of the genes encodedfor proteins that were either poorly characterized or were without any assigned functionalcategory. Among the functionally deÔ¨Åned categories, cell motility (N), energy metabolism(C), and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P) had relatively more enhanced expres-sion than suppression. With this basic classiÔ¨Åcation, it appears that Azoarcus is more activein generating energy to Ô¨Åx nitrogen and being motile. To fulÔ¨Åll energy demands, Azoarcusprobably diverts resources from other metabolic activities. Accordingly, translation ma-chinery (J), coenzyme metabolism (H), and replication and recombination machinery (L)had a higher frequency of down-regulation.

The Higher Sensitivity of RNA-Seq ConÔ¨Årms Known Regulation PatternsMicroarray analysis had already provided a glimpse of gene expression activity duringN2-Ô¨Åxation. It detected the enhanced transcription of several genes within the nitrogenÔ¨Åxation cluster ( nif-cluster). This included the genes that are responsible for the regulationof nitrogenase genes, FeMo cofactor synthesis, nitrogenase synthesis, and electron transport.Still, microarrays did not detect the regulation of all of the corresponding genes. Enhancedexpression of important genes such as nifL,nifH ,nifK,nifU, and fdxD were not detected.This shortfall was overcome by the robust and more sensitive RNA-Seq method, whichdetected most of the genes within this cluster to be differentially regulated (Figure 3a).The gene draG1 was found to be 19-fold up-regulated under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions byusing transcriptional reporter gene fusion assays [ 16]. This was similar to the 24-foldup-regulation detected in the current study. Still, some genes within the cluster were notdetected, even by RNA-Seq, to be differentially expressed. One among them, draT , wasshown to not be responsive to N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions by Northern blot analysis [ 16]. Thisstudy proposed that draT is part of a polycistronic mRNA along with the downstream genesazo0536 and dcrH1 . Contrary to this expectation, we detected both of the downstream genesto be up-regulated in both the RNA-Seq and microarray analyses. A potential secondarypromoter might aid in this regulation. RNA-Seq read alignment in this region supportedthis view (Figure S3). Remarkably, the four genes with the highest predicted fold-changesbelonged to the nif-cluster. nifH ,hesB, nifU, and rnfB1 were found to be 823-, 679-, 590-,and 516-fold up-regulated, respectively. This emphasizes the amount of effort taken by thebacterium to Ô¨Åx atmospheric nitrogen.Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 20    (a) ( b) ( c) Figure 3. RNA-Seq provides extensive coverage of DEGs in gene clusters under N 2-fixing conditions . Heat maps indicate the level of up- or down-regulation detected by microarray and RNA-Seq for the genes within clusters previously estab-lished to be regulated under nitrogen-fixing conditions: ( a) nitrogen fixation ( nif) cluster; ( b) hydrogenase uptake system, type 6 secretion system-1 (T6SS-1 , imp ), and type 2 secretion system (T2SS); ( c) ribosome subunits and two clusters of genes with varying functions.

Amon g them are the hydrogenase uptake system (hup and hyp genes) and type 2 as well as one of the two type 6 protein secretion systems (tss-1 or imp ) (Figure 3b). Type 6 protein secretion sy stems are particularly interesting, as they can inject effector proteins that may mo dulate host responses or interbacterial com-petition, and their gene expression is not known to be induced by N 2-fixation, except for A. olearius  BH72 [13]. This was also confirmed by transcriptional reporter gene fusion as-says for azo1299 (=tssK1 ), which demonstrated an 18-fold induction [13], similar to RNA-Seq. Along with the primary detection of regu lation, the differential  expression rate cal-culated from this study suggested a relatively stronger up-regulation than microarray analysis for the majority of th e overlapping genes (Figure 3a).

The Quest for Alternative Nitrogen  Sources during Nitrogen Fixation RNA-Seq data revealed the characteristics of strain BH72  during diazotrophic growth that were missed by microarray anal yses. Striking among them was the up-regu-lation of genes encoding proteins to assimila te nitrogen from other sources, even while fixing N 2. This included assimilatory nitrate reduction, high-affinity ammonium Figure 3. RNA-Seq provides extensive coverage of DEGs in gene clusters under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions.

Among them are the hydrogenase uptake system(hupand hypgenes) and type 2 as well as one of the two type 6 protein secretion systems ( tss-1 or imp ) (Figure 3b). Type 6 protein secretion systems are particularly interesting, as theycan inject effector proteins that may modulate host responses or interbacterial competition,and their gene expression is not known to be induced by N 2-Ô¨Åxation, except for A. oleariusBH72 [ 13]. This was also conÔ¨Årmed by transcriptional reporter gene fusion assays forazo1299 (=tssK1 ), which demonstrated an 18-fold induction [ 13], similar to RNA-Seq. Alongwith the primary detection of regulation, the differential expression rate calculated fromthis study suggested a relatively stronger up-regulation than microarray analysis for themajority of the overlapping genes (Figure 3a).We observed a similar trend in the genes that were suppressed, but they were scarceand less pronounced compared to the up-regulated genes (Figure 3c).3.3. The Quest for Alternative Nitrogen Sources during Nitrogen FixationRNA-Seq data revealed the characteristics of strain BH72 during diazotrophic growththat were missed by microarray analyses. Striking among them was the up-regulationof genes encoding proteins to assimilate nitrogen from other sources, even while Ô¨ÅxingN2. This included assimilatory nitrate reduction, high-afÔ¨Ånity ammonium transporters,and urea metabolism. For assimilatory nitrate reduction, A. olearius engaged the ABC-transporter NasFED to transport nitrate into the cytoplasm, where it is reduced to nitriteby NasA and NasC. Further, nitrite is commonly reduced to ammonium by the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase complex NirBD. Genes encoding for all of these proteins wereup-regulated by A. olearius . Additionally, genes encoding channels for nitrate/nitritetransport, narK, and nirC were also induced. All of these DEGs, except for narK , wereinduced by more than 50-fold; some of them reached over 200-fold (Figure 4). The inductionofnirB was also veriÔ¨Åed by RT-qPCR (Table S5). In most bacteria, assimilatory nitratereduction is controlled by the transcriptional regulators NtrBC and the nitrate-responsiveantitermination regulatory protein, NasR. [ 34‚Äì36]. This was also true for strain BH72,as a ntrBC knockout mutant had a relatively reduced expression of assimilatory nitratereductase compared to the wild type in the presence of nitrate [ 37]. Not only the presenceof nitrate, but just the absence of ammonium was shown to trigger the expression ofassimilatory nitrate reductase [ 34,36]. A combination of this might have led to the detectedenhanced expression in strain BH72. The beneÔ¨Åt of expressing this machinery at such highlevels is evident from high cost of ATP invested in N 2-Ô¨Åxation, making potential inputs ofmore economic nitrogen sources worthwhile.Less pronounced up-regulation was detected among high-afÔ¨Ånity ammonium trans-porters. A. olearius harbors four genes encoding high-afÔ¨Ånity ammonium transporters amtB ,amtD ,amtE, and amtY . AmtE is likely a ‚Äútransceptor‚Äù with regulatory functions becausethe protein combines a typical ammonium transporter at the N-terminus with sensoryGGDEF/EAL domains that are commonly involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of thesmall signaling molecule, cyclic di-GMP . Consequently, amtE expression was enhanced36-fold. Transcriptional reporter fusion assays have previously shown a similar trend, albeitwith a lower fold-change [ 17]. In an earlier study, amtB was shown to be co-transcribedwith glnK encoding for a P II-like protein [ 15]. Northern blot analysis revealed the enhancedexpression of this polycistronic transcript under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions [ 15], conÔ¨Årming the9- and 7-fold up-regulation detected by RNA-Seq for both amtB and glnK , respectively. Inaddition, the genes involved in urea metabolism were also detected to be up-regulated(Figure 4). Genes encoding for the ABC-transporter complex (AmiC2-UrtBCDE), the ure-ase complex (UreABC), and one accessory protein (UreD) were induced between 2- and8.8-fold.Recently, it was proposed [ 38] that in the absence of inorganic nitrogen, free-livingsoil diazotrophs might Ô¨Årst search for low molecular weight sources such as amino acids.This idea is well substantiated by our transcriptome analysis. RNA-Seq detected the up-Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 9 of 20regulation of several amino acid transport systems. This included the clusters encodingfor the putative polar amino acid transport ( azo2263 -azo2266 ), glutamate/aspartate trans-port ( glnHPMQ ), and three genes of the branched-chain amino acid transport ( azo1990 ,azo1991 ,azo3730 ). The article further proposes that the diazotrophs, while consumingthe low molecular weight nitrogen sources, might already start Ô¨Åxing N 2. N 2-Ô¨Åxation isconducted as a buffer until it shifts to the breakdown and assimilation of the abundanthigh molecular weight sources in the soil environment. They propose that the continuousenergy requirement of N 2-Ô¨Åxation might be a drawback in comparison to the assimilationof high molecular weight sources, which needs a one-off high investment. This hypothesisis further supported by previous studies describing pathways that exert tight control onN2-Ô¨Åxation and immediately switch-off nitrogenase activity upon detecting a sufÔ¨Åcientamount of ammonium [16,39,40].Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 20   transporters, and urea metabolism. Fo r assimilatory nitrate reduction, A. olearius  engaged the ABC-transporter NasFED to transport nitrat e into the cytoplasm, where it is reduced to nitrite by NasA and NasC. Further, nitrit e is commonly reduced to ammonium by the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase complex NirBD. Genes encoding for all of these pro-teins were up-regulated by A. olearius . Additionally, genes encoding channels for ni-trate/nitrite transport, narK,  and nirC  were also induced. All of these DEGs, except for narK , were induced by more than 50-fold; some of them reached over 200-fold (Figure 4). The induction of nirB was also verified by RT-qPCR (Table S5). In most bacteria, assimila-tory nitrate reduction is controlled by the tr anscriptional regulators NtrBC and the nitrate-responsive antitermination regulatory protein, NasR. [34‚Äì36]. This was also true for strain BH72, as a ntrBC knockout mutant had a relatively r educed expression of assimilatory nitrate reductase compared to the wild type in  the presence of nitrate [37]. Not only the presence of nitrate, but just the absence of ammonium was shown to trigger the expression of assimilatory nitrate reductase [34,36]. A co mbination of this might have led to the de-tected enhanced expression in strain BH72. Th e benefit of expressing this machinery at such high levels is evident from high cost of ATP invested in N 2-fixation, making potential inputs of more economic nitrogen sources worthwhile.  Figure 4. A. olearius BH72  prepares itself to assimilate other sources of combined nitrogen under N 2-fixing conditions.

The two parallel slanted lines indicate a reduction of the large genomic distance between two genes for this representation. Less pronounced up-regulation was detect ed among high-affinity ammonium trans-porters. A. olearius  harbors four genes encoding high-affinity ammonium transporters amtB , amtD , amtE,  and amtY . AmtE is likely a ‚Äútransceptor ‚Äù with regulatory functions be-cause the protein combines a typical ammonium transporter at the N-terminus with sen-sory GGDEF/EAL domains that are commonly involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of the small signaling molecule, cyclic di-GMP. Consequently, amtE  expression was en-hanced 36-fold. Transcriptional reporter fusion assays have previously shown a similar trend, albeit with a lower fold-change [17]. In an earlier study, amtB was shown to be co-transcribed with glnK  encoding for a P II-like protein [15]. Northern blot analysis revealed the enhanced expression of this polycistronic transcript under N 2-fixing conditions [15], confirming the 9- and 7-fold up-reg ulation detected by RNA-Seq for both amtB  and glnK , respectively. In addition, the genes involved in  urea metabolism were also detected to be up-regulated (Figure 4). Genes encoding for the ABC-transporter complex (AmiC2-Figure 4.

Arrows are drawn in proportion to the length, location, and orientation of the corresponding geneswithin the genome. The two parallel slanted lines indicate a reduction of the large genomic distance between two genes forthis representation.Even while Ô¨Åxing nitrogen, Azoarcus appears to search for low-cost nitrogen sources.A high, constant energy demand and the requirement to maintain a stable microaerobicenvironment for biological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation might favor this search. Although this modelsupports the behavior detected in our pure culture experiment, it would be interesting toexplore if and how Azoarcus modiÔ¨Åes this regulation once it is in a symbiotic relationshipwith plants.3.4. Motility Fostered by N 2-Deplete Environment‚ÄìSearch for More Favourable Niches?As discussed earlier, among the COG categories, cell motility has a higher proportionof enhanced expression than suppression. Strain BH72 contains at least 77 genes annotatedto be encoding for proteins related to the assembly and function of Ô¨Çagellar motilityand chemotaxis [ 41]. Out of these, 18 were detected to be signiÔ¨Åcantly up-regulated,with fold-change values between 1.8 and 4 (Figure 5 and Table S6). Looking closer, weidentiÔ¨Åed an additional 17 genes with signiÔ¨Åcant up-regulation (padj < 0.05) but with alower fold-change, between 1.5 and 1.8 (Table S6 and Figure 5). These genes were locatedwithin the Ô¨Çagellar clusters along with several genes that were more than 1.8-fold up-regulated. Hence, they were also considered to be true positives and were included in thisanalysis. Together, the expression of 35 genes in this module was found to be enhancedduring diazotrophic growth. Notable among them were the Ô¨ÇhDC genes encoding for theMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 10 of 20transcriptional regulators responsible for the expression of Ô¨Çagellar motility-related genes.Earlier studies have shown that the Ô¨ÇhDC operon in E. coli is regulated by RpoN and that arpoN knockout mutant had a reduced expression of Ô¨Çagellar related genes with a concurrentreduction in motility [ 42,43]. Next, a gene encoding for the Ô¨Çagellin ( Ô¨ÇiC3 ) was also foundto be induced. Strain BH72 contains three paralogs that encode Ô¨Çagellins. The Ô¨Çagellinencoded by Ô¨ÇiC3 was found to be the major constituent of the Ô¨Çagellar structure and to beresponsible for swarming activity [ 44]. In E. coli ,Ô¨ÇiCwas found to be up-regulated duringN2starvation, and a subsequent CHIP-Seq analysis revealed the binding of NtrC to thepromoter sequence of Ô¨ÇiC[45]. These earlier studies indicated the involvement of the globalregulators of nitrogen response, RpoN and NtrC, in the expression of Ô¨Çagellar related genes.These regulators might perform a similar role in strain BH72 under N 2-Ô¨Åxation.Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20    Figure 5. A. olearius  BH72 shows differential expression of motility-related machineries under N 2-fixing conditions. Graphic represents the genomic organization of the genes rela ted to the assembly and function of flagellar motility and type IV pili. The color of each arrow indicates the fold change of up-regulation for the respective gene under N 2-fixing conditions calculated through the RNA-Se q analysis. Arrows are drawn in proporti on to the length, location, and orien-tation of the corresponding genes within the genome. The two parallel slanted lines indicate a reduction of the large ge-nomic distance between two genes for this representation. Similar to the above regulation, the expressi on of genes encoding the type IV pili machinery was also detected to be induced (Figure 5 and Table S6). Among the fifteen genes that were significantl y up-regulated, eight had a fold-change between 1.8 and 4, while the rest had a fold-change between 1.5 and 1.8 (Figure 5 and Table S6). Interestingly, the expression of pilS, which is located upstream of the pilAB  operon, was found to be suppressed by 1.79-fold (Table S6). Previously, in strain BH72, PilS, a NtrC family sensor histidine kinase, was shown to have a strong negative effect on the expression of the pilin PilAB [46]. In the same study, a pilS knockout mutant exhibited increased pilin expression under high cell density growth conditions compared to the wild type. Accordingly, its suppression during diazotrophic growth might cause the enhanced expression of the pili structural genes. Overall, under N2-fixation A. olearius  strain BH72 appears to be more motile com-pared to N-replete conditions. the organism is likely searching for a suitable growth envi-ronment. Here, a suitable cond ition could depend on at least two variables. The first var-iable is the concentration of oxygen, as a stea dy microaerobic environment has to be main-tained to create a balance between respiratio n and the inhibition of  nitrogenase. The sec-ond factor is the availability of low-cost nitrogen sources, as previously discussed.   Figure 5. A. olearius BH72 shows differential expression of motility-related machineries under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions. Graphicrepresents the genomic organization of the genes related to the assembly and function of Ô¨Çagellar motility and type IVpili.

Interestingly,the expression of pilS, which is located upstream of the pilAB operon, was found to besuppressed by 1.79-fold (Table S6). Previously, in strain BH72, PilS, a NtrC family sensorhistidine kinase, was shown to have a strong negative effect on the expression of the pilinPilAB [ 46]. In the same study, a pilSknockout mutant exhibited increased pilin expressionMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 11 of 20under high cell density growth conditions compared to the wild type. Accordingly, itssuppression during diazotrophic growth might cause the enhanced expression of the pilistructural genes.Overall, under N 2-Ô¨Åxation A. olearius strain BH72 appears to be more motile comparedto N-replete conditions. the organism is likely searching for a suitable growth environment.Here, a suitable condition could depend on at least two variables. The Ô¨Årst variable is theconcentration of oxygen, as a steady microaerobic environment has to be maintained tocreate a balance between respiration and the inhibition of nitrogenase. The second factor isthe availability of low-cost nitrogen sources, as previously discussed.3.5. Increased Energy Requirements under Diazotrophic ReÔ¨Çected in TranscriptomeBiological nitrogen Ô¨Åxation is an energy-intensive process, as reducing each moleof nitrogen requires at least 16 moles of ATP . Along with Ô¨Åxing N 2, strain BH72 spendsadditional energy in search of other nitrogen sources and better environments. The com-bined energy demand of these activities probably exerts a higher pressure on the energymetabolism of the bacteria. It was observed that an E. coli strain, when engineered toÔ¨Åx N 2, shifted its metabolic Ô¨Çux from the TCA cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway(PPP) and ethanol fermentation. The authors hypothesize that this shift could potentiallyaid in the rapid response to energy demand [ 18]. However, Azoarcus does not encodeglucose transporters [ 41] and cannot utilize carbohydrates for growth [ 3]. Hence, in strainBH72, PPP may not be of assistance to rapidly meet the energy demand under N 2-Ô¨Åxation.Therefore, we looked at other means of carbon assimilation and energy production.Strain BH72 encodes transporters of dicarboxylic acids [ 41] and has also been shownto utilize these acids for growth [ 3]. Thus, we used malate as a carbon source in thisstudy. Within the bacterium, malate is converted to acetyl-Co-A and is then consumedthrough the TCA cycle. Our previous microarray analysis indicated a general tendencyof reduced expression in genes involved in the TCA cycle and in the Embden‚ÄìMeyerhof‚ÄìParnas pathway (EMP). However, RNA-Seq detected an enhanced expression of 12 genesthat are involved in malate conversion and the TCA cycle (Figure 6, Table S7). Again, weconsidered the genes with a fold-change above 1.5 to be signiÔ¨Åcantly regulated (Table S7).The TCA cycle, in addition to energy production, synthesizes 2-oxoglutarate, an importantcarbon skeleton for nitrogen assimilation. Furthermore, studies on rhizobia have indicatedthe relationship between several TCA cycle enzymes and N 2-Ô¨Åxation within root nodules.SpeciÔ¨Åcally, mutants of S. meliloti in genes encoding for isocitrate dehydrogenase ( icd),2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase ( gltA) formed root nodules but didnot Ô¨Åx nitrogen [ 47‚Äì50]. Concordantly, RNA-Seq detected the above three genes to beup-regulated in strain BH72.Surprisingly, two subunits of succinate dehydrogenase ( sdhC and sdhD ) were detectedto be down-regulated by 1.7-fold. This enzyme is also involved in quinone reductionfor oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, with the exception of a few isolated genes,we did not detect any clear induction or suppression pattern among the genes encod-ing for the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. It is most likely that theirexpression is restricted due to the limited availability of the electron acceptor, oxygen,under microaerobic conditions. In turn, this limits the generation of ATP . Additionally,not regenerating the reducing equivalents could indirectly affect the Ô¨Çux through the TCAcycle. Studies have shown that bacteria with reduced oxidative metabolism or a high redoxratio (NADH/NAD) increases the metabolic Ô¨Çux through the overÔ¨Çow metabolism [ 51‚Äì53].In this pathway, acetyl-Co-A is converted to acetate in a two-step process yielding anATP molecule by means of substrate-level phosphorylation. Concordantly, in strain BH72,RNA-Seq detected up-regulation for both genes involved in this pathway, pta(encodingfor phosphate acetyltransferase) and ackA (encoding for acetate kinase) (Figure 6). Inter-estingly, even in the ammonium-grown condition, ptawas detected to be induced undermicroaerobic growth when compared to aerobic growth [33].Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 12 of 20Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 20   3.5. Increased Energy Requirements under Diazotrophic Reflected  in Transcriptome Biological nitrogen fixation is an energy-intensive process, as reducing each mole of nitrogen requires at least 16 moles of ATP. Along with fixing N 2, strain BH72 spends ad-ditional energy in search of other nitrogen sources and better environments. The com-bined energy demand of these activities probably exerts a higher pressure on the energy metabolism of the bacteria. It was observed that an E. coli  strain, when engineered to fix N2, shifted its metabolic flux from the TCA cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and ethanol fermentation. The authors hypothesiz e that this shift could potentially aid in the rapid response to energy demand [18]. However, Azoarcus  does not encode glucose transporters [41] and cannot utilize carbohydrates for growth [3].

Strain BH72  encodes transporters of dicarboxylic acids [41] and has also been shown to utilize these acids for growth [3]. Thus, we used malate as a carbon source in this study. Within the bacterium, malate is converted to  acetyl-Co-A and is then consumed through the TCA cycle. Our previous microarray analysis indicated a general tendency of reduced expression in genes involved in the TCA cy cle and in the Embden‚ÄìMeyerhof‚ÄìParnas path-way (EMP). However, RNA-Seq detected an enhanced expression of 12 genes that are involved in malate conversion and the TCA cycl e (Figure 6, Table S7). Again, we consid-ered the genes with a fold-change above 1.5 to be significantly regulated (Table S7). The TCA cycle, in addition to energy production, synthesizes 2-oxoglutarate, an important carbon skeleton for nitrogen assimilation. Fu rthermore, studies on rhizobia have indi-cated the relationship between several TCA cycle enzymes and N2-fixation within root nodules. Specifically, mutants of S. meliloti  in genes encoding for isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase ( gltA) formed root nodules but did not fix nitrogen [47‚Äì50]. Concordantly, RNA-Seq detected the above three genes to be up-regulated in strain BH72.  Figure 6. Regulation in carbon metabolism during diazotrophic growth. Flow chart represents the enzymes (ovals) and metabolites (black rectangles) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA ) cycle, overflow metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis path-ways.

Surprisingly, two subunits of succinate dehydrogenase ( sdhC  and sdhD ) were de-tected to be down-regulated by 1.7-fold. This enzyme is also involved in quinone reduc-tion for oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, with the exception of a few isolated Figure 6.

Extent of up- or down-regulation during diazotrophic growth are denoted by shades of red and blue, respectively.Green rectangles demarcate the different pathways.To reduce the redox ratio, N 2-Ô¨Åxing bacteria utilize the lipid biogenesis pathways thatsynthesize poly-√ü-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), fatty acids, or both [ 54‚Äì56]. Synthesizing thesecompounds during nitrogen limitations also provides a competitive edge for the bacteria bystoring excess carbon for later consumption [ 55]. It has previously been shown that strainBH72 synthesizes PHB under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions [ 57]. In the present work, RNA-Seqdetected the induction a gene involved in this synthesis, phbC2 . This gene encodes forPHB synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the Ô¨Ånal step in the three-step synthesis of PHBfrom acetyl-CoA. Moreover, the induction of two probable phasins ( azo0789 ,azo3815 ) wasalso detected. In B. japonicum , it was shown that the phasins were more important in PHBaccumulation than the metabolic enzymes involved in their synthesis [ 58]. Concerning fattyacid metabolism, in strain BH72, all but two genes involved in their synthesis were found tobe repressed (Figure 6). Nevertheless, these genes were only suppressed between 1.8-and3-fold. This minor suppression probably helps in maintaining the fatty acid synthesis thatis sufÔ¨Åcient enough to meet other cellular needs.The suppression of two enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was de-tected. The genes for transketolase (Tkt) and ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (PrsA)were 1.9-and 4.4-fold suppressed, respectively. As the products of PPP are substratesfor several synthetic pathways, its suppression could have ramiÔ¨Åcations on downstreammetabolisms such as those for purine and riboÔ¨Çavin synthesis (discussed later).Overall, it seems that activities under diazotrophic growth probably demand increasedenergy production and that strain BH72 responded to the high energy demand by inducingthe expression of TCA cycle components. Nevertheless, growth under oxygen-limitedconditions restricts the capacity of oxidative phosphorylation, thereby increasing the redoxratio and, in turn, limiting the TCA cycle. Strain BH72 may overcome this hurdle by theinduction of overÔ¨Çow metabolism and PHB synthesis.3.6. Suppression of Vitamin Biosynthesis during N 2-FixationMany microorganisms encode the machinery for cobalamin (Vitamin B 12) synthesis, acofactor for vital metabolic enzymes. A cobalamin-dependent ribonucleotide reductaseMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 13 of 20is essential for the plant colonization of S. meliloti [59]. However, in strain BH72, thegenes involved in the synthesis of cobalamin were detected to be suppressed (Figure 7and Table S8). Knowledge on the relationship between cobalamin synthesis and biologicalnitrogen Ô¨Åxation is scarce. In A. vinelandii , cobalamin synthesis was more dependent on theconcentration of cobalt than on the availability of combined nitrogen [ 60,61]. Additionally,it was able to grow and Ô¨Åx nitrogen even with negligible vitamin B 12activity [61].Microorganisms 2021 , 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20   this module could function independently to synthesize riboflavin for different purposes [64]. Likewise, strain BH72 has another copy of the gene encoding for GTP cyclohydrolase II (ribA, azo3765 ), which was induced by 34-fold, which may act complementarily. Both synthetic pathways are linked; riboflav in is a substrate for cobalamin synthesis. Hence, reduction in riboflavin synthesis might limit the substrate availability for cobala-min synthesis and might be in line with the su ppression of the respective synthetic genes. Looking closer, RNA-Seq detected suppression in a sequence of pathways from PPP to cobalamin synthesis. Repression of the genes involved in PPP might reduce the availabil-ity of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyro phosphate (PRPP), which is a substrate for purine synthe-sis. Subsequently, we detected genes involved in  the purine biosynthesis to be down-reg-ulated (Table S8). This would reduce the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP along with ribulose 5-phos phate (from PPP) are substrates for the synthesis of ribo-flavin. Hence, the limited availability of these two substrates might suppress riboflavin synthesis. As mentioned earlier, lower quantities of riboflavin could impact cobalamin synthesis. Therefore, reduced flux through PPP under N2-fixing conditions might be re-sponsible for the repression of riboflavin an d cobalamin synthesis. The relationship be-tween GTP availability and riboflavin  synthesis has been elucidated in Bacillus subtilis [65,66]. In these studies, riboflavin production was enhanced by deregulating the purine pathway and by suppressing ribonucleotide re ductase, which competes for the GTP pre-cursor. In summary, the repercussions of N 2-fixation probably lead to the suppression of vitamin biosynthesis.  Figure 7. Regulation in riboflavin and cobalamin synthesis under N 2-fixation. Flow chart represents the enzymes (ovals) and metabolites (black rectangl es) in the riboflavin and cobalamin synthesis. The color of each enzyme indicates the fold chan ge in the expression of the corresponding gene detected by RNA-Seq analysis. The extent of down-regulation during diazotrophic growth is Figure 7. Regulation in riboÔ¨Çavin and cobalamin synthesis under N 2-Ô¨Åxation. Flow chart representsthe enzymes (ovals) and metabolites (black rectangles) in the riboÔ¨Çavin and cobalamin synthesis. Thecolor of each enzyme indicates the fold change in the expression of the corresponding gene detectedby RNA-Seq analysis. The extent of down-regulation during diazotrophic growth is denoted by blueshades. The dashed arrow encompasses several enzymatic steps, among which only two correspond-ing genes were detected to be differentially expressed. Dashed rectangles are pathways that generatethe substrates for vitamin biosynthesis. Green rectangles demarcate the different pathways.Similarly, the genes involved in riboÔ¨Çavin (Vitamin B 2) synthesis were detected to bedown-regulated (Figure 7 and Table S8). RiboÔ¨Çavin or its derivatives have been shownto enhance alfalfa root colonization by S. meliloti and to also have effects on plant growthpromotion traits [ 62,63]. Considering that we detected the regulation of genes that may beinvolved in plant colonization under N 2-Ô¨Åxation, the suppression of riboÔ¨Çavin synthesis ap-pears to be counter-intuitive. Nonetheless, Garcia-Angulo suggests that the paralogs of thismodule could function independently to synthesize riboÔ¨Çavin for different purposes [ 64].Microorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 14 of 20Likewise, strain BH72 has another copy of the gene encoding for GTP cyclohydrolase II(ribA,azo3765 ), which was induced by 34-fold, which may act complementarily.Both synthetic pathways are linked; riboÔ¨Çavin is a substrate for cobalamin synthesis.Hence, reduction in riboÔ¨Çavin synthesis might limit the substrate availability for cobalaminsynthesis and might be in line with the suppression of the respective synthetic genes.Looking closer, RNA-Seq detected suppression in a sequence of pathways from PPP tocobalamin synthesis. Repression of the genes involved in PPP might reduce the availabilityof 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is a substrate for purine synthesis.Subsequently, we detected genes involved in the purine biosynthesis to be down-regulated(Table S8). This would reduce the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTPalong with ribulose 5-phosphate (from PPP) are substrates for the synthesis of riboÔ¨Çavin.Hence, the limited availability of these two substrates might suppress riboÔ¨Çavin synthesis.As mentioned earlier, lower quantities of riboÔ¨Çavin could impact cobalamin synthesis.Therefore, reduced Ô¨Çux through PPP under N 2-Ô¨Åxing conditions might be responsiblefor the repression of riboÔ¨Çavin and cobalamin synthesis. The relationship between GTPavailability and riboÔ¨Çavin synthesis has been elucidated in Bacillus subtilis [65,66]. In thesestudies, riboÔ¨Çavin production was enhanced by deregulating the purine pathway and bysuppressing ribonucleotide reductase, which competes for the GTP precursor. In summary,the repercussions of N 2-Ô¨Åxation probably lead to the suppression of vitamin biosynthesis.3.7. Down-Regulation of Ribosomal Genes Corresponding to Decreased Growth RatesWe had previously highlighted DEGs encoding for proteins involved in translation(COG category J). In total, 51 genes encoding for proteins related to ribosome biogenesis andfunctioning were found to be down-regulated (Table S9). The list also included enzymesthat conduct rRNA modiÔ¨Åcation, ribosomal protein modiÔ¨Åcation, and other maturationfactors. Considering the energy scenario outlined earlier, bacteria could conserve energy bysuppressing these activities, thereby supporting N 2-Ô¨Åxation, which is in accordance withthe reduced growth rate of strain BH72 under N 2-Ô¨Åxation in comparison to ammonium-grown conditions [15].3.8. Differential Expression of Transcriptional RegulatorsRNA-Seq detected 33 DEGs that encode transcriptional factors and response regula-tors. Out of these, 23 were induced, and 10 were suppressed (Table S10). For eleven of theabove-detected response regulators, their cognate histidine kinases were also signiÔ¨Åcantlymodulated, albeit with varying strengths (Table S10, directly below the correspondingresponse regulator). The strongest induction was detected for nifA (80-fold) coding for thetranscriptional activator of the nifgenes. ntrC ,hoxA, and modE were the other well studiedinduced regulators. They have an established link to nitrogen metabolism or nitrogenÔ¨Åxation. HoxA, a hydrogenase transcriptional regulatory protein, regulates the expressionof structural genes for the hydrogenase uptake system in free-living B. japonicum andRhodopseudomonas palustris [67‚Äì69]. In accordance with this, we also detected the inductionof several genes of the hydrogenase uptake system (Figure 3b). The induction of one ofthose genes, hupS , was also substantiated by RT-qPCR (Table S5). Hydrogenase uptake reox-idizes H 2, the by-product of N 2-Ô¨Åxation, and regenerates the reducing power. This processincreases the efÔ¨Åciency of N 2-Ô¨Åxation [ 70]. ModE, the molybdate transport system regula-tory protein, represses the expression of the high-afÔ¨Ånity molybdate transporter ( modABCD )genes at high molybdate concentrations [ 71‚Äì73]. In strain BH72, the modE gene is located inthe same cluster as the genes encoding for the transporter ( modA1B1C1 ). Correspondingly,RNA-Seq detected the induction of all of these genes. A similar regulation was also de-tected for modD , which was located outside of this cluster. Studies in Azotobacter vinelandii ,Paenibacillus sp. WLY78, and Rhodobacter capsulatus have shown that the expression ofmodABC is coordinated with the expression of the Mo-Nitrogenase genes [ 25,26,74]. Ad-ditionally, the loss of modA impaired the Mo-Nitrogenase activity of B. japonicum withinthe root nodules of soybean plants under Mo-limiting conditions [ 75]. Strain BH72 onlyMicroorganisms 2021 ,9, 1888 15 of 20encodes for the iron‚Äìmolybdenum cofactor (FeMoCo) dependent nitrogenase. Hence, theregulation of the molybdate transporter system may also be related to nitrogen metabolism.In the future, it would be interesting to discern the roles of other transcriptional regulators,such as azo1949 and azo2458 , that are 20-and 5-fold induced, respectively.Only seven of the above regulators were previously detected by the microarray method(Table S10). Among them, azo2893 was identiÔ¨Åed by RNA-Seq to be repressed, while themicroarray had indicated an induction. RT-qPCR analysis of the samples used for RNA-Seqsubstantiated the detected repression (Table S5).3.9. Preparing for Sustained N StarvationRNA-Seq detected two neighboring genes, prkA and yeaH , to be induced duringdiazotrophic growth. PrkA shares 77% of its amino acid sequence identity with theE. coli YeaG and contains the same domain organization as a regulatory protein (serinekinase). Additionally, in E. coli , both yeaG and yeaH are present within the same cluster.The promoter of yeaG was bound by NtrC under N-starvation [ 45]. Subsequently, theexpression of both of these genes was found to be enhanced under N-starvation [ 76].The absence of either of these genes led to the loss of heterogeneity in metabolic activityduring prolonged N-starvation [ 76]. The heterogeneity of the bacterial population duringprolonged starvation could help them to overcome the adverse conditions. This mechanismis termed ‚Äúbet-hedging‚Äù [ 77]. The experimental setup used in this study can probably notbe classiÔ¨Åed as prolonged N-starvation. Nonetheless, strain BH72 appears to be graduallypreparing for such situations.Strong induction was detected for the cluster of three genes ( azo2278 ,azo2279, andazo2280 ) encoding for hypothetical proteins (490-, 373-, and 443-fold, respectively). Azo2278has two predicted nitroreductase domains, albeit with very low similarity. Azo2280 seemsto be unique to the Azoarcus genus, while the Ô¨Årst two genes were widespread amongprokaryotes. Considering the variety of functions performed by proteins containing ni-troreductase domains [ 78] and the extent of regulation observed in strain BH72, the notionof further investigation into their roles and relationship to N 2-Ô¨Åxation is compelling.4. ConclusionsWith the new data from the reported RNA-Seq analysis, strain BH72 appears tosupport a N 2-Ô¨Åxation lifestyle through inducing carbon metabolism and motility and bysuppressing translation and vitamin biosynthesis (Figure 8). Still, it is well prepared toutilize alternative economic N-sources such as nitrate, urea, or amino acids (Figure 8). Thus,RNA-Seq has provided a better understanding of the transcriptome during diazotrophicgrowth and thus of the complex lifestyle of coping with N 2as a N-source. Simultaneously,it has ignited the quest to explore the role of non-coding RNA under N 2-Ô¨Åxation and theregulation of N-assimilation in an endophytic lifestyle. The directional RNA-Seq used inthis study revealed the transcription of several antisense and small RNAs. This has beenrecently reported in several prokaryotes as well [ 79‚Äì81].
