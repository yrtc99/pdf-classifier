Gaining access to these resources requires biotrophic f ungi to breach plant cell walls without eliciting substantial plant defen ces. Theplant cell wall is composed mostly of glucose- and xylose-based polysaccharides, which can support fungal growth. Thus, fungi can acquire carboncompounds through the targeted depolymerization of speci ﬁc wall components. When the plant cell wall is breached, biotrophs redirect photoassimi-lates, increase sink strengths, and express invertases and transporters to acquire carbon compounds. Transitions in enzyme and transporter expres sionduring pathogenesis must be tightly controlled to ensure a continued s upply of carbon compounds. This review describes carbon acquisition andmetabolism, including regulation of available carbon source utilizatio n mechanisms such as carbon catabolite repression. While carbon acquisiti on hasbeen extensively studied in the ascomycetes, the mechanisms used by biotrophic fungi to acquire carbon during pathogenesis are poorly understood.Furthermore, the relationship between plant cell wall-degrading enzym es and carbon acquisition in biotrophic fungal pathogens is not well charact erized.As such, this review summarizes the current knowledge of carbon source utilization by fungal pathogens, with an emphasis on research involving thecorn smut pathogen Ustilago maydis , and provides a basis from which to extend our knowledge in this key area of fungal plant pathogenesis.Keywords: carbon catabolite repression, cell wall-degrading enzymes, corn smut, fungal carbon metabolism, plant pathogen, Ustilago maydisRésumé: Durant le cycle de la maladie de la plante, les agents pathogènes fongiques biotrophes doivent obtenir de leur hôte les molécules de carbonequi lui serviront d ’éléments constitutifs et de source d ’énergie. Pour accéder à ces ressources, le champignon biotrophe doit percer la membranecellulaire sans pour cela déclencher une réaction de défense vigoureuse de la plante. La membrane cellulaire est composée principalement depolysaccharides constitués de glucose et de xylose qui peuvent supporter la croissance des champignons. Ainsi, les champignons peuvent obtenir lescomposés de carbone par la dépolymérisation ciblée de composants précis de la membrane. Lorsque la membrane de la plante est percée, l ’agentbiotrophe redirige les photoassimilats, accroît l ’intensité du puits et extrait les invertases et les transporteurs a ﬁnd’obtenir les composés de carbonerequis. Les transitions relatives à l ’expression des enzymes et des transporteurs durant la pathogenèse doivent être étroitement contrôlées a ﬁnd’assurer un approvisionnement continu en carbone. Cet article décrit l ’acquisition et le métabolisme du carbone, y compris la régulation desmécanismes d ’utilisation des sources de carbone disponibles, telle la répression catabolique du carbone.

This meansthat biotrophic fungi must breach cell walls and accesssufﬁcient carbon sources in the plant to enable fungalgrowth, but do so in a manner that is not so damagingas to elicit dramatic protection responses from the plant,such as a hypersensitive response (Heath 1998 ).Surprisingly, little is known about how fungal biotrophsmodulate the process of carbon acquisition. In contrast,there is a wealth of knowledge regarding carbon acquisi-tion and carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in severalmodel ascomycete fungi and substantial information onthe biotechnological use of cell wall-degrading enzymesfrom fungi (reviewed in Ruijter & Visser 1997 ; de Vries2003 ; van den Brink & de Vries 2011 ; Brown et al.2014 ). This review seeks to examine how carbon acquisi-tion is modi ﬁed by biotrophic fungi during pathogenicdevelopment in plants. The model biotroph Ustilagomaydis is used to frame the discussions relating to carbonsources in plant tissues, enzymatic digestion of plantbarriers, carbon uptake and metabolism, carbon cataboliterepression, and how all of this relates to biotrophic plantpathogenesis and symptom development of corn smut.Plant cell wall degradation and carbon acquisition byfungiFungi must obtain carbon from their local environmentand, in the case of biotrophic pathogens, this environmentis a living host plant. Carbon compounds, which areabundant in plant cell walls, can be accessed by fungithrough the secretion of cell wall-degrading enzymes(CWDEs). During entry into and growth within theplant, CWDEs are released by the fungus, facilitatingcell wall breakdown and hyphal extension between and,in the case of U. maydis , within plant cells (Banuett &Herskowitz 1996 ; reviewed in Rytioja et al. 2014 ).However, the free simple sugars and more complex poly-mers available inside plant cells and in the plant apoplastmay be more readily metabolized by fungi. Therefore, themechanisms by which fungi acquire carbon moleculesmay change as infection proceeds. Carbon sources thatare circulating through the plant or present in cells can beprocessed by invertases and taken up by fungal transpor-ters (reviewed in Doidy et al. 2012 ; Tauzin & Giardina2014 ). To provide context for discussing mechanisms ofcarbon acquisition by biotrophic fungi, and the enzymesinvolved, one must consider the nature of the carbonsources in the plant.Plant cell walls provide support and rigidity as well asprotection from invading microorganisms. The structuralcomplexes that form plant cell walls include cellulose,hemicellulose, pectin and lignin (reviewed in Mäkeläet al. 2014 ; Rytioja et al. 2014 ). As an example, thesecondary wall of a monocotyledonous plant such ascorn is often generalized as consisting of 35 –45% cellu-lose, 40 –50% hemicellulose, 0.1% pectin and 20% lignin,though the exact composition of the plant cell wall canvary with growth stage (Vogel 2008 ; Benatti et al. 2012 ).Celluloses are comprised of 1,4- β-linked glucose unitsthat are organized into linear micro ﬁbrils, which are crys-talline structures held together by intermolecular hydro-gen bonds that wrap around cells (Kolpak & Blackwell1976 ). Hemicelluloses, another abundant plant polysac-charide, include xylan, mannan or xyloglucan, whichcontain linked monosaccharide pentose or hexose mole-cules such as xylose, mannose and glucose, respectively(reviewed in Mäkelä et al. 2014 ). Other monomers suchas galactose, arabinose or glucuronic acid can also beattached to the main hemicellulose backbone (van denBrink & de Vries 2011 ). The less abundant pectin is aheterogenic polymer mostly comprised of α-1,4-linkedgalacturonic acid residues which provides additionalcross-link support between celluloses and hemicelluloses(reviewed in van den Brink & de Vries 2011 ). Finally,lignins are complex polymers that provide added supportto cell walls through cross-linking of celluloses, hemi-celluloses and pectins (Grabber et al. 2000 ). A number ofother reviews have provided excellent diagrams, outliningthe structure of plant cell walls and their degradation byenzymes. Readers are referred to Aro et al. ( 2005 ),Rytioja et al. ( 2014 ) and Malinovsky et al. ( 2016 ).Notably, van den Brink & de Vries ( 2011 ) provide sche-matic structures of speci ﬁc plant celluloses, hemicellu-loses and pectins that are very informative. In order toinfect plants, fungi secrete CWDEs, breaching the cellwalls through depolymerization of these polymeric com-ponents. Their actions facilitate entry into the host, whilealso releasing sugars that can be metabolized by theinfecting fungus.Investigation of fungal enzymes that can degrade plantcell wall components including cellulose, hemicelluloseand lignin has been the focus of researchers searching forK. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 248ways to degrade plant biomass or break down wood toprovide pulp. These CWDEs or carbohydrate-activeenzymes (CAZymes; Battaglia et al. 2011 ; van denBrink & de Vries 2011 ; Kubicek et al. 2014 ; Rytiojaet al. 2014 ) are secreted by fungi in their natural environ-ments to enable growth and reproduction. However, dueto the occupation of different ecological niches, fungivary in their carbon utilization patterns; enzymes thatare secreted during infection vary greatly depending onthe organism ’s natural niche (Brown et al. 2014 ), so thosesecreted during natural growth and reproduction can dif-fer from those secreted during the infection process.Broadly speaking, there are three major categories ofCAZymes: (i) glycoside (glycosyl) hydrolases (GHs),which hydrolyse glycosidic bonds between oligo- orpolysaccharides; (ii) carbohydrate esterases (CEs),which hydrolyse carbohydrate esters; and (iii) polysac-charide lyases (PLs), which cleave glycosidic linkagespresent in acidic polysaccharides (Lombard et al. 2014 ).Each CAZyme category consists of multiple families orgroupings containing enzymes with speci ﬁc activities,although differing families can also contain enzymeswith similar functions (van den Brink & de Vries 2011 ).Detail about each CAZyme family involved in cellulose,hemicellulose and pectin degradation is the subject ofmany other major reviews, including one by Kubiceket al. ( 2014 ). A focus here is to provide a review of theCWDEs/CAZymes present in plant pathogenic fungiincluding the model biotroph U. maydis .Ustilago maydis CWDEsFungi secrete proteins to facilitate communication withtheir surroundings, as well as to ensure acquisition ofnutrients. In plant pathogenic fungi, there are distinctdifferences in the pro ﬁles of secreted proteins dependingupon their nutritional lifestyles. For example, of thesecreted proteins identi ﬁed in U. maydis , only approxi-mately 25% are CWDEs, compared with about 50% inthe basidiomycete Pycnoporus cinnabarinus andPhanerochaete chrysosporium white-rot fungi (VandenWymelenberg et al. 2006 ; Couturier et al. 2012 ;Levasseur et al. 2014 ). The number of CWDEs in bio-trophs, including U. maydis , is also lower than in fungiwith other modes of pathogenesis (Zhao et al. 2013 ),suggesting that reduced cell wall degradation activity isa characteristic of biotrophs to limit damage to the hostand the subsequent elicitation of defence responses(Kämper et al. 2006 ; Mueller et al. 2008 ). Interestingly,a different view of CWDE production by U. maydis ispresented when considering the possible biotechnologicaluse of this fungus for biofuel production. Couturier et al.(2012 ) indicated that U. maydis is a surprisingly goodcandidate for industrial use due to the high prevalence ofproteins that hydrolyse hemicellulose and lignocellulosesinto soluble sugar molecules. Additionally, Geiser et al.(2016 ) illustrated the value of U. maydis for industrialbiomass degradation through manipulation of the promo-ters of intrinsic CWDEs, including those that bioconvertxylans and celluloses into fermentable sugars.Furthermore, secretome analysis of a sequenced basidio-mycete relative of U. maydis (Pseudozyma brasiliensis ;Oliveira et al. 2014 ) revealed that this species containsenzyme sets capable of breaking down major polysac-charides in plants, such as xylan, indicating it is also agood candidate for the biomass degradation industry(Kaupert Neto et al. 2016 ). These reports seem to contra-dict the concept that U. maydis , as a biotroph, has lowercell wall-degrading enzyme activity. However, the studiesmay also indicate that U. maydis targets its release ofsuites of highly effective CWDEs during biotrophicdevelopment.InU. maydis , sequencing the genome has enabled theidenti ﬁcation of secreted proteins, including CWDEs(Kämper et al. 2006 ; Mueller et al. 2008 ). However,variation in the approaches used has resulted in the iden-tiﬁcation of slightly different lists of CWDEs. Kämperet al. ( 2006 ) identi ﬁed 168 putative secreted enzymes, 33of which were CWDEs, and Doehlemann et al. ( 2008a )provided expression data for 26 of these CWDEs. Asubsequent investigation of the U. maydis secretome dis-covered 86 secreted proteins, 30 that were potentiallyinvolved in cell wall degradation (Couturier et al. 2012 ).Lanver et al. ( 2014 ) detected 37 U. maydis proteinspossibly involved in plant cell wall modi ﬁcation. Morespeciﬁcally, the CWDE repertoire of U. maydis includescellulose-degrading β-endoglucanase and β-glucosidaseenzymes, as well as a number of enzymes involved inprocessing xylan (Mueller et al. 2008 ; Battaglia et al.2011 ; Rytioja et al. 2014 ). This is likely due to the largeproportion of cellulose- and xylan-type molecules presentin the maize cell wall (Carpita et al. 2001 ). Additionally,enzymes that target plant cuticle tissue and lignin weredetected in the U. maydis secretome (Mueller et al. 2008 ).Ustilago maydis is not as well equipped with pectin-,xyloglucan- and galactomannan-associated enzymes(Battaglia et al. 2011 ), reﬂecting the limited presence ofthese types of molecules in maize tissue (Mueller et al.2008 ) and the fact that pectin degradation is only requiredfor apoplastic cavity development and not disease devel-opment throughout infection (Doehlemann et al. 2008a ).This last point emphasizes the concept of targeted expres-sion of potentially highly active enzymes. While genomesequencing reveals the presence of these enzymes, it doesCarbon utilization by biotrophic fungi in plants 249not indicate which ones are necessarily involved inpathogenesis.To determine which CWDEs may be involved in U. may-dispathogenic development, we combined expression datafrom Kämper et al. ( 2006), Doehlemann et al. ( 2008a )a n dSkibbe et al. ( 2010) to provide evidence of which cell-typesthe enzymes were transcribed in and whether the transcriptswere present during in planta growth. These data are pre-sented in Tables 1 and2, while a comprehensive list of allidenti ﬁedU. maydis CWDEs is presented in SupplementaryTable 1. It is noteworthy that the majority of the U. maydisCWDEs in this comprehensive list are members of theCAZyme category GH, along with some CEs, which is con-sistent with it being a biotroph. This group of enzymesimparts a diverse array of catalytic functions important forestablishing infection by facilitating hyphal penetration ofplant tissues through polysacch aride rearrangement in plantcell walls (Lanver et al. 2014; Rytioja et al. 2014).Ustilago maydis penetrates cells of the host plant(maize) through the production of an appressorium, aspecialized cell-type that facilitates breaching the cuticlelayer and cell wall by releasing enzymes that depolymer-ize plant cell wall components. Sixteen potential U. may-disCWDEs, including a number of GHs, have differentialtranscript representation during appressorium and ﬁla-ment formation ( Tables 1 and2; Lanver et al. 2014 ) andcorresponding lytic activity has been detected only atinfection sites and not in the surrounding healthy planttissue (Cano-Canchola et al. 2000 ). Notably, the expres-sion of two U. maydis α-L-arabinofuranosidases, oneGH51 and the other GH62 ( UMAG_01829, afg1 andUMAG_04309, afg3 , respectively), are up-regulated 12-fold and 4-fold in the appressorium, respectively. Theseenzymes act on arabinoxylan through depolymerization,releasing the constituent sugars arabinose and xylose.Interestingly, expression of afg1 was also over 1000times up-regulated at 5 days post-infection (DPI), andcontinued to be highly expressed in each tumour stageassessed, suggesting that there is a requirement todegrade arabinoxylan throughout the pathogenic cycle(Table 1 , Doehlemann et al. 2008a ). This gene expressionanalysis further revealed increased transcript levels ofCWDEs involved in cellulose and hemicellulose depoly-merization during U. maydis pathogenesis, whichoccurred at 5 DPI and was maintained throughout patho-genesis ( Table 1 ; Doehlemann et al. 2008a ). Two endox-ylanases, encoded by UMAG_04422 andUMAG_03411 ,were highly up-regulated at 5 DPI and 13 DPI, respec-tively ( Table 1 ; Doehlemann et al. 2008a ). Genes encod-ing enzymes for the degradation of cellulose andhemicellulose were up-regulated in a U. maydis –Arabidopsis thaliana infection model, where the funguscan grow, but not complete its sexual cycle (Méndez-Morán et al. 2005 ; Martínez-Soto et al. 2013 ). GH familyenzymes, which contribute to the depolymerization ofcellulose and arabinoxylan, were up-regulated duringthe initiation and progression of U. maydis infection.Though there is evidence that CWDEs, including GHs,are critical for the establishment and progression of infec-tion, the correlation between virulence and CWDEs is notalways clear. It was previously suggested that an endox-ylanase of U. maydis (UMAG_06350 ), an enzymeinvolved in the degradation of xylan, is not involved inU. maydis infection since its deletion resulted in a similargrowth phenotype to the wild-type strain (Geiser et al.2013 ). Similarly, deletion of the gene that encodes aGH45 family 1,4- β-endoglucanase ( egl1) that is highlyexpressed during ﬁlamentous growth and tumour devel-opment did not affect ﬁlamentation or pathogenicity(Schauwecker et al. 1995 ). Even a triple knockoutmutant, where three versions of eglwere deleted, wasno less virulent or pathogenic than the wild-type strain,and appressorium and ﬁlament formation was unaffected(Lanver et al. 2014 ). However, deletion of the α-L-arabi-nofuranosidases afg1, afg3 and afg2 (UMAG_00837 )yielded a triple mutant strain with reduced virulence andhost penetration ef ﬁciency, relative to wild-type strains(Lanver et al. 2014 ). The differences in reported ﬁndingsis likely due to functional redundancy of CWDEs, wheredeletion of one or two genes may be complemented bygenes encoding other similar enzymes. Coding an excessof CWDEs could mean that not all genes are required forpathogenesis. In this case, why would U. maydis containmultiple enzymes with redundant or overlapping func-tions? One explanation is to provide protection againstmutation since, with this redundancy, DNA sequencechanges in a single enzyme would not signi ﬁcantlyreduce the ability of U. maydis to complete its pathogeniccycle due to the presence of other similarly functioningenzymes. This redundancy would ensure that ability toinfect and acquire nutrients is protected in the fungus.CWDEs for fungal carbon metabolismUstilago maydis , and plant pathogenic fungi in general,require CWDEs to facilitate infection by breaking downcomplex structural polysaccharides and releasing simplesugars. The products from this process could be con-sumed by the fungus, since they are biochemically indis-tinguishable from other sugar sources. As such, it isprobable that biotrophic fungi synthesize and secreteCWDEs to facilitate penetration and growth within theplant, utilizing the sugars released, while also releasingK. M. Goulet and B.

Pentoses, such asxylose and arabinose, can also be ef ﬁciently metabolizedby fungi (Jeffries 1983 ; Seiboth & Metz 2011). Fungi areunable to directly metabolize large polysaccharides, andtherefore must depolymerize these complex compounds toobtain sugars for uptake and subsequent metabolism. Forexample, while growing in culture, fungi can obtain glucosethrough amylase-mediated hydrolysis of starch, thusenabling them to use this polymer as a sole carbon source(Ohta 1997 ; Nahas & Waldemarin 2002 ). While growing inplanta , the degradation of complex plant cell wall polysac-charides would result in the release of both pentose andhexose sugars that may then be taken up by fungi. However,sucrose and hexoses are also available from the redirectionof plant metabolism. Fungal invertases and transporters arerequired to utilize these carbons (Talbot 2010 ).InvertasesInvertases are responsible for converting intra- and extra-cellular sucrose into the monosaccharide componentsfructose and glucose, which are substrates for high-af ﬁ-nity sugar transporters. Invertases belong to multiple sub-classes of glycoside hydrolases; GH32, GH43 and GH62invertases have been identi ﬁed in fungi (Lombard et al.2014 ). They are further categorized based on their pH andmechanism of glycosidic bond cleavage (Van der Nestet al. 2015 ). The majority of enzymes in the GH32 familyare functionally classi ﬁed as acid invertases that can becell wall-bound or vacuolar, and are involved in source-sink interactions and carbon processing in a number ofphytopathogenic fungi (Pons et al. 1998 ; Lammens et al.2009 ; Parrent et al. 2009 ). Fungi can acquire sugars suchas inulin and sucrose, which are then depolymerized byacid invertases through α1-β2 glycosidic bond cleavage(Lammens et al. 2009 ). Secreted fungal invertases arereleased to the apoplast where they process sucrose trans-ported, via the phloem, to the new sink at the site offungal infection. The action of invertases increases theavailability of free hexoses. The fungus takes up andutilizes the apoplast sugars (reviewed in Morkunas &Ratajczak 2014 ), maintaining the infection area as asink. There are several examples of a correlation betweenplant infection and invertase activity. Infection byPuccinia hordei resulted in reduced sucrose levels in theapoplastic spaces of barley leaf tissues (Tetlow & Farrar1992 ). Infection of wheat by P. graminis f. sp. tritici ledto a slight increase in invertase activity, whereas whiteblister rust-infected A. thaliana induced a much greaterchange in its invertase protein At βFruct1 (Heisterüberet al. 1994 ; Chou et al. 2000 ).Plasmodiophora brassicae ,a biotrophic pathogen, causes clubroot on a number ofvegetables and its infection is associated with increasedinvertase activity (Siemens et al. 2011 ). Activity from allinvertases tested in powdery mildew infection of wheatleaves exhibited a marked increase compared with non-infected leaves (Sutton et al. 2007 ) and increased inver-tase transcription was observed in Aspergillus ﬂavus-infected maize kernels (Dolezal et al. 2014 ). Theseplant-pathogen interaction studies provide evidence thatincreased invertase expression is linked to host plantinfection. However, it is not always clear whether theactivity is from plant- or fungal-derived invertases(Doidy et al. 2012 ). To help establish whether fungalinvertase activity facilitates infection, use of a modelsystem that can be manipulated at a molecular level,such as U. maydis , is required.The U. maydis genome encodes two Suc2 invertases(UMAG_01945 andUMAG_03605 ), which are the onlyinvertases characterized in this organism. Both are up-regulated in infected maize tissue (Kämper et al. 2006 )andsuc2 invertase activity increased as early as 2 DPI,suggesting that it is involved in the observed increase infree soluble sugars during infection (Horst et al. 2008 ).The lack of suc2 expression in haploid sporidia suggestsit might be speci ﬁc for ﬁlamentous growth in planta(Horst et al. 2008 ). The early induction (2 DPI) of suc2during U. maydis infection is similar to that of the rustpathogen Uromyces fabae , in which the invertase uf-Inv1was expressed during plant penetration, with high levelsfound in the haustoria (Voegele et al. 2006 ). In contrast,Voll et al. ( 2011 ) detected increased invertase transcrip-tion only during later stages of infection of maize by U.maydis . Together, these studies suggest that U. maydismay be expressing invertases and in turn, stimulating theplant to produce and release invertases as well. They alsosuggest a changing requirement for invertase activityduring fungal development within the plant. To determineif the invertase activity present at each stage of infectionis of fungal or plant origin, U. maydis suc2 -deﬁcientstrains and/or strains in which Suc2 proteins are tagged,could be created to assess the ability to establish infectionwithout this enzyme and/or to follow the expression ofthe enzyme and the concomitant increase in free sugarsduring pathogenic development.TransportersFollowing the action of invertases and other enzymes,pathogenic fungi must take up the sugars made available.K. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 254Transporters are responsible for facilitating entry ofmonosaccharide sugars into fungal cells. The diversearray of transporters present in some fungi contributesto their ability to process a variety of carbon sources andtherefore grow in many different ecological environ-ments. Sugar transporters are present at the plant-fungalinterface, and are generally located in the host penetrationstructures, resulting in competition with the host plant forthe pool of sugars released from the phloem into theapoplast (Voegele et al. 2001 ; Wippel et al. 2010 ).Fungal sugar transporters belong to the major facilitatorsuperfamily and are predicted to have a similar structure,composed of 12 transmembrane domains with a largeextracellular loop between the ﬁrst and second domain(Wahl et al. 2010 ; Doidy et al. 2012 ). The predictedconserved structure of this superfamily of proteins sug-gests that they execute similar functions –that is, theuptake of sugars into cells.Functional conservation exists among fungal hexosetransporters but sugar preference of transporters in speci-ﬁc species may vary. For example, U. fabae Hxt1 prefer-entially takes up glucose and fructose (Voegele et al.2001 ), while the monosaccharide transporter Frt1 inBotrytis cinerea , a necrotrophic fungus causing greymould in grapes, has a high af ﬁnity for fructose(Doehlemann et al. 2005 ). The monosaccharide transpor-ters of mycorrhizal fungi can take up pentoses releasedfrom cell wall depolymerization, such as xylose (Helberet al. 2011 ). In the Globus sp. system, increased xyloseinduces expression of monosaccharide transporters in theextraradical mycelium (Helber et al. 2011 ). In the hemi-biotrophic maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola ,four of the ﬁve characterized hexose transporter genes aredifferentially regulated depending on the mode of nutri-tion, likely re ﬂecting different sources of carbon availableduring the biotrophic and necrotrophic lifestyle. CgHxt1,CgHxt2 and CgHxt3 are up-regulated during the bio-trophic phase and can accept a number of hexose sugarsubstrates, but have a lower preference for pentoses suchas xylose (Lingner et al. 2011 ). The 19 members of thesugar transporter family that have been identi ﬁed in U.maydis are listed in Table 3 (Kämper et al. 2006 ; Wahlet al. 2010 ). The most well-characterized hexose trans-porter is Hxt1 ( UMAG_05023 ; Schuler et al. 2015 ),which has been shown to transport glucose, fructose andmannose with very high af ﬁnity (Schuler et al. 2015 ). Inaddition, when the U. maydis Hxt1 was expressed in amonosaccharide transporter-de ﬁcient Saccharomyces cer-evisiae strain, it was shown to have a low af ﬁnity forxylose (Schuler et al. 2015 ).Sugar preference in hexosetransporter uptake may re ﬂect sugars present in a givenhost or at a given stage of disease development. In thisregard, it is interesting that U. maydis also codes asucrose transporter, Srt1 ( UMAG_02374 ), so it has thecapacity to take up sucrose as well as monosaccharidesugars (Wahl et al. 2010 ).Srt1 is the only U. maydis transporter characterized thatcan directly transport sucrose into cells (Wahl et al.Table 3.

( 2006 ).Carbon utilization by biotrophic fungi in plants 2552010 ). By taking up sucrose directly from the apoplast,the fungus may avoid the initiation of plant defenceresponses shown to be related to the uptake of glucose(Herbers et al. 1996 ; Rolland et al. 2006 ; Wahl et al.2010 ).Ustilago maydis Srt1 also has a much higherafﬁnity for sucrose compared with the maize sucrosetransporter Sut1. This suggests that U. maydis could out-compete its host for the uptake of sucrose from theapoplast, bypassing the need for invertase activity andhexose uptake which may, in turn, provide a specialadvantage to its biotrophic lifestyle.No matter which pathogenic lifestyle a fungus has adopted,it seems logical that sugar transporters would be required forpathogenic growth, and expression data support this.Erysiphe cichoracearum infection of A. thaliana as well asErysiphe necator -a n d Plasmopara viticola -infection ofgrapevine leaves, result in up -regulation of their respectivesugar transporter proteins (Fotopoulos et al. 2003; Suttonet al. 2007; Hayes et al. 2010). Similarly, hexose transporterproteins from Fusarium graminearum (Kruger et al. 2002)andBlumeria graminis (Zhang et al. 2005) are expressedduring plant infection. Microarray analysis of 16 U. maydistransporter genes showed that 12 genes are up-regulated in 13DPI tumours compared with growth in axenic culture(Table 3 ;K ä m p e re ta l . 2006). The expression of srt1isinduced by in planta growth, peaking when tumours form,and is not present in fungal cells grown in axenic culture withadded sucrose or glucose, indicating that this transporterrequires signals from within the plant to be activated, and itis not subject to carbon catabolite repression (Wahl et al.2010). In contrast, when U. maydis is inoculated on thenon-host A. thaliana, srt1 is down-regulated early duringinfection (Martínez-Soto et al. 2013). This species-speci ﬁcexpression suggests that its direct function is to take upsucrose at the plant-fungal inte rface only during colonizationof its natural host, maize. The common outcomes of expres-sion analysis in a number of plant pathogens suggests thatthere is a broad conservation of t ransport function, especiallyamong proteins related to Hxt1. However, many fungi alsohave multiple transporters, so questions remain about whichone(s) are required for pathogenic growth.Ustilago maydis deletion analyses revealed that thesucrose transporter Srt1, and the hexose transporterHxt1, are each required for full pathogenic developmentand disease symptom formation (Wahl et al. 2010 ;Schuler et al. 2015 ). Even though the srt1 deletionmutants show dramatic reduction in pathogenicity, theyretain the ability to cause disease, and this ability isreduced further in the double deletion of srt1 andhxt1(Schuler et al. 2015 ). Pathogenesis was restored when thesucrose transporter suc9 from Arabidopsis was expressedfrom the srt1promoter in the Δsrt1mutant strain (Saueret al. 2004 ; Wahl et al. 2010 ). However, when Hxt1function was complemented with hexose transportersCgHxt3 and Stp1 from A. thaliana , pathogenesis wasstill reduced, which the authors attribute to the presenceof a sensor capability in addition to the transporter func-tion of Hxt1. When the region of the protein predicted toprovide this sensor capability was mutated, making it aconstitutively active sensor, the resulting U. maydis strainwas completely non-pathogenic (Schuler et al. 2015 ).Separate investigations revealed that Srt1 and Hxt1 arepresent in the plasma membrane of hyphae, and similarly,the sugar transporter UfHxt1, which shows 50% identityto the U. maydis Hxt1, is localized to the haustoriaplasma membrane of U. fabae , supporting a role forthese transporters in the establishment of infection(Voegele et al. 2001 ; Wahl et al. 2010 ; Schuler et al.2015 ). Together, the results are consistent with Srt1 hav-ing a role in sucrose uptake during pathogenesis, whilethe role of Hxt1 as a sensor is more prominent than itsrole as a hexose transporter. Redundancy may explain thisobservation, as noted earlier in regards to CWDEs; thepresence of multiple proteins with hexose transporterfunction may provide redundancy for the Hxt1 transporteractivity, but not for its sensing ability. Thus, it is likelythat many of the sugar transporters in U. maydis contri-bute to pathogenic development, and the production of avariety of transporters may be a requirement because thetypes of sugars available for uptake may vary duringpathogenic development and/or depending on the planttissue infected. This variation would further suggest dif-ferential regulation of the transporters to ensure adequatecarbon uptake throughout pathogenic development.Carbon catabolite repression (CCR)Although a number of pentose or hexose sugar sources areavailable to fungi in plant hosts, and fungi can alter whichcarbon catabolism pathways are activated (Ruijter & Visser1997 ), they prefer carbon sources that are readily availableand easily metabolized (Kelly 2004 ). Carbon cataboliterepression is a regulatory mechanism to increase the utili-zation of favourable carbon sources by ensuring the repres-sion of synthesis of enzymes required to metabolizealternative or secondary carbohydrate sources (Ruijter &Visser 1997 ;G a n c e d o 1998 ). In cases where multiplesugar types are available, one is typically preferred overothers; glucose provides the best energy gain and is there-fore the most favourable carbon source for fungal cells. Ininstances where glucose is available, the expression ofother catabolite pathways is often suppressed (Brownet al. 2014 ). This regulation is bene ﬁcial because it limitsutilization of energetically unfavourable carbonK. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 256compounds and suppresses expression of carbohydratemetabolism genes that are not required. Mutations inCCR regulatory mechanisms have shown that relief fromCCR is adequate for utilization of non-preferred carbonsources (Chang & Todd 2004 ). Investigating CCRmechanisms in plant pathogenic fungi is important forunderstanding how these pathogens thrive throughout dis-ease development; yet the vast majority of information onthis process has come from studies of ascomycete fungi inculture. An overview of the ﬁndings from these studies ispresented below to provide context for discussions of plantpathogens and basidiomycete fungi.AscomycetesThe term ‘carbon catabolite repression ’is often interchange-ably referred to as ‘glucose repression ’, since glucose fre-quently represses the expression of genes involved inprocessing other sugars. In the ﬁlamentous ascomyceteAspergillus nidulans , a number of enzymes involved in thedegradation of plant carbons, such as xylan, cellulose andpectin are repressed by glucose; however, other sugars mayalso initiate CCR (Ruijter & Visser 1997;d eV r i e s&V i s s e r2001). CCR induction by other sugars has also been noted inas t r a i no f S. cerevisiae that was engineered to metabolizexylose. In this strain, the presence of xylose represses theexpression of sucrose- and galactose-metabolizing genes(Belinchón & Gancedo 2003). CCR is controlled in ascomy-cetes by a transcription factor that is differentially phosphory-lated depending upon whethe r glucose is present. Whenglucose is available, genes for metabolizing other carbonsources (glucose repressible genes) are turned off, but areturned on when glucose is present at low levels or is absent.InAspergillus species, the controlling transcription factor isCreA, which was recently identi ﬁed as an essential growthfactor; a conserved region of CreA in Aspergillus species andTrichoderma reesei is required for growth on numerous car-bon, nitrogen and lipid sources (Ries et al. 2016). In creAdeletion studies, a number of cell wall-targeting genes wereinduced, indicating that they are directly repressed by CreA inthe presence of secondary carbon sources such as galactose orxylose (Culleton et al. 2013), once again indicating thatglucose is not the only sugar capable of initiating CCR andlinking CWDEs to CCR.The control of CCR has been extensively studied in theascomycete genera Saccharomyces andAspergillus (Ronne1995 ; Ruijter & Visser 1997 ; Brown et al. 2014 ). In S.cerevisiae , the DNA-binding protein Mig1 is the key glu-cose repression regulator (reviewed in Gancedo 1998 ).When glucose is available, Mig1 is shuttled into thenucleus (DeVit et al. 1997 ) and represses transcription ofglucose-repressible genes by binding to their promotersand recruiting a Ssn6 (Cyc8)-Tup1 co-repressor complex(Nehlin et al. 1991 ; Papamichos-Chronakis et al. 2004 ). Inresponse to glucose limitation, a serine/threonine kinase,sucrose non-fermenting 1 protein (Snf1) regulates phos-phorylation of Mig1 (Wilson et al. 1996; Ostling & Ronne1998 ). When Mig1 is phosphorylated, it is exported to thecytoplasm (DeVit et al. 1997 ), making interaction with theSsn6 (Cyc8)-Tup1 complex no longer possible and result-ing in transcription of glucose-repressible genes(Papamichos-Chronakis et al. 2004 ). Mig1-de ﬁcient strainsshow loss of CCR and have impaired growth (Dowzer &Kelly 1991 ). Inﬁlamentous ascomycetes, such as A. nidu-lans, the transcription factor CreA/CRE1 is a functionalhomologue of the Mig1 in S. cerevisiae (Ostling et al.1996 ; Strauss et al. 1999 ). In the presence of glucose,CreA/CRE1 binds to upstream regulatory elements, block-ing transcription of enzymes required to process alternatecarbon sources (Brown et al. 2014 ). In carbon-limitingenvironments, CreA/CRE1 is phosphorylated by SnfA,an orthologue to Snf1, and it is exported from the nucleus,allowing induction of carbon metabolism genes (Brownet al. 2014 ). Similarly to Δmig1 mutants, creA-null strainsexhibit impaired growth and show loss of CCR in thepresence of glucose (Dowzer & Kelly 1991 ). For furtherinformation on these transcriptional regulation mechan-isms, see reviews by Aro et al. ( 2005 ), Brown et al.(2014 ) and Fernandez et al. ( 2014 ). This well-characterizedcontrol of CCR and the link to repressing CWDEs make ita reasonable candidate for control of carbon metabolismduring pathogenesis by plant pathogenic fungi.The initiation of CCR is stimulated by Snf1/SnfA, whoseactivation results in the derepression of alternative carbonsource-related genes including CWDEs. CWDEs have beenidenti ﬁed as pathogenesis factors (reviewed in Kubiceket al. 2014 ), suggesting that the CCR pathways wouldcontribute to pathogenesis if CWDEs were regulated byCCR activator or repressor proteins. As such, functionalinvestigations of the Snf1 kinase have been carried out insome ascomycete plant pathogens. For example, inCochliobolus carbonum, F. oxysporum andLeptosphaeriamaculans , deletion of snf1 resulted in repression of manycell wall-targeting lytic enzymes and reduced virulence(Tonukari et al. 2000 ; Ospina-Giraldo et al. 2003 ;F e n get al. 2014 ). Deletion of the Magnaporthe oryzae snf1homologue did not have the same transcriptional effect onCWDEs, but resulted in impaired appressorium formationand pathogenicity (Yi et al. 2008 ). Since Snf1 regulatesglucose-repressed genes, cells that lack this kinase areunable to utilize carbon sources other than glucose, possiblyexplaining the deletion pathogenesis phenotypes in somefungi. To date, only a single creA deletion mutant has beenfunctionally assessed in ascomycete phytopathogens.Carbon utilization by biotrophic fungi in plants 257Deletion of the creA andsnf1homologs in Alternaria bras-sicicola did not affect pathogenesis and did not in ﬂuenceexpression of CWDEs, suggesting that these CCR proteinsare not involved in regulating carbon uptake or pathogenesisin this fungus (Cho et al. 2009 ). Together, the data indicatethat for some, but not all ascomycete plant pathogens, CCRplays a role in controlling the expression of CWDEs andcarbon uptake during pathogenic development.BasidiomycetesWhile most of the carbon catabolite research has beenconducted on ascomycetes, recent genome sequenceinformation provides insight into possible CCR mechan-isms in the basidiomycetes. As in ascomycetes, CreAhomologues in basidiomycetes could mediate repressionof carbon metabolism or CWDEs in the presence ofvarious carbon sources (Rytioja et al. 2014 ). A compara-tive genomics study identi ﬁed CreA homologues in 27 ofthe 31 basidiomycete genomes assessed. These includedU. maydis (UMAG_04909 ) and the white rot fungusPhanerochaete chrysosporium (Todd et al. 2014 ). Mig1homologues were not detected in any of the basidiomy-cetes. However, the fact that most basidiomycete speciescontain a CreA homologue suggests its conserved role asa transcriptional regulator of carbon metabolism in thesefungi, though there have been no functional studies to thiseffect in the basidiomycetes. The function of CCR inrelation to the control of CWDE expression has beeninvestigated in a limited number of basidiomycete fungi.Early studies, conducted before genome sequence datawere available, included only a single phytopathogen;Athelia rolfsii (Sclerotium rolfsii) (Shewale & Sadana1981 ; Chow et al. 1994 ; Onishi & Tanaka 1996 ; Dinget al. 2001 ). More recent investigations of plant patho-genic basidiomycetes reveal that CCR mechanisms havea role in CWDE expression in the common corn smutpathogen and white-rot fungi. In U. maydis , Snf1(UMAG_11293 ) negatively regulates the expression oftwo xylanases and positively regulates an endoglucanaseand a polygalacturonase. Deletion of snf1 resulted in aslight reduction in pathogenic development; however, it isnot required for releasing the fungus from glucose repres-sion since Δsnf1 mutants can grow on alternative carbonsources in axenic culture (Nadal et al. 2010 ). Therefore,in contrast to the situation in ascomycetes, U. maydisSnf1 positively and negatively regulates some CWDEs,but is not a global glucose regulator (Nadal et al. 2010 ).However, this distinction between the ascomycetes andbasidiomycetes is not universal, as white rot basidiomy-cete fungi have a CCR-mediated mechanism for suppres-sing CWDE expression. In the presence of a glucosesource, cellulase (endoglucanase) and xylanase arerepressed, and when glucose is depleted, transcription ofthese enzymes resumes (Kobakhidze et al. 2016 ). Theselimited studies provide some insight regarding the linkbetween CCR and CWDE expression and pathogenesis inbasidiomycetes; however, it is clear, especially for U.maydis , that the transcriptional regulation of CWDEs byglucose repression regulatory machinery and the resultingimpact on pathogenesis is in ﬂuenced by signallingmechanisms directed through Snf1 as well as other pro-teins. Furthermore, the expression of CWDEs does notoccur with the complete suppression of other sugar meta-bolizing enzymes ( Fig. 1 ). The nature of CWDE geneexpression control and the shifts in expression in U.maydis require further investigation.Plant defences and biotrophic interactionsBiotrophic fungal pathogens obtain nutrients from livingplant tissue; however, to access these nutrients, they mustovercome a barrage of plant defences. Plants have physi-cal barriers such as a cuticle and rigid cell walls, as wellas signal response systems that can lead to the reinforce-ment of physical barriers through callose or lignin deposi-tion, the expression of defence proteins, or the synthesisof small molecules including the creation of reactiveoxygen species (reviewed in Zeilinger et al. 2016 ). Theymay even sacri ﬁce cells through the hypersensitiveresponse to ward off infection (Heath 1998 ). Thesedefences are implemented at different stages of infectionand are not static. Plants constantly monitor for the pre-sence of microorganisms through the receptor-likekinases, which act as pattern recognition receptors detect-ing the presence of microbes, pathogens or damage-asso-ciated molecular patterns (MAMPS, PAMPs or DAMPs)(Kushalappa et al. 2016 ; Eckardt 2017 ). The damage thatmay be detected includes changes to cell wall structurethrough the action of pathogen-secreted CWDEs(reviewed in Malinovsky et al. 2016 ). Upon plant detec-tion of one of these patterns, there is a cascade responseleading to the activation of defence mechanisms and plantimmunity that has been referred to as pattern- or PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, pathogens, includingfungal biotrophs, produce and release protein effectorsand hormones that can alter host physiology and circum-vent this immunity (Bakkeren & Valent 2014 ; Morrisonet al. 2015 ; Matei & Doehlemann 2016 ). The battle con-tinues with the plant, which in turn responds with effec-tor-trigger immunity or ETI, another cascade defenceresponse. With this massive capacity for defence, itwould seem an insurmountable task for fungal biotrophsto access nutrients from living plant tissue, yet they do.K. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 258Fig. 1 Diagrammatic representation of events related to carbon acquisition by Ustilago maydis during pathogenic growth in maize (Zea mays ).(Bottom panel) Cross-section of a maize leaf, showing that fungal mycelia have penetrated the cuticle and epidermis, growing between andthrough the mesophyll cells. The upper mycelium is in the process of penetrating the next mesophyll cell while the lower mycelium haspenetrated the bundle sheath and has grown between the phloem cells. The white boxes indicate the areas with expanded views. (Upper leftpanel) Expanded view of mycelium approaching a plant mesophyll cell. Ustilago maydis modiﬁes the host physiology and suppresses defenceresponses through the action of effectors and phytohormones, while CAZymes act on the cell wall. The approximate proportions, based on thecomprehensive U. maydis CAZyme list in Supplementary Table 1, of GH (~76%), CE (~23%) and PL (<1%) enzymes are indicated by thenumber of coloured stars. These enzymes depolymerize cell wall components, releasing hexose and pentose sugars which are taken up by thefungus via transporters; the proportion of cell wall components are indicated below the lower panel. The text box above this panel indicatesincreased CWDE activity during infection. (Upper right panel) Expanded view of carbon uptake by a mycelium interacting with the phloemtissue, representing the results of U. maydis creating sink tissue in the leaves. Sucrose moves through the phloem and is available in the leafvasculature for direct uptake by the fungus via Srt1. Alternatively, sucrose is acted upon by cell wall or vacuolar invertases to yield glucose andfructose, which are transported into the fungus via the monosaccharide sugar transporter Hxt1. The text box above this panel indicates the roleof CCR in this process; increased invertase and transporter activity, increase in free sucroses, decrease in sucrose synthesis genes, and anincrease in sucrose degradation genes is observed in infected tissue. The switch between methods of carbon acquisition by the fungus, which isindicated by the grey dashed line, could be mediated by CCR systems.Carbon utilization by biotrophic fungi in plants 259One approach to biotrophy is to colonize the plant with-out triggering the defense responses mentioned above.This involves altering plant responses and physiologythrough the release of effectors and phytohormones, aswell as controlling how and when carbon sources areaccessed.Ustilago maydis initiates its biotrophic infection ofmaize by altering gene expression in response to sensingplant surface cues, such as the hydrophobicity or thepresence of cutin monomers (Lanver et al. 2014 ). Asmentioned earlier, this alteration includes the expressionof the arabinofuranosidases GH51 and GH62, which areactive during plant penetration (Lanver et al. 2014 ;Table 4 ). Effectors that suppress plant defences are alsoexpressed and secreted during the early stages of infec-tion. Functions have been identi ﬁed for several effectors;Pep1 aids in suppressing the maize oxidative burst byinhibiting its POX12 peroxidase (Hemetsberger et al.2012 ,2015 ), while Pit2 suppresses the activity ofcysteine proteases (Mueller et al. 2013 ). Pep1 and Pit2suppress plant defences in the apoplast early during infec-tion, while effector Cmu1 regulates chorismate homeos-tasis, resulting in the suppression of salicylic acidsynthesis (Djamei et al. 2011 ), and Tin2 stabilizes amaize kinase which stimulates anthocyanin biosynthesisby redirecting precursors that would be used for ligninbiosynthesis (Tanaka et al. 2014 ). This suppression ofplant defences allows U. maydis to penetrate and begincolonizing maize tissues.We propose that, during this early phase of leaf infec-tion, U. maydis acquires a portion of its carbon throughthe depolymerization of cell wall components ( Fig. 1upper left panel; Table 4 ). As the infection progresses,U. maydis mycelia reach the leaf vascular bundles andcarbon acquisition is augmented by, or may switch to, theuptake of sucrose and hexoses, the latter being releasedby the action of invertases ( Fig. 1 upper right panel;Table 4 ). At this stage of infection, the fungus alsostimulates the expansion of mesophyll cells (hypertrophy)and the division of bundle sheath cells (hyperplasia),likely via the release of effectors and hormones. Thesealterations in cell morphology are a component of in ﬂu-encing the plant source-sink relationships, which arefurther altered by the synthesis of cytokinins and thealteration of cytokinin metabolism in maize by U. maydis(Bruce et al. 2011 ; Morrison et al. 2015 ,2017 ). In anuninfected plant, source tissues, such as mature leaves,provide excess photosynthates to sink tissues such asdeveloping leaves (Biemelt and Sonnewald 2006 ). Therelative strength of each sink tissue within a plant deter-mines the distribution of photoassimilates (Lemoine et al.2013 ).Ustilago maydis -colonized maize tissue remains astrong sink throughout the infection cycle (Horst et al.2008 ). Horst et al. ( 2010 ) proposed that soluble sugarsacquired through the redirection of nutrients from sourcetissues provide the fungus with a source of food andenergy. This suggestion is supported by the work pre-sented here ( Fig. 1 upper right panel). Furthermore, wepropose that the requirement for carbon acquisition by thebiotrophic fungal pathogens provides a major selectivepressure for effector evolution.The in ﬂuenceof U. maydis on the host to increasesugar availability must be controlled. In feeding experi-ments where sugars were added to the sites of U. maydisinfection, Kretschmer et al. ( 2016 ) observed an increasein disease rating in their seedling assays and suggestedthat this would lead to increased plant responses, includ-ing turning on of defence processes. The plant responseto infection was assessed by transcriptome analyses of U.maydis -infected developing maize leaves. It was notedthat expression of photosynthesis-related genes, as wellas those involved in sucrose and starch synthesis, werenot activated as they would be in an uninfected leaf. As aresult, the infected leaf remains a sink and does notbecome a photosynthetically active source (Doehlemannet al. 2008b ; Kretschmer et al. 2016 ; Cheung et al.Table 4. Summary of Ustilago maydis infection of Zea mays leaves at various stages of growth.Penetration Initial Growth Within Leaf Tumour Formation Initiated Mature Teliospore FormationStage of FungalDevelopmentSensing plantsurface;development ofappressoriaDikaryon penetration of epidermisand extension into mesophyllcellsDikaryon growth Transition to teliosporedevelopment; reduced effectorexpressionImpact on Host Cuticle is breached Defence responses are suppressed,allowing penetrationCell morphology is reprogramed tohypertrophy (mesophyll cells) andhyperplasia (bundle sheath cells)Digested to increase plant cellﬂuidity relative to one another;defence responses resumeNature of CarbonAcquisitionBreakdown ofcuticle and cellwall componentsBreakdown of cell wall polymers;soluble sugars in apoplast andpenetrated plant cellsGreater uptake of sucrose and hexosesfrom increased sink strength inchanging fungal and plant tissuesCarbon acquisition augmented byrelease of galacturonic acidK. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 260Forthcoming 2017 ). Infected tissues also exhibited anoverall increase in soluble sucrose and hexoses, the latterbeing attributed to increased invertase activity (Horstet al. 2008 ; Doehlemann et al. 2008b ). The source ofthe invertases –fungal or plant –is dif ﬁcult to discern(Lemoine et al. 2013 ). However, altering sucrose concen-tration through the action of plant invertases and alteredplant sucrose transporter expression leads to induction ofpathogenesis-related gene expression (Tauzin andGiardina 2014 ). Thus, if plant invertases are involved,there must be some counteraction from U. maydis toensure defence responses remain suppressed. Theincreased expression of the U. maydis Srt1, which has ahigher af ﬁnity for sucrose than the maize sucrose trans-porters (Wahl et al. 2010 ), could contribute to this con-tinual suppression of plant defences. It may also be thatplant invertases have a limited role in increasing hexoseconcentration, since fungal invertases are up-regulatedduring infection. However, the molecular basis of thecontrolled increase in sugar availability by U. maydisrequires further investigation.To ensure carbon sources are available for the completionof its pathogenic/sexual cycle, U. maydis requires the abilityto access different carbon sources, depending upon the stageof fungal development and the progression of disease. Thetransition in carbon acquisition between the stages of pene-tration and growth in the leaf mesophyll relative to acquisi-tion once U. maydis reaches the vasculature and stimulatescell morphology changes has been discussed ( Fig. 1 ;Table 4 ). Recent work with effector proteins suggests therecould be another switch in carbon sources during teliospor-ogenesis. Tollot et al. ( 2016 ) showed that regulation ofteliospore formation included repression of effector genesthat were expressed during the early stages of U. maydisinfection. Down-regulation of ‘early ’effectors during theformation of teliospores suggests that there is no longer arequirement to extract nutrients from the host without elicit-ing a defence response. At the stage when teliospore devel-opment begins, the fungus has already colonized the plantand established mechanisms of gaining nutrients thatinvolve the expression of effectors, but now it must transi-tion to fuelling the development of dispersal spores withstored carbon sources. There is very limited research intofungal carbon acquisition during sporogenesis. Cano-Canchola et al. ( 2000 ) noted a correlation between a poly-galacturonase (PG) as well as other PL family enzymeactivity and teliospore formation. In addition, Castruita-Domínguez et al. ( 2014 ) discovered that PG is involved inteliospore formation and tumour development of U. maydis .We propose that during sporogenesis, increased activity ofPG and other PL family members is associated withincreased pectin degradation. Breaking down pectin,which helps to hold cells together, would make the plantcells friable, while also providing space for the productionof teliospores within tumours ( Table 4 ). This proposedbreakdown of pectin would also result in the release of α-1,4-polygalacturonic acid, which could be taken up by U.maydis via its galacturonic acid transporter, UMAG_00061 ,shown to be a potential orthologue of Neurospora crassa(Benz et al. 2014 ). We propose that, together, these observa-tions illustrate several transitions in sugar acquisition by U.maydis during its development in planta . Further, we pro-pose that these transitions could be in ﬂuenced by CCRsystems, suggesting a role for CCR in modulating the rela-tive levels of cell wall degradation and free sugar uptakeduring the pathogenic cycle.Conclusions and future workA key focus of this review is the identi ﬁcation of shifts incarbon sources accessed by biotrophic fungi from plantsduring the infection process. Initially, they obtain carboncompounds via depolymerization of plant cell wall mate-rial, then the uptake of free sucrose and hexoses becomes asigniﬁcant component of carbon metabolism, followed by ashift to pectin degradation and uptake of galacturonic acid.Since these shifts include transitions away from and back tocomplex carbohydrate degradation, CCR may be involved.We point out that CCR mediates the shift in carbon meta-bolism in ascomycete fungi, but that CCR does not controlthe switch from glucose metabolism to the expression ofCWDEs to the same degree in basidiomycete fungal patho-gens, possibly because there is a requirement for thesefungi to access several carbon sources simultaneously.Thus, while the main carbon source may shift, this is notan‘all-or-none ’response, and the fungus retains uptake andmetabolism of carbons from other sources. Nonetheless,these shifts are prominent and, at least temporally, linkedto shifts in disease progression, fungal development andeffector gene expression.It is possible that sensing carbon sources is a compo-nent of the control of developmental shifts in U. maydisduring pathogenesis. Glucose sensing controls morpholo-gical shifts in the human pathogen Candida albicans(Miwa et al. 2004 ). Similarly, nitrogen sensing via ammo-nium permease has a role in the shift between the non-pathogenic budding haploid cells and the pathogenicﬁlamentous dikaryon in U. maydis (Smith et al. 2003 ;reviewed in Braunsdorf et al. 2016 ). Thus, sensing nutri-ents, and speci ﬁcally carbon, might be expected to in ﬂu-ence development during fungal biotrophic growth. If thisis the case, it would also provide a means of sensing thephysiological state of the host, possibly linking the timingof fungal development to plant development, a keyCarbon utilization by biotrophic fungi in plants 261component of fungal pathogenesis in U. maydis . Furtherinvestigations into the control of carbon metabolismshifts by U. maydis would provide insight into the reg-ulation of biotrophic fungal pathogenesis.Carbon metabolism transitions are also linked to shiftsin effector gene expression. It is possible that a commoncontrol mechanism exists, or that carbon sensing directs ashift in carbon metabolism and in effector expression tofacilitate access to new carbon sources. To further inves-tigate these possible linkages, some of the infection time-course RNA-seq and microarray datasets could be re-evaluated. However, a current limitation to this type oftranscriptome analysis is that the existing data may notinclude important time points, especially those spanningthe transition to teliospore formation. Therefore, a speci-ﬁc investigation of this important time period by RNA-seq is warranted. Another investigative approach wouldinvolve determining if varying carbon sources alter effec-tor gene expression.The shifts in carbon source acquisition during fungalpathogenesis must be considered when investigatingwhether a carbon metabolism or CWDE gene isrequired for successful infection of a potential hostplant. If there is a shift, but it is not an ‘all-or-none ’shift, deletion of a gene encoding either of these func-tions would not be expected to block pathogenesis, butrather it may inhibit normal disease development in anincremental manner. Further, one might expect thattiming of expression of carbon metabolism enzymesor CWDEs may be critical for successful growth withinthe plant. In this regard, recent ﬁndings that deletion ofa xylitol dehydrogenase gene reduces pathogenesis inU. maydis are relevant (Goulet et al. unpublished data).As noted earlier, deletion of sucrose- or hexose-meta-bolizing enzymes reduces pathogenesis; however, theimpact of blocking xylose metabolism had not beeninvestigated. The depolymerization of maize cell wallpolymers releases xylose molecules, suggesting xylose-containing polymers are a readily available and impor-tant carbon source within the maize plant. Interestingly,Mondo et al. (personal communication) have deter-mined through comparative genomic analyses that thesmut fungi have speci ﬁc set CWDEs that target xylose-containing molecules, and these sets differ from othergroups of basidiomycete fungi. Along with this, thexylitol dehydrogenase deletion pathogenesis phenotypeis not completely complemented by constitutive expres-sion of the gene, suggesting that timing of its expres-sion may be critical to its full impact on pathogenesis.Together, these results suggest a role for xylose meta-bolism in pathogenesis by U. maydis and other smutfungi. It is also possible that the metabolism of otherspeci ﬁc carbon sources is required for the full expres-sion of pathogenesis. In this context, the shift providingaccess to galacturonic acid and its potential link toteliospore development should be investigated.Determining the roles of CWDEs during pathogenesisshould also take into account the possibility of having arequired time-period of expression. Initially, the expres-sion pro ﬁle of CWDEs could be determined over a timecourse of pathogenesis to con ﬁrm differential expressionat speci ﬁc stages in disease development, followed bydeletion analysis. Given the redundancy in CWDE func-tions, determining their roles in pathogenesis mightrequire the deletion of multiple genes. The recently devel-oped CRISPR-mediated genome modi ﬁcation methodsforU. maydis could facilitate such a functional investiga-tion (Schuster et al. 2016 ). Further, it is possible to createaU. maydis strain containing the minimum number ofrequired CWDEs as a starting point for dissecting theroles of cell wall degradation during pathogenesis andthe link to carbon uptake.During in planta growth, U. maydis cells undergodevelopmental transitions and it is possible that theseare linked to changes in carbon source availability. Forexample, many fungi enter into meiosis in response tonutrient limitation (reviewed in Saville et al. 2012 ), soinvestigating the impact of carbon source shifts, includingthe uptake of galacturonic acid, on the initiation of tel-iospore production could be informative. One approachmay be to determine the impact of growing U. maydis onsingle carbon sources such as galacturonic acid or speci ﬁcsugars, on the expression of transcriptional regulators ofmeiosis like unh1 (Doyle et al. 2016 ). A more globalapproach could be to carry out a metabolomics analysisover a time course of pathogenic development and notingthe shifts in sugar or sugar acid presence relative tofungal developmental shifts. Such a study would capturesugars from the breakdown of cell walls and the changesin sugar availability throughout the maize growing sea-son, assessing proposed shifts in carbon sequestration asoutlined in this review. These metabolomics studies couldbe carried out in conjunction with transcriptomic studiesto link the expression pro ﬁle of speci ﬁc genes to shifts incarbon source availability.In considering transcriptome studies, it is also impor-tant to pay closer attention to subtle changes in tran-scription of carbon metabolism or CWDE genes, sincethe evidence presented in this review suggests that thereis not likely to be a single carbon acquisition strategythat is responsible for fungal biotrophic pathogenicdevelopment. Since the ability of U. maydis to causedisease appears to require subtle changes in multiplecarbon-related genes, elucidating what the subtleK. M. Goulet and B. J. Saville 262changes are and how they are controlled will be criticalin developing a full understanding of carbon metabo-lism during fungal biotrophic growth. In general, theinformation presented herein indicates that the linksbetween carbon metabolism and pathogenesis are com-plex and there is a need to focus on subtle changes inpathogenesis assays when investigating these relation-ships. Understanding carbon relations in fungal bio-trophs is at an early stage; however, new tools thatcan be applied to model systems like U. maydis ,a n dthe ability to link ﬁndings to less tractable fungithrough comparative transcriptomics, offers great pro-mise for a rapid expansion of knowledge in this area.The key ﬁnding that biotrophs shift carbon sourceaccessibility throughout the pathogenic cycle may bebeneﬁcial in directing future research in basidiomycetebiotrophic pathogenesis.AcknowledgementsWe would like to acknowledge Ibraheem Alimi, Dr Colleen Doyle and DrErin Morrison for critical review of this manuscript.
