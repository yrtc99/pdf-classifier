However, theimpacts of different fractions of digestate on the soil carbon (C) cycle remainunclear and provide the focus for the research reported here. We examined theeffects of applying whole digestate (WD) and solid digestate (SD) on carbondioxide (CO2C) efflux, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC),microbial biomass C (C micro) and phospholipid fatty acids, alongside carbonuse efficiency (CUE). A 21-day laboratory microcosm incubation was used toinvestigate the impacts of digestate when applied to two grassland soils of highversus low initial nutrient content. Application rates for SD and WD werebased on recommended nitrogen (N) inputs to grassland soils for these organicmaterials. Compared to control treatments, cumulative CO2C efflux and the con-centration of DOC increased significantly after WD and SD application, althoughonly within the low nutrient soil. Both C micro and the fungal-to-bacterial ratioincreased significantly following SD applic ation, regardless of the initial soil nutri-ent content. These observations are likely t o reflect the larger input of C, alongsidethe dominance of more strongly lignifi ed compounds, associated with SD com-pared to WD to achieve a constant N application rate. Our results also indicatethat the two digestate fractions generated s ignificantly different CUE. The applica-tion of SD led to increases in C micro and positive values of CUE, whereas decreasesin C micro and negative values of CUE were observed following WD application.These findings emphasize the need to car efully plan the management of digestatein agricultural production systems, to m inimize negative impacts on C storagewithin soils whilst maximizing the agronomic value derived from digestate.Received: 21 August 2020 Revised: 15 January 2021 Accepted: 19 January 2021DOI: 10.1111/ejss.13091This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any me dium, providedthe original work is properly cited.© 2021 The Authors.

However, some agriculturalpractices, including deep till age, over-application of inor-ganic fertilisers and intensific ation, have significantlyimpacted soil structural, chemical and biological conditions,increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from soil andreducing soil organic matter (SOM) content (FAO, 2017). Incontrast, soil C stocks may be increased by the promotionof agricultural practices that sequester soil organic C(FAO, 2017; Rumpel & Kögel-Knabner, 2011), through fix-ing atmospheric CO2within soil following plant photosyn-thesis and the transfer of CO 2to plant biomass, or throughthe addition of allochthonous organic matter to soil. Addi-tional practices may also help to reduce the environmentalimpacts of agricultural product ion, including crop rotation,improved nutrient and water application practices and thereduction of tillage intensit y (IPCC, 2014). However, due tomicrobial metabolism, the app lication of organic materialsto agricultural soil may also result in the release of signifi-cant quantities of CO 2,m e t h a n e( C H 4) or nitrous oxide(N2O) to the atmosphere (WRAP, 2016).Interest in the application of digestate, the residueremaining after anaerobic diges tion, to agricultural soil hasgrown substantially given the potential agronomic value ofthis material. Digestate gene rally has a low C-to-N ratio (C:N ) ,i sr i c hi nN H 4+,P ,K+,N a+,M g2+and other macronutri-ents, and can improve soil structure, water infiltration rateand water-holding capacity (G arcía-Albacete, Tarquis, &Cartagena, 2014; Möller & Müller, 2012; Tamboneet al., 2010). However, there are significant uncertainties sur-rounding the impact of digestate application on the C cyclewithin agricultural soils. This is particularly true followingsolid –liquid separation and the application of different frac-tions of digestate to soil. Separation allows for differentiationof the total nutrient content o f digestate into individualphases, enhancing the potential to match digestateapplication to crop nutrient requirements when comparedwith the whole fraction of digestate without separation(Marcato, Pinelli, Pouech, Win terton, & Guiresse, 2008).Whole digestate is a mixture of fibre and liquid, with high vis-cosity and low infiltration potential. It is generally rich in N,P, K+and other macronutrient elements that are present inplant-available forms and usually has a C:N < 10 (Tamboneet al., 2010). In contrast, the solid fraction is rich in total P(up to 90% of total P in whole digestate may be retained inthe solid fraction), much pres ent as water extractable P,alongside Ca2+,M g2+, S and Mn, usually with a C:N > 10(Bachmann, Uptmoor, & Eichler-Löbermann, 2016; Hjorth,Christensen, Christensen, & Sommer, 2010; Lukehurst,Frost, & Seadi, 2010; Marcato et al., 2008; Panuccio, Attinà,Basile, Mallamaci, & Muscolo, 2016). The forms of organic Cpresent in the whole and solid fr actions of digestate can alsodiffer substantially. The whole fraction has been shown to bea mixture of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is read-ily available to microorganisms after application to land, andlignin compounds. In contrast, the solid fraction is domi-nated by recalcitrant organic C compounds, including lignin,cutin, humic acids and other complex compounds, consid-ered as humus precursors with high biological stability(Nkoa, 2014; Tambone, Genevini, D'Imporzano, &Adani, 2009) that can promote SOM accumulation.The application of digestate as a fertiliser in agriculturemay influence C metabolism by the soil microbial commu-nity, which biosynthesiz es the C into compounds forgrowth and/or emits CO2through respiration. This balancedictates the carbon use efficiency (CUE), which may bedefined as the efficiency of the biosynthesis of organic Cfrom a source material relativ e to its respiration (Manzoni,Taylor, Richter, Porporato, & Ågren, 2012). Usually, whenCUE is positive and high the soil microbial community uti-lizes a C source for biosynthesis and growth, favouring theanabolic pathway, leading to C stabilization in soil. In con-trast, when CUE is low and/or negative, microbial utiliza-tion of a C source for biosynthesis is less efficient, theCATTIN ET AL . 2399 13652389, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13091 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [13/04/2023].

Many factors influ-ence the CUE, including temperature, moisture, quality ofthe C source (e.g., C:N) and nutrient availability in soil. Forexample, Sinsabaugh, Manzoni, Moorhead, and Rich-ter (2013) reported that applic ation of an organic materialto soil that is rich in recalcitrant C (often C:N > 20), suchas the solid fraction of digestate, can increase bacterialcatabolism in order to produce extracellular enzymes tohydrolyse C compounds and, consequently, CO2is pro-duced. In contrast, the addition of organic matter with C:N < 20 to soil, such as the whole fraction of digestate, canpromote bacterial biosynthesis of C and, consequently,reduce CO2production.Soil nutrient availability, particularly the concentra-tions of N and P, may also influence CUE. When soil isnot N or P limited relative to C (e.g., low soil C:N), CUEtends to increase because bacteria seek to maintain a bal-anced intracellular composition between C and nutrients(Manzoni et al., 2012; Roller & Schmidt, 2015) and thusmicrobial biomass concentration tends to increase. How-ever, when an organic material containing liable C(e.g., the whole fraction of digestate) is applied to a low-nutrient soil (high soil C:N ratio and, potentially, N limi-tation) (Blagodatskaya, Blagodatsky, Anderson, &Kuzyakov, 2014; Moorhead & Sinsabaugh, 2006), bacteriatend to respire C that has been applied because mainte-nance respiration is increased. This is also true afterapplication of poor-quality resources (e.g., recalcitrantcompounds, such the solid fraction of digestate) to astressed environment (e.g., low nutrient availability, hightemperature or low water availability), because there isan increase in the cost of producing intra/extracellularcatabolism under these conditions and an increase inCO2production (Malik, Puissant, Goodall, Allison, &Griffiths, 2019; Sinsabaugh, Hill, & Follstad Shah, 2009).Further, bacteria and fungi within the soil microbialcommunity have potentially different effects on CUE. Forexample, fungi are able to degrade organic material withhigh C:N without emitting CO2C, thereby maintaininga high CUE, whereas bacteria are less efficient atdegrading organic material with high C:N(Blagodatskaya & Kuzyakov, 2008). For bacteria, CUEalso differs between r (growth strategists; high CUE) andK (competitive strategists; low CUE) communities(Keiblinger et al., 2010; Roller & Schmidt, 2015).However, the impacts of digestate on the soil C cycle viamicrobial effects on CUE remain poorly understood, espe-cially when different physical fr actions of digestate with vary-ing nutrient form and stoichio metry are applied to soils. Thediffering composition of whole and solid digestate mayinfluence soil bacterial and fungal communities differently,with potential effects on C cycling and CUE. There has alsobeen insufficient research focussed on the interactionsbetween digestate application and soil nutrient status, whichhas been considered as one of the main drivers influencingbacterial and fungal activity an d, subsequently, soil C stocksand other soil health parameters. In this context, the researchreported here tested the followi ng hypotheses: (a) for soil atlower initial nutrient status, t he application of either WD orSD stimulates microbial respiration and reduces CUE to agreater extent than for soil at hi gher initial nutrient status,(b) at low or high soil nutrient status, the application of WDwill stimulate microbial respiration and reduce CUE com-pared to SD, and (c) the applicat ion of SD increases the fun-gal-to-bacterial ratio in soils at both low and high initialnutrient status, when compared to WD.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Soil sampling and initialcharacterizationSoils were sampled from two fields adjacent to a commer-cial biogas plant (Cockerham Green Energy Ltd, North-west England, UK; latitude: 53.972, longitude: −2.822) on17 September 2018. The two fields were selected to pro-vide contrasting initial soil nutrient properties (Table 1)as driven by the management history of each field. Top-soil to 15-cm depth was sampled from each field using agouge auger and following a “W”sampling protocol(Natural England, 2008), in which samples from 20 pointsalong a “W”were combined into a single integrated soilsample for each field. High nutrient soil (HN) was undergrass production at the time of sampling and used forgrazing and silage production during previous years. Thisfield receives liquid digestate four times per year, withthe last application occurring at the end of July 2018. Thelow nutrient soil (LN) was fallow grassland at the time ofsoil sampling and had never previously receiveddigestate. Following collection and homogenization, soilswere sieved through a 2-mm mesh and stored in sealedplastic bags at 4/C14C until the incubations began.2.2 |Digestate samplingand characterizationOn 24 September 2018, whole and solid fractions of anaero-bic digestate were collected from Cockerham Green EnergyLtd, following sampling protocols detailed by the Agricul-ture and Horticulture Deve lopment Board (2017), andstored at 4/C14C prior to the start of the incubations.

Whole digestate is unpas teurised and separated intoliquid and solid fractions using a screw-press. The liquidfraction is collected in covere d lagoons, whereas the solidfraction is stored in an uncovered open space. Wholedigestate was sampled directly from the anaerobic digesterbefore separation, whereas th e solid fraction was sampledfrom material that had been stored for 7 days prior to col-lection. The two fractions of digestate were chosen to pro-vide contrasting properties f o rt h ee x p e r i m e n t( T a b l e2 ) .2.3 |Experimental designA microcosm incubation was carried out between 8 and30 October 2018, involving control (Ctr), whole digestate(WD) and solid digestate (SD) t reatments. Each amendmentwas conducted in triplicate for both HN and LN soil types,with soil ×amendment combinations placed randomly inamber and Duran bottles inside a temperature-, pressure-and moisture-controlled room in the dark. The WD and SDamendments were added to soils inside separate glass con-tainers in order to achieve the same N application rate(170 kg N (as NH4+-N) ha−1year−1), after the Agricultureand Horticulture Developmen t Board (2017). This resultedin the addition of c.12,500 mg kg−1dry weight (DW) soil ofC for SD and 625 mg kg−1DW soil of C for WD treatmentsto both soils. Digestate frac tions were mixed thoroughlywith soil and then subdivided into Duran (for respirometry)or amber bottles (destructive samples) prior to theincubation.The moisture content of the soils was set at 50%water-holding capacity (WHC) using milliQ water(>18.2 M Ω.cm at 25/C14C). Control soils were leftunamended without any digestate addition and onlyreceived milliQ water in order to maintain 50% WHC.Respirometry measurements were carried out using aMicro-Oxymax Respirometer (Columbus InstrumentsInternational Corp., Columbus, OH, USA), with an auto-mated 20-channel closed circuit and with two empty bot-tles used as analytical blanks. For respirometry samples,the respirometer maintained a constant moisture contentthroughout the incubation. The concentration of CO2inthe headspace of each Duran bottle was monitored at apartial pressure of 1,063.9125 hPa and a temperature of23 ± 1/C14C, via a specialized GL 45 three-port connectionat 2-h intervals, with emission rates of CO 2C and cumu-lative CO 2C expressed as a rate (mg C h−1) and as amass (mg C), respectively. In addition, a parallel set ofdestructive samples was prepared using amber bottles inorder to monitor changes in soil properties through time.These destructive samples were analysed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7,14 and 21 days (for the 21-day time-point, respirometrysamples were destructively sampled). The moisture con-tent of the destructive samples was checked daily byweighing the amber bottles without lids and addingTABLE 1 Initial physicochemical characteristics of soils usedin the microcosm incubations (mean values reported, ±1 standarderror in parentheses, n=3 )Soil characteristicsHighnutrient soilLownutrient soilBulk density (g cm−3) 1.54 (0.14) 1.48 (0.014)pH water (1:5 w/v) 7.31 (0.035) 5.06 (0.018)NO3−(mg kg−1DW soil)71.05 (0.51) 66.66 (0.32)NH 4+(mg kg−1DW soil) 0.47 (0.044) 1.94 (0.10)Olsen P(mg kg−1DW soil)40.66 (1.18) 10.42 (1.10)P index UK (Agricultureand HorticultureDevelopmentBoard, 2017)41Water extractable totalorganic C(mg kg−1DW soil)228.61 (14.23) 61.43 (0.76)Soil total C(mg C kg−1DW soil)50,298.14(68.49)31,817.73(39.3)Soil total N(mg N kg−1DW soil)4,396.73(160.30)2,363.93(199.82)TC:TN 11.46 (0.07) 13.68 (0.50)DM (%) 73.06 (0.10) 75.49 (0.02)Abbreviations: DM, dry matter; NH 4+, ammonium; NO 3−, nitrate; P index,mg L−1P Olsen; P, phosphorus; total C, total carbon, non-acidified analysis;total N, total nitrogen; Water total C, water extractable total organic carbon,acidified analysis.TABLE 2 Physicochemical characteristics of whole and soliddigestate used in the microcosm incubations ( n=1 )Parameter in freshweight (FW)Wholedigestate (WD)Soliddigestate(SD)DM (%) 11.6 24.3Organic matter (%) 8.36 84.3pH (1:6 w/v) 8.18 8.20TN (mg kg−1FW) 8,500 4,836NH 4+-N (mg kg−1FW) 4,921 752.81TP (mg kg−1FW) 2,869 4,209TC (mg kg−1FW) 37,000 109,107TC:TN 4.35 22.56Abbreviations: DM, dry matter; NH 4+-N, ammonium nitrogen; TC, totalcarbon; TN, total nitrogen; TP, total phosphorus.CATTIN ET AL . 2401 13652389, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13091 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [13/04/2023].

Extractionfor Cmicro was carried out following the chloroform fumi-gation method (Brookes et al., 1985; Vance, Brookes, &Jenkinson, 1987). Duplicate fresh soils were extractedwith and without chloroform fumigation according toBrookes et al. (1985) and Vance et al. (1987) (1:5 w/v,0.5 M K2SO4,p H /C247, filtered Whatman No 42). Thedetermination of TC for the two sets of extracts was car-ried out using a TOC-L/TN Series Analyser (Shimadzu,Kyoto, Japan) based on a combustion-reduction method.Microbial biomass C was calculated as the difference inconcentration between fumigated and unfumigated sam-ples, with subsequent correction by Kecfor C evolved asCO2(Brookes et al., 1985; Joergensen, 1995, 1996).Fresh soil samples were extracted in milliQ water(1:10 w/v; 15 min shaking) for DOC analyses (Jones &Willett, 2006), filtered (Whatman No 42) and the extractwas analysed using a TOC-L/TN Series Analyser(Shimadzu) after sample acidification to removeinorganic C.The PLFA extraction was carried out as described byQuideau et al. (2016), using a three-stage extraction. Fro-zen soil ( −80/C14C) was freeze-dried and between 1 and1.5 g of soil was used for the extraction. Extracted sam-ples were analysed using a Gas Chromatograph-FID(Agilent Technology 6890N, Santa Clara, CA, USA). AC13 (methyl tridecanoate) and C19 (methyl non-adecanoate) mixed standard was used as an internal stan-dard in order to identify the range of the retention timesof the PLFAs of interest.Soil pH was determined on fresh soil samples (1:5 w/v; 30 min shaking) using milliQ water. Air-dried soil sam-ples were analysed for Olsen P as described by Murphyand Rilely (1962) and Olsen, Cole, Watanabe, and Dean(1954). Samples were extracted (1:20 w/v; 30 min shak-ing) with a 0.5 M NaHCO3solution, with pH adjusted to8.5, and subsequently filtered (Whatman No 42). Theextracted samples were analysed using a SEALAutoanalyzer AA3 (Seal Analytical, Fareham, UK; MethodNo G-103-92 Rev1; Multitest Mt7/MT8) based on themolybdenum blue colorimetric reaction. Soil dry matter(DM) and loss-on-ignition ( LOI) were determined using agravimetric method (Allen, 1989; Gardner, 1986).Approximately 12 g of fresh soil was oven-dried at 105/C14Cfor 48 h to constant weight to determineDW. Subsequently, around 1.5 g of oven-dried soil washeated at 550/C14C for 6 h in a muffle furnace, left to cool over-night and subsequently weighed to determine LOI. The TC(total carbon) and TN (total nitrogen) content of soils wasdetermined using an automated Dumas procedure on aCarbo Erba NA 1500 analyser (Erba Science, Surrey, UK),working with 30 ± 1 mg of oven-dried and ball-milled soil.Fresh soil samples were also extracted for available N using1 M KCl (1:5 w/v, 1 h shaking) (Bremmer, 1965; McTaggart& Smith, 1993) and filtered (Whatman No 42). The filtratewas subsequently analysed for NH4+and NO 3−contentusing a SEAL Autoanalyzer AA 3 (Seal Analytical; MethodNo G-102-93 Rev 2; Multitest MT7/MT8) with two differentcolorimetric reactions (ISO 11732, 1997 and ISO 13395,1996, respectively).2.5 |Calculations for % TC respired, CUEand statistical analysisThe % TC respired from soils after the addition ofdigestate was calculated as:%TC respired at each time −point =cumulative CO 2C produced at each time −point = ðTC present in the soil at day 0ð+TC applied in digestate amendment ÞÞ*100,where all C terms were expressed in mg.The CUE was estimated as described by Frey, Gupta,Elliott, and Paustian (2001) and Tiemann and Bil-lings (2011), using the following equation:CUE =dBc=dBc+XCO2C/C16/C17,where dBc is the change in C micro andPCO 2C is thecumulative C lost through microbial respiration duringthe incubation, both expressed in mg C. For both WDand SD treatments, C micro andPCO2C were standard-ized by the Ctr treatment, in order to focus on the fate ofC that was added to the soil with digestate, followingTiemann and Billings (2011). The CUE of Ctr treatmentswas not calculated, because no C was added to soils.Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1(R Core Team, 2019). One-way and two-way analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) were employed to assess the signifi-cance of the factors “soil”(HN, LN) and “digestateamendment ”(Ctr, WD, SD) and their interaction.2402 CATTIN ET AL . 13652389, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13091 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [13/04/2023].

ATukey-test (honest significant difference [HDS]) wasemployed to compare individual levels where a signifi-cant factor was identified in ANOVA. For CUE, aKruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the significance ofthe factors soil type and digestate amendment.Due to the non-linear nature of many response vari-ables across the incubations, multivariate polynomialregression was used to model time ×soil type ×digestateamendment interactions. Time was treated as a numeri-cal variable and expressed from 0 to 21 days. For Cmicroand DOC, in order to fully capture the nonlinear natureof changes through time, a cubic polynomial regressionwas used, whereas for cumulative CO2C efflux, %TCrespired and fungal:bacterial ratio linear regressionmodels were applied. Where significant regressionmodels were identified, t-tests were performed on cumu-lative CO2C efflux, %TC respired and fungal:bacterialdata in order to determine the nature of the time ×soiltype×digestate amendment interaction.In all statistical analyses, p-values <0.05 weredeemed as significant, whereas p-values between0.05and 0.06 were marked as borderline significantafter Hofmann and Meyer-Nieberg (2018). Residualplots (S-L, Q-Q, residual-leverage and Cook's distance -leverage) were employed to assess the quality of themodel fits and the assumption of normally distributedresiduals for ANOVA, as well as the presence of lever-age points or outliers. Missing observations wereexcluded from the analysis and no data imputationwas performed. Clear outliers, assumed to representsample error or contamination, were removed from thedatasets prior to analysis.3|RESULTS3.1 |Influence of treatments on CO 2Cefflux from soilsCumulative CO 2-C efflux from HN soils was significantlygreater than from LN soils across the incubations(p< 0.001) (Table 3). Further, di gestate amendment exertedsignificant control on cumulative CO2-C efflux ( p< 0.0001),with higher cumulative CO 2C efflux observed after theapplication of digestate to soils compared to control treat-ments, in the order Ctr < WD ≈SD. However, an interac-tion between soil type and digestate amendment wasobserved ( p< 0.0001), with significant increases in cumula-tive CO2C efflux after WD and SD application only occur-ring within LN soils and not within HN soils.A significant three-way interaction between time, soiltype and digestate amendment was also observed for cumu-lative CO2C efflux, as shown in Figure 1 ( p< 0.0001).Within the LN soil, both WD and SD amendments increasedcumulative CO 2C efflux rapidly and significantly throughtime when compared to the control treatment, reaching+563% (SD) and +377% (WD) at 21 days compared to fluxesin the control treatment. Further, SD and WD diverged sig-nificantly from each other from 14 days onwards. Within theHN soil, only the SD amendment generated significantlyhigher cumulative CO2C efflux and only from 14 days ofthe incubation onwards (+20% at 21 days when comparedwith Ctr), whereas WD and Ctr di d not differ significantly.Figure 2 reports the percentage of TC present in thecombination of soil and digestate amendment that wasrespired as CO2C during the incubations. In contrast tocumulative CO 2C efflux, no significant difference in %TC respired was observed between HN and LN soils.However, both WD and SD amendments resulted in sig-nificant increases in %TC respired compared to the Ctr(p< 0.001), in the order Ctr < WD ≈SD. Further, a sig-nificant interaction between soil and digestate amend-ment ( p< 0.001) indicated that significant increases in %TC respired following SD or WD application onlyoccurred in the LN soil, consistent with observationsrelated to cumulative CO2C efflux.A highly significant three-way interaction between time,soil type and digestate amendment was observed(p< 0.0001), indicating that the temporal pattern in %TCrespired after the addition of digestate depended on thenature of the soil at the start of the incubation. In the HNsoil, digestate amendments followed the same temporaltrend as the Ctr treatment. However, in the LN soil the %TC respired increased significantly through time followingboth WD (+372% at 21 days) and SD (+369% at 21 days)applications compared to the control treatment, an effectthat was observed from 1 day onwards in the incubations.3.2 |Influence of digestate amendmentson the soil microbial communityMicrobial biomass C was significantly higher in HN com-pared to LN soil ( p< 0.001). Further, C micro increasedsignificantly after the application of SD compared toeither Ctr or WD treatments ( p< 0.0001), by +29% at21 days in the HN soil and by +36% at 21 days in the LNsoil compared to the Ctr treatment (Figure 3). No signifi-cant interactions between soil type, digestate amendmentor time were observed for Cmicro, confirming that the sig-nificant increase following the application of SD wasobserved in both HN and LN soils and throughout theduration of the incubations.2404 CATTIN ET AL . 13652389, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13091 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [13/04/2023].

However, the impact of SD applica-tion differed between soil types, with a significantincrease in DOC concentration following SD applicationonly observed in the LN soil (Figure 5). No interactionbetween time, soil type and digestate amendment wasobserved with respect to DOC concentration.3.4 |Estimation of CUE after digestateamendmentTable 4 reports the CUE for each combination of soil typeand digestate amendment used within the incubationreported here. No significant difference in CUE wasobserved between the two soil types. However, digestateamendment exerted significant control on CUE(p< 0.05), with positive values of CUE observed follow-ing the application of SD and negative values after appli-cation of WD to soils; these effects were consistent acrossthe two soil types used in the incubations.4|DISCUSSIONThe application of digestate strongly influenced the Ccycle within the soils examined during this research. Thiswas evidenced by significant changes in the loss of Cvia gaseous pathways, the pr oduction of water-solubleDOC, and the biomass and composition of the soilmicrobial community. However, for many parametersthe impact of digestate ap plication depended on theinitial soil nutrient status, on the physical fraction ofdigestate that was applied, and on time across the21 days incubation. It should be noted that the historyof soil management with in the HN and LN soils islikely to have driven different responses between thesesoils to the treatments app lied in the experimentsreported here. For example, past digestate applicationto the HN soil may have been responsible for differ-ences in microbial commun ity composition and func-tional traits, compared to the LN soil.

Future researchwill be required in order to examine the interactionswithin plant-microbial-soil systems, including the netimpacts of these interactio n so nt h ef a t eo fCd e r i v e dfrom inputs of digestate to agricultural soil, and theimpacts of a wider range of so il management histories.4.1 |The influence of digestateapplication on CO 2C effluxThe efflux of CO 2C from soil, whether expressed as anabsolute flux or as a proportion of the TC within the com-bination of soil and digestate, increased significantly fol-lowing the application of digestate. This observation isconsistent with both previous laboratory and fieldresearch (e.g., Johansen, Carter, Jensen, Hauggard-Niel-sen, & Ambus, 2013; Pezzolla et al., 2012; WRAP, 2016),spanning grassland and arable soils. For example, fieldexperiments have reported an increase in cumulativeCO2efflux occurring across a 12-month period followingfour whole digestate applications (WRAP, 2016) andacross a 5-month period following three applications ofwhole digestate (Pezzolla et al., 2012). Further, a 9-daylaboratory experiment on arable soil revealed a two-foldincrease in cumulative CO2C efflux after wholedigestate addition when compared with untreated soil(Johansen et al., 2013). Although the research we reportabove used digestate from a single feedstock, it should alsob en o t e dt h a ts o m ep a s tr e s e a r c h has demonstrated signifi-cant effects on CO2efflux associated with variation indigestate feedstock and po st-digestion processing(i.e., separation) techniques (e.g., Askri, Laville, &Tre, 2016). These variables were not incorporated withinthe experimental system used in the research reported here.The data reported above confirm that CO2C effluxwas influenced by a significant interaction between soiltype and digestate, in which increases in this gaseous fluxof C following either WD or SD application only occurredin the LN soil. Increases in CO2C efflux followingdigestate application are partly consistent with de laFuente, Alburquerque, Clemente, and Bernal (2013) andGrigatti, Di Girolamo, Chincarini, Ciavatta, andBarbanti (2011), who report mineralization rates after theapplication of different fractions of digestate and theireffects on CO2C efflux. However, de la Fuenteet al. (2013) and Grigatti et al. (2011) report higherCO2C efflux following the application of SD comparedto WD, whereas in the research reported here CO 2Cefflux did not differ significantly between the two frac-tions of digestate. It should be noted that the research ofde la Fuente et al. (2013) involved a calcareous soil withnutrient content similar to the HN soils used in ourresearch, whereas Grigatti et al. (2011) also used a soil moresimilar in nutrient content to the HN compared to LN soilused in the current research. Differences in soil type mayhelp to explain why no significant difference in CO2Cefflux was observed between SD and WD within the LN soilin the research reported above. However, further workwould be required in order to understand why similar varia-tion in CO2C fluxes after application of different fractionsof digestate were not observed in the HN soils.The efflux of CO 2C increased rapidly from the earlystages of the incubations following the application ofeither SD or WD to the LN soil, whether expressed ascumulative CO2C or as a percentage of TC present inthe soil-digestate system. The effects of digestate applica-tion in the LN soil are likely to reflect the activation ofdormant bacteria and stimulation of maintenance respi-ration after the application of either fraction of digestate(Mondini, Cayuela, Sanchez-Monedero, Roig, &Brookes, 2006). In the LN soil, rapid increases in bacterialcatabolism are likely to have followed the application ofWD due to the input of readily available DOC, suggestingthat this C source may have been utilized quickly forenzyme production and maintenance of respirationwithin a few days after application, consistent with otherresearch (e.g., Wang et al., 2013; Wang & Post, 2012).After exhaustion of readily available C in WD, bacteriamay have started to mine SOM present in the soil to meetcontinued demand for nutrients (Fontaine et al., 2011;Fontaine, Bardoux, Abbadie, & Mariotti, 2004), or alter-natively turnover of the bacterial community may haveoccurred through the course of the incubation(Blagodatskaya, Blagodatsky, Anderson, &Kuzyakov, 2007), consistent with negative CUEs follow-ing the application of WD. However, the increase inCO2C efflux was higher and more persistent followingthe application of SD to the LN soil, possibly because fun-gal degradation of recalcitrant C compounds in SD pro-duced C by-products that were subsequently consumedby bacterial catabolism. Alternatively, bacteria may haveinvested directly in enzymatic degradation of recalcitrantC such as lignin within SD, as reported by Sierra (2012).In turn, this is likely to have resulted in prolongedincreases in respiration and CO2C efflux, consistentwith Fontaine, Mariotti, and Abbadie (2003), Sinsabaughet al. (2013) and Winogradzky (1924).In contrast, within the HN soil, only during the laterstages of the experiment and only after SD applicationwere increases in CO2C efflux observed, and only whenCO2C was expressed as a cumulative flux rather than asa percentage of TC present in the system.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensedegradation of recalcitrant C within SD are likely to havesupported the higher efflux of CO 2C from bacterial res-piration towards the end of the incubation (Six, Frey,Thiet, & Batten, 2006). In contrast, rapid exhaustion ofreadily available C, combined with the absence of aninput of more recalcitrant C in WD, meant that CO2Cefflux under this treatment did not differ significantlycompared to the control within the HN soil.Varying effects of digestate application on CO 2Cefflux between HN and LN soils are also likely to reflectdifferences in physicochemical conditions between thetwo soil types that influenced microbial metabolicresponses to the input of resources within the digestate(e.g., Larsson, Vonstockar, Marison, & Gustafsson, 1995;Manzoni et al., 2012; Russell & Cook, 1995). Within theHN soil, existing neutral soil pH, higher Cmicro, and DOCand lower C:N meant that the changes in microbial respi-ration following digestate input were relatively smallcompared to the control soil treatment. In contrast, theadverse soil conditions in the LN soil (low pH, Cmicro,DOC and nutrient concentration) created an environ-ment in which respiration of CO2from control soils wasrelatively low, and in which activation of dormant bacte-ria and subsequent increases in respiration followed theapplication of resources within both WD and SD(Mondini et al., 2006).4.2 |Changes in the soil microbialcommunity following digestate applicationBoth C micro and the fungal to bacterial ratio increased sig-nificantly following the application of SD, a pattern thatwas consistent across both HN and LN soils. Increases inCmicro following the application of SD were likely to bedriven by higher inputs of TC compared to the WD treat-ment, in order to achieve a consistent N application rateacross both fractions of digestate. The additional input ofC resources allowed greater opportunity for biosynthesisand the accumulation of C within new soil microbial bio-mass under the SD treatment. These observations relatedto Cmicro are supported by other research that has exam-ined the impact of digestate application on the soil micro-bial community. For example, de la Fuente et al. (2013)report increases in Cmicro only 7 days after the applicationof SD, driven by the high TC applied to soil with this frac-tion of digestate. Further, Chen et al. (2012) carried out a21-day incubation and report an increase in Cmicro thatwas related to a shift from r-strategists to K-strategists insoil that received biogas residues.The fungal-to-bacterial ratio of control HN and LNsoils indicated a microbial community that was domi-nated by bacteria, consistent with other research focusedon agricultural grasslands (Bardgett, Frankland, &Whittaker, 1993; Bardgett, Hobbs, & Frostegård, 1996;Bardgett & Leemans, 1995). However, this ratio increasedsignificantly following the application of SD to both soilsused in the incubations reported here, driven by anincrease in fungal PLFA rather than a decrease in bacte-rial PLFA. This observation is likely to reflect the signifi-cant input of more recalcitrant C compounds, such aslignin, associated with SD compared to WD (Nkoa, 2014).Hydrolysis of these C compounds has been shown to relypredominantly on the action of fungi rather than bacteria(Hammel, 1997), consistent with the increase in total fun-gal PLFA through the incubations reported here follow-ing the application of SD and in agreement with otherresearch (e.g., Rousk & Bååth, 2011; Walsh, Rousk,Edwards-Jones, Jones, & Williams, 2012). Fungal-produced C by-products following degradation of recalci-trant C within SD may also have sustained bacterial pro-duction (e.g., Bugg, Ahmad, Hardiman, &Rahmanpour, 2011; Dashtban, Schraft, Syed, &Qin, 2010; Ruttimann, Vicuna, Mozuch, & Kirk, 1991),including through generating a flush of DOC, which isavailable for the microbial community (Möller, Miller, &Kjöller, 1999). In contrast, the limited input of recalci-trant C following WD application produced no significantchange in fungal-to-bacterial ratio within the HN soil,alongside a relatively small and marginally significantdecrease in this ratio within the LN soil, reflecting adecrease in total fungal PLFA within the microbial com-munity under this treatment.Although the concentration of DOC was significantlygreater in soil following the application of SD compared toeither Ctr or WD treatments, this effect was only observedwithin LN and not within HN soils. Within the HN soil,DOC generated following the application of SD appearedto be efficiently metabolized by the microbial community,evidenced by an increase in Cmicro but no increase inCO2C efflux compared to control soils. In contrast, theapplication of SD to the LN soil increased DOC concentra-tions by the end of the incubation. This is likely to reflectunfavourable conditions for the microbial communitywithin the LN soil, including low pH and nutrient avail-ability, which can limit microbial metabolism of DOC, asnoted in previous research (David, Vance, Rissing, &Stevenson, 1989; Guggenberger, Glaser, & Zech, 1994;Jardine, Weber, & J. F. M., 1989; Vance & David, 1989).4.3 |Changes in CUE following digestateapplicationCarbon use efficiency varie d significantly between thedigestate treatments used in t he experiments reported here,CATTIN ET AL . 2409 13652389, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13091 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [13/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensewith consistent patterns observed across both soil types. Theapplication of WD resulted i n negative values of CUE,driven by greater decreases in C micro and by increasedCO2C fluxes compared to control treatments during theincubations. Decreases in C micro may reflect grazing by pro-tozoa and/or microbial turnover (Frey et al., 2001). Theinput of readily degradable C s u b s t r a t e sw i t h i nW Di sl i k e l yto have promoted the catabolic pathway and maintenanceof respiration of bacteria to a greater extent compared to theanabolic pathway, resulting in enhanced CO2C effluxesand decreased biosynthesis of C within microbial cells(Geyer et al., 2016; Manzoni et al., 2012). The magnitude oft h ee f f e c to fW Do nC U Ew a sm o r ep r o n o u n c e di nH Ncompared to LN soils. This obser vation reflects the smallercumulative CO2C efflux in HN soils compared to therespective controls, generating a more negative value ofCUE following the application of WD. Although C micro alsodecreased following the application of WD to LN soils, therelatively large increase in CO2Ce f f l u xc o m p a r e dt oc o n -trol soils resulted in a smaller value of CUE for LN soilscompared to the HN soils. The se observations emphasizethe potential for application of WD to result in net decreasesin C micro, rather than net accumulation of C within soilmicrobial biomass, due to the s timulation of maintenancerespiration and associated utilization of C from both nativesoil and substrate pools (e.g., Blagodatskaya et al., 2014;Moorhead & Sinsabaugh, 2006).In contrast to WD, positive values of CUE wereobserved following the application of SD to both soiltypes, with CUE in the range 0 –0.55, as reported for soilmicrobial communities by Sinsabaugh et al. (2013), whoaccounted for substrate C:N, the assimilation efficiencyof N, bacterial C:N and a CUEmaxin their research. How-ever, it is notable that a higher CUE was observed afterapplication of SD to HN compared to LN soils, reflectingsubstantial increases in Cmicro and relatively smallincreases in cumulative CO 2C efflux in HN soils follow-ing SD application, compared to control soils. AlthoughCmicro also increased in LN soils after the application ofSD compared to control soils, the increases in CO 2Cefflux were far more pronounced, resulting in lowervalues of CUE compared to HN soils. Increase in Cmicrofollowing SD application to soils indicates the potentialfor net accumulation of C within soil microbial biomass,in particular associated with increases in soil fungal com-munity anabolism and biomass (Keiblinger et al., 2010).However, it should also be recognized that cumulativeCO2C fluxes following the application of SD exceededthose under all other treatments used in our experiments.Therefore, application of SD to soils can potentially gen-erate adverse effects on absolute fluxes of CO 2to theatmosphere, whilst at the same time contributing posi-tively to the accumulation of C within soils.5|CONCLUSIONSThe research reported here provides important newinsights into how changes in the soil C cycle may followthe application of digestate to agricultural grasslands.The precise nature of these impacts is contingent on thephysical fraction of digestate applied to land and on thenutrient status of the soils that receive digestate. Thesolid fraction of digestate drove substantial increases inCO2C efflux, an effect that appears to be inverselyrelated to soil nutrient status. Microbial biomass C andthe fungal-to-bacterial ratio in soil also increased follow-ing the application of the solid fraction of digestate,regardless of initial soil nutrient status. The effects ofapplying whole digestate to soil were more variable.Although CO2C efflux increased following the appli-cation of whole digestate to soil at low initial nutrientstatus, no significant changes in microbial biomass Cor in fungal-to-bacterial ratio followed the applicationof whole digestate. Carbon use efficiency in soilsreceiving solid digestate was positive, indicating thepotential for C accumulation within soil microbial bio-mass. However, the accumulation of C within soil wasexceeded by the additional C lost from soils viaCO2C efflux. Further, CUE was negative in both soiltypes following treatment with whole digestate, drivenby decreases in C stored within microbial biomass andloss of C as CO 2C.These findings emphasize the need to carefullyplan the management of digestate in agricultural pro-duction systems, in order to minimize negative impactson C storage within soils whilst maximizing the agro-nomic value derived from digestate. Future researchshould seek to examine the impacts of a broader rangeof digestate fractions (whole, liquid, solid) on the soilC cycle in long-term field experiments, including theeffects of plant –soil interactions and longer-termchanges in CUE and SOM. In addition, researchshould seek to quantify the impacts of digestate appli-cation on other environmental parameters of concern,including the emission of greenhouse gases beyondCO2and the potential leaching of pollutants into thesubsurface.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe are indebted to the contribution from Chris Parry,who provided access to the digestate fractions and soilsused during this experiment.
