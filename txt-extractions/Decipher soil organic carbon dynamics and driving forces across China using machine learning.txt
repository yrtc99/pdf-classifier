However, the long-  term spatiotemporal changes of SOC at large scale, and the impacts of driving forces remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the dy -namics of SOC in different soil layers across China through the1980s to 2010s using a machine learning approach and quantified the impacts of the key factors based on factorial simulation experiments.Our results showed that the latest (2000–  2014) SOC stock in the first meter soil (SOC100) was 80.68 ± 3.49 Pg C, of which 42.6% was stored in the top 20 cm, sequestrating carbon with a rate of 30.80 ± 12.37  g C m−2 yr−1since the 1980s. Our experiments focusing on the recent two periods (2000s and 2010s) revealed that climate change exerted the largest relative contributions to SOC dy -namics in both layers and warming or drying can result in SOC loss. However, the in -fluence of climate change weakened with soil depth, while the opposite for vegetation growth. Relationships between SOC and forest canopy height further confirmed this strengthened impact of vegetation with soil depth and highlighted the carbon sink function of deep soil in mature forest. Moreover, our estimates suggested that SOC dynamics in 71% of topsoil were controlled by climate change and its coupled influ-ence with environmental variation (CE). Meanwhile, CE and the combined influence of climate change and vegetation growth dominated the SOC dynamics in 82.05% of the first meter soil. Additionally, the national cropland topsoil organic carbon in -creased with a rate of 23.6 ± 7.6  g C m−2 yr−1since the 1980s, and the widely applied nitrogenous fertilizer was a key stimulus. Overall, our study extended the knowledge    |  3395LI et aL.1 | INTRODUCTIONSoil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest component of the terres -trial organic carbon pool (Batjes, 1996), playing an essential role in the global carbon cycle and exerting profound feedback to climate change (Bradford et al., 2016; Davidson & Janssens, 2006; Prietzel et al., 2016). Furthermore, abundant organic carbon in soil is ben -eficial for soil fertility and quality, safeguarding food security and water retention (Lal, 2004; Zhao et al., 2018). Hence, increasing SOC stocks is widely considered as an effective approach to mitigate global warming and improve ecosystem services (Meyer et al., 2018; Prietzel et al., 2016). SOC dynamics are determined by the long-  term balance between inputs (i.e., aboveground litter or root exudates) through the vegetation net primary production and removals via a series of geophysical and biochemical processes (Plante & Conant, 2014). These processes closely interact with climate change, vege -tation growth, environmental variation, and even human activities (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000), making SOC (especially that in topsoil) be highly sensitive to changes in abiotic and biotic factors (Gaitan et al., 2019). As the largest organic carbon pool, the variations in SOC, even with a slight magnitude, may lead to critical disturbance to the global carbon cycle and climate (Paustian et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2019). However, our understanding about the long-  term spa -tiotemporal distributions of SOC and contributions of different driv -ers over large spatial domains are still limited.Assessment of the SOC dynamics at large scales is pivotal to un -derstand the global carbon cycle, which has attracted tremendous efforts in investigating SOC densities and stocks at global, national, and regional scales. Traditionally, two major approaches have been used to estimate SOC stocks over large spatial domains. The first way is to upscale the site-  level soil profiles to regional stocks based on the area-  weighted average method under the spatial constraints of soil taxonomic units (or other scope constraints). Substantial dif -ferences were found in different studies—  SOC stock in the global first meter was estimated to vary from 504 to 3000 petagrams of carbon (Pg C; 1 Pg C = 1015 g C) (Batjes, 1996; Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000; Scharlemann et al., 2014). Large differences were also re -ported at regional scales. For example, SOC stock in the first meter soil in China was estimated to be in the range of 69.1 to 185.7 Pg C (Ni, 2001; Tang et al., 2018; Wang & Zhou, 1999; Wang et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007, 2010). The dif -ferences in these estimates at different scales may result from dis -tinct soil profile sizes, locations, methods, and periods of sampling. The area-  weighted average method usually shows a poor spatial representation and coarse resolution (Stockmann et al., 2013). The second widely used method to investigate the SOC dynamics is the biogeochemical modeling built on prior knowledge (Allison et al., 2010; Franko, 1996; Li et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2003; Parton et al., 1998; Wieder et al., 2013). Estimates from different models usually present substantial divergences (both in magnitudes and trends) mainly caused by different model mechanisms (or structures), in -complete specification of processes, and key inputs and parame -ters (Zhang et al., 2017). Model calibration that relies on long-  term observations plays a key role in influencing the capability of these process models and is the prerequisite for accurate simulations of SOC stocks and dynamics (Hui et al., 2020; Stockmann et al., 2013).In recent years, growing studies using state-  of- the- art data- driven methods (or machine learning approaches) to estimate the spatio-temporal patterns of SOC have emerged and showed promising re -sults (Padarian et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2019). In terms of the spatial patterns of SOC, for instance, the global SOC density was mapped at a high spatial resolution (250 m × 250  m) (SoilGrids) using a ran -dom forest (RF) model (Hengl et al., 2017). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations generated the Global Soil Organic Carbon Map (GSOCmap) using several data-  driven ap -proaches (FAO & ITPS, 2018). There are also a large number of studies that utilized these state-  of- the- art methods to map SOC densities at landscape or regional scales (de Anta et al., 2020; Gomes et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019b, 2020). As for the dynamics of SOC at large spatial domain, the research community usually use independent data-  driven models trained by samples in different periods to predict the SOC maps in the corresponding period and evaluate the changes between these maps (Ding et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2019b). However, these models lack the temporal expansion ability, and a major reason is the lack of detailed time information with the measurements used in the model training. Over the past decades, substantial efforts have been made to survey and collect soil profile information across the country. This provides us a great opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC using a data-  driven model trained by time intensive samples.Deciphering the impacts of different biotic, abiotic, and anthro-pogenic factors on SOC dynamics are critical to understand how SOC will respond to future climate change, environmental varia -tion, and anthropogenic disturbances (Rossel et al., 2019). There is a broad consensus that the dynamics of SOC are largely controlled by the carbon input and carbon loss processes, which are closely associated with biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic drivers (Jackson et al., 2017). Soil physicochemical properties are strongly related about the dynamics of SOC and deepened our understanding about the impacts of the primary factors.KEYWORDSclimate change, factorial simulation experiments, fertilization, random forest, SOC, vegetation growth 13652486, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16154 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Biogeochemical processes related to SOC dynamics are substantially affected by climate change. Taking temperature as an example, warming can increase soil carbon input via promoting vegetation productivity, but it can also promote microbial activity and accelerate carbon decom -position (Prietzel et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020b). Hydrological condition is another important factor controlling the SOC dynam -ics (Suseela et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019a). Vegetation growth directly controls the carbon source of both soil surface through litter production and deep soil layer via root growth, exudation, and turnover, hence playing an essential role in controlling SOC distribution and dynamics (Plante & Conant, 2014). Environmental variations such as enriched CO2 and nitro -gen deposition may also exert substantial impacts on SOC dy -namics (Cheng et al., 2012; van Groenigen et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2005). Anthropogenic activities can bring about great disturbance on SOC balance, and among all these kinds of drivers, land-  use change may be the most significant factor of SOC destabilization (Poeplau et al., 2011; Wiesmeier et al., 2019). Agricultural manage -ment practices such as nitrogenous (N) fertilizer addition are also important for the balance of SOC. China has experienced signifi -cant variation ( p < .01) in precipitation, temperature, and vegeta -tion growth during the last few decades (Li et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2018). Previous assessments based on site-  scale measurements usually revealed the correlations between the spa -tial pattern of SOC and some influencing drivers. However, our knowledge about the long-  term SOC dynamics in different soil depths at the national scale under comprehensive influences of these factors is uncertain, not to mention the controlling drivers and their contributions.To understand the dynamics of SOC pool in China and the im -pacts of the key drivers, we developed SOC maps in the topsoil (0– 20 cm) and the first meter soil at 1km by 1km spatial resolution over China for the periods of 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s based on a machine learning approach and extensive measurements. We ana -lyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC in the two soil layers and further quantified the contributions of climate change, vegetation growth, and environmental variation to SOC dynamics based on factorial analysis experiments. More importantly, we presented the spatially explicit estimates of the dominant drivers for SOC dynam -ics in both soil layers.2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  |  Soil organic carbon samplesSoil profile investigations over China during the early 1980s (1979 ~1985) were collected from the Second National Soil Survey of the country (National Soil Survey Office, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996). This nationwide soil survey provided the most comprehen -sive soil property information of the nation. For each sampling site, the SOC density (kg C m−2) was calculated by the following equation:where Di, Bi, and Ci are  soil  depth  ( cm ) ,  bulk  density  (g  cm−3), and volume fraction (%) of the rock fragments with a particle size >2 mm in the soil horizon for each soil layer ( i), respectively. SOCC is soil or -ganic carbon content (g kg−1), which is calculated by multiplying soil organic matter (SOM) by 0.58. A total number of 2203 soil samples in the top 20 cm soil (topsoil, SOC20) and 2436 soil samples in the top 100 cm (SOC100) soil layers were obtained from this soil survey. The SOC measurements in the topsoil and the top 100 cm soil layers during the period of 2000 to 2014 were obtained from an open ac -cess database (Xu et al., 2018). This publicly available SOC data set contains 4515  soil samples for the topsoil and 3026  soil samples for the top 100 cm soil layer across China during this period, and those samples were collected from in- situ investigations of 1036 publicly published papers and database. Most soil samples ( >90% of topsoil samples and >81% of samples in the top 100 cm soil) contain the specific sampling time and some of them were annually-  continuously monitored ( >3 years). All collected samples were widely distributed in China and their locations encompassed the five main ecosystems in China, with over 35% of samples in cropland, followed by forest (~28%) and grassland ( ~20%) (Figure 1a,b).2.2  |  Soil organic carbon estimation based on the random forest model2.2.1  |  Splitting the training and testing time- series samplesIn this study, the RF model was selected to estimate the spatiotem -poral dynamics of SOC20 and SOC100. RF is an ensemble of deci -sion tree predictors, which uses the bootstrap resampling method to build decision tree for each sampling (Breiman, 2001). For the construction of each tree, samples are independently selected; however, the distributions for all trees in the forest are the same, which guarantees the robustness of the model. A specific number of trees (here 1200) were constructed during the model training. Two RF models were built to simulate SOC in the topsoil and the top 100 cm soil, respectively. To validate the temporal prediction capability of a RF model, we split the time-  series SOC samples into three different time periods—  observations during the early 1980s (1979–  1985), the 2000s (2000–  2009), and the early 2010s (2010– 2014). Observations during the first and last periods were used to train the two RF models, and the rest (those during the 2000s) were for validation. Under such a sample segmentation scheme, we can test whether the RF models can predict the temporal variation of SOC during these periods.(1) SOC=/uni2211.s1ni=1Di×Bi×SOCCi×(1−Ci∕100) ∕100 13652486, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16154 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Among the list of candidate driv -ers, one is opted out if its Pearson correlation coefficient with any other drivers was larger than 0.7 (Liu et al., 2022). Finally, 16 driv -ing factors were determined to estimate the SOC over China (Table S1). These drivers involved five categories, including soil property, terrain feature, climate change, vegetation growth, and environ -mental variation. The data sources and detailed information about these drivers were described in the Supplementary Materials. We extracted the predictor variable (e.g., climate and land-  use type) values linked to each sample, and the corresponding sampling time (a specific year or a period) was adopted as the temporal informa -tion. For the period 2000–  2014, the exact sampling years for most SOC measurements were available. However, SOC measurements during the 1980s did not contain a specific sampling time, then we used the mean values of the time-  variant drivers during this period (1979–  1985). The land use and land cover (LULC) map during this period was replaced by that in 1980. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) during this period was substituted by the average during 1982 and 1985. Similarly, for those samples with no exact sam -pling year (2000s and 2010s), we used the mean values of the time-  variant drivers during that period (2000s or 2010s). When we extract the feature properties linked to SOC samples beside a water body, we built a buffer ring with a radius of 5km that cov -ered the sample and then set each feature value as the average of all gird cell values or the most frequent value for soil types and LULC in the buffer. For extracting soil feature properties of differ -ent soil layers, the mean values of those in the corresponding soil depth were calculated. For the estimation of SOC100, apart from the above drivers, the estimated SOC20 maps  w ere  also  consid -ered as a new driver to build the model (Figure S1a,b).2.2.3  |  Model construction schemeWhen training the RF model, feature numbers between two and the maximum (i.e., 16) were randomly selected to find out the best split at each node, and the mean absolute error (MAE) of about one-  third of the samples (out-  of- bag, OOB) that were left out of the bootstrap sampling and decision tree construction was used to measure the FIGURE 1 Locations of soil organic carbon (SOC) samples used in the study and comparison between predicted and observed SOC at the training and testing phases in the two soil layers.

Measurements during the early 1980s (1979–  1985) and 2010s (2010–  2014) were used to train the random forest models and the measurements during the 2000s (2000–  2009) were used to validate the spatiotemporal prediction ability of the models.

After building all trees, the final predictions were determined by the weighted average outputs of all ensemble trees. The RF model generally shows a high ability in reducing the experi -mental noise and can enhance the prediction accuracy by aggregat -ing the predictions of multiple trees, so that is why the RF model has been successfully used in mapping the SOC in many regions (Gomes et al., 2019; Hengl et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020b). As mentioned by those past studies, a RF model without a validation strategy for the time-  varying prediction may only be able to simu -late the spatial variability of SOC while hard to predict the temporal variation of SOC. In this study, our validation strategy of splitting the time-  series samples into training (1980s and 2010s) and testing (2000s) parts can test the model ability in predicting SOC variations between time periods. The Python module “scikit-  learn” (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was used to build the RF regression models for SOC simulations in the two soil layers.2.2.4  |  Model validation and the uncertainty  detectionTo validate the spatiotemporal prediction ability (or robustness) of the RF model, we adopted the nine-  fold cross-  validation method, which means the initial training samples during the 1980s and 2010s were equally divided into 9 parts. For each split, 8/9 of the initial training samples were used to build a new model and the rest 1/9 samples and those during the 2000s were used to validate the model. Then, we can have 9 groups of training and testing samples. It means the cross-  validation method can detect not only the model performance in predicting the spatial variability of SOC but also the temporal variability of SOC across China, at least between time periods. Statistical indices of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination ( R2), the MAE, and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used to quantify the bias of the RF mod -els. For the unbiasedness of model sampling, we detected the spa -tial distributions of the training and testing samples, as well as the density distributions of the corresponding SOC observations during the model construction. Combining the validation strategy for the time-  varying prediction of the RF models and the nine-  fold cross- validation, we can fully detect the spatiotemporal prediction ability of the RF model for SOC across China.The verified RF models were then used to estimate SOC20 and SOC100 during the early 1980s, 2000s, and the early 2010s. Specifically, the RF models used the average maps of the time- variant variables during the 1979–  1985 (except for the LULC and NPP, see section “Model driver selection”) to simulate the SOC maps in the two soil layers during the 1980s. For the period of 2000–  2014, firstly, the time-  variant driver maps of each year were used to run the RF models, and the SOC maps in each year during this period were predicted. Then, the average SOC maps of the two soil layers during 2000–  2009 and those during 2010–  2014 were calculated as the final SOC maps for the periods of 2000s and early 2010s, respectively.The uncertainties of our estimates during different periods were quantified using the standard deviations of the nine-  fold cross-  validation simulations. It is worth noting that the uncertain -ties here exhibit the robustness of the model during the spatial prediction, indicating the uncertainties caused by the random sam -pling. Specifically, for the periods of 2000s and 2010s, we first used the nine-  fold cross-  validation models to simulate the SOC maps in each year during each period. Second, the average of SOC maps in both layers estimated by all validation models during each period were used as the final SOC maps. Third, the estimation uncertain -ties during the 2000s and 2010s for each soil layer were quantified using the standard deviations of the nine simulations by the cross- validation models during these two periods. The uncertainties of the estimates during the 1980s were determined as the standard devia -tions of the nine-  fold cross-  validation model simulations. Apart from examining the prediction ability of the two RF models, we adopted several approaches to validate the accuracy of our estimates. First, we validated the spatial patterns of our estimates by comparing them with other widely used SOC maps (SoilGrids and GSOCmap). Second, we compared the magnitudes of our estimated SOC densi -ties and stocks in different ecosystems with previous investigations. Third, variation trends of our predictions were also compared with previous investigations.2.3  |  Experimental design for driving factor analysis2.3.1  |  The contributions of time-  variant driver categories to soil organic carbon dynamicsThe dynamics of SOC among different periods were controlled by the three time-  variant driver categories (i.e., climate change, veg -etation growth, and environmental variation). Following a previous study (Yuan et al., 2019), we designed factorial experiments to iso -late the impacts of a specific time-  variant driver category on SOC in the two soil layers for the period of 2000–  2014 (Figure S1c,d). In the experiment, we just kept one specific driver category (e.g., climate) constant at their initial states (data at the first year, here 2000) in a single experiment, while allowing the other driver categories vary with time as they are (i.e., the time-  series in the real world) for each soil layer. For instance, the SOC2 0 - C l i ( or  SOC1 0 0 -  C l i) means that all drivers in the climate category remained constant at values in year 2000 but with real (time-  variant) features of drivers in vegetation and environment categories. Similarly, SOC2 0 - V e g (or SOC1 0 0 -  V e g) esti -mation experiment just kept vegetation drivers constant at values in year 2000, and SOC2 0 - E n v (or SOC1 0 0 -  E n v) kept environmental drivers constant at values in year 2000.By comparing the simulations between experiments, we could isolate the impact of a target driver category and quantify its con -tribution. To implement the comparison, we defined the differences between simulation driven by all variables in soil layer s and period y (SOCs- All,y) and that driven by partial time-  variant driver categories  13652486, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16154 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

We defined the single dominant driver category of each pixel as the variable with a relative contribution larger than 60%. If the maximum relative con -tribution of any driver category is below this threshold, the dominant driver category of that pixel is defined as the combination of the two driver categories with larger relative contributions among the three driver categories. When we carried out the factorial analysis model experiments for SOC100, the initial driver SOC20 was replaced by the new estimated SOC2 0 - V i , y (Figure S1d). Due to negligible SOC changes in desert area, the controlling driver analyses in this region are excluded.2.3.2  |  The impacts of key drivers on soil organic carbon dynamicsWe adopted three ways to detect the impacts of the key drivers (i.e., warming, precipitation variation, vegetation growth, and fer -tilization) on SOC dynamics. For warming and precipitation varia -tion, we conducted a sensitivity-  analysis experiment to quantify the impacts of these two drivers on SOC dynamics through chang -ing the magnitude of each driver during 2000–  2014. We designed three scenarios: 20% more precipitation (P +20%), 20% less pre -cipitation (P-  20%), and a raise of 2 ℃ in air temperature (T +2℃). The differences between the estimated SOC between actual situ -ation and designed scenarios indicate the impacts of warming and precipitation variation on SOC dynamics. All estimates of the nine-  fold cross-  validation models were used to quantify the uncertain -ties as described in section “Model validation and the uncertainty detection”. For the impact of vegetation growth, we used the for -est canopy height map with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km (Simard et al., 2011) to investigate the relationship between forest growth and SOC dynamics in the two soil layers. In addition, China has experienced a rapid growing application of N fertilizer since 1979 (Figure S2). However, because the N fertilizer consumption during 2000–  2014 was at a relatively stable level (22.85 million tons of N yr−1) compared with the early 1980s (10.47  Mt N yr−1), we com -pared the differences between cropland SOC20 during the 1980s and 2000–  2014 to detect the impact of N fertilizer on cropland SOC across China.3 | RESULTS3.1  |  Evaluation of the random forest modelsThe estimated and measured SOC densities during the model training phase (using samples during the early 1980s and 2010s) were significantly correlated, with a correlation coefficient (r ) of 0.96 ( p < .001) for both soil layers (Figure 1c,d). Positive correla -tions were also observed between the predicted and measured SOC densities during the model testing phase (using samples dur -ing the 2000s), with r being 0.74 and 0.65 for SOC20 and SOC100 (p < . 00 1 ) ,  r e s p e c t i v e l y .  T a k e  a l l  m e a s u r e m e n ts  a s  a  w h o l e ,  t h e  predicted SOC densities were closely associated with the meas -urements for both soil layers, with a r of 0.9 ( p < .001). The pre -dictions and measurements of all samples were also distributed nearby the 1:1 lines, with the RMSE equaling to 1.26 and 2.64 kg C m−2 for SOC20 and SOC100, respectively. These validations sug -gested that the trained RF models are capable to predict the spa -tiotemporal variability of SOC during the three periods (i.e., early 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s) over China.The wide distributions of both sampling locations and SOC- density magnitudes (training and testing samples) (Figure S3) jointly guaranteed the capabilities of the RF models for estimating SOC for the two soil layers across the country. Based on the nine-  fold cross- validation, we found that all robustness-  detection models explained more than 75% of the inter-  site variabilities of all SOC measurements across the country (Figure S4 and S5). The estimation error level is small (less than 1.38 and 2.9  kg C m−2 of RMSE for SOC20 and SOC100, respectively) (Figure S4 and S5), indicating that the RF models were able to generate reliable predictions of SOC in both soil layers. The robustness of the models mainly benefited from the unbiasedness in sampling which was reflected in the widely distributed samples for both soil layers and SOC density distributions (Figure S6 and S7). With the validated RF models, we produced the SOC maps in the topsoil and the top 100 cm soil over China during the periods of early 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s. The uncertainties (standard deviations of the cross-  validation model simulations) of the SOC estimates (Figure S8) showed that the high uncertainties were mainly occurred in the Qinghai-  Tibetan Plateau for both layers where the samples were rel -atively sparse. Overall, the national average uncertainties of SOC20 and SOC100 are in the range of 0.16–  0.18  kg C m−2 and 0.38–  0.49  kg C m−2 during different periods, respectively (Table 1).3.2  |  Spatiotemporal patterns of soil organic  carbonThe estimated SOC in the two soil layers exhibited similar spatial patterns during the study periods (Figure 2a,b; Figure S9), with (2) ActCons−Vi,y=SOCs−All,y−SOCs−Vi,y(3) RelCons−Vi,y=���ActCons−Vi,y���∑ni���ActCons−Vi,y���×100% 13652486, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16154 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

The low SOC lev -els were found on the northwestern China, Loess Plateau, Inner Mongolia, the Northeast China plain, the North China Plain, and the western Qinghai-  Tibetan Plateau.The average densities of SOC20 and SOC100 over China during 2000–  2014 were 3.74 ± 0.16 and 8.78 ± 0.38 kg C m−2, respectively, suggesting an increase of 14.72% and 9.61% when compared to the 1980s (3.26 ± 0. 18  kg C m−2 for SOC20 and 8.01 ± 0.49  kg C m−2 for SOC100). The total SOC100 storage of China during 2000–  2014 was estimated to be 80.68 ± 3.49  Pg C with 42.6% (34.37  ± 1.47  Pg C) stocking in the top 20 cm soil. Taking the middle year of 1982 (the mean of 1979–  1985) and 2007 (the average year of 2000–  2014) to represent these two periods, the average accumulation rates of SOC20 and SOC100 were 19.2 ± 3.3 and 30.8 ± 12.37  g C m−2 yr−1, re-spectively. Over the recent 15  years (2000–  2014), SOC20 increased from 3.69 ± 0.16  kg C m−2 (33.91  ± 1.47 Pg C as storage) during the 2000s (2000–  2009) to 3.84  ± 0.17  kg C m−2 (35.29  ± 1.56 Pg C as storage) during the early 2010s (2010–  2014), an increase of 4.07%. Similarly, the overall SOC100 in China also presented an increasing pattern from 8.69 ± 0.39  kg C m−2 (79.86  ± 3.58 Pg C as storage) during the 2000s to 8.98 ± 0.41  kg C m−2 (82.52 ± 3.77  Pg C as stor -age) during the early 2010s, an increase of 3.34%. Taking middle year 2004 and 2012 to represent the 2000s and early 2010s, the overall average SOC accumulation rates in China were 18.75 ± 7.18 g C m−2 yr−1 and 36.25 ± 1 5 . 8 1  g  C  m−2 yr−1 f o r  S O C20 and SOC100, respectively.Spatially, compared with SOC during the 1980s, SOC in most regions showed an increasing trend for both soil layers during the 2000s and 2010s (Figure S10). However, the variation of SOC over China from the 2000s to 2010s exhibited substantial spatial het -erogeneity across the country (Figure 2c). Considering this spatial heterogeneity of SOC change, our following analysis mainly focused on the periods of 2000s and 2010s. SOC in 70.87% of the topsoil showed an increasing trend from the 2000s to 2010s; meanwhile, SOC in 64.56% of the top 100 cm soil presented a positive change. Regions with a substantial increase mainly occurred in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, North China, Southeast China, the Loess Plateau, and the western Qinghai-  Tibetan Plateau (Figure 2c), whereas Southwest China and South China were the main regions that suffered from decreasing trends from the 2000s to 2010s.The average SOC20 and SOC100 in the four major ecosystems (for -est, shrubland, grassland, and cropland) and nine geographical zones across China exhibited increasing trends from the 1980s to 2000s and 2010s (Figure 2d; Table S2). For the period of 2000–  2014, the av -erage SOC density of the forest ecosystem was the highest for both topsoil (5.28 ± 0.16  kg C m−2) and top 100 cm soil (12.24 ± 0.37 kg C m−2), whereas the minimum level of SOC densities in the topsoil (3.46  ± 0.12  kg C m−2) and top 100 cm soil (8.9 ± 0.29  kg C m−2) were FIGURE 2 Spatial patterns and the changes of SOC in the two soil layers.

For carbon stock in the top 100 cm soil, grass -land and forest had the two largest amount of carbon, accounting for 31.88% and 31.68% of the national SOC100 stock, respectively, followed by agricultural land (19.65%) and shrubland (8.99%).3.3  |  The contributions of time-  variant driver categoriesThe relative contribution (RelCon) maps of the three time-  variant drivers (i.e., climate change, vegetation growth, and environmen -tal variation) for the two soil layers during 2000–  2014 are shown in Figure 3a,b. At the national scale, the average RelCons of cli -mate, vegetation, and environmental drivers to SOC20 were 48.5%, 17.32%, and 34.18%, respectively (inset in Figure 3a), indicating that climate change was the most important driver category controlling the SOC20 dyn a m i cs  a t  th e  n a ti o n a l  s ca l e  d u ri n g  th i s  peri od.  I t  i s  clear that the RelCon of climatic driver category was still the most significant one for SOC100 but decreased to 37.14%; whereas the RelCon of vegetation driver category increased to 30.49% (inset in Figure 3b), suggesting strengthened impact of vegetation on SOC along depth. Meanwhile, the RelCon of environment driver cat -egory showed a very slight decrease along the soil depth (32.37% for SOC100).The spatial distributions of the driver RelCon showed het -erogeneous geographical patterns for the two soil layers (Figure 3a,b). The dominant driver maps also illustrated the spa -tial differences of the driver impacts (Figure 3c,d). The climate-  dominant regions in SOC20 had the largest area, which were widely distributed across China, especially in Southeast China, Northeast China, South China, and the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau (Figure 3a,c). Environment controlling regions were mainly lo -cated in the eastern China and western Qinghai-  Tibetan Plateau. The vegetation- dominant regions were mainly distributed in North China and Southwest China. Different from the topsoil, the controlling area of vegetation on SOC dynamics in subsoil showed a higher percentage, especially in the eastern China (Figure 3b,d). Interestingly, a single factor category (climate, vegetation, or en -vironment) has limited impact (quantified by the dominant area of the dominant driver) on controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC (insets in Figure 3c,d), except for the climatic drivers for SOC20, which controlled the SOC20 dynamics of about 24.6% of FIGURE 3 The relative contributions (RelCon) of different drivers and the dominant drivers for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in the two soil layers.

Along with the single impact of climate change, the coupled influences of climate change and en -vironmental variation (CE and EC in Figure 3c) are also important drivers for SOC20, which together dominated 46.4% of the SOC dynamics in the topsoil (Figure 4j). Although the combined im -pacts of climate change and environmental variation are still im -portant drivers for SOC100, dominating 35.54% of the dynamics of SOC100 (Figure 3d), the combined impacts of climate change and vegetation growth (CV and VC), controlling about 46.51% of the variation inSOC100, became the most important drivers for subsoil (Figure 4j). In addition, the combined influences of environmental variation and vegetation growth (EV) also accounted for 12.21% of the dominant area in SOC100.We further quantified the drivers’ dominant areas in the nine geographical sub-  regions (Figure 4) and found that, similar to those at the national scale, a single driver showed limited impacts on the SOC dynamics in almost all sub-  regions, except for the climate change. Actually, CE, climate change, and CV are the three most im -portant drivers for SOC20 in almost all sub-  regions. Among these three drivers, CE controlled the largest are a proportion ( >~40%) of SOC20 in the nine sub-  regions, whereas CV and CE played the dominant role in controlling the subsoil organic carbon in all sub- regions. In addition, the dominant area of climate change and CE in most sub-  regions showed a decreasing pattern with soil depth, while that of CV exhibited an increasing trend with soil depth. Considering the decreasing relative contribution of climate change to SOC100 with soil depth, this increasing impact of CV was largely contributed by the enhanced influence of vegetation growth on SOC100. The in -creased impact of vegetation growth on SOC100 with soil depth are also reflected by the raised dominant area of VE with soil depth in all sub-  regions.3.4  |  The impacts of the key driversThe sensitivity-  analysis experiments by changing the magnitudes of air temperature and precipitation indicated that a 2 ℃ increase in temperature may significantly ( p < .05) reduce China's SOC stocks by 0.37 ± 0.18 and 0.55 ± 0.33  Pg C for the topsoil and top 100  cm soil, respectively (Figure 5a,b). A 20% increase in precipitation can significantly ( p < .05) raise China's topsoil organic carbon storage by 0.39 ± 0.18 Pg C, whereas the decreased precipitation by 20% did not significantly reduce the SOC stocks in the two layers. Overall, we can observe that warming mainly presents negative correlation with SOC dynamics while increase in precipitation may exhibit posi -tive impact on SOC at the national scale.Although the mean SOC significantly ( p < .05) correlated with the forest canopy height in the two soil layers at the national scale, the relationships between SOC and forest canopy height in these two soil layers exhibited different patterns (Figure 5c,d). For the topsoil, SOC20 showed the largest accumulation rate (0.12  kg C m−2 m−1) at the rapid growing phase of forest (forest shorter than the average canopy height ~19 m), while its increasing rate substantially decreased (0.02  kg C m−2 m−1) when forest getting mature (forest taller than the average canopy height). Interestingly, SOC100 b a s i c a l l y  p r e s e n t e d  a  p o s i t i v e  linear correlation with canopy height during both the rapid growing phase and mature stage, but the increasing rate at the mature phase (0.16  kg C m−2 m−1) was smaller than that (0.25  kg C m−2 m−1) during the prior phase. This phenomenon suggested the important potential of forest deep soil in sequestrating carbon at the national scale.Our estimates suggested that SOC20 in most croplands (94.02%) across China increased through the 1980s to 2000–  2014 and the de -creasing regions mainly located in Northeast China (Figure 5e). The  national average SOC20 in croplands increased from 2.87  ± 0.15  kg C m−2  FIGURE 4 The dominant drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in the nine sub-  regions and entire China.

Cropland SOC20 in the nine geograph -ical regions exhibited different increasing trends with the largest one (0.81  ± 0.17  kg C m−2) occurring in Southeast and Central China, fol -lowed by North China (0.71 ± 0.15  kg C m−2). Overall, cropland soils in China played an important role in sequestrating carbon since the 1980s, and the widely applied N fertilizer (Figure S2) can be an im -portant stimulus, especially for the agricultural lands in North China, Southeast China, Central China, and Southwest China (Figure 3c).4 | DISCUSSION4.1  |  Comparison-  based evaluation of model performanceWe adopted several approaches to validate the accuracy of our estimates. First, our sample splitting strategy and the validation confirmed the capability of the RF model in predicting the spatiotem -poral dynamics of SOC across China. Second, the nine-  fold cross- validation exhibited the robustness of the RF model in predicting the spatiotemporal variations of SOC. Third, there is no systematic deviation in the magnitude of our estimates compared to previous investigations (Table 1; Table S2), even though, the estimated shrub -land SOC density in the top 100 cm soil was a little higher than some previous investigations (Table S2). This may be caused by the classifi -cation differences of shrubland in different land cover maps because shrubs usually mix with herbaceous and woody vegetation, leading to difficulties in separating them from other land cover classes in re -mote sensing images (Herold et al., 2008). In this section, we further evaluated the spatial patterns and variation trends of our predictions with other widely-  used SOC maps and previous investigations.As for the spatial patterns, our estimated SOC density maps in the topsoil is consistent with that of the SoilGrids ( R2 = .73, p < .001) and GSOC map ( R2 = .57, p < .001) SOC maps (Figure S11 and S12). The estimated SOC100 showed an overall similar spatial pattern with the SoilGrids SOC100 (Figure S13a,b) and other studies (Shangguan et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2018). Notably, the SoilGrids SOC stock in the first meter soil layer is ~144.58 Pg C with a density of 15.53 kg C m−2 for an area of 930.97  km2, which is much larger than our esti -mate and most previous studies (Table 1). The overestimation of the SoilGrids SOC maps in China and other regions were also reported by previous studies (Chen et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2019; Tifafi et al., 2018). We checked the global soil profiles that were used to produce the subsoil SOC maps (under 15 cm) in SoilGrids (Figure S12c) and found that although there are 2886 sites distributed over China, they only accounted for 1.52% of all global subsoil sites. SOC maps in the SoilGrids were produced based on a global scale model FIGURE 5 Impacts of the key drivers on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and the changes in cropland SOC in the topsoil from the 1980s to 2000–  2014. (a) and (b) illustrate the predicted average SOC under different precipitation variation and warming scenarios in the two soil layers. The letters upon the boxes indicate the significant differences ( p < .05) between average SOC over China under different scenario simulations. The range of each box shows the difference among the national averages of the nine cross-  validation model estimates. (c) and (d) present the distributions of SOC among different forest canopy height levels in the two soil layers. The fitting curves were fitted using logistic regression and “95% P.B.” represents the 95% confidence interval of the prediction band. The vertical green dashed lines separate the rapid growing and mature phases of forests in China, which was determined as the average canopy height of forests ( ~19 m) in China. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of SOC in the corresponding canopy height range.

However, calculation based on these observations showed that the average subsoil organic carbon content in China (7.7 g/kg) was much less than that of the rest region (14.97 g/kg). Thus, the limited sam -ple amount in China and the relatively lower organic carbon content may lead to the overestimation of the SoilGrids subsoil SOC in China.As for the variation trends of our predictions, our estimated SOC20 variation trend in forest (23.48 ± 4.46  g C m−2 yr−1) from the 1980s to 2000s is basically consistent with a previous investiga -tion (20 ± 5.5  g C m−2 yr−1) (Yang et al., 2014). The average trend (29.43  ± 13.31  g C m−2 yr−1) of our estimated SOC20 in the Tibetan Plateau grassland from the 2000s to 2010s is also close to a previous investigation (28.0 g C m−2 yr−1 for the topsoil) (Ding et al., 2017). Our estimated increasing magnitude of cropland SOC20 (0.59  ± 0.19 kg C m−2) from the 1980s to 2000–  2014 is comparable with a previous investigation (0.43 ± 0.09kg C m−2) from 1980 to 2011 (Zhao et al., 2018). Above comparisons suggest that our estimates are relatively reasonable and satisfactory in both magnitude and spatiotemporal patters, illustrating the capability of the RF model in predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC across China.It is noted that although our simulations are comparable with pre -vious studies as described above, there are three distinct improve-ments. First, our model has been tested to have the spatiotemporal expansion capability, which provided new insights for the temporal variation of SOC. Second, we provided the maps of long-  term SOC dynamics in different soil depths with full evaluation, and can be im -portant and attractive supplements to the existing static SOC maps or site-  scale measurements. Last but not least, we spatially quanti -fied the contributions of the driving forces to SOC dynamics.4.2  |  Divergent soil organic carbon responses in different soil depthsOur simulations revealed that climate change exerted the largest relative contribution compared to environmental variation and veg -etation growth at the national scale, especially for topsoil. This is because the chemical and biochemical reactions related to the soil carbon input and loss are temperature-  dependent and also sub -ject to moisture condition (Armas-  Herrera et al., 2012; Davidson & Janssens, 2006; Meyer et al., 2018). Our sensitivity-  analysis experiments based on air temperature and precipitation further deciphered how climate change affect the SOC dynamics and dem -onstrated that both warming and drying can reduce the SOC storage while a wetter condition showed positive impact on it at the national scale (Figure 5a,b). Our results not only confirmed the previous con -clusion based on correlation analysis (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000; Luo et al., 2020; Schindlbacher et al., 2009; Suseela et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2018) but also provided the quantified contributions of these factors, providing a paradigm for evaluating the impacts of differ -ent influcing drivers. As for the weakened impact of climate change on SOC with soil depth, this is mainly due to that shallow soil or -ganic matter was more vulnerable to warming than that of deep soil organic matter (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000; Walz et al., 2017). The labile carbon formed by plant residues and topsoil root exu -dates dominate the turnover of organic matter in shallow soil with the highest microbial abundance and diversity (Liebner et al., 2008). Simultaneously, most biological mediated processes take place in the shallow soil, which could quickly respond to slight changes of climate (Knapp et al., 2008).Plant biomass allocation between aboveground and below -ground and the root depth control the relative distribution of or -ganic carbon in soil profile (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000), and root is the main source of organic matter in deep soil, dominating the dynamics of deep SOC (Nepstad et al., 1994). In addition, roots are generally harder to be decomposed than topsoil litter (Rasse et al., 2005), re -sulting in a relatively greater impact of vegetation growth on SOC dynamics in deep soil. The relationships between forest canopy height and SOC in the two soil layers further illustrated these dif -ferent impacts of vegetation growth on SOC dynamics in different soil depths (Figure 5c,d). Although the topsoil carbon accumulation rate substantially decreased when the forest canopy height exceeds the average level across China (i.e., getting mature), subsoil in ma -ture forest still showed a comparable carbon sequestration rate as the rapid growing phase. Our results are consistent with previous investigations that revealed the old-  growth forests can accumulate atmospheric carbon at a high rate (Tang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2006). It can be attributed to the impact of litter quality (i.e., litter carbon-  to- nitrogen ratio) on the SOC accumulation (Sumiyoshi et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019a), because a lower litter C/N ratio in the mature forest can increase litter turnover and the carbon-  use efficiency of microorganisms (Huang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2019a). China have experienced a rapid expansion of affor -estation over the past decades, and these rapid-  growing plantation forests have substantially promoted the carbon sink capacity of eco -systems through photosynthesis (Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a). The ongoing nationwide ecological protection programs such as the Grain-  for- Green and the Natural Forest Protection projects have greatly improved the soil environment, causing the increase of SOC stock, as previously confirmed (Tang et al., 2018). Our results high -lighted that, with the rapid growth of the large proportion of young forests in China, soils in these new planted forests may also exhibit high potential in sequestrating carbon.The agricultural development in China largely depended on N fertilizer, and its amount increased rapidly from1979 to 2000–  2014 to meet the rising demand for food (Figure S2). Our estimates re -vealed that the increasing trend of cropland SOC20 throughout the 1980s to 2000–  2014 (Figure 5e), and fertilization showed the domi-nant impact on controlling the SOC20 dynamics in these agricultural lands (Figure 3c). The increased N fertilizer over this period played a key role in promoting the soil carbon sequestration in the croplands through the enhanced biomass production (Snyder et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2018). Nonetheless, it should be noted that fertilization is not absolutely beneficial to soil carbon sequestra -tion (Zhao et al., 2018) because excessive use of N fertilizers can result in soil acidification, which can deteriorate the stability of SOC  13652486, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16154 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Chinese government has issued a series of eco-  agricultural policies to optimize the intensive agricultural devel -opment. It is predictable that the optimized fertilization and contin -uously enhanced straw/stover return to soils (Zhao et al., 2018) can further benefit the SOC stocks in croplands.4.3  |  Uncertainties and limitationsAlthough the visual comparisons and statistical evaluations of all model validations showed that our estimates were reasonable and acceptable, there still exist uncertainties and limitations in the study. A potential limitation is the different spatial resolutions of the model inputs. We used several grid datasets to predict the SOC distribu -tions and dynamics, and some of them were extracted from the global-  scale datasets. Take the WoSIS SoilGrids soil parameters as an example, these datasets were constructed based on extensive field investigations ( ~150,000 soil profiles) across the world and owned a higher spatial resolution compared with other global soil property data sets (Hengl et al., 2017). Although the producers used a few approaches to control the accuracy of the data sets (Batjes et al., 2020; Hengl et al., 2017), the performance and accuracy of such a high resolution global data set may cause some biases and bring uncertainties in our study. Therefore, extensive evaluation of these data sets locally in different regions may deserve further work in future by the scientific community. Another limitation is that some factors that may induce SOC variations were not introduced into our model simulation due to the data unavailability at large scale. For example, litter quality (i.e., litter C/N ratio) may be a key factor con -trolling the SOC accumulation (Sumiyoshi et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019a). The nationwide ecological protection pro -grams, grazing activity, and agricultural practices may also affect the SOC dynamics locally or regionally (Deng et al., 2014; Lal, 2004). Developing reliable data of these programs/practices and investigat -ing their impacts on SOC dynamics at the national scale would be a promising subject in future study.5 | CONCLUSIONSThis study provided the investigated SOC dynamics for different soil layers over China using a machine learning approach and ex -tensive measurements during the early 1980s, 2000s, and early 2010s. Our spatiotemporal estimates of SOC confirmed soils in China functioned as carbon sink at the nation scale, with an accu -mulation rate of 30.8 ± 12.37g C m−2 yr−1 in the first meter soil since the 1980s. Using factorial analysis experiments, we further quanti -fied the impacts of different time variant factors on SOC dynamics and found that climate change exerted the largest relative contribu -tions to SOC dynamics in the two soil layers. However, the climate change-  induced influence on SOC weakened with soil depth, while vegetation growth exhibited a strengthened impact with soil depth. Relationships between SOC and forest canopy height confirmed this strengthened impact of vegetation with soil depth and implied that forest soil in China may exhibit a high potential in sequestrating at -mospheric CO2 with the rapid growth of young forests owing to the nationwide expansion of afforestation over the past decades. Using the sensitivity-  analysis experiment, we concluded that warming and drying can both negatively affect the SOC stocks, while the increase in precipitation showed a positive contribution. Our simulations further suggested that SOC dynamics is not simply controlled by a single driver. In fact, climate change and its coupled impact with en -vironmental variation (CE) were the two key drivers for SOC20, con -trolling the SOC dynamics in 71% of topsoil. Meanwhile, CE and the combined influence of climate change and vegetation growth were the most important drivers for SOC100, dominating the SOC dynam -ics in 82.05% of the first meter soil. Additionally, we have spatially quantified the changes in cropland SOC20 across China and found an increasing rate of 23.6 ± 7.6  g C m−2 yr−1 through the 1980s to 2000–  2014. The widely applied N fertilizer since 1979 can be an important stimulus to the increase in cropland SOC. Overall, our spatiotempo -ral estimates can be important and attractive supplements to the existing static SOC measurements, and emphasized the combined impacts of different factors on SOC dynamics.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (31961143011, U20A2089), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFC0507403), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB40020205), Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program (2022ZDLSF06-  04), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (xzy022020008), Technology Innovation Center for Land Engineering and Human Settlements, Shaanxi Land Engineering Construction Group Co.
