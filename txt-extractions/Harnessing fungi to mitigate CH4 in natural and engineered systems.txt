MINI-REVIEWHarnessing fungi to mitigate CH 4in natural and engineered systemsJason P. Oliver1&Jonathan S. Schilling2Received: 17 May 2018 / Revised: 26 June 2018 /Accepted: 26 June 2018 /Published online: 7 July 2018#Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018AbstractMethane (CH 4) is a powerful greenhouse gas emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources, and its emission rates vary amongsources as a function of environment, microbial respiration, and feedbacks. Biological CH 4flux from natural and engineeredsystems is typically represented simply as generation of CH 4by methanogens minus oxidation by methanotrophs. In many cases,however, CH 4flux is modulated by transport and solubility mechanisms that occur before oxidation or other chemical transfor-mation. The ability of fungi to directly oxidize CH 4remains unclear; however, their hydrophobic growths extending abovemicrobial biofilms can improve surface area and sorption of hydrophobic gases. This can improve overall oxidation rates in abiofilm simply by improving phase transfer dynamics and bioavailability to bacterial or archaeal associates. This indirectfacilitation is not necessarily intuitive, but there has been a recent emerging interest in harnessing these fungal abilities inengineering bioreactors and filtration systems designed to capture and oxidize CH4. These dynamics may be playing a similarfacilitative role in natural CH 4oxidation, where fungi may indirectly influence carbon mineralization and methanogen/methanotroph communities, and/or directly oxidize and dissolve gaseous CH 4. This review highlights these unique roles forfungi in determining net CH 4oxidation rates, and it summarizes the potential to harness fungi to mitigate CH 4emissions.Keywords Anaerobic digester .Biofilter .Hydrophobin .Methanogen .Methanotroph .RumenIntroductionMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas of significant concerndue to the magnitude of its anthropogenic sources and to itspotential feedbacks with warming, which may trigger massivenatural CH4releases. Although it is a trace atmospheric gas,CH4is the second most significant greenhouse gas after car-bon dioxide (CO 2), accounting for up to 20% of the globalwarming effect (IPCC 2014 ;X ue ta l . 2016 ). The significanceof CH 4-related warming is driven by a potent global warmingpotential that is ~ 25 times that of CO 2over a 100-year period(EPA 2018 ), and 84 –87 times greater over a 20-year period(EPA 2015 ). This is compounded by the rise in the meanatmospheric concentration of the trace gas from around0.7 ppm pre-nineteenth century to around 1.845 ppm currently(NOAA 2017 ). This 2.5 factorial increase has largely been theresult of industrialization and human activity, with naturalsources —which originally accounted for ~ 90% of pre-industrial global CH4emissions (Conrad 2009 )—nowrepresenting only ~ 30% of the total (Saunois et al. 2016 ).Today, roughly a third of CH 4emissions are from entericfermentation and manure management, while another thirdare related to the extraction of natural gas and other fossil fuels(EPA 2018 ).Many natural fluxes of CH 4are sensitive to climate change.These include elevated CH 4releases from permafrost, wet-lands, and freshwater systems, as well as the vulnerability oflarge frozen marine sediment stores, like clathrates (Hamdanand Wickland 2016 ; Singh et al. 2010 ). There are also un-known feedbacks between climate and natural terrestrialsources of CH 4(Campbell et al. 2009 ). Many of the nuancesof CH 4flux are not yet resolved and, as a consequence, arepoorly represented in Earth System Models (James et al. 2016 ;Wieder et al. 2013 ). The controls and tipping points of poten-tially massive CH 4releases from marine, freshwater, and ter-restrial sources remain uncertain.The significance of human sources, their potential impacton natural CH 4flux, and the fact that CH 4has a relativelyshort (12.4-year) lifespan in atmosphere (IPCC 2014 )m a k e*Jason P.

Toaddress this global priority, resolution of the microbial under-pinnings of the CH 4cycle is needed, both to improve modelsand foster the development of effective CH 4mitigation strat-egies (Conrad 2009 ; Nazaries et al. 2013 ). To date, most re-search dealing with microbial CH 4dynamics have been lim-ited to select prokaryotes known to generate and oxidize CH 4,despite the fact that these microbial groups rarely exist insolitude and instead form co mplex community networks(Konopka 2009 ). There is also new evidence from natural(Ivarsson et al. 2016b ) and engineered systems (Lebrero etal.2016 ) that eukaryotic fungi have an underappreciated yetintegral role in the CH4cycle. In the subsequent sections, thismini-review will summarize our understanding of the indirectand direct roles fungi play in oxidizing and generating CH4,and will highlight the potential utility of these eukaryotes inCH4mitigation strategies.Methanogens and methanotrophsTraditionally, biologically generated (biogenic) CH 4has beenattributed solely to methanogens, while methanotrophs havebeen considered exclusive oxidizers of CH4. Methanogens arearchaea that belong to the phylum Euryarchaeota , and areclassified into two groups based on their fastidious mechanismof CH4generation. One type —the hydrogenotrophs —gener-ates CH 4almost exclusively from the reduction of CO 2,w i t hH2used as the typical electron donor. Other methanogens cangenerate CH 4by degrading acetate or other simple, methylat-ed organic compounds (Costa and Leigh 2014 ). Methanogenscan be thought of as terminal organisms whose metabolism ishighly dependent upon the supply of simple carbon metabo-lites generated by other microbes.Most methanotrophs belong to the gamma- (type Imethanotrophs) or alpha- Proteobacteria (type II) and are dif-ferentiated by their morphologies and mechanism of carbonassimilation. These bacteria generate energy by oxidizing CH4with O 2to form methanol, formaldehyde, formate, and finallyCO2.C H 4monooxygenase (MMO), a critical enzyme thatcatalyzes the initial oxidation of CH 4, is indicative ofmethanotrophs and exists in two forms —particulate(pMMO) or solubilized (sMMO) —the latter restricted to typeII methanotrophs (Hanson and Hanson 1996 ). More recently,a third group of methanotrophs has been identified thatuniquely couple carbon and nitrogen cycles, bacteria capableof nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (N-DAMO)in consortia with archaea (Raghoebarsing et al. 2006 )a n di npure culture (Ettwig et al. 2008 ). While N-DAMOmethanotrophs may be more important in inland lakes andrivers where nitrate runoff occurs (Shen et al. 2015),methanotrophs, regardless of type, typically reside in anoxic/oxic interphase habitats, co-localized near methanogens,where they can effectively reduce the CH4emissions pro-duced by methanogenesis (Conrad 1996 ).CH4transport limitations and the potentialinfluence of fungal hyphaeThe flux of biogenic CH 4is governed by gas transport mech-anisms through solid-phase environments such as soil in na-ture or biofilter media in engineered bioreactors —it is notsimply the interplay of methanogens and methanotrophs(Nazaries et al. 2013 ; Scheutz et al. 2009 ). CH4is a hydro-phobic, relatively insoluble gas at ambient conditions (solu-bility = 0.024 g CH4L−1water at 20 °C, 1 atm), with limitedmass transport through water (dimensionless Henry ’s law con-stant = 30) estimated to be 10,000 times slower than throughair (Castro et al. 1995 ; López et al. 2013 ). Consequently, in thecase of well-studied soil systems, CH4moves more readilythrough aerated, course soils than through saturated sedimentsand wetted fine loams (Dorr et al. 1993 ). With transport ratelimiting, CH4generation and oxidation are highly dependenton the soil/sediment properties, with oxidation rates increas-ing with diffusivity, porosity, and organics content (Ball et al.1997a ,b) and decreasing when air is displaced by moisture(Bhullar et al. 2013 ; Maier et al. 2017 ).In these microhabitats in soils and other similar environ-ments, fungi are unique regulators of transport and agents ofmass transfer from gas to aqueous phases (Treseder andLennon 2015 ). Many fungi secrete hydrophobic proteins thatself-assemble on their surfaces, and enable their hyphae toescape the surface tension of water films and extend into soilpore space (Fricker et al. 2017 ). For this purpose, fungi essen-tially bridge inter-colloidal airspace, form a conduit for waterand nutrient transport (Linder 2009 ), and effectively alter thesoil/sediment structure and its permeability (Ritz and Young2004 ). These hydrophobic proteins, called hydrophobins(Wosten 2001 ), have also been shown to facilitate fungal ad-sorption of hydrophobic gases (Vergara-Fernández et al. 2006 ;Vigueras et al. 2008 ), and physical chemistry research sug-gests there are unique interactions between the surfaces ofhydrophobin monolayers and CH4(Patel and Garde 2014 ;Ley et al. 2015 ).The aerial growths of fungi are also a well-recognized pointof attachment for bacterial biofilms (Hogen et al. 2007 ). It isthus plausible that the methanotrophs co-localize on the grow-ing hyphae of CH4-capturing fungi where gas transfer limita-tions would be minimal, although little is known about theseinteractions. One study verified with molecular approachesthat methanotrophic bacterium from the genusMethylobacterium had successfully colonized the surface ofthe soil fungus Glomus intraradices (Scheublin et al. 2010 ).Another study presented scanning electron microscopy (SEM)7366 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375images that showed the hyphae of an arbuscular mycorrhizalfungus co-located, spatially, with Methylobacterium oryzaeon plant roots (Kim et al. 2010 ). While the CH 4oxidizingpotential of Methylobacterium is debated (Dedysh et al.2004 ), these studies do suggest that bacteria known to growon one-carbon compounds like formate, formaldehyde, andmethanol can utilize soil fungi as a point of attachment.There is also evidence that CH 4can trigger simultaneousgrowth of fungi and methanotrophs in agricultural (Arif etal.1996 ) and landfill soils (Watzinger et al. 2008 ).Oxidation of CH 4by aerobic fungiIn addition to providing space for gas capture andmethanotroph attachment, there are reports of fungi in thegenus Graphium oxidizing CH4, directly. Using batchbiodegradation tests, Lebrero et al. ( 2016 )d e m o n s t r a t e dt h a taGraphium culture, verified not to be contaminated withmethanotrophic bacteria, was able to sustain CH 4oxidation,providing methanol supplementation. Methanol has also beenshown to promote CH 4oxidation in forest soils (Benstead etal.1998), and like Graphium sp., some pure culturemethanotrophs similarly co-metabolize CH 4and methanol(Jensen et al. 1998 ).Graphium is a small genus, but has wide-spread distribution on varied substrates. It is noteworthy thatthe fungal isolate used by Lebrero et al. ( 2016 ) was originallyisolated from natural gas plumbing in CH4-enrichment cul-tures (Curry et al. 1996 ). How widespread this ability in fungiis, or how prevalent fungi are in CH 4-rich environments, is notknown.Harnessing fungi for CH 4biofiltrationBased on their potential to facilitate CH 4capture and oxida-tion, fungi are of growing interest for their applications tobiotechnologies designed to mitigate anthropogenic CH 4emissions, a field long dominated by prokaryotic-centric re-search. While high-concentration CH 4emissions (> 30% v/v)can be harnessed for energy production, and flaring is a cost-effective technology to mitigate lower concentration CH4emissions (> 20% v/v) if emitted at sufficient flow rates (>10 m3h−1), fugitive emissions from landfills, coal minesvents, manure pits, and long-term storages typically do notmeet these requirements (Menard et al. 2012 ). This presentsa problem, globally, as it is estimated that most anthropogenicCH 4is emitted at concentrations less than 3% (AvalosRamirez et al. 2012 ). Potential solutions are gas-phasebiofilters (Fig. 1a) and biotrickling filters (BTF, Fig. 1b), bothharnessing microbial catalysts that are immobilized on themedia of packed-bed reactors. These designs can treat low-concentration contaminants in gaseous effluent emitted at arange of flow rates (Delhomenie and Heitz 2005 ), and aresuitable for many anthropogenic CH 4emissions.CH4biofiltration was first recognized in soils covering aretired landfill (Whalen et al. 1990 ). In the decades followingthat research, biofilters harnessing the action ofmethanotrophs have been engineered and applied to landfillemissions (Menard et al.,2012 ), coal mine (Limbri et al.2014 ), and livestock facility ventilation exhausts (Girard etal.2011). While methanotrophic biofilters can routinelyachieve removal efficiencies > 80% from passive-flow landfillexhausts (Chanton et al. 2011; Obulisamy et al. 2016 ), CH4capture is less efficient in biofilters used to treat high flow rateexhausts. When ventilation rates are rapid, as is typical of coalmine (Limbri et al. 2013 ) and livestock facility ventilationsystems (Veillette et al. 2012 ), the low solubility of CH 4cre-ates mass transfer limitations in biofilters (Ferdowsi et al.2017 ) and BTFs (Estrada et al. 2014 ). In BTFs, the use ofliquid sorbents or innovative reactor configurations has beendemonstrated by Estrada et al. ( 2014 ) to improve mass transferand CH4removal rates. To improve biofilter CH 4capture,larger reactors can be used to increase empty bed residencetime (EBRT = volumetric flow rate [m3min−1] / volume ofreactor media [m3]), but this is reasonable only for some ap-plications like large coal mining facilities where coal can beused as an inexpensive reactor media (Limbri et al. 2014 ). Inother applications like livestock facility ventilation, which areresponsible for 14.5% of global CH 4(Gerber et al. 2013 ),space and cost restraints limit the feasibility of large biofilters.Biofilters that utilize fungi as biocatalysts in concertwith methanotrophs may provide a strategy to improveCH 4mass transfer without major changes to the reactorsize or configuration. Fungi offer many advantages inbiofiltration, including their ability to improve capture ofhydrophobic emissions (Kennes and Veiga 2004). To ourknowledge, Girard et al. ( 2012) conducted the first exper-iments that tested the ability of fungi to improve CH 4biofiltration. Using lab-scale biofilters packed with inor-ganic media and designed for a 4.2-min EBRT, they com-pared four fungal strains against a non-inoculated controland the influence of swine manure irrigation. Althoughelimination capacities up to 19 g CH4m−3h−1were obtain-ed, by the end of the experiment, the fungal inoculationswere outcompeted by competitive colonizer microbes en-tering the system via the semi-continuous manure irriga-tion. Lebrero et al. (2016) were able to maintain a fungalinoculant ( Graphium sp.) in a biofilter designed for a 20-min EBRT, and achieved an elimination capacity of39 g m−3h−1(removal efficiencies of ~ 90%). Althoughthis residence time would be too long (i.e., required reactorsize would be too large) for many anthropogenic CH4emission sources, this study demonstrated that fungal-inoculated biofilters had more stable and higher perfor-mance than comparable methanotroph-only biofilters.Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375 7367In lab-scale biofilters designed for a 25-s EBRT (more rep-resentative of a livestock facility ventilation system), we pre-viously showed certain inoculums of wood decay fungi couldalso improve capture of CH 4from manure storage emissions(Oliver and Schilling 2016 ), although elimination capacitieswere low (5 g m3h−1) at these high flow rates. Utilizing thesame multi-staged biofilters and a chromatographic isotherm,it was also demonstrated that capture of CH 4was proportionalto the amount of fungal biomass. It is noteworthy, that thisisotherm-tested dormant fungal spores, not living hyphae, butlike hyphae, these spores are similarly coated in hydrophobinproteins (Klimes and Dobinson 2006 ). This ability of fungalbiomass to capture CH4has subsequently been supported bybatch isotherm work (Liew and Schilling, paper in review ). Toour knowledge, no one has explored the ability of fungi tocapture CH 4in a BTF, although Palanisamy et al. ( 2016 )h a v eused fungi to improve the performance of a BTF-treating chlo-roform, a single-carbon compound.Biofilters offer a useful model system for studying thesedynamics in nature, as the microbial communities in biofiltersexist in a discrete system and inputs and outputs can be easilycontrolled and monitored (Cabrol and Malhautier 2011).Collectively, biofilter research findings suggest a new concep-tual model for CH4biofiltration that may be useful for ecolo-gists and engineers (Fig. 2). Originally, CH 4biofilters weremodeled as a two-phase system (gaseous and aqueous bio-film) on solid media, where advection, mass exchange (fromgas to liquid), absorption, diffusion, and biofilm concentra-tions were all driven by methanotrophic biodegradationreactions and limited by absorption and diffusion of CH4inaqueous biofilm (Nikiema et al. 2009 ).When fungi are included in the model, however, new pro-cesses and limits must be considered. First, fungi can dwellinside the solid media and extend into the air space, increasingtheir desiccation tolerance and increasing the effective surfacearea of the biofilm (Oliver et al. 2016 ). Second, the biofilmsinfiltrated by filamentous fungal hyphae are no longer exclu-sively aqueous, as these hyphal protrusions are hydrophobicand better suited for capture of insoluble CH4. Methanotrophsco-localized along these fungi may also create preferentialdiffusion gradients for CH 4that reduce rate limits to thebiofiltration process. As research and modeling efforts ad-vance, we may one day be able to fine-tune fungal andmethanotroph communities in biofilters to optimize mitigationof anthropogenic CH4emissions.Role of aerobic fungi in community CH 4dynamicsIn soil systemsSimilar to their role in moderating CH 4dynamics inengineered systems, fungi may play a similar but overlookedrole in the soil CH4cycle. Fungi likely affect CH 4fluxes insoils both indirectly (by dictating microbial community as-sembly and function through metabolite generation and nutri-ent allocation) and directly (via gas capture and oxidation).Fig. 1 Simplified schematic of abiofilter ( a) and a biotricklingfilter ( b)Fig. 2 New conceptual model ofCH4biofiltration that includes therole of fungi7368 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375Currently, there is no research exploring the ability of fungi tooxidize CH 4in soil, although several studies have suggestedtheir indirect influences. Dissolved organic carbon, inorganicnitrogen, and phosphorus levels strongly influence CH 4up-take and oxidation in soils and sediments (Veraart et al. 2015 ;Wu et al. 2016 ) with the availability of these dictated in manycases by fungi (Boddy 1999 ). Fungi degrade lignocellulose insoils, and they maintain growth forms and enzymatic machin-ery that enable unique acquisition, translocation, and immobi-lization of dissolved carbon, inorganic nitrogen, and phospho-rous (Treseder and Lennon 2015 ). Fungi also have high as-similation efficiencies and capacities to store carbon (Singh etal.2010 ), and in the past 15 years, the contribution of fungalnecromass to forest biogeochemical cycles also has been rec-ognized as a significant input into forest carbon and nutrientcycles (Clemmensen et al. 2013 ; Fernandez and Kennedy2015 ; Fernandez et al. 2016 ).Fungal regulation of carbon and nutrient cycles in soils alsoinfluences the development of soil microbial communities,including methanotrophs (Burke et al. 2012 ). In a laboratorystudy of arable soils, following CH4injection, increases inmethanotroph populations correlated with increases in fungalbiomass (Arif et al. 1996 ). A similar relationship betweenfungi and methanotrophs has been observed in landfill soilsin response to inputs of CH4-rich biogas (Watzinger et al.2008). The only study of natural systems found CH 4-oxidiz-ing bacteria and fungal biomass/enzymes to be negativelycorrelated in soils of a mature forest, but attributed these un-expected results to sampling biases which excluded fresh or-ganic soil horizons where soil fungi were likely to reside(Burke et al. 2012 ).Despite the potential benefits to Earth System Models froma more complete inclusion of microbial communities, pools,and their impact on the carbon cycle (Todd-Brown et al. 2012 ;Wieder et al. 2013 ), fungi have not been given significantattention in the soil CH4cycle (Lai 2009 ; Mancinelli 1995 ;Segers 1998 ; Singh et al. 2010 ). This connection betweenfungi and CH 4is indirect and not necessarily intuitive; wedo not yet understand the interactions of soil fungi withmethanogens, methanotrophs, and CH4(Conrad 2009;Nazaries et al. 2013 ). Resolving these interactions may im-prove our estimates of CH 4budgets, which, not surprisingly,have larger uncertainties in natural systems than for anthropo-genic emissions (Kirschke et al. 2013 ; Saunois et al. 2016 ).In forestsSome wood-degrading fungi may actually facilitate CH 4pro-duction by providing methanogens with reduced carbon feed-stocks derived from the breakdown of lignocellulose. TheseBmycogenic ^CH4emissions were first described by Mukhinand V oronin ( 2007 ,2008 ) in a series of experiments wherewood fragments infected by several species of bracket fungiwere placed into gas-tight jars and the fluxes of O 2,C O 2,a n dCH4were tracked over time. Covey et al. ( 2012 ) detectedsimilar CH 4emissions in northern hardwoods, with greateremission from tree species more susceptible to heart rot, andpostulated that the fungi causing this rot may be supportingthe growth of methanogens. The impact of these decay fungion CH4emission was later confirmed in a study of livingNorway spruce trees where those infected by Armillaria spp.(fungi with the white rot decay mechanism) had elevatedlevels of CH4emissions, 3 –4 times the levels of healthy un-infected trees (Hietala et al. 2015 ). With the prevalence ofdecay fungi like Armillaria in forests, the magnitude of thesemycogenic emissions could be significant.Wood decay fungi have been observed co-localized withmethanogens in wood biofilms of timbers in an abandonedcoal mine, where fungal generation of acetate was suggestedto be the specific stimulant for CH4generation (Beckmann etal.2011). This dynamic is harnessed, purposefully, whenwhite rot fungi are used as selective pretreatments to improvesubstrate digestibility and biogas production in anaerobic di-gesters (Rouches et al. 2016 ). Fungi may be similarly utilizedto initiate the remediation of fossil fuel contamination andbiomethanization of tar sands (Wong et al. 2015 ) and coal(Singh et al. 2012 ).Some aerobic fungi may also be capable ofbiomethanization without a methanogenic partner. The firstreport that organisms other than anaerobic prokaryotes mightbe able to generate CH4was by Keppler et al. ( 2006 ), wherethere was evidence that plants under aerobic conditions gen-erated CH 4. Based on a series of well-controlled experiments,Lenhart et al. ( 2012 ) were the first to demonstrate that aerobicdecay fungi could independently generate CH 4. Using stable-carbon isotopic experiments, methionine was identified as thelikely precursor of these CH 4emissions (Lenhart et al. 2015 ).The authors postulated that this methyl sulfide was oxidizedby fungi to a sulfoxide, which was then demethylated, andfollowing homolytic bond cleavage, generated methyl radicalsthat stabilized as CH 4. While the mechanistic role of this CH 4generation is poorly understood, this may be a widespreadstress response of fungi, and mycogenic CH 4emissions maybe a more significant contribution to global CH 4budgets thanpreviously assumed (Liu et al. 2015 ).In termite moundsFungi are also associated with termite mounds and may influ-ence CH 4fluxes to the atmosphere. Termite mounds are anoteworthy source of CH 4which is generated bymethanogens residing in the termite gut (Zimmerman et al.1982 ; Conrad 2009 ). These methanogens and their conse-quential CH4production are strongly influenced by fungalpopulations, also present in the termite gut, which are thecrucial metabolizers of the lignocellulose ingested by theAppl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375 7369termites (Brune and Ohkuma 2011 ). Similar to thebiofiltration that occurs in landfill soils, methanotrophs locat-ed in the termite mounds will oxidize the CH 4released by theinsects. These methanotroph communities are unique to indi-vidual mounds and are shaped by the termite microbiota (Hoet al. 2013 ). Like the well-recognized leaf-cutting ants, severalspecies of termites also form unique symbioses with fungi(Mueller and Gerardo 2002 ). In a study to determine theCH4emission factors of various termite mounds, Sugimotoet al. ( 1998) observed appreciable emissions from somemounds, but measured near zero emission factors for moundsthat housed termite species that cultivated fungi(Macrotermes ). While the exact role fungi play in mitigatingtermite CH4emissions has not been investigated, it is plausi-ble that fungi growing in these mounds facilitatemethanotrophic activities and CH4mitigation and may besuitable candidates for biofilter studies.In wetlands and freshwater environmentsWetland soils and the sediments of freshwater environ-ments are very important natural sources of CH4.W h i l ecycling of CH 4in these systems has received considerableresearch attention, there remains significant uncertaintysurrounding their response to a changing climate(Natchimuthu et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017a ). Our eco-logical understanding of fungi in wetland systems haslagged behind that of prokaryotes (Gutknecht et al.2006). This is despite knowledge that fungi are the prin-cipal litter decay and carbon cycling organisms in fresh-water and wetland environments (Baldrian 2017). In ricepaddies, for example, the decomposition of plant residuesto soil organic matter stimulates the production and re-lease of CH4(Kimura et al. 2004). Oxic surface soils ofrice paddies also harbor higher numbers of methanotrophs(Kimura et al. 2004) and fungi (Lopes et al. 2011). In anexperimental paddy system, it was observed that riceplants inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi re-duced paddy CH4emissions (Zhang et al. 2017b). Theseauthors hypothesized that the fungi increased the soilcarbon-to-nitrogen ratio which created nitrogen limitationfor methanogens, although the influence of methanotrophsin the system was not explored. Fungi are also found atsignificant depths (2.5 m) in peatlands (Jackson and Raub2010), where diverse groups of fungi from diverse guilds(mycorrhizal, saprophytic, pathogenic) make up a signifi-cant fraction of the Sphagnum microbiome and coexistwith methanotrophs in unknown associations (Kostka etal.2016). There is a need for research on these freshwaterfungi and their interactions with methanotrophs andmethanogens, to resolve CH4dynamics in these environ-ments and improve predictions of their responses to cli-mate change.Role of anaerobic fungi in community CH 4dynamicsIn the rumenLike the aerobic fungi discussed, anaerobic fungi may alsoplay an important role in anthropogenic and natural cyclingof CH4. Anaerobic fungi were first detected in the rumen ofsheep in the late 1970s and not long after were observedgrowing in close proximity with rumen methanogens(Bauchop 1981 ). Mountfort et al. ( 1982 ) were the first to sug-gest that these fungi critically supported methanogenesisbased on evidence that CH 4generation was elevated whencellulose was fermented by a co-culture of rumenmethanogens and anaerobic fungi. Anaerobic fungi lack mi-tochondria and instead utilize hydrogenosomes to produceATP, H2,C O 2, acetate, formate, and other simple metabolicproducts, like lactate and ethanol, from the decomposition oflignocellulose (Brul and Stumm 1994 ; Yarlett et al. 1986 ). Inco-culture, some of these fungal metabolic products are uti-lized by methanogenic archaea. Interestingly, this relationshipbetween rumen methanogens and anaerobic fungi is morecomplex than simple cross-feeding, with the metabolic profileof anaerobic fungi able to shift away from lactate or ethanol,and exclusively towards the more reduced and preferredgrowth substrate of rumen methanogens —formate and acetate(Cheng et al. 2009 ). Because of this energetically favorabletransfer of hydrogen and electrons, fungal degradative enzymeproduction and the breakdown of ingested lignocellulose inthe rumen are also enhanced (Gruninger et al. 2014 ). Similarsyntrophic cooperation between anaerobic fungi andmethanogens has recently been demonstrated in coalbeds inChina (Guo et al. 2017 ).To a farmer, enteric CH4is not just a greenhouse gas butalso a missed opportunity and production cost, as carbon infeed is lost instead of converted to meat or milk. It is estimatedthat this inefficiency can represent a 6 to 15% loss of grossenergy intake in ruminants (Puniya et al. 2015 ). Unlike theCH4produced in the rumen by methanogens, which isflatulated or belched by rumen animals, the acetate producedby acetogens can be utilized by the animal for growth andproduction. In the rumen, however, acetogens are less abun-dant and competitive than methanogens, as the latter requirelower levels of H2to convert CO 2and do so via a more ther-modynamically favorable reaction (Martin et al. 2009).Anaerobic fungi can increase the level of H 2in the rumen(Hook et al. 2010 ), and thus may be able to improve thecompetitiveness of acetogens.An initial meta-analysis showed that feeding cows anaero-bic fungi probiotics only sometimes reduced enteric CH 4pro-duction. However, most of the early fungal strains used asprobiotics were selected to improve milk production and notspecifically to reduce CH 4(Sauvant 2005 ). Since then, others7370 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375have provided examples where anaerobic fungi fed asprobiotics can specifically enhance acetogenesis and reduceCH4emissions (Puniya et al. 2015 ). There are at least sixunique fungal genera, each representing multiple species,w h i c hp o p u l a t et h er u m e no fac o w( T a p i oe ta l . 2017 ).Syntrophic interactions between these rumen fungi, bacteria,and archaea are complex, and change with cow diet and ma-turity (Kumar et al. 2015 ). While it will take concerted effortto develop strategies that successfully strengthen the interspe-cies H 2transfer from anaerobic fungi to acetogens, this poten-tial to reduce enteric CH 4while providing economic value to alivestock producer highlights an important area of research.In anaerobic digestersManure management is one of the more significant anthropo-genic sources of CH 4emissions, particularly long-term ma-nure slurry storages. Anaerobic digesters are utilized by manyfarms to treat organics and manure prior to storage to promoteCH4generation where it can be captured and utilized as arenewable energy source (IPCC 2006). The hydrolysis ofcomplex lignocellulose materials like manure is typically therate-limiting step in anaerobic digestion systems (Donoso-Bravo and Mairet 2012 ;M ae ta l . 2013 ). Rumen fungi arebeing applied to these systems for their ability to catalyzelignocellulose breakdown, but unlike research goals in animalproduction, in anaerobic digesters, the aim is to promotemethanogenesis (Cheng et al. 2009 ). In recent studies, theaddition of rumen fungi was able to successfully couple hy-drolysis rate limits and the metabolic support ofmethanogenesis; however, improvements in biogas and CH4production were substrate dependent (Aydin et al. 2017;Yıldırım et al. 2017 ). While the use of anaerobic fungi inanaerobic digesters still faces many hurdles, such as their sur-vivability and application to industrial scales (Gruninger et al.2014 ), additional research into the ecology of these organismsand their function in anaerbogic digesters could facilitate boththe mitigation of a significant anthropogenic CH 4source andthe economical production of a renewable energy source(Dollhofer et al. 2015 ).I nt h ed e e ps e aA unique and poorly explored environment where anaerobicfungi may also play a critical role in the CH4cycle is the deepsea (Ivarsson et al. 2016a ). Though fungi were first reportedfrom the deep sea by Roth in 1964, the ecology of fungi inmarine environments has received considerably little atten-tion. It is now known that fungi are ubiquitous in ocean waterand sediments, around hydrothermal vents, cold-CH4seeps(Nagano and Nagahama 2012 ), and even in the ocean crust(Ivarsson et al. 2016b ), and that these fungi are both geneti-cally and biologically diverse (Le Calvez et al. 2009 ;N a g a n oand Nagahama 2012 ). The ecological role of deep sea fungi isstill mysterious (Calvez et al. 2009 ), but their association withcertain environmental gradients, like carbonates, suggests thatas on land, fungi in the sea are underpinning carbon cycles(Pasulka et al. 2016). While many of these fungi areextremophiles, some like the Malassezia are hyperdiverseand common in many different terrestrial and aquatic habitats(Amend 2014 ). Other species like Exophiala which are asso-ciated with hydrothermal vents (Le Calvez et al. 2009 )a n dbasalt ocean crust (Hirayama et al. 2015 ) are also found andused in biofilters to treat hydrophobic gaseous emissions (Coxet al. 1997 ; Estévez et al. 2005 ). Ivarsson et al. ( 2016a )h a v esuggested that the same feedbacks formed between anaerobicfungi, methanogens, and methanotrophs in other systems mayunderpin oceanic CH4fluxes and other crucial processes in thedeep biosphere. Understanding this process in greater detail isa critical need in understanding CH4emissions from both deepand shallow marine environments (Borges et al. 2016 ;J a m e set al. 2016 ). At least one study has also found anaerobic fungiin freshwater lakes and landfill soils (McDonald et al. 2012 ),suggesting their importance may extend beyond the ocean.OutlookAerobic and anaerobic fungi play an integral, often underap-preciated, role in environmental and anthropogenic CH4fluxes and mitigation (Fig. 3). In soils, forests, and wetlands,Fig. 3 Interactions of aerobic andanaerobic fungi withmethanotrophs, methanogens,and CH4. Modified from Ivarssonet al. ( 2016b )Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018) 102:7365 –7375 7371aerobic fungi initiate the breakdown of lignocellulose andother carbon stores, releasing carbon as CO 2or CH 4as wellas feeding methanogen associates. These fungi in soils canconstitute a major fraction of organic matter, including deadmycelial necromass, and their ability to capture hydrophobicCH4m a yp l a ya nu n d e r a p p r e c i a t e dr o l ei nC H 4emission rates.Their control of carbon and domination of transport processesalso guides microbial community assembly in soils, forests,and wetlands. Anaerobic fungi can also regulate anthropogen-ic CH4emissions through their control of carbon allocationand the support of acetogenic and methanogenic communities.As these cross-feeding relationships are better resolved, thereis opportunity to both reduce enteric CH4emissions and facil-itate the generation of CH 4—and the subsequent capture andutilize of this renewable energy source— in anaerobic di-gesters. Anaerobic fungi in shallow and deep sea environ-ments also appear integral to the terminus of carbon cyclingand CH 4flux. With the recent recognition of these vast unex-plored fungal communities, the potential for novel organismswith applicability to engineered CH 4mitigation systems issignificant.Improving our understanding of fungal interactions withmethanotrophs, methanogens, and CH 4in these various natu-ral and human environments is a critical next step to bolsterthe predictive power of Earth System Models and to developthe biological technologies and strategies to minimize anthro-pogenic CH4emissions. Critical research areas include resolv-ing the roles and mechanisms (1) of fungal/hydrophobin sorp-tion of CH4, (2) of co-localization of methanotrophs on fungalscaffolds, (3) of syntrophic cooperation between fungi,methanotrophs, and methanogens in natural environments,(4) of independent fungal oxidation and degradation of CH 4,(5) of fungal biocatalysts in CH 4biofilters, rumen function,and anaerobic digesters, and (6) of fungi in underexplorednatural environments such as peatlands and the deep sea.These efforts will help us understand and harness fungi fortheir important, but often indirect and overlooked, role in theCH4cycle.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts ofinterest.Ethical approval This article does not contain any studies with humanparticipants or animals performed by any of the authors.ReferencesArif MAS, Houwen F, Verstraete W (1996) Agricultural factors affectingmethane oxidation in arable soil.
