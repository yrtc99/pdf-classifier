REVIEW New Phytol . (2000), 147, 189–200Research reviewMycorrhizal fungi have a potential role insoil carbon storage under elevated CO#andnitrogen depositionK. K. TRESEDER* andM.F. ALLENCenter for Conservation Biology ,University of California at Riverside ,Riverside ,CA 92521 ,USAReceived 9 November 1999; accepted 7 March 2000summaryIn this review, we discuss the potential for mycorrhizal fungi to act as a source or sink for carbon (C) under elevatedCO#and nitrogen deposition. Mycorrhizal tissue has been estimated to comprise a signiﬁcant fraction of soilorganic matter and below-ground biomass in a range of systems. The current body of literature indicates that inmany systems exposed to elevated CO#, mycorrhizal fungi might sequester increased amounts of C in living, deadand residual hyphal biomass in the soil. Through this process, the fungi might serve as a negative feedback on therise in atmospheric CO#levels caused by fossil fuel burning and deforestation. By contrast, a few preliminarystudies suggest that N deposition might increase turnover rates of fungal tissue and negate CO#eﬀects on hyphalbiomass. If these latter responses are consistent among ecosystems, C storage in hyphae might decline in habitatssurrounding agricultural and urban areas. When N additions occur without CO#enrichment, eﬀects onmycorrhizal growth are inconsistent. We note that analyses of hyphal decomposition under elevated CO#and Nadditions are extremely sparse but are critical in our understanding of the impact of global change on the cyclingof mycorrhizal C. Finally, shifts in the community composition of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi withincreasing CO#or N availability are frequently documented. Since mycorrhizal groups vary in growth rate andtissue quality, these changes in species assemblages could produce unforeseeable impacts on the productivity,survivorship, or decomposition of mycorrhizal biomass.Key words: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, elevated CO#, external hyphae, interspeciﬁcvariation, microbial communities, nitrogen deposition or fertilization, soil carbon sequestration.introductionLand-based ecosystems in the northern hemisphereappear to remove, at least temporarily, a substantialportion of anthropogenic CO#from the atmosphere(Tans et al., 1990; Ciais et al., 1995; Schimel et al.,1995; Keeling et al., 1996; Fung et al., 1997). Themechanisms behind this C sink are not well under-stood, even though knowledge of these processes isvital to predict and interpret the responses ofecosystems to global change (Field & Fung, 1999).Changes in plant productivity due to CO#en-richment (Friedlingstein et al., 1995; Thompson etal., 1996), nitrogen deposition (Nadelhoﬀer et al.,1999), land use change (Houghton et al., 1999), and*Author for correspondence (fax ›1 909 787 4625; e-mailtreseder !mail.ucr.edu).climatic eﬀects (Dai & Fung, 1993; Malmstrom etal., 1997) have been investigated as potential com-ponents (Schimel et al., 1995; Lloyd, 1999). How-ever, the response of microbial communities to theseperturbations, and their potential inﬂuence on Ccycling, have received scarce attention.Mycorrhizal fungi in particular might play animportant role in the sequestration of C in soilunder elevated CO#and N deposition. This group,which symbiotically colonizes plant roots, formsassociations with 80% of plant species and is foundin nearly every habitat in the world (Smith & Read,1997). Plants allocate an estimated 10–20% of netphotosynthate to mycorrhizal fungi, although thisnumber can range from 5 to 85% among systems(reviewed by Allen, 1991).A substantial amount of C allotted to mycorrhizaltissues could be long-lived in the soil. Chitin, which190 REVIEW K.K.Treseder and M .F.Allenis not readily decomposed (Gooday, 1994), canconstitute up to 60% of fungal cell walls (Muzzarelli,1977). Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are alsothe sole producers of glomalin, a potentially re-calcitrant glycoprotein (Wright et al., 1996; Wright& Upadhyaya, 1996, 1999). AM hyphae in theabsorptive hyphal network (nonrunner hyphae) havelifespans of only 5–7 d (Friese & Allen, 1991a), andwith each cycle residual hyphal C should remain inthe soil. Furthermore, some micro-arthropods preferto graze on nonmycorrhizal fungi rather than on avariety of AM fungi (Klironomos & Kendrick, 1996;Klironomos & Ursic, 1998; Klironomos et al., 1999),and therefore might not necessarily speed up tissueturnover signiﬁcantly. As a result, glomalin alonecan account for 30–60% of C in undisturbed soils(calculated from data of Wright & Upadhyaya(1996), assuming that the protein is 30% C byweight M. C. Rillig, pers. comm.). Likewise, por-tions of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) biomass (sheaths,Hartig nets and fruit bodies) were responsible forapprox. 15% of soil organic matter in two hardwoodforests (Vogt et al., 1982, cited by Vogt et al., 1991).Carbon derived from mycorrhizal tissue can accountfor a signiﬁcantly sized pool within ecosystems (Vogtet al., 1982; Fogel & Hunt, 1983; Vogt et al., 1991;O’Neill, 1994; Allen et al., 1995; Rillig & Allen,1999) and globally.Because mycorrhizal fungi acquire most or alltheir C directly from living plants, the nutrientstatus of foliage strongly aﬀects mycorrhizal growth.As elevated CO#generally increases plant growth(Poorter, 1993) and root-to-shoot ratio (Rogers etal., 1996), greater allocation of C to mycorrhizalstructures might follow (Norby et al., 1986; O’Neillet al., 1987). Eﬀects of elevated CO#on mycorrhizalgrowth have been reviewed by O’Neill (1994), Diaz(1996), Hodge (1996), and Staddon & Fitter (1998),with an emphasis on changes in percentage rootlength (or tips) colonized and total root lengthcolonized per plant. These reviews indicate that thepercentage of roots with mycorrhizal structuresmight not necessarily change under elevated CO#.However, as root biomass tends to rise, totalmycorrhizal biomass per plant might do so as well.This response varies among systems and does notnecessarily occur universally. By contrast, increasesin N availability through deposition or fertilizationtend to reduce root colonization and fruit bodyproduction by ECM fungi (reviewed by Arnolds,1988; Jansen & Dighton, 1990; Arnolds, 1991;Colpaert & van Tichelen, 1996; Wallenda & Kottke,1998). Eﬀects of CO#and N availability on thebiomass or production of extraradical hyphae havebeen less intensively studied or summarized.In this review, we address the current state ofknowledge regarding the potential for mycorrhizaltissue (particularly hyphae) to form a sink or sourceof C in response to elevated CO#or N deposition.First, we present an overview of processes and poolsinvolved in the cycling of mycorrhizal C and therelevance of various measures of mycorrhizal dy-namics (e.g. percentage colonization, hyphal length,vital staining and ergosterol concentration). Inter-and intraspeciﬁc variations in traits that could aﬀectC dynamics are considered. Second, we discussknown eﬀects of CO#concentration on hyphalbiomass, turnover, tissue quality and communitycomposition. Next, we focus on the inﬂuence of Navailability on these same factors, and ﬁnally weaddress potential interactions between elevated CO#and N availability.mycorrhizal carbon cyclingMajor ﬂuxes and pools of carbonProcesses involved in the cycling of mycorrhizal Cinclude production, survivorship and decompositionrates of tissue. As mycorrhizal tissue grows, C istransferred from the atmosphere via plants to thepool of live hyphae. Micro-arthropods might graze afraction of live hyphae, but grazing on AM hyphaeshould be low, as in feeding trials mites andcollembola appear to prefer nonmycorrhizal fungi(Klironomos & Kendrick, 1996; Klironomos &Ursic, 1998; Klironomos et al., 1999). When grazingof AM fungal hyphae does occur, animals often onlyclip the hyphae, severing connections to the root butnot ingesting mycelial mass (Klironomos & Ursic,1998). Thus changes in micro-arthropod numbersmight not have a major impact on C ﬂux from AMhyphae to soil organic matter. Instead, death rates oflive hyphae determine the ﬂux of C from the live tothe dead hyphal pool. At this point, dead tissue isdistributed between active and slow soil organicmatter pools as a function of tissue quality (followingParton et al., 1988). Active soil organic matterincludes sugars and other metabolites that areprocessed relatively quickly (in days to a few years)by decomposers; slow soil organic matter consists ofrecalcitrant components such as chitin and glomalin,and might last from years to decades in the soil. Inplant tissues, higher N content generally speedsdecomposition rates (Melillo et al., 1982). Finally, assoil organic matter decomposes, a portion of Cremains in decomposer tissues, and the rest returnsto the atmosphere. Each of these ﬂuxes and poolsmight be aﬀected directly by elevated CO#and Ndeposition, or indirectly through changes in thecomposition of the mycorrhizal community.The role of inter -and intraspeciﬁc variationGroups of mycorrhizal fungi diﬀer in several factors,including growth rate, that could inﬂuence C cycling.For example, isolates of ECM fungi vary markedlyREVIEW Mycorrhizal fungi and soil carbon 191in productivity, both within species (Wallander etal., 1999; reviewed by Cairney, 1999) and amongspecies (Wallander et al., 1999). In AM fungi,Sanders et al. (1998) observed signiﬁcant diﬀerencesin hyphal biomass (after 18 wk growth on Prunellavulgaris ) among three Glomus species. In addition,after 16 wk growth, total hyphal lengths ofAcaulospora denticulata andScutellospora calosporawere signiﬁcantly greater than those of two Glomusspecies in a glasshouse experiment with Artemisiatridentata (Klironomos et al., 1998). If mycorrhizalcommunities are altered by climate change, thenvariation in growth and biomass among groups couldaﬀect the amount of atmospheric C that is initiallydrawn into the pool of live hyphae.Mycorrhizal groups also diﬀer in tissue qualitiesthat might aﬀect the rate at which this mycorrhizal Cis returned to the atmosphere. Wallander et al.(1997) found that ﬁve morphotypes of ECM fungi onﬁeld-grown Pinus sylvestris varied more than twofoldin chitin concentration. Likewise, glomalin contentin AM hyphae diﬀered between Gigaspora andGlomus (approx. 20 and 60lg protein mg −"hyphae,respectively; Wright et al., 1996), and signiﬁcantlybetween Glomus caledonium andGlomus intraradices(Wright & Upadhyaya, 1999). In addition, mean Nconcentrations in the hyphae of four isolates ofPaxillus involutus (an ECM fungus) ranged from 5 to9% when grown in culture (Wallander et al., 1999).Nitrogen content might be related to decom-posability of fungal tissue (see ‘Major ﬂuxes andpools of carbon’). These results suggest that theidentity, as well as the amount, of mycorrhizal fungimight be important in soil C dynamics.Measures of mycorrhizal response to environmentalchangesAs most mycorrhizal structures are relatively delicateand often below ground, measurements of mycor-rhizal biomass, growth rate or turnover present somechallenges. Most mycorrhizal studies under elevatedCO#or N deposition have quantiﬁed changes inmycorrhizal colonization (percentage root lengthcolonized by AM, or percentage root tips colonizedby ECM). This measure might be an appropriateindex for nutrient transfer to the host plant (inAM fungi the presence of internal structures suchas arbuscules implies transfer of P). However,because extraradical hyphae account for a largeportion of fungal biomass (30–87% of ECM fungi;Colpaert et al., 1992; Wallander & Nylund, 1992,cited by Ekblad et al., 1995), direct measures ofhyphal length are a valuable indicator of themycorrhizal C pool (Rillig & Allen, 1999). Fur-thermore, root colonization does not necessarilyincrease linearly with hyphal biomass, and environ-mental changes might alter relationships betweenthe two variables. For instance, the ratio of AMhyphal length : total root length colonized by AMvaried nearly twofold among CO#and N treatmentsinGutierrezia sarothrae (Rillig & Allen, 1998), andwas nearly three times greater under ambient versuselevated CO#in a serpentine grassland (Rillig et al.,1999a). In an additional study, Staddon et al.(1999) noted a decrease in this ratio with elevatedCO#inPlantago lanceolata andTrifolium repens . Forthis reason we focus primarily on hyphal length orbiomass in this review. We emphasize that hyphallength per unit soil area is a particularly meaningfulvariable in ﬁeld studies, and might be used eventuallyto scale biomass to the ecosystem or regional level.The life stage of hyphae is also an importantconsideration when measuring fungal productivity.Few CO#or N studies have made the distinctionbetween live and dead hyphae when determininghyphal length. The size of this combined pool is afunction of productivity, survival rate and initialdecomposition rate, and therefore changes in anycombination of these factors might inﬂuence theresults. Although the magnitude of these two poolsprovides useful information regarding immobili-zation of C, the inﬂuence of underlying mechanismsmust be interpreted with caution. To draw con-clusions about productivity, the growth rate of livehyphae must be directly followed. Several tech-niques enable us to focus on this live pool. Forexample, ergosterol concentrations are thought toindicate relative amounts of living fungal cytoplasm(Salmanowicz & Nylund, 1988; Martin et al., 1990;Nylund & Wallander, 1992), and are an appropriatemeasure when no nonmycorrhizal fungi are present.In addition, stains such as ﬂuorescein diacetate,diﬀerential ﬂuorescent stain and immunoﬂuorescentantibodies (Friese & Allen, 1991b; Morris et al.,1997) can distinguish between live and dead hyphae.Immunoﬂuorescent antibodies are also speciﬁc todiﬀerent genera and can be used to characterizethe community composition of hyphae (Egerton-Warburton & Allen, 2000). This information,together with live and dead hyphal biomass, can becritical in analyses of mycorrhizal C dynamics.effects of elevated co#Hyphal biomass and productivityMycorrhizal fungi might provide a negative feedbackon anthropogenic CO#emissions by responding torising concentrations of this trace gas. Overall,elevated CO#tends to increase or produce no changein hyphal biomass or growth on both ECM and AMfungi (Table 1). These variables are determinedindependently of plant growth or biomass, and aretherefore not an indication of relative allocationbetween plant and fungal tissue.

This trend suggests apossible increase in global mycorrhizal biomass asatmospheric CO#levels rise, although the magnitudeof this response might vary regionally and amongspecies.Long-term ﬁeld-based studies of mycorrhizalbiomass under elevated CO#are rare but critical inpredicting responses of natural systems. Rillig et al.(1999a) found increases in AM hyphal biomass in aserpentine grassland (but no signiﬁcant change in asandstone grassland) after "5y rC O#treatment.This change could be due to indirect eﬀects of shiftsin plant or fungal communities, or direct eﬀectson plant C status. A similar increase occurred in AMfungi associated with trembling aspen after 14months (Klironomos et al., 1997). Likewise, Tingeyet al. (1995) noted a rise in the presence of ECM roottips and visible hyphae after 2.5 yr enrichment. Withthe exception of the sandstone grassland, theseresults are not consistent with the hypothesis thathyphal lengths in soils are already at a maximumunder ambient CO#and will not increase as CO#levels rise (O’Neill, 1994; Allen et al., 1995). Each ofthese studies focused on changes in the incidence oflive and dead hyphae combined.Additional ﬁeld studies have indicated that thequantity of soil organic matter derived from mycor-rhizal tissue might rise under CO#enrichment. Rilliget al. (1999b) reported an increase in glomalinconcentrations in soil from a chaparral systemexposed to elevated CO#for 3 yr. In large macro-aggregates (1–2 mm diameter) from the sameecosystem, the length of live AM hyphae increased10-fold as CO#treatments varied from 250 to 650ppm CO#(K. Treseder, unpublished). This increasein mycorrhizal biomass was accompanied by a 30-fold rise in C allocation to these macroaggregates.These ﬁeld-based studies suggest that the combinedinﬂuences of elevated CO#on mycorrhizal C dyna-mics (including community changes, productivityand decomposition) could ultimately produce anincrease in the amount of C sequestered in intacthyphae and their residual components. However,many more studies of this nature are required beforewe can make general statements with any certainty.In addition, it is not clear whether these increases inhyphal biomass or residues will be maintained atequilibrium levels after the system has adjusted tothe sudden rise in CO#that occurred at the onset ofthe experiment.Controlled, smaller-scale experiments provideinsights into the mechanisms underlying the increasein hyphal biomass in ﬁeld systems. For example,Rouhier & Read (1998a) directly followed hyphalgrowth of two ECM fungi and noted a positiveresponse in both under CO#enrichment. Thesemeasurements of actual growth rates are rare.Most investigations have been conducted ingrowth chambers or glasshouses for periods fromseveral weeks to months (Table 1). Many of thesehave reported augmentation of hyphal length underCO#enrichment. However, the duration and scale ofthese experiments impose some limitations in scalingup to ecosystem-level dynamics or in assessingunderlying mechanisms (Allen, 1996). As the plantsand fungi were not grown in an intact community,they were not necessarily subject to competition orinteractions from higher trophic levels. In addition,the bacterial community might not have beenrepresentative of those found in natural systems.Decomposition might also be a factor in experimentslasting more than a few weeks, and could introducesome unknown degree of error into interpretationof growth rates. Klironomos et al. (1996) useddiﬀerential ﬂuorescent staining to restrict biomassmeasurements to live hyphae, and found a more thantwofold increase with elevated CO#. This responsemight also have been aﬀected somewhat by changesin lifespan of the fungi. Nevertheless, the generaltrend toward increases in hyphal biomass (usuallyassociated with increasing plant biomass) underelevated CO#in pot experiments indicates that theabundance of mycorrhizal hyphae could rise in anumber of AM and ECM fungal species and,potentially, ecosystems. Notably, the hyphal lengthsof ECM fungi do not appear to demonstrate a greaterfrequency or magnitude of response to CO#than dohyphae of AM fungi, as suggested by O’Neill (1994).Shifts in the mycorrhizal communityMycorrhizal groups vary in the magnitude of theirresponses to elevated CO#(Table 1), resulting inshifts in the mycorrhizal community structure(O’Neill, 1994; Cairney & Meharg, 1999). In AMfungi, hyphal lengths of Acaulospora denticulata andScutellospora calospora increased in response to CO#enrichment, while those of two Glomus species didnot (Klironomos et al., 1998). These genera wereeach grown separately in pots (with Artemisiatridentata ) and did not compete for resources. In acomplementary chaparral-based ﬁeld experiment,the abundance of hyphae from four AM genera(Acaulospora ,Gigaspora ,Glomus andScutellospora )was evenly distributed in chambers exposed to CO#concentrations of 250–350 ppm, but AcaulosporaandScutellospora dominated at 450–650 ppm (K.Treseder, unpublished). The results of these twostudies indicate that Acaulospora andScutellosporamight become more prevalent as CO#levels rise.Interspeciﬁc variation and shifts in communitycomposition have also been documented in ECMfungi. For example, Rouhier & Read (1998a)reported that the biomass of P.involutus respondedmore strongly to a doubling of CO#concentrationsthan did that of Suillus bovinus . Likewise, in194 REVIEW K.K.Treseder and M .F.Allenmycorrhizal root tips of Betula pendula seedlingsLeccinum dominated at elevated CO#, but at ambientCO#species were more evenly distributed (Rey &Jarvis, 1997). In addition, in Betula papyrifera therelative abundance of ECM morphotypes changedsigniﬁcantly under elevated CO#(Godbold et al.,1997), with a shift toward morphotypes with highernumbers of associated hyphae and rhizomorphs(Godbold & Berntson, 1997). Finally, in young Pinussylvestris trees, CO#enrichment reduced by half thepresence of the dominant (dichotomous) morpho-type (Kasurinen et al., 1999), although this responsecould have been strictly morphological. As mycor-rhizal groups vary in tissue quality and growth rate,these shifts in the mycorrhizal community mightfeed back to aﬀect several processes involved in thecycling of mycorrhizal C.Life span and decomposition of mycorrhizal tissueThe eﬀects of elevated CO#on the life span orturnover of individual mycorrhizal hyphae (ECM orAM) are not known. Rygiewicz et al. (1997) usedminirhizotrons to track the length of time betweenformation and disappearance of mycorrhizal roottips on seedlings of Pinus ponderosa and found thatelevated CO#had no signiﬁcant eﬀect. Moreover, ashigh CO#increased production of new root tips, agreater C ﬂux through mycorrhizas was implied.Single hyphae might respond in a similar manner,and studies of their dynamics are required. Addition-ally, nutrient concentrations might be related todecomposition rates in mycorrhizal tissue (as inplant tissue), and P concentrations in ECM tips ofP.involutus andS.bovinus declined signiﬁcantly withCO#enrichment (Rouhier & Read, 1998a). Nitrogencontent also decreased in P.involutus . Finally, wenote that elevated CO#can increase ﬁne-rootmortality (Pregitzer et al., 1995), which might befollowed by a decrease in the life span of relativelylong-lived ECM root tips and rhizomorphs.Summary of CO#eﬀectsAlthough approaches and scopes have variedwidely among studies of elevated CO#on mycor-rhizal dynamics, several lines of evidence indicatethat pools of mycorrhizal C might increase as CO#levels rise. With exceptions, growth rate and biomassof total live and dead hyphae tend to increase forboth AM and ECM fungi both at plant andecosystem level. This response is probably related toconcurrent increases in plant biomass (Staddon &Fitter, 1998) or to changes in plant or fungalcommunity composition. Hyphal length rarely, ifever, decreases. In addition, preliminary evidenceindicates that soil organic matter associated withmycorrhizal hyphae might become more prevalent.However, few data exist regarding changes inlife span or decomposition rate under CO#enrich-ment, and these processes have strong controls overthe long-term accumulation of soil organic matterpools over time. In addition, shifts in communitycomposition of mycorrhizal fungi with CO#con-centration might aﬀect all aspects of mycorrhizal Ccycling in an unforeseeable manner. Additionalresearch on ecosystem-level responses and under-lying mechanisms is critical.effects of nitrogen depositionBiomass and productivityElevated CO#often occurs concurrently with severalother aspects of global change, including widespreadN deposition. Increasing N availability might reduceinvestment by plants in mycorrhizal fungi. Thisresponse is especially likely for ECM fungi, as thisgroup acts as an important mechanism of Nacquisition for plants (Read, 1991). The decline inabundance of fruiting bodies of ECM fungi inEuropean forests has been well documented(Arnolds, 1988, 1991; Jansen & Dighton, 1990;Colpaert & van Tichelen, 1996; Wallenda & Kottke,1998; Cairney & Meharg, 1999), and N deposition isconsidered a major contributing factor. Nitrogenfertilization has often been used to simulate eﬀects ofN deposition, and usually produces decreases inmushroom production (Menge & Grand, 1978;Ruhling & Tyler, 1991; Termorshuizen, 1993). Thisdecline in fruiting bodies might in itself representa noteworthy decrease in ECM fungal biomass,but might not necessarily be accompanied by a de-crease in the presence of below-ground tissue(Termorshuizen, 1993).Extraradical hyphae can also account for asubstantial portion of mycorrhizal biomass,and ecosystem-level responses of hyphae to Nfertilization vary (Table 2). For example, the in-cidence of ECM biomass (including hyphae) in roottips was not aﬀected by long-term fertilization in P.ponderosa seedlings (Tingey et al., 1995) or in a Piceaabiesforest (Karen & Nylund, 1997). In AM fungi,Klironomos et al. (1997) reported a signiﬁcantreduction in hyphal length associated with Populustremuloides saplings after 14 months of N additions,but Eom et al. (1999) observed an increase inbiomass in a tallgrass prairie fertilized for 10 yr. Ofthese four studies, all but Karen & Nylund (1997)included both live and dead hyphae in theirmeasurements of biomass. These inconsistencies inN response could be attributable to the initial Nstatus of the systems, and to varying inﬂuences ofalterations in growth rate, decomposition, life spanor community structure.Nitrogen treatments also have inconsistent eﬀectson hyphal growth rate (Table 2). Arnebrant (1994)documented signiﬁcant decreases in growth withincreasing N availability in ﬁve ECM isolates.REVIEW Mycorrhizal fungi and soil carbon 195Table 2.

(1999) found no signiﬁcant N eﬀect on growthrates of four isolates of P.involutus collected fromregions exposed to varying levels of N deposition.Aside from these two studies, few direct assessmentsof N eﬀects on ECM or AM growth rates arereported in the literature. In experiments that havemeasured ECM biomass after weeks or months ofgrowth, decreases (Wallander & Nylund, 1992;Wallander et al., 1994); lack of response (Wallander& Nylund, 1992); or increases (Ekblad et al., 1995)under higher N availability have each been observed.Likewise, the responses of AM biomass to Nconcentration have been positive (Lussenhop et al.,1998), negative (Rillig & Allen, 1998), or notsigniﬁcant (Rillig & Allen, 1998; Bethlenfalvay et al.,1999).Much of the inconsistency in N eﬀects among andwithin studies might be due to variation in responsesamong mycorrhizal groups or among plant }fungalcombinations. Wallander and Nylund (1992)reported that S.bovinus was more sensitive to Nadditions than was Laccaria bicolor when both weregrown on Pinus sylvestris in a semi-hydroponicmedium. In a microcosm experiment conducted byArnebrant (1994), two isolates of P.involutus , oneisolate of S.bovinus , and two additional unidentiﬁedspecies of ECM fungi were exposed to increasing Navailability. The growth rate of S.bovinus and oneunknown species declined markedly, while one P.involutus isolate was only slightly aﬀected. In aseparate study by Wallander et al. (1999), fourisolates of P.involutus and two of S.bovinus grown inculture (as a complement to the seedling experimentsummarized in Table 2) also displayed diﬀerentsensitivities to N additions. One P.involutus isolatefrom a low-N deposition site, another from amoderate-N site, and an isolate of S.bovinus from alow-N site each grew signiﬁcantly more slowly whensupplied with excess N. Additional isolates frommoderate- to high-N (or unknown) sites had nosigniﬁcant response. These N eﬀects were notconsistent with those of the seedling experiment, inwhich hyphal growth rates were not aﬀected in anygroup. Nevertheless, these three studies suggest thatECM fungi might diﬀer in productivity under Ndeposition, and that S.bovinus appears particularlysusceptible. It remains to be seen whether AMgroups might vary as well.Shifts in community compositionSeveral studies have detailed changes caused by Ndeposition or fertilization in the species assemblageof mushrooms (Menge & Grand, 1978; Arnolds,1988, 1991; Termorshuizen, 1993). However, as thecommunity composition of ECM fruiting bodies candiﬀer from that of below-ground ECM structures(Gardes & Bruns, 1996), and below-ground biomasscould be a substantial C pool, this review focuses onthe species composition of fungal structures in thesoil. In both a Swedish Picea abies forest (Karen &Nylund, 1997) and a Scottish Sitka spruce plantation(Taylor & Alexander, 1989), frequencies of ECMmorphotypes on root tips shifted upon long-term Nfertilization. Likewise, in Pinus sylvestris forests inSweden, colonization of ‘bait’ seedlings by oneparticular morphotype was less frequent in N-fertilized than in control plots (Arnebrant &Soderstrom, 1992).Composition of AM communities can also shiftwith N availability. In a natural N depositiongradient in southern California coastal sage scrub,spores of Scutellospora andGigaspora species becameless prevalent with increasing deposition. Con-versely, spores of certain Glomus species (e.g.G.aggregatum ,G.leptotichum andG.geosporum )proliferated under the same conditions (Egerton-Warburton & Allen, 2000). In addition, in tallgrassprairie the abundance of spores from Gigasporagigantea andGlomus mosseae increased with Nfertilization, while that of Entrophospora infrequensdeclined signiﬁcantly (Eom et al., 1999). Johnson(1993) noted an increase in the presence of Gigasporagigantea ,Gigaspora margarita ,Scutellospora calo -spora andGlomus occultum , and a decrease in Glomusintraradix after 8 yr fertilization with a suite ofnutrients including N and P. Alterations in thespecies assemblage of mycorrhizal fungi, eitherdirectly through N availability or indirectly throughshifts in plant communities, appear to be a likelyoutcome of widespread N deposition.Life span and decomposition of mycorrhizal tissueNitrogen eﬀects on the survivorship and decompo-sition of mycorrhizal hyphae have received littleattention. Using minirhizotrons, Majdi & Nylund(1996) found that N fertilization signiﬁcantlyreduced the life span of ectomycorrhizal short rootsfrom 240 to 210 d in a 30-yr-old Norway sprucestand in southwest Sweden. The authors did notspeculate on mechanisms underpinning this change,but we suggest that alterations of the ECM com-munity could have been one factor. In anotherminirhizotron experiment, Rygiewicz et al. (1997)recorded no eﬀect of N fertilization on the length oftime between appearance and disappearance of ECMtips. This latter result includes both life span anddecomposition rate of the fungal tissue. Thesestudies present valuable information on the dy-namics of mycorrhizal root tips. However, alterationsin turnover of extraradical ECM and AM hyphae byN additions have yet to be reported in the literature.Nitrogen concentrations of hyphae from one P.involutus isolate were reported to increase withhigher N availability in a culture experimentREVIEW Mycorrhizal fungi and soil carbon 197(Wallander et al., 1999), with possible shifts indecomposition rate. Additionally, root turnover canincrease with N fertilization (Pregitzer et al., 1995;Majdi & Nylund, 1996), and this response couldproduce a corresponding decrease in the life span ofECM structures such as mycorrhizal root tips andrhizomorphs.Summary of N eﬀectsIncreases in N availability inconsistently aﬀecthyphal dynamics (especially growth and biomass).In ﬁeld studies, this variation in response could bepartially attributable to the initial N status of theecosystem; N-limited systems might respond diﬀer-ently from systems in which another factor (e.g. Por water) limits primary productivity. Nutrientlimitation of plants is an important considerationbecause mycorrhizal fungi derive the majority oftheir C from the host. However, this possibility hasnot been explicitly tested. At this point we can onlysuggest that C storage in living and recently deadmycorrhizal tissue might only be aﬀected (e.g.augmented or reduced) in certain systems exposed toN deposition. Furthermore, in glasshouse or culturestudies the use of diﬀerent fungal species or isolatesmight contribute to conﬂicting responses of hyphalgrowth or biomass. Even isolates of the same speciescan vary in response to N availability (Arnebrant,1994; Wallander et al., 1999).Overall, alteration in the community compositionof mycorrhizal fungi (probably due to diﬀerencesamong groups in sensitivity to N) appears to be themost general response to N addition. Becausemycorrhizal groups can vary in chitin content andgrowth rate, these shifts could have importantconsequences for C immobilization in live hyphaltissue or its residual soil organic matter. However, amore complete understanding of diﬀerences in tissuequality and physiology among groups is necessary inorder to predict their inﬂuence on C dynamics.Interactions between elevated CO#and N depositionEﬀects of elevated CO#and N availability caninteract to inﬂuence hyphal biomass. In a 14-monthexperiment on P.tremuloides seedlings, AM hyphallengths increased with CO#in the low-N but notthe high-N treatment (Klironomos et al., 1997).Arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae associated withGutierrezia sarothrae responded in a similar mannerafter 4 months’ exposure to high and low treatmentsof CO#and N (Rillig & Allen, 1998). Apparently, Nadditions can negate CO#eﬀects on mycorrhizalbiomass in some systems. This interaction is notuniversal, however. Lussenhop et al. (1998) noted nosigniﬁcant CO#by N eﬀects in AM biomass of aconstructed ecosystem of Populus ‹euramericanaseedlings. Tingey et al. (1995) also found no CO#andN interaction on the presence of ECM root tips andhyphae on P.ponderosa seedlings. Further investi-gations of this interaction and its eﬀects on processesincluding turnover will be of interest. Unlikeelevated CO#, which is a global phenomenon, Ndeposition is greatest near regions with densehuman populations. Therefore interactions betweenthese two elements of global change will be factorsprimarily in ecosystems surrounding urban andagricultural areas, and investigations should focus onthese habitats.conclusionThe potential for mycorrhizal fungi to inﬂuence thesequestration of soil C under various aspects ofglobal change has been frequently suggested in theliterature, although rarely directly addressed. Thecurrent body of work on mycorrhizal dynamicssuggests that elevated CO#might augment globalpools of C in living, dead and residual mycorrhizaltissue by increasing productivity in numeroushabitats. By contrast, the (smaller-scale) inﬂuence ofN deposition on ecosystem-level responses is lessgeneral than that of CO#, and might rely on severalfactors, including the initial N status of the veg-etation. Preliminary evidence that N fertilizationincreases turnover rates of hyphae indicates that Csequestration in hyphal biomass might decrease inareas exposed to N deposition. Elevated CO#and Ndeposition could therefore have conﬂicting in-ﬂuences on mycorrhizal C.Shifts in the community composition of AM andECM fungi with CO#and N enrichment could haveimportant inﬂuences on mycorrhizal C dynamics.For instance, since Scutellospora andAcaulosporaspecies appear to proliferate under elevated CO#, andGlomus species can be more abundant with Ndeposition, predictions of the community structureunder both disturbances are challenging. Never-theless, our understanding of these changes isimportant; AM genera and species can vary in tissuequality and therefore aﬀect C transformations. ECMfungi present similar issues. Compared with Suillusbovinus ,P.involutus can respond more strongly toelevated CO#and can be less sensitive to N addition,with potential consequences for species compositionand C storage. However, these patterns are derivedfrom very few studies. Our knowledge indicates thatthe inﬂuence of mycorrhizal fungi on C dynamicsunder global change remains largely unknown, butcould be a signiﬁcant factor in soil C sequestration.acknowledgementsWe thank the participants of the October 1999 NewPhytologist symposium,‘Rootdynamicsandglobalchange:an ecosystem perspective’, for discussion of the topicspresented in this paper.
