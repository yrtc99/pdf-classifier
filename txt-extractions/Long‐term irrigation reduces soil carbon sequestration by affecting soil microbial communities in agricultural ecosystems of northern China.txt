The variation of soil moisture after irrigation has thepotential to affect soil microbial community composition and soil organic car-bon (SOC) storage, and thus, the imbalances in the terrestrial ecosystem car-bon cycle. However, the impact of long-term irrigation on the relationshipsbetween soil microbial community and SOC sequestration in semiaridagroecosystems is still poorly understood. We took advantage of a 7-year irriga-tion experiment in a winter wheat-maize rotation system in northern China,whereby the non-irrigation was subject to rain-fed conditions. We aimed toinvestigate the effects of long-term irrigation on soil microbial communitiesand their linkages with soil carbon sequestration. Seven years of irrigation sig-nificantly increased soil moisture content by 39% but decreased SOC concen-tration of topsoil (0 –20 cm) by 4.2% on average across all sampling times. Theresponses of soil microbial communities to irrigation were highly taxa depen-dent. Irrigation significantly decreased fungal biomass, fungal-to-bacterial ratioand Gram-positive-to-Gram-negative bacterial ratio, and did not affect the bac-terial community biomass. The decreased SOC concentration under the long-term irrigation was mainly caused by the changes in the ratio of fungi-to-Yongqing Qi and Jian Li contributed equally to this work.Received: 31 March 2021 Revised: 18 June 2021 Accepted: 3 July 2021DOI: 10.1111/ejss.13143Eur J Soil Sci. 2022;73:e13143. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ejss © 2021 British Society of Soil Science. 1o f1 2https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13143bacteria.

Therefore, inten-sive irrigation has become the main practice to increasecrop yield in this region. Irrigation not only influencessoil physical processes (such as water infiltration andleaching) but also affects biotic processes (such as cropgrowth) in agroecological ecosystems (Du et al., 2018).However, previous studies mainly focused on the effect ofsoil moisture variation after irrigation on abovegroundcarbon (C) processes, such as leaf photosynthesis andaboveground net primary productivity (Jafarikouhini,Kazemeini, & Sinclair, 2020; Wang, Hu, Liu, Ahmad, &Zhou, 2021). In contrast, the responses of belowgroundcarbon processes to long-term irrigation are unclear,especially the effect of the soil microbial community inthis process.The variation of soil moisture after irrigation willaffect soil microbial community composition through itseffect on microbial physiological tolerance and metaboliccapacity (Kaisermann et al., 2013). As a consequence, theadaptive microbial strategy will shift, resulting in changesin the composition and functioning of soil microbial com-munities (Evans, Wallenstein, & Fierer, 2014). Therefore,the variation of soil moisture may not only influence thephysical characteristics of the soil and soil nutrient diffu-sion to microorganisms but also act as an environmentalfilter shaping the physiological response and compositionof soil microbial communities.Some bacterial strains adjust their osmotic pressuremechanisms in response to rapid changes in soil waterpotential (Sleator & Hill, 2002). Bacterial communitiesexhibit a highly conservative recovery strategy dependenton phylogeny and can rapidly synthesize proteins inresponse to wetting events or seasonal rainfall patterns(Ruehr et al., 2009). For instance, Gram-positive bacteriagenerally grow more slowly than Gram-negative bacteriaand are considered K-strategists, because they showslower development, larger body size, delayed reproduc-tion and longer lifespan (Punsalang, Healmbbs, &Murphy, 1989). A high abundance of Gram-positive bac-teria under lower moisture is associated with theirthicker cell wall and greater drought tolerance (Chodak,Golebiewski, Morawska-Ploskonka, Kuduk, & Niklinska,2015; Hueso, Garcia, & Hernandez, 2012), whereasGram-negative bacteria are more sensitive to majorchanges in water potential (Nesci, Etcheverry, &Magan, 2004). In addition, the ability of many Gram-pos-itive bacteria to sporulate allows them to recover quicklyafter disturbance (Drenovsky, Steenwerth, Jackson, &Scow, 2010). Therefore, the resistance of the microbialcommunity to disturbance may increase the ratio ofGram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biomass orthe relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria.Another important group among soil microorgan-isms, soil fungi, are considered more tolerant to the varia-tion of soil moisture than bacteria because extensivefungal hyphal networks allow them to internally transfermoisture and nutrients in a disturbed environment.2o f1 2 QIET AL . 13652389, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13143 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Further,fungal chitinous cell walls make them more resistant andresilient than bacteria to variations in water availability(Guggenberger, Frey, Six, Paustian, & Elliott, 1999). Inaddition, mycorrhizal fungi can obtain assimilation prod-ucts from plants and in return promote water and nutri-ent supply because they are directly connected to roots(de Deyn, Quirk, Oakley, Ostle, & Bardgett, 2011; Jones,Nguyen, & Finlay, 2009). Hence, the abundance of fungitends to be greater than that of bacteria in lower soilmoisture, and the fungi-to-bacteria ratio increases whena greater resistance of microbial communities againstdrought stress is required (Preece, Verbruggen, Liu,Weedon, & Peñuelas, 2019). However, the effects of soilmoisture on the microbial community composition areinconsistent, and some studies found a relatively higherratio of fungi and Gram-positive bacteria in conditions oflow soil moisture (Barnard, Osborne, & Firestone, 2013;Fuchslueger, Bahn, Fritz, Hasibeder, & Richter, 2014;Preece et al., 2019), whereas others showed limited oralmost no influence on the microbial community compo-sition (Canarini, Carrillo, Mariotte, Ingram, &Dijkstra, 2016; McHugh & Schwartz, 2015; Rousk,Smith, & Jones, 2013).In terrestrial ecosystems, soil microorganisms play animportant role in the soil carbon cycle because they canmineralize SOM, and they convert soil carbon into CO2then release it into the atmosphere (Bardgett, Freeman, &Ostle, 2008; Bruun, Clauson-Kaas, Bobulska, &Thomsen, 2014). The relative contributions of fungal andbacterial functional groups to SOM decomposition differ(Wang et al., 2014). In some cases, the carbon assimila-tion efficiency of bacteria is lower than that of fungi, andthe fungal storage carbon is much greater than bacterialstorage carbon (Suberkropp & Weyers, 1996). In addition,fungal-dominated soil microbial communities canimprove soil carbon stability and generate more stablecarbon (Bardgett et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019). There-fore, soil moisture can influence the soil carbon cyclethrough changes in soil microbial community composi-tion (Borken & Matzner, 2009; Lei et al., 2016; Suet al., 2020).In this study, we took advantage of a 7-year irriga-tion experiment in a winter w heat-maize rotation sys-tem in northern China. The annual precipitationduring the experimental period varied from 330 to576 mm. A high crop yield in this region is mainlyachieved by intensive irri gation (Xiao et al., 2016). Thefield treatments included irrigation plots and non-irrigation plots (only rain-fed conditions). We aimed toinvestigate how long-term irrigation affects the soilmicrobial community composition and the soil carbonstock in a semiarid agroeco system. We hypothesizedthat: (a) long-term irrigatio n would decrease the ratioof fungi and bacteria, as well as the ratio of Gram-nega-tive and Gram-positive bacteria; and (b) the variation ofsoil microbial community composition under long-termirrigation would decrease the soil carbon stock. Thefindings of this study will advance our understanding ofthe relationship between microbial community compo-sition and soil carbon cycling in future precipitationregimes.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1 |Study site and experimental designThis study was conducted at the LuanchengAgroecosystem Experimental Station (37/C14530N, 114/C14410E,50.1 m a.s.l.), located in the high-yield zone of the NorthChina Plain. The climate of this study area is a semiaridwarm temperate continental monsoon with a meanannual temperature of 12.3/C14C. About 75% of the annualprecipitation occurs in the summer (June –September).The soils are classified as silt loam Haplic Cambisolaccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) soil taxonomy system. The basic information ontopsoil (0 –20 cm) was listed as follows: soil organic mat-ter (SOM), 12 –13 g kg/C01; total nitrogen (N), 0.7 –0.8 g kg/C01; soil available N, 60 –80 mg kg/C01; soil availablephsophorus (P), 15 –20 mg kg/C01; soil available potassium(K), 150 –170 mg kg/C01; saturated volumetric water con-tent, 44.1%; water holding capacity, 35.4%. The croppingsystem in this area is winter wheat-maize rotation withwinter wheat grown from early October to mid-June andmaize grown following wheat harvest.Field irrigation experiments were set up at theresearch station in 2006 and have been maintained sincethen. A completely randomized block design was used,with four plots (5 m in width, 10 m in length and 1.5 min depth) assigned to an irrigation treatment and threeplots assigned to a non-irrigation (rainfed) treatment.The irrigated plots received sufficient water to maintainthe soil moisture content of the 1-m soil profile near fieldcapacity (~75% of water-holding capacity). Irrigationtiming was mainly determined according to the keygrowth period of crops and was consistent with localfarmers' irrigation practices. The non-irrigated plots weresubject to the rainfed condition, and only received natu-ral precipitation without extra irrigation during theexperimental period. Due to an unfortunate event, one ofthe non-irrigated plots was destroyed, so there were onlythree replicates of the non-irrigated treatment.

Based on local historical planting and fertilizationregimes, the winter wheat cultivar Kenong 199 was sownin early October at a seed rate of 150 kg ha/C01with a20-cm row space and harvested in mid-June in the fol-lowing year: 600 kg ha/C01of nitrogen and phosphoruscompound fertilizer ((NH 4)2HPO 4) and 150 kg ha/C01ofurea fertilizer (CO(NH 2)2) were applied before wheatsowing; 300 kg ha/C01of urea fertilizer was applied at thejointing stage of winter wheat. The maize cultivarZhengdan 958 was sown at a density of 60,000 plantsha/C01in mid-June and harvested in early October:500 kg ha/C01of urea fertilizer was applied in late July dur-ing the maize growing season. All field managementpractices were uniformly applied to the irrigation treat-ment plots and non-irrigation plots.2.2 |Sample collection and analysisThe inner 3 m /C28 m area of each plot was used for sam-pling plant and soil, with the outer 2 m serving as abuffer zone. Soil volumetric moisture content in a 1.8-msoil profile was measured using a neutron probe (above-ground 20 cm and belowground 180 cm; Institute ofHydrology, Wallingford, UK) at 200-mm intervals in thecentre of the plot every 7 –15 days. Daily air temperatureand precipitation were monitored automatically by theweather station at the research station. The choice ofsampling time is based on the different plant growthperiods and included different seasons. The soil samplingtime was usually before irrigation or at a sufficiently longtime after the last irrigation in order to exclude short-term effects of specific irrigation events on soil microor-ganisms. Topsoil (0 –200 mm) was sampled from eachplot by using a soil corer (38 mm in diameter). Soil sam-pling in 2013 focused on the wheat-growing season,including the wheat-jointing stage (4 April), grain-fillingstage (15 May), seedling emergence stage (12 October)and initial winter stage (22 November). Soil sampling in2014 focused on maize growth periods, including wheatjointing (9 April), maize seedling emergence (12 June)and maize jointing (8 July). In each plot, at least five soilsamples were taken randomly, homogenized, and bulkedinto one composite sample. Each composite sample wassplit in two after the surface organic material and visibleroots were carefully removed. One-half of the sample wasair-dried for analysis of soil physicochemical propertiesand the other was stored at /C020/C14C for microbial analysisafter sieving to 2 mm.Soil moisture content in the samples was determinedgravimetrically after drying for 24 h at 105/C14C. Soil pHwas determined in a 1:2.5 ratio of soil and water slurryusing a combination glass electrode. Soil organic carbon(SOC) was determined with the K 2Cr2O7titrationmethod after digestion (Lu, 1999). Available N was deter-mined with an alkaline hydrolysis diffusion method(Lu, 1999). Available P was extracted with 0.5 MNaHCO3solution (pH =8.5) and determined by theMo-Sb colorimetric method (Lu, 1999). Soil microbialcommunity composition was characterized using phos-pholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, as described byFrostegård and Bååth (1996) with minor modifications.Briefly, 8 g freeze-dried soil samples were extracted ina chloroform-methanol-phosphate buffer (1:2:0.8 v/v/v),and the extracted lipids were fractionated into neutrallipids, glycolipids and polar lipids on silica acid col-umns by successive elution with chloroform, acetoneand methanol, respectively. The methanol fraction(containing phospholipids) was subjected to mild alka-line methanolysis to transform the fatty acids into freemethyl esters and analysed on a gas chromatograph(Agilent Technologies 7890B, USA) equipped with aflame ionization detector. Peaks were identified usingbacterial fatty acid standards and MIDI peak identifica-tion software (MIDI, Inc., Newark, DE, USA). ThePLFAs i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0 and a17:0 were used toindicate Gram-positive (GP) bacteria, and the PLFAs16:1ω9c, 16:1 ω7c, 18:1 ω7c, cy17:0 and cy19:0 were usedto indicate Gram-negative (GN) bacteria (Frostegård &Bååth, 1996; Zelles, 1999). The sum of PLFA markerschosen to represent Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacteria was used to determine total bacteria. ThePLFA 18:2 ω6c was used as an indicator of fungi. ThePLFAs were chosen to represent fungi and the sum ofthe PLFA markers chosen to represent bacteria wasused to calculate the fungi-to-bacteria ratio. All PLFAswere expressed as nmol g/C01dry soil.2.3 |Statistical analysisAll data were checked for normal distribution and homo-geneity of variance before statistical analysis and allvalues were presented as means ± standard error ( SE).The effects of treatment, sampling time and their interac-tions on soil properties and microbial indices were testedusing two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Multivariatedimensionality reduction analysis was applied to quantifyand test the effects of treatment and environmental fac-tors on the variation of soil microbial community compo-sition.

The precipitation was par-ticularly low in 2010 and 2011, resulting in stronger lowmoisture in that period (Figure 1a). Soil water content(SWC) in the non-irrigation treatments was generallylower than in the irrigation over the 7 years (Figure 1b,c).In this experiment, irrigation significantly increasedthe soil moisture content by 38% and decreased the SOCconcentration by 4.2% ( p< 0.05; Table 1), whereas theavailable soil N and P were not affected by the irrigation(p>0.05; Table 1). All abiotic soil properties measuredin this study were strongly affected by sampling time,showing variations among sampling times ( p< 0.05;Table 1). In addition, soil pH was significantly influencedby both the irrigation and sampling time ( p< 0.05;Table 1).3.2 |Effects of irrigation on soilmicrobial community compositionThe fungal biomass significantly decreased after irriga-tion and varied with sampling time ( p< 0.05; Figure 2a).FIGURE 2 Fungal (a),bacterial (b), Gram-positive (GP)bacterial (c), Gram-negative(GN) bacterial (d) and totalmicrobial (e) biomass(represented by phospholipidfatty acid (PLFA) abundance) inirrigation and non-irrigationplots across different samplingtimes6o f1 2 QIET AL . 13652389, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13143 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Therefore, intensive irrigationregimes have long been imposed to relieve drought stressin agriculture in this region (Xiao & Tao, 2014). Ourresults demonstrated that 7-year irrigation stronglyinfluenced soil microbial community composition, andhence affected the soil carbon content in the semiaridagroecosystem.4.1 |The response of soil microbialcommunity composition to irrigationSoil microbial community composition can be stronglyaffected by soil moisture (Frindte, Pape, Werner,Loeffler, & Knief, 2019). Our results showed that irriga-tion strongly increased soil moisture during the 7 years.Accordingly, we found that irrigation significantlyaffected the ratios of different microbial groups and thePLFA biomarker abundances. These results support ourfirst hypothesis that the ratio between fungi and bacteriadecreased after long-term irrigation, and was dependenton sampling time in a semiarid agroecosystem.Although the total microbial biomass was not affectedby irrigation, both fungal biomass and the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial PLFA abundance were significantlydecreased under irrigation. This was consistent with pre-vious studies showing that fungi are more tolerant thanbacteria to drought in both laboratory and field experi-ments (de Vries et al., 2018; Preece et al., 2019). Fungalchitinous cell walls make them more resistant to drought,and their hyphal networks may benefit the growth offungi and allow them to acquire more water and nutri-ents over long distances in low-moisture environments(de Boer et al., 2005; Guggenberger et al., 1999). Further-more, soil moisture can affect both the quantity and com-position of root exudates, and these exudates maystrongly influence the microbial community via labilecarbon, signalling molecules and phytohormones(de Vries, Griffiths, Knight, Nicolitch, & Williams, 2020;Fuchslueger et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2020; Li, Zhou, Alaei, &Bengtson, 2020). Indeed, a field study has demonstratedthat low soil moisture content reduces plant-assimilatedcarbon acquired by bacteria, but does not influence car-bon transfer to fungi (Fuchslueger et al., 2014).In contrast to our hypothesis, both Gram-positive andGram-negative bacterial biomass did not significantly dif-fer between irrigation and non-irrigation treatments.However, we found that the microbial community dif-fered after irrigation, and the ratio of Gram-positive toGram-negative bacterial PLFA abundance in the non-irri-gation treatment was higher than that in the irrigationtreatment. The lower ratio of Gram-positive bacteria-to-Gram-negative bacteria in the irrigation treatment maybe caused by differences in cell-wall structure and physio-logical functioning between the two bacterial groups(Canarini et al., 2016).

Gram-positive bacteria arealso more complex substrates and potentially have amore advanced osmoregulatory strategy than Gram-nega-tive bacteria (Harris, 1981). Moreover, the capacity ofmany Gram-positive bacteria to sporulate allows them towithstand a variety of disturbances, including lower soilmoisture (Drenovsky et al., 2010). In summary, the abovemicrobial survival strategies offer a possible explanationfor the variation in the ratios between different bacterialgroups after irrigation. Similar results have been found inother studies showing that variation of soil moisture canstrongly influence the bacterial community biomass ordiversity (Alster, German, Lu, & Allison, 2013;Fuchslueger et al., 2014; Sheik et al., 2011).4.2 |Irrigation effect on the soil Cstorage and its linkage with soil microbialcommunity compositionCycling of soil carbon strongly depends on soil environ-mental factors, such as soil water content (Condron, Hop-kins, Gregorich, Black, & Wakelin, 2014; Lei et al., 2016;Lei et al., 2020). In our experimental period, the non-irrigation treatment significantly increased SOC concen-tration compared with the irrigation treatment. Otherstudies also reported that a low soil moisture contentreduces SOM mineralization and increases soil carboncontent (Borken & Matzner, 2009; Larsen et al., 2011).Low water availability can limit SOM decomposition pro-cesses by decreasing microbial activity (Hueso et al., 2012;Zeglin et al., 2013), as well as decreasing the mobility ofnutrients and energy sources, in return, resulting in a lowsubstrate supply to microbial decomposers and nutrientlimitation (Suseela, Conant, Wallenstein, & Dukes, 2012).In addition, there was more crop biomass in the irrigationtreatment than in the non-irrigation treatment. Greatercrop biomass would increase the carbon input into thesoil from plants (e.g., root residues and exudation). Thegreater carbon input from plants would also result in vari-ation of the microbial community, and induce rhizo-sphere priming, which might increase the SOMdecomposition rate, by up to 380% (Cheng et al., 2014; Li,Alaei, Zhou, & Bengtson, 2021).Soil carbon content is directly and indirectly affectedby the soil microbial community dynamics, microbialactivity and microbial decomposition (Six, Frey, Thiet, &Batten, 2006). We found that the ratio of soil fungal-to-bacterial PLFA abundance greatly contributed to theincreased SOC concentration based on the SEM. Ourresult is consistent with reports that the fungal biomassshowed a relative increase under low soil moisture con-tent because fungi are better adapted to low-moistureconditions (Bapiri, Bååth, & Rousk, 2010; Barnard,Osborne, & Firestone, 2015; Preece et al., 2019). The vari-ation in soil physical conditions by moisture availabilitymight lead to soil carbon stabilization when the micro-bial community shifts towards a fungi-dominated com-munity (Bardgett, Bowman, Kaufmann, & Schmidt, 2005;Manzoni et al., 2012). Soil fungal communities cansequester more carbon through a more recalcitrant cell-wall composition and higher carbon-use efficiency thanthose of bacteria (Bailey, Smith, & Bolton, 2002; Sixet al., 2006). As observed in previous studies, a large pop-ulation of fungi favours the formation of macroaggregatesby the effect of their hyphae aggregating smaller aggre-gates into bigger ones, in which SOM is more resistant todecomposition than in microaggregates (Johnson,Gehring, & Jansa, 2016). Thus, soil carbon sequestrationcapacity would be more persistent when fungi dominatethe microbial community, and the lower fungal biomassand ratio of fungal-to-bacterial abundance under irriga-tion would decrease soil carbon sequestration in thesemiarid agroecosystem in the study area.The bacterial community is strongly affected by soilwater content in terms of their physiological status andSOM decomposition capacity, and different microbialgroups generally show a different response to soil mois-ture content (Jansson & Hofmockel, 2020). Therefore, thebacterial community composition, for example, the ratioof Gram-positive-to-Gram-negative bacterial abundance,after soil moisture changes influences soil carbon con-tent. Although there was a lower ratio of Gram-positivebacteria and Gram-negative bacteria in the non-irrigationthan in the irrigation plots, our results show that the ratioof Gram-positive-to-Gram-negative bacterial biomass hadno significant effect on the increased SOC concentrationaccording to the SEM. This was probably due to neitherthe Gram-positive nor the Gram-negative bacterial bio-mass being significantly affected by the irrigation treat-ment. Moreover, the SEM analysis showed that the soilphysicochemical index had a significant direct effect onthe SOC concentration, but its residual value was high inthe model and not caused by irrigation. Our results dem-onstrate that soil microbes are associated with higher soilcarbon content through changes in microbial communitycomposition in the semiarid agricultural ecosystems.5|CONCLUSIONSUsing a 7-year irrigation experiment, we found that irri-gation significantly decreased soil carbon content of theQIET AL . 9o f1 2 13652389, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13143 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [10/04/2023].

Irrigation also, directly and indirectly,affected soil abiotic properties and influenced the soilmicrobial community composition, decreasing the fungalcommunity and soil carbon content in the semiaridagroecosystem. Overall, our experiment demonstratesthat (a) the responses of soil microbial communities toirrigation were highly taxa dependent and the groupsadapted to low availability of water such as the fungi-dominated group were not favoured; (b) irrigation couldinfluence soil carbon sequestration through its effect onthe ratio between bacteria and fungi. These findingsallow us to predict the response of soil carbon content ina semiarid agroecosystem to future climate change.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSLiu Z.F. was supported by the Strategic Priority ResearchProgram of Chinese Academy of Sciences(No. XDB40020203) and the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (No. 41771278).
