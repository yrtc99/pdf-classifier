Soil pH and temperature regulate assembly processesof abundant and rare bacterial communities inagricultural ecosystemsShuo Jiao and Yahai Lu *College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, PekingUniversity, Beijing 100871, P. R. China.SummaryThe factors determining stochastic and deterministicprocesses that drive microbial community structure,speci ﬁcally the balance of abundant and rare bacte-rial taxa, remain underexplored. Here we examinedbiogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacte-rial taxa and explored environmental factors in ﬂuenc-ing their community assembly processes inagricultural ﬁelds across eastern China. More phylo-genetic turnover correlating with spatial distance wasobserved in abundant than rare sub-communities.Homogeneous selection was the main assembly pro-cess for both the abundant and rare sub-communi-ties; however, the abundant sub-community wasmore tightly clustered phylogenetically and was moresensitive to dispersal limitations than the rare sub-community. Rare sub-community of rice ﬁelds andabundant sub-community of maize ﬁelds were moregoverned by stochastic assembly processes, whichshowed higher operational taxonomic unit richness.We propose a conceptual paradigm wherein soil pHand mean annual temperature mediate the assemblyof the abundant and rare sub-communities respec-tively. A higher soil pH leads to deterministic assem-bly of the abundant sub-community. For the rare sub-community, the dominance of stochasticity in low-temperature regions indicates weaker niche-basedexclusion and the arrival of more evolutionary line-ages. These ﬁndings suggest that the communityassembly processes for abundant and rare bacterialtaxa are dependent on distinct environmental vari-ables in agro-ecosystems.IntroductionMicrobial communities, which are highly diverse at bothtaxonomic and metabolic levels, are a crucial part ofglobal biogeochemical processes (Prosser et al ., 2007;Schloss and Handelsman, 2007; Falkowski et al., 2008).Biogeography describes the distribution of taxa overspace and time (Meyer et al ., 2018). Understandingmicrobial biogeography has led to fundamental insightsinto the maintaining and generating species diversity. Itcan also help determine the links between communitystability and ecosystem functions (Hanson et al ., 2012;Meyer et al ., 2018). Microbial communities commonlyexhibit unbalanced distributions, whereby they contain alarge number of low-abundance taxa and a small numberof high-abundance taxa (Hanson et al ., 2012; Brownet al., 2014; Jousset et al., 2017). These low-abundancetaxa are often referred to as the ‘rare biosphere ’(Soginet al ., 2006; Pedrós-Alió, 2012). The highly abundantmicrobes that account for the majority of microbial bio-mass are thought to be most important in carbon cycling(Pedrós-Alió, 2012; Wu et al., 2017). In oil-contaminatedsoils, abundant taxa had closer relationships with and agreater in ﬂuence on the co-occurrence of other taxa thanrare taxa did (Jiao et al., 2017a). However, recent studieshave increasingly emphasized the importance of raretaxa (Lynch and Neufeld, 2015). For example, rare bacte-rial species have been shown to play fundamental rolesin sulphate reduction (Pester et al ., 2010) and phenan-threne degradation (Sauret et al., 2014), as well as medi-ating ecosystem stability and function (Elshahed et al .,2008; Reid and Buckley, 2011). Currently, little is knownabout the fundamental processes underlying the micro-bial biogeography of abundant and rare taxa, as well asthe mechanisms controlling rare taxa (Jia et al., 2018).Microbial community ecology is progressing from thedescription of patterns towards a mechanistic under-standing the underlying processes in microbial commu-nity assembly (Ovaskainen et al ., 2017). There is anongoing debate regarding the relative contributions ofdeterministic (niche-based theory) and stochastic (neutraltheory) processes in the assembly of microbial communi-ties (Stegen et al ., 2012; Wang et al ., 2013; Dini-Received 15 July, 2019; revised 27 September, 2019; accepted 30September, 2019. *For correspondence.

Over the last decade, high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowedresearchers to explore microbial community assembly inthe rare biosphere (Logares et al., 2012). Indeed, studieshave been conducted in a wide range of environments,such as marine water (Logares et al ., 2014; Wu et al .,2017; Mo et al., 2018), inland freshwater (Liu et al., 2015)and oil-contaminated soil (Jiao et al ., 2017a). In oil-contaminated soil, the rare subcommunity is primarilygoverned by stochastic processes; meanwhile, determin-istic processes are the primary contributor to the structureof the abundant sub-community (Jiao et al., 2017a). How-ever, the opposite results were observed in inland fresh-water (Liu et al ., 2015). These outcomes indicate thatmicrobial assembly processes can differ between terres-trial and aquatic ecosystems. Agricultural ﬁelds arehuman-managed ecosystems that provide global foodsecurity for a growing world population (Mondiale, 2008).Due to contrasting water management practices, agricul-tural soils can be divided into unsaturated (e.g. corn) andsaturated (e.g. paddy) ﬁelds that have distinct microbialdiversity patterns. Nevertheless, studies assessing themechanisms that in ﬂuence the community assembly ofabundant and rare bacterial taxa in unsaturated and satu-rated agro-ecosystems remain scarce.To advance mechanistic understanding of communityassembly processes, the factors that mediate the bal-ance between stochastic and deterministic processesmust be elucidated (Feng et al., 2018). A study showedthat soil pH in ﬂuences the balance between stochasticand deterministic processes in shaping soil bacterialcommunity assembly during the paedogenic processes(Tripathi et al ., 2018). In addition, it has been observedthat increases in soil organic matter (OM) lead to a transi-tion from homogeneous selection to weak selection andstochasticity, and then to variable selection during pri-mary ecosystem succession (Dini-Andreote et al., 2015).The initial amount of and the changes in soil OM due tonutrient addition in ﬂuence the relative contributions of dif-ferent assembly processes (Feng et al., 2018). However,it is still unclear what underlying environmental factorslead to the dominance of particular assembly processesfor abundant and rare bacterial taxa in agro-ecosystems.In the present study, we aim to (i) explore the biogeo-graphic patterns of abundant and rare bacterial taxa inagro-ecosystems and (ii) uncover the underlying environ-mental factors regulating assembly processes of abun-dant and rare bacterial taxa. These questions could bewell addressed based on the existing high-throughputsequencing data sets obtained from adjacent pairs ofmaize (water unsaturated) and rice (water saturated) cul-tivated ﬁelds across eastern China (Jiao et al ., 2019).Our results highlight the importance of considering thedifferent linkages between environmental conditions andecological processes in governing the assembly of abun-dant and rare taxa in agro-ecosystems.ResultsGeneral patterns of abundant and rare taxaThere was large phylogenetic diversity in both the rareand abundant sub-communities (Fig. 1A and C). Theabundant taxa were primarily comprised of Prote-obacteria ,Acidobateria and Actinobacteria ; meanwhile,the rare taxa were primarily comprised of Chloro ﬂexi,Planctomycetes andFirmicutes . The rare taxa containedmore taxonomic groups than the abundant taxa. In addi-tion, the abundant taxa had greater presence across soilsamples than the rare taxa (Fig. 1A and B). Some abun-dant taxa were present in 100% of samples; meanwhile,none of the rare taxa were present in > 20% of sites. Toexplore the distributions of rare and abundant taxa acrosssoil samples we calculated the per cent changes of rareor abundant taxa in each sample to determine whetherthese taxa were abundant, intermediate, rare or notdetected in other samples (Fig. S1). Of the taxa that werelocally abundant, 35.3% were also abundant and only2.4% were rare in other samples. Of the taxa that werelocally rare, 77.7% were not detected, 5.2% were still rareand almost none (0.9%) were abundant in the other sam-ples. These results indicate distinct distribution patternsof abundant and rare taxa in agricultural ﬁelds.In general, the rare taxa accounted for a high proportionof the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (mean = 63.2%);however, they only accounted for an average of 11.5% ofthe relative abundance in each sample (Fig. S2A). Theabundant taxa accounted for a very low proportion ofOTUs (mean = 4.7%); however, they accounted for 48.6%of the average relative abundance in each sample. Theabundant sub-community had a higher OTU richness andrelative abundance in maize soils than rice soils; the raresub-community exhibited the opposite trend (i.e. lowerOTU richness and relative abundance in maize soils thanrice soils; Fig. S2B). Modelling using kriging interpolationshowed that both the abundant and rare sub-communitieshad higher OTU richness in northern ﬁelds than southernﬁelds (Fig. S2C and D).Turnover of abundant and rare taxaThe mean values of standardized effect size measure ofthe mean nearest taxon distance (SES.MNTD) were sig-niﬁcantly higher for abundant than rare taxa, which wereall less than zero (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p<0 . 0 0 1 ,Fig. S3). Signi ﬁcant distance –decay relationships (DDRs)were observed for the abundant and rare sub-communities(p< 0.05; Fig. S4A).

In addition, the abundant sub-communityexhibited a signi ﬁcantly higher phylogenetic β-diversitythan the rare sub-community (Fig. S4B).We performed a distance-based linear model and for-ward selection procedure to identify the major environ-mental variables responsible for shaping the abundantand rare sub-communities. A constrained analysis of prin-cipal coordinates (CAP) revealed that soil pH and meanannual temperature (MAT) were the most important vari-ables for the community assembly of abundant and raretaxa respectively (Fig. 2, Tables S1 and S2). Similartrends were observed separately in maize and rice soils(Fig. S5, Tables S3 –S6).The strength of the relationship between phylogeny andenvironmental response was examined to determinewhether environmental responses could be predictive ofphylogenetic levels. Spearman ’s correlations between rela-tive abundances of bacterial taxa and environmental vari-ables (soil pH or MAT) across all of the soil samples wereused to identify ‘alkaline-responsive ’or ‘acid-responsive ’indicator taxa, as well as ‘warm-responsive ’or‘cold-respon-sive ’indicator taxa. In the abundant sub-community,426, 518, 380 and 311 OTUs were identify as ‘alkaline-responsive ’,‘acid-responsive ’,‘warm-responsive ’and ‘cold-responsive ’indicator taxa, respectively; in the rare sub-com-munity, 506, 571, 564 and 626 OTUs were identi ﬁed as‘alkaline-responsive ’,‘acid-responsive ’,‘warm-responsive ’and ‘cold-responsive ’indicator taxa respectively. Indicatortaxa mainly belonged to the Proteobacteria ,Chloro ﬂexi,Acidobacteria andActinobacteria phyla (Fig. S6).We assessed trait conservatism in response to environ-mental changes (Table 1). The abundant sub-communityexhibited a stronger and signi ﬁcant phylogenetic signal forsoil pH (K=0 . 0 9 1 ; p< 0.001) than for MAT ( K=0 . 0 7 8 ;p< 0.001). This indicates that within abundant taxa, closelyrelated species had more similar responses to soil pH thanMAT. By contrast, the phylogenetic signals of rare taxawere stronger for MAT ( K=0 . 0 6 8 ; p< 0.001) than for soilpH (K=0 . 0 6 7 ; p< 0.001). Phylum-level taxonomy con-ﬁrmed these observations (Table 1). For instance, mostphyla in the abundant sub-community had a stronger phy-logenetic signal for soil pH than for MAT; meanwhile, mostrare phyla, including Proteobacteria ,Gemmatimonadetesand Verrucomicrobia , had a stronger phylogenetic signalfor MAT than for pH.Relative in ﬂuence of assembly processes in rare andabundant sub-communitiesThe relationships between β-nearest taxon index ( βNTI)and major environmental variables were used to inferFig. 1.

Partial mantel testshowed that soil pH and MAT were, respectively, the bestpredictor of assembly processes of the abundant and therare sub-communities, and the relationships remainedsigni ﬁcant after controlling for spatial distance and othermeasured environmental variables (Table 2). Pairwisecomparisons of βNTI values for the abundant and raresub-communities were signi ﬁcantly and positively corre-lated with differences in soil pH and MAT respectively(Fig. 3A). This indicated that an increasing divergence ofsoil pH and MAT, respectively, led to a shift from homo-geneous selection to stochasticity in abundant and rarebacterial community assembly.Samples were separated into sub-groups based on soilpH and MAT and correlated with βNTI. In the abundantsub-community, the relative in ﬂuence of homogeneousselection increased with soil pH. In the rare sub-commu-nity, the relative in ﬂuence of stochastic assemblydecreased with MAT (Fig. 3B). Similar results wereobserved in both maize and rice soils (Figs S7 and S8,Table 2).Quantitative analysis of assembly processes inabundant and rare sub-communitiesHomogeneous selection contributed the largest fractionto the assembly of both abundant (45.0%) and rare(65.8%) sub-communities, with higher contributions forrare sub-communities (Fig. 4). Dispersal limitations(31.0%) and variable selection (9.3%) in ﬂuenced theabundant sub-community more than the rare sub-community (dispersal limitations: 3.1%, variable selec-tion: 0.2%). The neutral community model explained alarger fraction of variation in the abundant sub-communitythan the rare sub-community, which were observed inboth maize and rice soils (Table 3). Then, we comparedthe different assembly processes of maize versus rice(Figs 5 ). For abundant taxa, deterministic processes con-tributed a larger fraction to the community assembly inrice (64.0%) than maize (61.7%) ﬁelds. While stochasticassembly processes in ﬂuenced the rare sub-communityin rice ﬁelds (35.0%) ﬁvefold more than that in maizeﬁelds (7.1%).Fig. 2.

Determining the biogeographic patterns and com-munity assembly of abundant and rare microbial taxa isuseful for understanding the generation and maintenanceof ecosystem diversity (Pedrós-Alió, 2012; Lynch andNeufeld, 2015; Jia et al ., 2018). Here, we show that(i) abundant and rare bacterial diversity exhibits distinctbiogeographic and ecological patterns that are driven bydifferent assembly processes, and (ii) soil pH and MATpredominately mediate the assembly of abundant andrare sub-communities, respectively, in agricultural ﬁelds.Novel sequencing technologies have provided increas-ing resolutions to shed light on the role of the rarebiosphere, which is currently one of the new frontiers inmicrobial ecology (Jousset et al ., 2017). In the presentstudy, abundant taxa were more ubiquitous than raretaxa, suggesting that rare taxa are mediated by the pres-ence of distinct ecological niches in agricultural ecosys-tems. This conclusion is supported by the notion thatabundant species occupy a diverse niche, competitivelyutilize an array of resources, and effectively adapt to theenvironment (Jiao et al ., 2017a). Rare taxa, meanwhile,are restricted by habitat speci ﬁcity (Barberan et al., 2014;Jousset et al ., 2017). A study suggested that rare taxamay act as a ‘seed bank ’for taxa that can become domi-nant under the proper conditions (Lennon and Jones,2011). However, in our study only a few taxa shifted fromrare to abundant, and most rare taxa (77.7%) were non-existent or below the limits of detection in other samples.This implies that rare species might not be waiting forfavourable conditions based on the homogenized habi-tats in maize or rice ﬁelds. Rice soils possessed morerare taxa than maize soils, which could be due to thepresence of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa due tosaturation –unsaturation cycles in rice ﬁelds (Jiao et al .,2019). Rare taxa, which are more abundant in rice ﬁelds,can increase functional redundancy and resiliency toenvironmental disturbances (Yachi and Loreau, 1999;Pedrós-Alió, 2012; Lynch and Neufeld, 2015).The globally biogeographic microbial assemblagescould have potential to be ef ﬁcient biological indicatorsfor the environmental health of the complex natural sys-tems (Astudillo-Garcia et al., 2019). Therefore, revealingmicrobial biogeography and mechanisms underlyingcommunity assembly is a central issue in microbial ecol-ogy (Nemergut et al., 2013). In our agricultural soils, bothFig. 4.

Soil pH hadthe strongest in ﬂuence on the structure of the abundantsub-community among all environmental factors tested;by contrast, the rare sub-community was most highly cor-related with MAT. Studies have demonstrated that differ-ent controlling factors constrain the structures of the rareand abundant sub-communities (Liu et al ., 2015; Jiaoet al ., 2017a). Additionally, the signi ﬁcantly lower meanvalues of SES.MNTD for rare taxa indicate that thesetaxa are more closely phylogenetically clustered than theabundant sub-community (Fan et al., 2017). The negativeSES.MNTD values indicate that both abundant and raretaxa were phylogenetically clustered more closely thanexpected by chance. Abundant and rare taxa alsoexhibited more phylogenetic niche conservation and eco-logical similarity than soil pH and MAT respectively. Thisimplies that the sub-communities have distinct phyloge-netic adaptations to different environmental conditions.Although the phylogenetic signals were signi ﬁcant, theKvalues were all below 1 and close to 0. This indicatesthat closely related species were actually less correlatedwith the traits (e.g. soil pH, temperature) than expectedunder the Brownian motion model of trait evolution, whichmimics a random or convergent pattern of evolution(Blomberg et al., 2003).A central challenge in biogeography is quantifying thecontributions of deterministic and stochastic processes tomicrobial community assembly (Wang et al., 2015). Theneutral and niche-based mechanisms could lead tomicrobial communities with low-stability properties, forexample, resistance and recovery (Liu et al ., 2019b).Analysis of phylogenetic and taxonomic β-diversity usinga null-model approach provides a systematic frameworkto classifying community pairs based on the underlyingforces driving community assembly (Stegen et al., 2013).We can also make ecological inferences using phyloge-netic turnover (Cavender-Bares et al ., 2009; Tripathiet al ., 2018). Microbial diversity of extreme ecosystems,like Arctic soils, could be substantially different, whileother non-extreme environments, for example, forest andagricultural ﬁelds, may harbour similar communities(Malard and Pearce, 2018). Long-term crop cultivation(e.g. maize, rice) and irrigation (e.g. unsaturated, satu-rated) results in homogenized habitats in agriculturalﬁelds. As expected, homogeneous selection was foundto be the main process driving the assembly of bothabundant and rare sub-communities irrespective of croptype (i.e. maize or rice). Recent studies have demon-strated that deterministic processes drive communityassembly in wheat (Shi et al., 2018) and soybean (Zhanget al., 2018) ﬁelds. Homogenizing selection, estimated bynull model analysis, was predicted to have played amajor role in the assembly of soil microbial communities,while dispersal limitation was a dominant factor structur-ing mineral-associated communities in a rhizospheremicrocosm (Whitman et al., 2018). Moreover, Ogonowskiand colleagues (2018) provided experimental evidencesfor the signi ﬁcant effect of selection process in the struc-turing of bio ﬁlm microbial community assemblages anddemonstrated that differences in bio ﬁlm community struc-ture were strongly related to the variation in substratehydrophobicity.In our study, dispersal signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced theabundant sub-community but not the rare sub-commu-nity. This result is supported by a study showing thatabundant taxa were more limited by dispersal than raretaxa in the surface layer of the north-western Paci ﬁcOcean (Wu et al., 2017). Other studies have shown thatrare taxa are more limited by dispersal than abundanttaxa in oil-contaminated soils (Jiao et al ., 2017a) andsubtropical bays (Mo et al ., 2018). These discrepanciesmay be due to the difference in habitats (Wang et al .,2013, 2017) and geography (Shi et al ., 2018).Langenheder and Lindstrom (2019) proposed a concep-tual overview to predict changes in the relative impor-tance of community assembly processes in dependenceof spatial scale, and demonstrated the important roles ofspatial scale in the assembly processes. In addition, dif-ferent de ﬁnitions of rare and abundant taxa could partlyresult in the different results (Langenheder andLindstrom, 2019). The high fraction of non-dominant pro-cesses (29.6%) that contributed to the assembly of therare sub-community suggests that more complex assem-bly mechanisms may shape the rare sub-community(Mo et al ., 2018). Neutral-based processes are anotherforce that shapes the microbial community (Hubbell,2001; Dumbrell et al ., 2010; Langenheder and Szekely,2011). Neutral mechanisms were found to in ﬂuence theassembly of microbial communities with dominatedstrength in steady-state insular environments (Liu et al .,2019b). Our neutral model explained a large fraction(R2> 0.9) of the variability in occurrence frequency of theabundant sub-community, indicating that neutral pro-cesses have a strong role in shaping the abundant sub-community but not the rare sub-community. Multiple ana-lyses support the notion that different assembly pro-cesses drive the structure of the abundant and rare sub-communities, which leads to their distinct biogeographicdistributions. However, this is inconsistent with otherstudies exploring the rare microbial biosphere of the Arc-tic Ocean (Galand et al ., 2009) and subtropical bays(Moet al., 2018), which showed that rare taxa had similarpatterns to those of abundant taxa. It is possible that dis-persal is limited by diminished ﬂuidity in terrestrial eco-systems and that selection strength may be higher in© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Environmental Microbiology ,22,1052 –10651058 S.

Bacterialβ-diversity showed strong habitat-speci ﬁcp a t t e r n s( W a n get al., 2017). In the present study, we suggested that raretaxa in the rice ﬁelds, more governed by stochastic assemblyprocesses were less constrained by environment than thatin the maize ﬁelds. On the other hand, weaker deterministicprocesses for abundant sub-community were observed inmaize ﬁelds compared with rice soils. A potential explanationis that paddy soils could be unique habitats due to constantﬂooding management activities and long-term regular dry –wet cycles (Hu et al., 2013), resulting in less environment ﬁl-tering. This effort might be stronger for rare taxa, becausethey are typically restricted by habitat speci ﬁcity (Barberanet al., 2014; Jousset et al., 2017). When facing less environ-ment ﬁltering, rare taxa might exhibit stronger stochastic dis-persal than abundant ones, which could utilize an array ofresources and effective adapt to the environment (Barberanet al., 2014; Jousset et al., 2017). Stochastic processes mayoverwhelm deterministic processes under less environmen-tal variation (Wang et al., 2013). Interestingly, the abundantsub-community in maize ﬁelds and rare sub-community inriceﬁelds were more governed by stochastic assembly pro-cesses, corresponding to thei r higher OTU richness. Thiscould be supported by a recent study, demonstrating thatstochastic assembly processes were dominant in highα-diversity communities (Xun et al., 2019).Environmental ﬁltering is a key determinant of commu-nity assembly (Kraft et al., 2015) and has been shown tocause phylogenetic clustering in bacterial communities(Horner-Devine and Bohannan, 2006). Many studieshave shown that soil pH, OMs and salinity can in ﬂuencebacterial community assembly processes in various envi-ronments (Dini-Andreote et al ., 2015; Feng et al ., 2018;Tripathi et al ., 2018; Zhang et al ., 2019). Here, weshowed that soil pH and MAT mediated the balancebetween stochastic and deterministic assembly for abun-dant and rare sub-communities, respectively, in agro-eco-systems. It is not surprising that soil pH in ﬂuences theassembly of abundant sub-communities because pH isknown to affect bacterial community composition anddiversity at multiple scales (Fierer and Jackson, 2006;Rousk et al ., 2010; Jiao et al ., 2019). In the presentstudy, the increased role of stochasticity in acidic envi-ronments may mean that adapted lineages of abundanttaxa accumulate in acidic soils. However, another studyshowed that stochasticity played a larger role in neutralpH soils (Tripathi et al., 2018). The differences betweenstudies might be due to the divergences between human-managed agricultural ﬁelds and natural ecosystems.MAT drove the assembly of the rare sub-community,which was dominated by homogeneous selection in high-MAT regions and stochasticity in low MAT regions. Tem-perature is known to in ﬂuence soil microbial communitystructure (Davidson and Janssens, 2006; Leininger et al.,2006; Jurburg et al., 2017). Climate warming acceleratestemporal turnover and divergent succession of soil micro-bial communities (Guo et al., 2018, 2019). Species diver-sity, metabolic activity and population growth ratesincrease exponentially with temperature (Zhou et al .,2016). Because rare taxa are important contributors tomicrobial diversity (Lynch and Neufeld, 2015), changingenvironmental temperatures might have a larger effect onrare taxa. The dominance of homogeneous selection inhigh MAT regions suggests that rare taxa are more sensi-tive to hot environments; by contrast, the dominance ofstochastic assembly in low MAT regions implies thatweaker niche-based exclusion and increased arrival ofrare taxa lineages may dominate in colder regions.ConclusionsTogether, we propose a conceptual paradigm describingthe assembly of abundant and rare bacterial sub-communities based on environmental factors in agro-ecosystems (Fig. 6). Phylogenetic clustering of bacterialcommunities is different in rare and abundant sub-commu-nities. The rare sub-community is more phylogeneticallyclosely clustered than the abundant sub-community, whichwere less governed by stochastic assembly. With regardto different habitats, stochastic processes contributedmore to the abundant sub-community assembly in maizeﬁelds than rice ﬁelds, while the rare sub-communityexhibited the opposite trend. Soil pH and MAT mediatethe assembly of the abundant and rare sub-communitiesrespectively. In the abundant sub-community, higher pHleads to an increase in deterministic assembly, whereas inthe rare sub-community, increased MAT leads to adecrease in stochastic assembly. This model helps toexplain the forces responsible for the generation andmaintenance of bacterial diversity, which is essential forecosystem function (Jing et al., 2015; Delgado-Baquerizoet al ., 2016). These factors should be considered whendetermining ecosystem management practices. Our studywas limited to two agricultural ecosystems, and a broaderexamination of various ecosystems is warranted.MethodsData setsWe used high-throughput sequencing data from studiesof soil bacterial diversity in ﬁelds cultivated with maize© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Environmental Microbiology ,22,1052 –1065Bacterial community assembly in agro-ecosystems 1059 14622920, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.14815 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

The sampling sites extendfrom 18.30/C14N to 48.35/C14N and 87.61/C14E to 99.91/C14Eacross eastern China. Brie ﬂy, 251 soils samples werecollected from 133 agricultural ﬁelds under long-term cul-tivation with maize and rice; there were 118 paired sites(i.e. < 5 km apart), 8 maize-only sites and 7 rice-onlysites. Edaphic variables, including pH, cation exchangecapacity (CEC), OM, dissolved organic carbon (DOC),total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), nitrate –nitrogen (NO3), ammonium –nitrogen (NH 4), total phos-phorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), total potassium(TK), available potassium (AK), microbial biomass carbon(MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), total iron(TFe), available iron (AFe), total sulphur (TS), availablesulphur (AS), total manganese (TMn), available manga-nese (AMn), total copper (TCu), available copper (ACu),total zinc (TZn), available zinc (AZn) and soil particle sizedistribution (clay, silt and sand), were measured usingstandard soil testing procedures (Ma et al ., 2016; Shiet al., 2018). MATs and mean annual precipitation valueswere obtained from the WorldClim database (www.worldclim.org). Microbial diversity was analysed usinghigh-throughput sequencing of the V4 –V5 regions of the16S rRNA gene on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina Inc.,San Diego, CA). Sequences were ﬁltered for quality con-trol, split into OTUs using a 97% similarity cut-off andassigned to taxonomic groups (Jiao et al., 2019).Data analysesAll statistical analyses were performed in R (v3.5.1; http://www.r-project.org/). OTUs that contained less than20 reads were discarded. Sequences were rare ﬁed at26,547 sequences from each sample. Give the rarefac-tion and locations proximity, 242 samples (120 maizeand 122 rice soils) were further analysed. After quality ﬁl-tering and the removal of chimeric sequences, 6 588 444high-quality sequences were clustered into 13,149 OTUs.We de ﬁned ‘abundant ’OTUs as those having relativeabundances above 0.1% of total sequences, ‘rare ’OTUsas those having relative abundances below 0.01% and‘intermediate ’OTUs as those having relative abundancesbetween 0.01% and 0.1% (Campbell et al., 2011; Alonso-Saez et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2017b). Given the aims ofthis study, we mainly focused on the abundant and raretaxa, rather than intermediate taxa. Recently, a newmethod has been proposed for the de ﬁnition of abundantand rare taxa (Mo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a). While,our de ﬁnition might be more suitable for the present work,which concentrate more on the local level (i.e. in onesample). A kriging interpolation method in the ‘automap ’package of R was used to model spatial distributions ofOTU richness (Hiemstra et al., 2009). Maps were cross-validated using ‘autoKrige.cv ’. Predicted richness valueswere extracted for selected soil samples and correlatedwith the observed values from corresponding sites usinga Pearson correlation analysis.Phylogenetic analyses were performed in the ‘picante ’package in R (Kembel et al., 2010). To evaluate the phy-logenetic community assembly, we calculated the SES.MNTD using the null model ‘taxa.labels ’(999 randomiza-tion) in the‘ses.mntd ’function. Pairwise phylogeneticturnover between communities was calculated as theMNTD metric ( βMNTD) using the ‘comdistnt ’function(abundance.weighted = TRUE). The phylogenetic DDRwas calculated as the slope of an ordinary least-squaresregression between geographic distance and phyloge-netic community similarity (1 –βMNTD metric). Theimpact of environmental variables on β-diversity wasassessed using a distance-based linear model and for-ward selection procedure based on the βMNTD distancematrix by estimating the proportion of variance explained(R2). These results were displayed by CAP.We estimated the phylogenetic depths of environmen-tal responses for the abundant and rare bacterial sub-communities and their major phyla using Blomberg ’sK,calculated with the ‘multiPhylosignal ’function. TheseKvalues indicate how well the species is correlated withFig. 6.

The variations in phylogenetic and taxonomicdiversity were measured using null model-based phylo-genetic and taxonomic β-diversity metrics ( βNTI andBray –Curtis-based Raup –Crick, RC bray). The βNTI quan-tiﬁes the magnitude and direction of deviation betweenan observed βMNTD value and the null βMNTD distribu-tion. It also estimates the phylogenetic turnover given sto-chastic and deterministic ecological processes (Stegenet al ., 2012; Wang et al ., 2013; Dini-Andreote et al .,2015). A signi ﬁcant deviation (i.e. | βNTI| > 2) indicatesthe dominance of deterministic processes. βNTIvalues < −2 indicate signi ﬁcantly less phylogenetic turn-over than expected (i.e. homogeneous selection); mean-while, βNTI values > +2 indicate signi ﬁcantly morephylogenetic turnover than expected (i.e. variable selec-tion). The taxonomic β-diversity metric RCBraywas usedto analyse pairwise comparisons that were not assignedto deterministic processes (i.e. | βNTI| < 2). The relativeinﬂuence of homogeneous dispersal was quanti ﬁed asthe fraction of pairwise comparisons with | βNTI| < 2 andRC Bray<−0.95. The relative in ﬂuence of dispersal limita-tions was quanti ﬁed as the fraction of pairwise compari-sons with | βNTI| < 2 and RC Bray> 0.95. The fraction of allpairwise comparisons with | βNTI| < 2 and |RC Bray| < 0.95was used to estimate the in ﬂuence of the ‘non-dominant ’fraction (Zhou and Ning, 2017; Tripathi et al., 2018).To assess the relative in ﬂuence of assembly pro-cesses, we compared all possible pairwise comparisonsofβNTI values with each major environmental variable.The variation in community assembly processes alongthe gradients of the derived environmental variables (soilpH for the abundant sub-community and MAT for the raresub-community) was assessed using regression analysiscomparing βNTI values with the Euclidean distance matri-ces of these variables. The statistical signi ﬁcance ofthese comparisons was determined by Mantel tests with999 permutations. The same method was used to assessthe relationship between phylogenetic turnover and thederived environmental variables after controlling for spa-tial or other environmental variables distance. These ana-lyses were performed using the ‘mantel ’function of the‘ecodist ’package in R (Goslee and Urban, 2007). A neu-tral community model was used to determine contributionof neutral processes to bacterial community assembly bypredicting the relationship between the frequency of taxo-nomic occurrence in a set of local communities and theabundance of those taxa across the wider met-acommunity (Sloan et al., 2006).AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Science Founda-tion of China (41807030), the National Key Research andDevelopment Program of China (2016YFD0200306), theNational Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(BX201700005), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foun-dation (2018M630041).Availability of data and materialsThe raw sequence data reported in this paper have beendeposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (Genomics,Proteomics & Bioinformatics 2017) in Beijing Institute ofGenomics (BIG) Data Center (Nucleic Acids Research2018), BIG, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under acces-sion numbers PRJCA001121 that are publicly accessibleat http://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsaAuthor contributionsS.J. conceived and designed the experiments with thehelp of Y.L.; S.J. performed the experiments andanalysed the data.

The boxplots display the percent changes forabundant or rare taxa in one sample to abundant, intermedi-ate, rare, or not detected in other samples. For example, thepercentages of rare taxa in Sample 1 that become abundant,intermediate, remained rare, or were not detected in Sam-ples 2, through all samples are displayed.Fig. S2 General distribution patterns of abundant and rarebacteria in agricultural soils. (A)The proportion of the OTUsrichness ( ‘Richness ’) and relative abundance of abundantand rare taxa, compared to the whole bacterial community ineach sample. (B)Differences in OTUs richness and relativeabundance of abundant and rare taxa between maize andrice soils (***, P< 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Spatialdistributions of OTU richness of abundant (C)and rare (D)taxa were mapped using a kriging interpolation method.Cross-validation ( ‘CV ’) of the maps was based on Pearsoncorrelation between the predicted and observed values ineach sampling site. The Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient andP-value were shown in the maps.Fig. S3 Boxplot showing difference in SES.MNTD valuesbetween abundant and rare sub-communities (***,P< 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).Fig. S4 General beta-diversity patterns of abundant and rarebacteria in agricultural soils.
