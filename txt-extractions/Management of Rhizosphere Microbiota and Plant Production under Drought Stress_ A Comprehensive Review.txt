It includes the search for new water resources and the useof tolerant crops and genotypes, improved irrigation systems, and other less explored alternativesthat are very important, such as biotechnological tools that may increase the water use efÔ¨Åciency.Currently, a large body of evidence highlights the role of speciÔ¨Åc strains in the main microbialrhizosphere groups (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, yeasts, and bacteria) on increasing the droughttolerance of their host plants through diverse plant growth-promoting (PGP) characteristics. With thisbackground, it is possible to suggest that the joint use of distinct PGP microbes could produce positiveinteractions or additive beneÔ¨Åcial effects on their host plants if their co-inoculation does not generateantagonistic responses. To date, such effects have only been partially analyzed by using single omicstools, such as genomics, metabolomics, or proteomics. However, there is a gap of information in theuse of multi-omics approaches to detect interactions between PGP and host plants. This approachmust be the next scale-jump in the study of the interaction of soil‚Äìplant‚Äìmicroorganism. In thisreview, we analyzed the constraints posed by drought in the framework of an increasing globaldemand for plant production, integrating the important role played by the rhizosphere biota as a PGPagent. Using multi-omics approaches to understand in depth the processes that occur in plants in thepresence of microorganisms can allow us to modulate their combined use and drive it to increasecrop yields, improving production processes to attend the growing global demand for food.Keywords: arbuscular mycorrhizae; global climate change; PGP bacteria; PGP fungi; plant growthpromotion; rhizosphere engineering1. IntroductionProjections of agroclimatic models indicate a strong impact of global climate change(GCC), represented by both temperature increases of 0.5 to 2C by 2100 and a signiÔ¨Åcant de-crease in rainfall [ 1,2]. This change will undoubtedly promote a reconversion of agronomicpractices to produce the necessary food for a growing world population, both in volumeand requirements of high-quality products [ 3]. Regardless of the plant species cropped,agricultural production depends on a signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of water being supplied mainlyPlants 2022 ,11, 2437. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11182437 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plantsPlants 2022 ,11, 2437 2 of 19by rainfall, which has had a strong impact on the production of the last few seasons due toa marked mega-drought in many places around the world [1].Under this complex scenario, the availability of water sources for irrigation is also amajor structural problem, since the availability of adequate infrastructure to allow waterstorage is insufÔ¨Åcient to ensure access to water during periods of higher demand [ 4].Such constraints require the implementation of innovative agricultural approaches toincrease resilience to climate variability, such as the incorporation of new species to becropped. Additionally, lands where new crop species are chosen to be incorporated inmust be evaluated in terms of alternatives to increase the ‚Äúwater use efÔ¨Åciency‚Äù, togetherwith an increased plant tolerance to drought [ 5‚Äì8]. The above is a major challenge forglobal agricultural activity given the extent of the predicted climate change effects onagriculture [9].Consequently, one of the major questions to be answered under this complex paradigmis not how to access more water in the short‚Äìmedium term (that could only be answeredat the infrastructural level and in the long term) but how it would be possible to keep thecurrent yields of plant production with the scarce water availability, or even how to increasethem based on the projected demand. An alternative that has generated much interest inrecent years is the use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms as inoculants(biofertilizers) in agricultural plants [ 6,7,10,11]. The above is based on the numerousmicrobial strains that have developed tolerance to the environmental stresses in which theycommonly are exposed. This, together with the microbial fast growth and multiplicationrate, can generate a high abundance of some desirable traits in a very short time.Among the multiple PGP microbial groups, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungistand out because they establish strict mutualist symbiosis with most of the agriculturalplant species, mainly characterized by providing mineral nutrition (as P) and watertransport to the host plants [ 5,12,13]. Moreover, the development of biotechnologicaltools using AM fungi constitutes one of the most environmentally friendly alternativesto address the above-described constraints in a context of resilient agriculture [ 12,14‚Äì17].Additionally, other free-living microorganisms such as yeast and bacteria present diversePGP traits, which also support their use as biofertilizers. While their beneficial effects onplant growth have been extensively described, they also produce effects in plants thatcan be based on (or can promote) molecular, biochemical, and physiological changesthat are lesser known.Despite the increasing use of microbial inoculants from both monospeciÔ¨Åc isolatesand consortia of yeast and bacteria (for instance, [ 7,18]), some points need to be addressed,such as: (a) the basis by which such microorganisms generate beneÔ¨Åcial responses in plants;and (b) the multiple microbial or ‚Äúecological‚Äù interactions that may occur in the rhizo-sphere [19,20] . In the last case, it may not necessarily produce positive effects, being in somecases even negative [ 21]. Therefore, as a basis for the design of optimized bioinoculants, itis necessary to understand their degree of compatibility. This can be achieved by avoidingnegative interactions such as competition or predation and promoting commensalism andcooperation [ 22]. Finally, the microbial functionality in generating desirable responses inthe host plants will be registered as yield and food quality increases.There are previous experiences that link, at the molecular level, the responses ofplants to inoculation with certain PGP microorganisms [ 11,23,24]. Meanwhile, to thebest of our knowledge, there are no systematized works to develop microbial consortiaengineered to different hosts, including microbe‚Äìmicrobe interactions + PGP traits + shiftsin plant mechanisms, to develop optimized biofertilizers for a speciÔ¨Åc plant species. Incontrast, it is commonly concluded that the effects observed by the inoculation with a PGPmicroorganism in a model plant could easily be transferred to other species without a deepunderstanding of the physiological, biochemical, or molecular changes in the host plant(regarding the uninoculated plant) [7,10].Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 3 of 19The above scenario generates double uncertainty: (i) whether the inoculant can bebeneÔ¨Åcial to more than one host plant species; (ii) whether the plant responses can bemechanistically equivalent between different host plants using the same inoculant. Cur-rently, the multiple soil‚Äìmicroorganism‚Äìplant interactions represent an unexplored ‚Äúblackbox‚Äù. Much less effort has been put into the validation at the Ô¨Åeld level of an inoculant‚Äôseffectiveness beyond the argued socially friendly decrease in the use of chemical inputs, ascommonly advertised by marketing agricultural companies.Against this scenario, the current ‚Äúomics‚Äù tools emerge as an attainable alternative toclarify ‚Äúwhat is happening in this black box‚Äù, allowing us to describe and predict behaviorsin plants based on powerful genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic tools.Therefore, with this focused review, we hoped to summarize the current and updatedknowledge regarding the role of microbial tools used as bioinoculants to improve the plantproduction. In addition, we highlight the projections based on the use of single-omicsplatforms and multi-omics approaches. With this, our aim was to elucidate the mechanismsthat explain the improvements in yield and food quality under drought stress, as one themain sensible effects of climate change in agriculture.2. The Drought as Main Constraint for Plant Production in a Global ClimateChange ScenarioAgriculture meets our food demands (food security), being the main practice thatcontributes to the economy in many countries worldwide. However, the intensiÔ¨Åcationof agriculture has also led to the degradation and exhaustion of soils; moreover, about38% of suitable agricultural lands around the world have been degraded by inadequatemanagement practices [ 25,26]. Supplying the increasing world population with sufÔ¨Åcientfood is mandatory. Because of this, food security is the most important challenge inthe21st century . However, nowadays, food security is strongly threatened by globalwarming [27].Global warming and associated climate change not only affect air temperature butalso inÔ¨Çuence the amount and distribution of rainfall [ 28]. Predictive models of GCC haveshown that the frequency of precipitation events and net volumes have drastically changedduring the past one hundred years. It has caused frequent and severe periods of drought inlarge areas around the world [29].The agricultural sector is responsible for about 75% of the total global consumptionof water [ 30]. However, in the wake of GCC, drought has emerged as one of the majorabiotic stresses and is considered the strongest environmental stress that limits the plantgrowth, reducing crop productivity [ 31,32]. Due to the droughts, yield reductions havebeen reported in the order of 21 to 40%, from 1980 to 2015, for wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) andmaize ( Zea mays ) productions, two of the most important crops worldwide [ 33]. Moreover,considering that among 80‚Äì95% of the fresh weight of plants consists of water, it is evidentthat drought stress leads to changes on a multidimensional level, modifying differentphysiological, biochemical, molecular, and morphological processes in plants [34‚Äì36].The responses of plants to water stress depend on the length and severity of the waterdeÔ¨Åciency [ 37]. Many plants have developed mechanisms to tolerate water stress, butthese mechanisms are varied and depend on the plant species. Included among themare developmental, physiological, morphological, ecological, biochemical and molecularmechanisms [ 38]. Mainly, the mechanisms involved in plant tolerance to drought are basedon maintaining cell water homeostasis under drought conditions, allowing diminishedwater loss and increasing the water inlet to the plants [39].To improve plant responses against the water stress, different approaches are currentlybeing studied, such as traditional breeding methods, transgenic technology, and primingmethods, among others. However, because of the complexity of drought effects on plantsand the speciÔ¨Åc responses of plants to the water stress, each method has some problemsand limitations [40‚Äì42].Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 4 of 19In addition, the role of root-associated microbial communities able to improve plantdrought tolerance has only been explored in recent years [ 43]. In this way, different studieshave reported that beneÔ¨Åcial soil microorganisms improve plant tolerance to abiotic stressesby producing a root‚Äîsoil interface that directly or indirectly enhances the absorption ofwater and nutrients. The most important groups of microorganisms related to increasedtolerance to water scarcity include the PGP rhizobacteria and AM fungi [5].3. Rhizosphere Microbial Groups and Ecological Roles for Plant Production underDrought ConditionsCurrently, due to the importance of the functions that soil provides, it is widelyrecognized that soil represents one of the main frontiers of science. The functions that soilprovides strongly determine the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, both natural andagricultural-modiÔ¨Åed ones [ 44,45]. The sustainable development of agriculture is mediatedby biotic and abiotic factors, the rhizosphere being an environment that can be consideredthe common point shared by both factors. The health of the rhizosphere matrix is closelyrelated to the state of its present PGP microbial communities [46].In this ecological niche, factors such as the availability of oxygen, nutrients (C:N:P ra-tio) and water modulate a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the total interactions in the rhizosphere [ 47].In addition, in this volume of soil, it is possible to Ô¨Ånd exudates from plant roots (rhizode-posits), which are considered an essential component of the rhizosphere [ 48,49]. Thepresence or absence of rhizodeposits can signiÔ¨Åcantly affect rhizosphere interactions sincethey fulÔ¨Åll signaling functions to give way to the symbiotic association between the plantand PGP microorganisms [50].Another fundamental characteristic in the ecology of the rhizosphere is the restrictioninteractions of microorganisms. It has the characteristic of restricting other microorganismsfrom interacting with the plant (e.g., plant pathogen microorganisms). This converts therhizosphere into a bridge of chemical communication between the plant and the PGPmicroorganisms for the formation of protective microbial bioÔ¨Ålms, acting as biocontrolagents in both the defense and resistance process of the host plant [51].The rhizosphere comprises a complex and dynamic microenvironment, with medi-ating characteristics in the selection of organisms that interact with the host plant. Therhizosphere can be understood as a holobiont assemblage, which is formed by the associa-tion of a host and its microbial communities [ 52,53]. The holobiont impacts the stability,adaptation and evolution of the organisms involved in the assemblage [54].Under stress conditions, such as drought, salt, and poor nutrient availability, theproper functioning of the holobiont is essential for the development and growth of plants,and thus, for improving their tolerance and nutrient-obtaining capacities [ 55]. In sum-mary, the ecological relationship between the rhizosphere and the characteristics of PGPmicroorganisms is essential for the growth, nutrition, and quality of crops, both underfavorable and stress conditions. This importance is reÔ¨Çected even more in a context ofclimate change, where interactions at the rhizosphere level play a fundamental role in thehealth of crops [ 56], carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and rhizosphere ecosystemfunctioning [57,58].Plants are closely associated with soil microorganisms both externally and internallyin various ways [ 59]. Numerous works have demonstrated the important role playedby rhizosphere microorganisms in plant growth, highlighting those with PGP capacity(Figure 1). These PGP traits have been evidenced in several studies using different rhizo-sphere microorganisms (Tables 1 and 2). PGP microorganisms, in addition to beneÔ¨Åtingplant growth, are also characterized by having the ability to produce hormones and lyticenzymes, showing a promising use as bioinoculants [ 60]. Some microorganisms are alsoinvolved in the production of secondary metabolites, thus promoting carbon sequestration,nitrogen Ô¨Åxation, and phosphorus solubilization in the rhizosphere [61,62].Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 5 of 19Plants 2022 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 20    Figure 1. Generalized  representation of the main effects of plant growth -promoting (PGP) traits on cropped plants under drought conditions as the basis for the design of optimized biofertilizers. Pos-sible effects of PGP microorganisms on plants are shown with + /‚àí since such effects might be posi-tive or negative.  PGP microorganisms (fungi, yeasts, and bacteria) are present in the soil and can con-tribute to maintain ing or enhanc ing soil health, improving plant growth, inducing sys-temic resistance in plants , and increasing stress tolerance against different unfavorable environmental conditions, both biotic and abiotic [63]. Several works have described these PGP attributes, emphasizi ng mainly their ability to: (i) ensure greater nutrient availability for plants [64], (ii) stimulate changes in their root structure [13], (iii) promote the estab-lishment and growth of plants under conditions of abiotic stress (e.g., potentially toxic elem ents, salinity, and drought) [5,12,65‚Äì67], or (iv) help with the control of phytopatho-gens [68].  Studies looking for beneficial microorganisms have typically used various character-istics to assess their PGP capacity, such as the microbial production of 1 -aminocyclopro-pane -1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, siderophores, indole -3-acetic acid (IAA), and en-zymes for the solubilization of nutrients (mainly phosphates) [6,7,14,69,70] . In addition, certain microbes (e.g. , some bacteria and yeast) can potentially miti gate the phytotoxic effects by producing organic acids and extracellular polymeric substances, such as exopol-ysaccharides (EPS s). Additionally , AM fungi contribute with this through the production of glomalin, which is a fungal glycoprotein  [18,71‚Äì75]. All the above beneficial traits are normally observed at rhizosphere level, with scarce reports that include the effects on host plants. The use of PGP microbes has been analyzed through effects on plants such as: (i) improvements in photosynthetic variables [7,8,76,77] , (ii) biofortification of plants with essential [78,79] and beneficial nutrients [19,20], (iii) modification of antioxidant responses [66,80], and (iv) changes in secondary metabolite profiles [81‚Äì83], among others.

In this sense, microorganismsPlants 2022 ,11, 2437 6 of 19with PGP capabilities have been shown to promote plant growth under water deÔ¨Åcit stressconditions, suggesting that they are naturally acclimatized to the stressed environment [ 84].Bacteria with PGP attributes, for instance, are key soil components able to establishbeneÔ¨Åcial associations with plants [ 46]. Additionally, bacteria are the most studied groupof microorganisms under drought stress conditions, including the genera Acinetobacter ,Azospirillum ,Azotobacter ,Arthrobacter ,Bacillus ,Beijerinckia ,Brevundimonas ,Burkholderia ,Clostridium ,Delftia ,Duganella ,Erwinia ,Enterobacter ,Flavobacterium ,Hydrogenophaga ,Methy-lobacterium ,Paenibacillus ,Pantoea ,Proteus ,Providencia ,Pseudomonas ,Psychrobacter ,Rhizobium ,Serratia ,Stenotrophomonas ,Streptoccoccus , and Streptomyces [85‚Äì89].In order to enhance plant growth, the most common effect of bacteria on plantsexposed to drought conditions is the improvement in the antioxidant plant responses,reducing the cell damage (mainly in membranes) and alleviating their status of stress(Table 1).Table 1.

AMfungi are an obligate biotroph that depend on living root tissue for carbohydrate supply,which allows them to complete their life cycle [ 101]. AM fungal colonization on plantroots occurs when its hyphae penetrate the epidermis and grow extensively between andwithin living cortical cells, forming a very large and dynamic interface between bothsymbionts. It enhances plant growth and yield and also decreases the effects of severalabiotic stresses [102].This obligate symbiosis can promote the formation of stable aggregates and im-prove water storage in the soil through the production of glomalin, which is releasedin large amounts into the soil [ 5,75,103]. Moreover, the formation of AM symbiosiscan change the efficiency of water uptake by modifying the ionic balances (Na/K) inthe host plant, as well as modifying the relative expression of PIP aquaporin and ionicNHX antiporter genes under osmotic stress [ 5,104]. New reports using AM fungi inassociation with other PGP microorganisms have also shown a beneficial (synergic oradditive) effect on plant growth and development when established in water-scarceenvironments (Table 2).Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 8 of 19Table 2.

However, there are fewer studies compared to the groups described above, mainlyincluding some works exploring its PGP attributes under water stress conditions. Forinstance, Silambarasan et al. [ 7,18] demonstrated the ability of EPS produced by yeasts topromote the formation of stable aggregates and improve the storage of water in soil.Furthermore, recent evidence showed that yeast application can upregulate soil en-zymes under drought stress conditions, which increased the nutrient content in the soil,also improving the osmotic state of roots and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in theplants treated with the strains [ 63]. PGP microorganisms are undoubtedly a key element forthe adaptation of plants to new unfavorable environmental scenarios. Deepening studiesoriented to evaluate the interspecies synergistic potential of PGP microorganisms in thecurrent framework of climate change are required.4. The ‚ÄúOmics‚Äù Approaches and the Development of Optimized BioinoculantsAs stated above, the use of microorganism for improved drought tolerance has shownpromising results in different crops [ 120,121]. In this sense, rhizosphere engineering (modiÔ¨Å-cation in the microbial rhizosphere community by known PGP microorganisms) representsa faster and more advantageous alternative to improve drought tolerance in crops thanother tools, such as genetic engineering or genetic improvement [122].The interaction of the newly added microorganisms with the rhizosphere is the Ô¨Årstbarrier to overpass to establish a relation with the already naturally present microbiome,and in the better situation, form a mutualistic and cooperative relationship [ 22,123]. Then,the newly formed microbiome interacts with the plant root and may produce an increase inthe physiological traits that allow the plant to confront the drought stress.Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 10 of 19This promotes, for instance, the formation of lateral roots [ 124], generates increases inhormone levels (ABA, cytokinin, and gibberellin) associated with increases in the watercontent and the hydric status of plant organs [ 125‚Äì127], improves the expression of osmoticadjustment systems (proline), and promotes the production of antioxidant enzymes [ 128],among others.However, a negative effect on the plant growth and development is also a possibil-ity [129]. The way how this microbial community increases the tolerance to abiotic stressis not completely understood yet. This gap in information is due to the complex mediawhere microbial communities are developing, which is the most complex compartmenton the Earth‚Äôs surface [ 24]. In this sense, understanding the interaction among microbialcommunities, plants, and the biotic and abiotic factors is an essential step to improve thedesign of bioinoculants [130,131].A modern approach to study this interaction is the use of ‚ÄúOmics‚Äù technologies, whichare also being applied in microbial science (Table 3). This set of new techniques allows tointegrate the information of genome, proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome and givesinformation about the biological changes that underlie the drought tolerance produced byadvanced bioinoculants [24,132].Table 3.

The usual workÔ¨Çowto determine a metabolic proÔ¨Åle starts with sample acquisition, sample preparation, dataacquisition, bioinformatic analysis, and biochemical interpretation [140].The widely used techniques for separating and determining the metabolic proÔ¨Ålefrom different microorganisms are based on thin-layer chromatography (TLC), columnchromatography (CC), Ô¨Çash chromatography (FC), gas chromatography coupled to massspectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chro-matography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS and LC-MS/MS), liquid chromatogra-phy with ultraviolet, visible, Ô¨Çuorescence, or diode array detection (LC-UV-VIS, LC-FD, orLC-DAD), gas‚Äìliquid chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), near-infrared(NIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies [140,141].For example, the application of the metabolomics approach in the study of droughtcondition in the root of the trifoliate orange and the interaction with the AM fungusRhizophagus intraradices showed a total of 88 and 17 metabolites upregulated and down-regulated, respectively, also showing an improvement in the physiological status of themycorrhized plants [ 142]. In the same way, the use of metabolomics tools in the applicationof a consortium of Bacillus subtilis ,B. thuringiensis , and B. megaterium in chickpea showed anaccumulation of riboÔ¨Çavin, L-asparagine, aspartate, glycerol, nicotinamide, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutarate under drought condition, together with the reduction in the deleteriousimpact on the plant status [143].On the other hand, proteomics is the use of different technics that allows to determinethe complete contents of the different proteins present in an organism under speciÔ¨Åc cir-cumstances [ 144]. Proteomics analysis can be used in certain ways, such as for translationalproteomics, protein‚Äìprotein interaction, post-translational modiÔ¨Åcation, and proteomicsstudies at a comparative level for the comparison of protein proÔ¨Åles, including droughtstress [141].The typical workÔ¨Çow of proteomics analysis starts with the extraction of proteins in aplant tissue of interest, digestion of proteins with speciÔ¨Åc enzymes into peptides and identi-Ô¨Åcation of resulting peptides by mass spectrometry, quantiÔ¨Åcation of protein expression,and determination of post-translational modiÔ¨Åcations [ 145]. The widely used techniquesused for the study of proteomes include 1D and 2D gel electrophoresis, followed by massspectrometry with different ionization sources. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-Ô¨Çight (MALDI-TOF MS/MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI) are the main massspectrometry tools used in proteomics approaches [141].With the use of proteomics approaches, it was possible to Ô¨Ånd in pepper plantsinoculated with B. licheniformis K11 a total of 15 differential expressed proteins that confertolerance to drought stress [ 145]. Similar results were observed for the inoculation ofRhizobium leguminosarum and Pseudomonas putida toVicia faba , which produced changes inthe proteomic proÔ¨Åle with an improvement in the tolerance to drought stress [145].Genomics is the study of all genes present in an organism with the respective identiÔ¨Å-cation of sequences, intragenic sequences, and genes structures [ 145]; meanwhile, transcrip-tomics is focused on the determination of the RNA present in the speciÔ¨Åc organs, which ishighly dependent on the speciÔ¨Åc environmental condition that makes the transcriptomichighly variable [ 146]. In this sense, the study of genomics allows to know the potential ofmicroorganisms to produce secondary metabolites or proteins to enhance the growth anddevelopment of drought tolerance with plant interaction.Furthermore, transcriptomics allows to determine how this genomic potential isexpressed under speciÔ¨Åc circumstances. In both cases, the starting point is the extraction ofthe nucleic acid, but for RNA, it is necessary to synthesize the cDNA and then sequenceit in a next-generation sequencing platform [ 141]. The use of the integrated genomic andtranscriptomic approach showed that some colonization genes such as FixL/FixK/FixJand NodD were upregulated in the presence of beneÔ¨Åcial microorganisms [ 147]. Moreover,Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 12 of 19there are several types of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with the fullgenome assembly, which previously have shown an improvement in the plant tolerance todrought stress, such as B. amyloliquefaciens [148],Serratia plymuthica [149],Hartmannibacterdiazotrophicus [150], and Rhizophagus irregularis [151].The omics approaches still have important bottlenecks, such as the need of different,focused, and specialized researchers; and the gap in both information and integrationof data available in the worldwide databases (e.g., one-stop shop) [ 152]. Currently, dataintegration can be performed post-analysis by performing ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù after individualanalyses [ 153] or carrying out an integrated data analysis in parallel. This last one requiresspecialized tools to merge data from different platforms prior to the Ô¨Ånal interpretations ofthe results [ 132,154]. For instance, MetaboAnalyst allows for multiple integration of themetabolome, transcriptome, proteome, and genome into a wide spectrum of biologicalsamples, including plants [ 155], as well as data processing and statistical analyses based onthe R platform [132].Undoubtedly, the research possibilities with the incorporation of multi-omics ap-proaches will be a strong basis for the functional interpretation of the effects that advancedbiofertilizers have on their host plants. Based on the strong progress that these approacheshave had in other sciences (mainly medicine and human health), it is feasible to state thatthey may represent the starting point for the design of optimized biofertilizers in a widerange of plant species of agricultural and environmental interest.5. Perspectives and ConclusionsAs stated above, a large body of evidence highlights the role of speciÔ¨Åc microbialstrains within the main rhizosphere microbial groups in conferring drought tolerance toplants. However, much less known are the physiological, molecular, and biochemicalmechanisms and responses displayed by plants as a consequence of the presence and actionof these PGP microorganisms.In the case of yeasts, these microorganisms have very interesting PGP characteristicsthat have not been widely reported, especially regarding water stress. Nevertheless, recentstudies have demonstrated their great potential as coadjutants in plant growth to cope withother abiotic stresses. Such evidence makes us presume that yeasts can be a key elementwith a great biotechnological value that needs to be explored as a tool to face the foodshortage that promises to be accentuated with the advance of GCC.Therefore, the next steps for the designing of biofertilizers supported by the use ofmulti-omics approaches could represent a signiÔ¨Åcant leap in the research regarding therole of rhizosphere microbial communities in plant production under drought conditions.In this sense, the integration of omics platforms will strongly support the mechanisticunderstanding that underlies the use of beneÔ¨Åcial microorganisms in plant productionthrough rhizosphere engineering.While it is necessary to realistically recognize that the tangible results could primarilybe framed at the local level, considering particular soil conditions, rhizospheres, andcrop plants, the research at the pilot scale will establish the basis for the generation andmassiÔ¨Åcation of optimized biofertilizers. However, some considerations must be addressed,as the development of local biological collections for the ex situ maintenance of PGPmicrobes able to enhance drought tolerance represents a valuable resource for testing theirapplicability in different crops, in line with the global advice for the maintenance of geneticresources oriented to agriculture and food production [156].Moreover, the projection of the fundamental and mechanistic bases studied in theplant, considering different efÔ¨Åcient rhizosphere modiÔ¨Åcations, can also be focused ondifferent types of environmental stress, such as the low availability of nutrients, salinity,heavy metals, extreme pH values, and many other environmental and soil constraints thatcurrently affect enormous areas of arable land surfaces worldwide.Plants 2022 ,11, 2437 13 of 19Author Contributions: Conceptualization, C.V . and P .C.; investigation, C.V ., C.S.
