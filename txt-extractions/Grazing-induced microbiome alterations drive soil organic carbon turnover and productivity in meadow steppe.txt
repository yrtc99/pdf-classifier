RESEARCH Open AccessGrazing-induced microbiome alterationsdrive soil organic carbon turnover andproductivity in meadow steppeWeibing Xun1,2, Ruirui Yan3, Yi Ren1, Dongyan Jin3, Wu Xiong1, Guishan Zhang2, Zhongli Cui1, Xiaoping Xin3*†and Ruifu Zhang1,2* †AbstractBackground: Grazing is a major modulator of biodiversity and productivity in grasslands. However, our understandingof grazing-induced changes in below-ground communities, processes, and soil productivity is limited. Here, using along-term enclosed grazing meadow steppe, we investigated the impacts of grazing on the soil organic carbon (SOC)turnover, the microbial community composition, resistance and activity under seasonal changes, and the microbialcontributions to soil productivity.Results: The results demonstrated that grazing had significant impacts on soil microbial communities and ecosystemfunctions in meadow steppe. The highest microbial α-diversity was observed under light grazing intensity, while thehighest β-diversity was observed under moderate grazing intensity. Grazing shifted the microbial composition fromfungi dominated to bacteria dominated and from slow growing to fast growing, thereby resulting in a shift fromfungi-dominated food webs primarily utilizing recalcitrant SOC to bacteria-dominated food webs mainly utilizinglabile SOC. Moreover, the higher fungal recalcitrant-SOC-dec omposing activities and bacterial labile-SOC-decomposingactivities were observed in fungi- and bac teria-dominated communiti es, respectively. Notably, the robustness of bacterialcommunity and the stability of bacter ial activity were associated with α-diversity, while this was not the case for therobustness of fungal community an d its associated activities. Finally, we observed that microbial α-diversity rather thanSOC turnover rate can predict soil productivity.Conclusions: Our findings indicate the strong influence of grazing on soil microbial community, SOC turnover, and soilproductivity and the important positive role of soil microbial α-diversity in steering the functions of meadow steppeecosystems.Keywords: Temperate meadow steppe, Cattle grazing, Microbial composition, Soil incubation, SOC-decompositionenzymatic activity, Soil productivity* Correspondence: xinxiaoping@caas.cn ;rfzhang@njau.edu.cn†Xiaoping Xin and Ruifu Zhang contributed equally to this work.3National Hulunber Grassland Ecosystem Observation and Research Station,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academyof Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China1Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, NationalEngineering Research Center for Organic-based Fertilizers, JiangsuCollaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waste Resource Utilization,Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0International License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link tothe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-018-0544-yBackgroundGrazing by livestock is one of the most extensive landuses and occupies more than one third of the global landarea [ 1]. Overgrazing has been reported to reduce floristicdiversity and biomass and is probably the most pervasiveand significant process of degradation in grasslands [ 2].The importance of floristic diversity in driving the prod-uctivity and other ecosystem functions has been demon-strated by many studies [ 3,4]. However, the importance offloristic diversity has been questioned recently [ 5,6]. Someof these queries suggest that the productivity of many ter-restrial ecosystems depends on the availability of resources[7–9]. In particular, soil microbes are important compo-nents in maintaining ecosystem functions and enhancesoil productivity due to their critical roles, including litterdecomposition, biogeochemical nutrient cycling, soil ag-glomeration, and fertility promotion [ 10–12]. Therefore, itis important to promote the transition from above-groundstudies to below-ground ones to increase our under-standing of the soil microbial behaviors. These studiesmay provide ecologists with insights into the seeminglydivergent results observed above the ground. To date,although some investigations have studied top-down in-teractions [ 13–15], our knowledge of the mechanismsby which soil microbial communities and ecosystemsfunction to maintain soil productivity is limited, espe-cially the grazing-induced changes in below-groundcommunities [ 16].It has been well established that both the compositionand functional capabilities of soil microbial communitycan be strongly influenced by environmental variablessuch as climate [ 17], vegetation [ 18], and soil conditions[19]. In steppe ecosystems, grazing is a key regulatorthat can directly or indirectly affect the abovementionedenvironmental variables [ 20,21] and then affect the diver-sity and composition of soil microbial community [ 22],resulting in the alteration of the functional performanceand nutrient provision patterns in soil [ 23]. Indeed, somestudies have demonstrated that grazing has a significanteffect on soil microbial community and on soil carbon (C)and nitrogen (N) availability [ 24–26]. It has also beensuggested that different grazing intensities may alterthe distribution of soil bacteria and fungi and affect soilrespiration [ 27,28]. Despite these findings, few studieshave been conducted on the effect of grazing on below-ground microbial community and on the C sequestra-tion capacity and productivity of soil in grassland eco-systems [ 29,30]. Therefore, these integrated top-downand bottom-up interactions need to be further investigated.The Inner Mongolian grassland is an important com-ponent of the Eurasian grassland, and the grassland ofHulunber, which is at the east edge of Eurasian grass-land, is the most representative temperate meadowsteppe, with high soil fertility and biodiversity [ 31]; thisgrassland can undergo a loss of species under high graz-ing intensity and is favorable for our research. Therefore,to explore the impacts of grazing on soil microbial com-munity and consequent on soil productivity, a long-termgrazing-intensity-gradient experiment was established in2009 at the Hulunber Grassland Ecosystem ResearchStation (HGERS) of the Chinese Academy of AgriculturalSciences (CAAS) in Hulunber, Inner Mongolia, China.16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of therRNA gene amplicon sequencing were performed toevaluate the structure of soil microbial community. Avariety of SOC-decomposing enzymatic activities wereperformed to evaluate the microbial activity on SOCturnover. The objectives of this study were to investi-gate grazing-induced changes in the composition, di-versity, activity, and stability of soil microbial communityand to study the microbial contributions to SOC turnoverand productivity.MethodsStudy designThe experimental site was located at the HulunberGrassland Ecosystem Research Station (HGERS) of theChinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) (119°94′~119°96 ′E, 49°32 ′~49°34 ′N) in Hulunber, InnerMongolia, China. The soil at the station is kastanozemsaccording to FAO/Unesco System of Soil Classification.This region covers a semi-arid continental climate witha mean annual temperature range of almost −3 °C andannual precipitation range of 350~400 mm. The vegeta-tion in this region is characterized as typical meadowsteppe. Leymus chinensis ,Stipa baicalensis ,Carex dur-iuscula ,Galium verum ,Bupleurum scorzonerifolium ,and Filifolium sibiricum are the dominant plant species.This grassland was subjected to six levels of cattle graz-ing intensity in a randomized complete block design(Additional file 1: Figure S1). Four of these six grazingintensities with 0.00, 0.42, 0.83, and 1.67 cattle ha−1, cor-responding to 0, 2, 4, and 8 cattle per plot, were selectedfor this study, and these grazing intensities were desig-nated G0, G2, G4, and G8, respectively. All these siteshave been used as summer pastures, with a grazing periodfrom June to September, since 2009. Rest grazing beginsin October and ends in May of the following year.Soil sample collection and analysisSoil samples were collected in June (designated J0, J2, J4,and J8 for soil samples collected from treatments G0,G2, G4, and G8, respectively) and August (designatedA0, A2, A4, and A8 for soil samples collected from treat-ments G0, G2, G4, and G8, respectively) of 2015. Toallow the detection of both α- and β-diversity, a nestedsampling approach was established [ 32] in which allsampling sites were located on concentric circles withXun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 2 of 13radii of 150 m, 15 m, 1.5 m, and 0.15 m in a plot. Withthis sampling strategy, a total of 17 samples were col-lected from each plot (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Soilsamples were obtained from the upper 20 cm (the litterlayer was removed) of the plots in soil cores with diame-ters of 10 cm. All samples were sieved, homogenized, andsubdivided using standard methods. Soils for measuringphysiochemical properties were air-dried, soils for mo-lecular analyses were stored at −80 °C until extraction ofdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and soils for establishingmicrocosms were stored at room temperature. The ed-aphic properties of all soil samples were evaluated at theQiyang Red Soil Experimental Station of the CAAS, andthe detailed methods used were described previously [ 33].Microcosm incubationIn this field experiment, different grazing intensities resultin different plant coverage, which leads to differences in thesoil water content of the plots (Additional file 3:T a b l eS 1 )and influences the soil temperature. The water content andtemperature of soil are important factors affecting C de-composition in soil. Thus, given the grazing-induced differ-ences in water content and temperature conditions in situand to provide an accurate assessment of the effects ofgrazing on the potential SOC decomposition rate, we estab-lished soil microcosms and incubated these microcosmsunder different water content and temperature conditions.The water content of G0 (22%) was defined as 100% of thefield water content; 75% and 50% field water contents werechosen for moisture perturban ce. A temperature gradient(24 °C, 33 °C, and 42 °C, which is consistent with changesin temperature between June and August) was used fortemperature perturbance.Soil microcosms were prepared as described by Xun etal. [33]. Eighteen replicate microcosms were establishedfor each soil sample (thus, we have 18 microcosm repli-cates × 17 soil samples × 3 plot replicates = 918 micro-cosms for each grazing intensity), and each microcosmwas constructed by placing 150 g of fresh soil into a250-mL bottle. Sterile water was added to maintain themoisture level at 100% of the field water content, andthe microcosms were preincubated at 24 °C in the dark.After preincubation for 1 week, 16 of these 18 replicatemicrocosms were randomly chosen for moisture and/ortemperature perturbance testing, while the remaining 2microcosms were incubated as before (control, no per-turbance, moisture at 100% of the field water content,and temperature of 24 °C). The detailed incubation con-ditions are described in Additional file 4: Table S2. Theincubation process lasted for 2 months.Enzymatic activity analysesThe following enzyme activity assays were conducted: (i)the activities of invertase (EC 3.2.1.26), maltase (EC3.2.1.20), amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8), cel-lulose (EC 3.2.1.4), and pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) weremeasured using the 3,5-dinitro-salicylic acid colorimetricmethod with sucrose, methyl polyglycoside, starch, xy-lan, carboxymethylcellulose and pectin as substrates, re-spectively; (ii) the activity of β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21)was measured using an improved colorimetric method[34] with p-nitrophenyl glycoside as the substrate.DNA extraction, qPCR, and amplicon sequencingTotal DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of soil using aPowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.,Carlsbad, CA, USA). To minimize the DNA extractionbias, three successive DNA extractions of each soil sam-ple were pooled before performing polymerase chain re-action (PCR). A NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer(NanoDrop, ND2000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington,USA) was used to assess DNA quality on the basis ofthe 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm absorbance ratios. Ex-tracted DNA was stored at −20 °C until use.Bacterial and fungal abundances were determined byquantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using the Power SYBRGreen PCR Master MIX (Biosystems, Warrington, UK)on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosys-tems, CA, USA). The following primer sets were used:F347 (5 ′-GGAGGCAGCAGTRRGGAAT-3 ′) and R531(5′-CTNYGTMTTACCGCGGCTGC-3 ′)( 1 9 4b p )f o rbacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance and FungF (5 ′-GTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTC-3 ′)a n dF u n g R( 5 ′-ATTCCCCGTTACCCGTTG-3 ′) (346 bp) for fungal 18S rRNAgene abundance.The V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNAgene was amplified using the primers 515F (5 ′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 ′) and 806R (5 ′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3 ′) to assess bacterial communi-ties. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of therRNA gene of fungi was amplified using the primersITS3 (5 ′-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3 ′) and ITS4(5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3 ′) to assess fungalcommunities. The PCR amplicons were combined inequimolar ratios, and sequencing was conducted by BionBiotechnology Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China) on an IlluminaMiSeq platform with separate sequencing runs for the 16Sand ITS rRNA gene amplicon pools. The sequencing datawere processed using the UPARSE pipeline ( http://drive5.com/usearch/manual/uparse_pipeline.html )[35]. The rawsequences were subjected to quality control. The singletonand chimeric sequences were removed after dereplication,and the remaining sequences were categorized into oper-ational taxonomic units (OTU) with 97% similarity andthen assigned taxonomy using the Silva database (Release128) ( https://www.arb-silva.de/ ) and the UNITE database(Release date: August 2016) ( https://unite.ut.ee/ )f o rt h e16S and ITS rRNA genes, respectively. The 16S and ITSXun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 3 of 13rRNA gene sequences are available at the NCBI SequenceRead Archive under the accession numbers SRP117970and SRP119882.Data analysesThe sequencing data were analyzed as follows: (i) thepercentage of each taxonomy was designated the relativeabundance, (ii) taxonomic α-diversity was calculated asthe OTU richness and Shannon diversity of a singlesample site, (iii) taxonomic γ-diversity was calculated asthe OTU richness of an experimental plot, and (iv)β-diversity (phylogenetic community dissimilarity) wascalculated using FastUnifrac [ 36]. Duncan ’s multiplecomparison test was used to calculate the statistical sig-nificance among samples. Tukey ’s HSD test was used tocalculate the statistical significance between two sam-ples. Correlations were calculated using Mantel tests andSpearman correlations. All statistical analyses were per-formed with the Vegan package (v.2.4-1) [ 37] in R soft-ware (version 3.3.2).ResultsIntensification of grazing triggers fast-growing andbacteria-dominated communitiesGrazing had a significant impact on soil bacterial andfungal abundance, whereas the seasonal changes did not.The bacterial abundance was consistently higher in G2and G4 and lower in G8 (Fig. 1a). However, the fungalabundance was highest in G0 and decreased with in-creasing grazing intensity (Fig. 1b). Overgrazing (G8) ledto significant reductions in both bacterial and fungalabundance. When the bacteria/fungi ratios were calcu-lated, we observed that higher bacteria/fungi ratios wereassociated with higher grazing intensities, indicating thatbacteria become prevalent with increasing grazing inten-sity (Fig. 1c).Our sequencing results indicated significant differ-ences in the bacterial and fungal communities respond-ing to cattle grazing. The strongest distinctions wereobserved between the below-moderate (G0 and G2) andmoderate-to-high (G4 and G8) grazing intensities. Withregard to soil bacteria (Additional file 5: Figure S3A),most slow-growing bacteria of the phyla Acidobacteria ,Chloroflexi ,Planctomycetes ,a n d Verrucomicrobia weremore abundant in G0 and G2. However, mostfast-growing bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes ,Firmi-cutes ,Nitrospira ,a n d Proteobacteria were more abun-dant in G4 and G8. For soil fungi (Additional file 5:Figure S3B), the most abundant fungal phyla were Asco-mycota ,Basidiomycota ,Glomeromycota , and Zygomy-cota. Among them, Ascomycota was the most prevalentphylum, with a relative abundance ranging from 80.6 to89.9%. Moreover, the identified classes from the phylaGlomeromycota and Zygomycota and several classes be-longing to Ascomycota (Geoglossomycetes ,Pezizomycetes ,Sordariomycetes , etc.) were more abundant in G0 andG2. Notably, seasonal changes had less impact on micro-bial composition than grazing.Grazing affects the diversity and robustness of microbialcommunitiesSoil microbial diversity was estimated using α-diversity(species richness at sample site level), γ-diversity (speciesrichness at plot level), and β-diversity (the communitydifferentiation among sample sites in one plot) simultan-eously. First, light grazing intensity (G2) resulted in thehighest soil microbial α-diversity, while high grazing in-tensity (G8) resulted in the lowest α-diversity, the signifi-cance of which is indicated by the Shannon index(Fig. 2a) and OTU richness (Additional file 6: FigureS4A) of the samples. Meanwhile, the sites with moderategrazing intensity (G4) possessed the same level of micro-bial α-diversity as G0. Second, microbial γ-diversity(Additional file 6: Figure S4B) was observed to be thehighest in G2 and the lowest in G8. However, G4 had thesame level of species richness as G2 at plot level. Third,theβ-diversity of the microbial communities were calcu-lated using the unweighted (Additional file 6: Figure S4C)and weighted (Additional file 6: Figure S4D) Unifracdistances, and the communities of G4 showed thegreatest β-diversity, followed by the communities ofG2, G0, and G8.AB CFig. 1 aLg-transformed bacterial abundance, bLg-transformed fungal abundance, and cbacteria/fungi ratio at all grazing intensities. Statisticalanalyses were performed independently for bacterial abundance, fungal abundance, and bacteria/fungi ratio using Duncan ’s multiple comparisontest. The results were shown with letters a to cXun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 4 of 13A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ana-lysis was performed to compare the microbial communi-ties. Bacterial communities were separated across thefirst principal coordinate on the basis of grazing inten-sity (Fig. 2b). The pattern of separation is consistent witha gradient of grazing intensity from G0 and G2, acrossmoderate grazing intensity (G4), and to high grazing in-tensity (G8). In addition, the communities were sepa-rated by seasonal variation across the second principalcoordinate, indicating that soil bacterial communitiesalso respond to seasonal changes. Moreover, a similarseparation pattern was observed for fungal communities.Grazing has significant effects on grassland microbialcommunity composition and diversity, which may alterthe robustness of microbial community. Indeed, commu-nity robustness is related to its responses to seasonalchanges. Therefore, we conducted an OTU differentialanalysis using the normalized OTU relative abundancesand performed a logarithmic ratio test between the soilsamples collected at each level of grazing intensity inJune and August to determine the community robust-ness. As indicated by the broom-shaped “tails, ”wheremore divergent “tails ”indicate weak robustness, the sea-sonal variations of the bacterial communities of G8(Fig. 3d) were greater than those of the communities ofG4 (Fig. 3c), followed by G2 (Fig. 3b)a n dG 0( F i g . 3a),which indicated that the stability of bacterial commu-nity decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Incomparison, the seasonal variations in the fungal commu-nities fluctuated considerably across all grazing intensities(Fig. 3eto3h).Grazing alters SOC decomposition and functional stabilityTo study how soil SOC turnover responds to seasonalchanges, a soil incubation experiment was established byvarying the water content and temperature conditions(moisture and temperature were determined by field in-vestigation). Various soil enzymatic activities, includingthose of SOC-decomposing enzymes ranging from thoseinvolved in labile- to recalcitrant-SOC decomposition,were detected.We found that the soil enzymatic activities were differ-ent across incubation conditions, whereas the microbialabundances were not (qPCR data not shown). Intri-guingly, the activities of the labile-SOC-decomposing en-zymes (invertase, maltase, and amylase) exhibitedpositive relationships ( R≥0.597, P≤0.019) with bacterialabundance but weak relationships ( R≤0.286, no signifi-cance) with fungal abundance (Table 1). However, theactivities of the recalcitrant-SOC-decomposing enzymes(pectinesterase, cellulase, and xylanase) exhibited posi-tive relationships ( R≥0.659, P≤0.009) with fungal abun-dance but weak relationships ( R≤0.262, no significance,except P= 0.035 for xylanase) with bacterial abundance.Additionally, the activity of the enzyme β-glucosidaseABFig. 2 aBacterial and fungal α-diversity (Shannon index) in June and August.

The results were shown with colored letters a to c. bNon-metric multidimensionalscaling (NMDS) analysis for bacterial and fungal communitiesXun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 5 of 13was positively correlated with both bacterial ( R= 0.628,P= 0.021) and fungal ( R= 0.585, P= 0.015) abundances.To provide a reasonable assessment of microbial activ-ity, the ratios of enzymatic activity to microbial abun-dance were calculated (only the significantly correlatedactivities and microbial abundances were used for thecalculations). Soil microbi al activity responded differ-ently to moisture and temperature perturbances; bac-terial activity was detected to be the highest in G4 andlowest in G8 under temperature or water content gra-dient (Additional files 7and 8: Figures S5 and S6).However, fungal activity was highest in G0 and lowestin G8 under temperature or water content gradient(Additional files 9and 10: Figures S7 and S8). Mean-while, the fungal activity seemed to be more sensitivethan bacterial activity becau se of the high variability offungal activity under moisture and temperature per-turbances at the same grazing intensity.A normal distribution of microbial activity was per-formed to demonstrate the stability of microbial activityunder various water and temperature conditions (Fig. 4).The right-most rectangle indicated higher activity, andthe smaller-sized rectangle indicated more stable micro-bial activity under perturbances. In this analysis, thehighest bacterial activity was observed in G4, whereasthe most stable bacterial activity was found in G0. More-over, the strongest individual predictor of bacterial activ-ity was bacterial β-diversity ( R= 0.794, P= 0.002), andsoil bacterial activity was also significantly related to soilpH ( R= 0.726, P= 0.004), bacterial γ-diversity ( R= 0.692,P= 0.034), and bacterial α-diversity ( R= 0.625, P= 0.045)(Table 2).

In addition, thestrongest individual predictor of fungal activity was fun-gal abundance ( R=0 . 8 2 9 , P= 0.001), and soil fungal activ-ity was also significantly related to fungal α-diversity ( R=0.571, P= 0.039) and SOC concentration ( R=0 . 5 0 7 , P=0.037).Soil productivity is related to microbial α-diversitySoil productivity was estimated using both below-groundSOC concentrations and above-ground plant and livestockbiomass.

However, linear regression analysisresults revealed that bacterial ( R2≥0.597, P< 0.01) andfungal ( R2≥0.476, P< 0.01) Shannon diversity indices hadsignificant positive correlations with SOC concentrationsin both June and August (Fig. 5a, b ).

Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 7 of 13DiscussionGrazing shifts microbial communities from fungi dominatedand slow growing to bacteria dominated and fast growingDifferent grazing intensities have direct and indirectimpacts on soil environmental conditions and micro-bial community [ 38]. Livestock feed on abovegroundplants and return nearly half of it as feces [ 39],which favors bacterial growth. Nevertheless, at over-grazing site, much trampling leads to high volumeweights of soil [ 40], and lack of plant coverage in-duces drastic fluctuations in soil moisture andtemperature, which results in a difficult environmentfor the growth of soil microorganisms. Therefore, weobserved a leaping change in bacterial abundance. Inaddition, the increasing bacteria/fungi ratio suggestedthat bacteria became the dominant microorganismswhile soil fungal abundance decreased at higher grazingintensities, which is probably because fungi favor lessperturbed ecosystems [ 41].With regard to the effects of grazing on the compositionof microbial community, we observed that different mi-crobial taxa exhibited different behaviors. Many Basidio-mycotal groups are sensitive to environmentalperturbances and slow-growing due to the long-lastingdikaryotic state [ 42], and could be used as a fungal indica-tor of perturbance intensity. Moreover, the phylum Glo-meromycota , members of which are known as arbuscularmycorrhizal fungi (AMF), is closely associated with plantbiomass [ 43]. Therefore, conditions of intensive grazingare not conducive to colonization by these fungi [ 44]due to enhanced soil perturbance and decreased plantrichness and biomass.Particularly, although the aboveground plants arenearly half-returned as feces, limited herbage under in-tensive grazing may impel the cattle to consume moreenergy foraging around the site, thus will increase theaboveground herbage consumption and belowgroundnutrient turnover, and consequently decrease the SOCconcentration [ 31]. However, in this site, intensive graz-ing increased the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes ,Proteobacteria ,Nitrospria , etc. These abundant bacterialtaxa are mostly copiotrophic bacteria [ 45], which aregenerally fast growing and positively correlated withSOC concentrations [ 46]. This result was initially sur-prising, as a previous study revealed that intensive graz-ing induces the proliferation of gram-positive bacteria[47], which was confirmed only on the bacterial phylumFirmicutes at the highest grazing intensity in this study.We considered that the feces contain more available nu-trient and labile organic substrates than plant residues,hence promote the growth of copiotrophic bacteria.Taken together, these findings suggest that grazing shiftsthe microbial communities from slow growing and fungidominated to fast growing and bacteria dominated.Grazing alters soil bacterial and fungal diversitysimultaneously but has different impacts on therobustness of bacterial and fungal communityGrazing probably modulates the diversity of soil microbesby altering the competitive interactions between dominantABDCEFFig. 5 Linear regression analysis between microbial α-diversity (Shannon index) and SOC concentration ( abacteria; bfungi), average plantbiomass accumulation ( cbacteria; dfungi), and average livestock biomass accumulation ( ebacteria; ffungi)Xun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 8 of 13microbes and releasing/suppressing subordinate microbes[16]; however, overgrazing may have negative effects on mi-crobial diversity. In this study, the microbial α-diversity ofG0 and G4 were both significantly lower than that of G2,but the γ-diversity of G4 was at the same level as that ofG2. These data indicated that light grazing had positive ef-fects on soil microbial species richness at local and regionalscale. However, moderate grazing decreased microbial spe-cies richness at local scale but had little impact at regionalscale. These variations in speci es richness at different scalesin moderate grazing intensity lead to a high level ofβ-diversity [ 48]. Indeed, we confirmed the observationusing both unweighted and weighted Unifrac distances.Moreover, this observation was consistent with previousfindings by Cline et al. [ 49], who carried out a long-termungulate foraging intensity experiment and indicated thatforaging intensity is associated with decreased bacterialrichness ( α-diversity) and increased distinct bacterial com-munities ( β-diversity). They also predicted that high for-aging intensity would lead to larger reductions in soilbiological α-a n d β-diversity. Particularly, Griffiths et al.[50] suggested that these kinds of variations in diversitymainly correspond to greater environmental variation. Wep r o p o s et h a tt h e s ef i n d i n g sm a yb ea t t r i b u t e dt os e l e c t i v efeeding, which causes alterat ions of nutrient supply and de-mand pattern at local scale, leading to greater environmen-tal heterogeneity at regional scale.In addition to the strong influence of grazing, seasonalchanges affect soil microbial community synchronously[17]. As indicated by the broom-shaped “tails ”in Fig. 3,i n -creased variations of soil bacterial community were ob-served with increasing grazing intensity. Since soilmicrobes are susceptible to soil moisture and temperature[51] and many other characteristics [ 52], these differenceswere probably attributable to seasonal changes. For in-stance, grazing leads to a decrease in plant coverage [ 53],which induces rapid loss of soil moisture [ 54] and sharpfluctuations of soil temperature [ 55]. Therefore, intensivegrazing makes the soil more susceptible to seasonal fluctu-ations and decreases soil microbial diversity, and thus, in-tensive grazing may decrease community robustness.However, in contrast to the bacterial communities, largevariations were observed for fungal communities acrossall grazing intensities. We propose that plant growth maybe the major factor responsible for the seasonal alterationsin fungal community. This is consistent with Millard andSingh [ 56] that demonstrated that bacterial communitiesare more influenced by soil characteristics, while fungalcommunities are primarily influenced by vegetation.Microbial composition and robustness determine the SOCdecomposition activity and stabilitySoil bacteria and fungi have different impacts on SOCpool; hence, grazing influences the size and compositionof SOC fractions via altering the microbial abundanceand composition in soil [ 57]. Generally, intensive grazinglands require more available nutrients for plant growth.Therefore, soil microbes are forced to form a community,which exhibits higher nutrient-turnover rates. To date, weknow that intensive grazing leads to bacteria-dominatedfood webs in soil [ 58,59]. Our results are consistent withthese observations, showing that bacteria, especiallyfast-growing copiotrophic bacteria, become dominant inintensive grazing lands. We detected the activities of sev-eral SOC-decomposing enzymes to provide an overviewof SOC decomposition capacity. The distinctive relation-ships between SOC-decomposing enzyme activity and mi-crobial abundance revealed that fungi are more importantin recalcitrant-SOC turnover while bacteria are more im-portant in labile-SOC turnover. For instance, fungi aremore efficient at decomposing lignocellulose than bacteria[60]. Moreover, more copiotrophic bacteria contain morelabile-SOC-decomposing genes [ 61], which promoteslabile-SOC turnover. Therefore, the dominance of soilbacteria or fungi regulates SOC decomposition.To provide a proper characterization of average micro-bial activity, we calculated the ratios of enzymatic activityto microbial abundance. This ratio is similar to the meta-bolic quotient (qCO 2), which is defined as the respirationrate per unit of biomass [ 62]. We observed that soil bac-terial activity (labile-SOC decomposition) was highest inG4, suggesting that moderate grazing enhanced whereasovergrazing suppressed the bacterial activity and ability todecompose labile SOC. On the other hand, soil fungal ac-tivity (recalcitrant-SOC decomposition) was highest in thenon-grazed site (G0), suggesting that the introduction ofgrazing suppressed soil fungal activity and the ability todecompose recalcitrant SOC. This finding supported thehypothesis that bacteria and fungi are relatively more im-portant decomposers in intensively grazed and lightlygrazed grasslands, respectively.We observed that the best parameter for predictingbacterial activity was bacterial β-diversity, followed by soilpH. It is apparent that soil pH has a strong effect on bac-terial survival and activity [ 33]; however, there are few re-ports on the effects of bacterial β-diversity. We believe thatthe high bacterial activity in G4 was mainly due to the highproportion of copiotrophic bacteria. Therefore, moderategrazing will promote the growth of copiotrophic bacteriaand enhance bacterial activity in meadow steppe. However,the activity of copiotrophic bacteria will be suppressed inovergrazed lands. Unlike bacterial community, weak rela-tionship was found between fungal community and soilpH [19], and subsequent studies proved that soil fungal di-versity and composition are related to SOC [ 63,64],which is related to plant growth in grasslands. More-over, Keiblinger et al. [ 65] suggested that the SOC-de-composition efficiency of fungi is more sensitive toXun et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:170 Page 9 of 13vegetation and requires a high fungal biomass. There-fore, the association between fungal abundance and re-calcitrant-SOC decomposition efficiency may act as agood predictor for fungal activity in natural habitats.We also detected great fluctuations in bacterial activityat intensive grazing sites and in fungal activity across allgrazing sites, which were related to the robustness of bac-terial and fungal communities, respectively. Our findingswere consistent with a previous result, which showed thatmicrobial robustness determines the stability of soilfunctions [ 66]. Importantly, although we did not findsignificant changes in fungal abundance under variousincubation conditions, fungal activity showed the samefluctuation tendencies, indicating that fungal activity isalso sensitive to moisture and temperature. Taken to-gether, these findings indicate that soil bacterial activitymainly lays in the abundant copiotrophic taxa and soilproperties, and these abundant copiotrophic taxa areprimarily responsible for the efficiency of labile-SOCdecomposition. In addition, fungal activity is mainly af-fected by fungal abundance and plant growth and is pri-marily responsible for the efficiency of recalcitrant-SOCdecomposition.Soil microbial α-diversity rather than SOC turnover ratepredicts soil productivityGenerally, floristic complexity determines soil producti-v i t yi nt h ea b s e n c eo ft h ei n t e r f e r e n c eo fn a t u r a le c o -logical systems [ 3,67]. Ecologists have been trying topredict ecosystem services x(e.g., soil productivity) usingfloristic diversity in human- or herbivore-disturbed eco-systems, but the results have been mixed [ 3,5,7]. Van DerHeijden et al. [ 68] summarized that closed nutrient cyclingoccurs in less-perturbed soils with fungi-dominated foodwebs and that these soils usually support slow plant growthand low net primary productivity. Nevertheless, we foundthat moderate grazing-indu ced bacteria-dominated foodwebs and faster labile-SOC turnover rate did notachieve the highest producti vity either. We conjecturedthat in bacteria-dominated food webs, rapid nutrientcycling occurs to provide suitable conditions for thegrowth of fast-growing bacteria, which may shift theSOC pool from C sinks to C sources and may suppressplant growth and productivity. Herein, strong positiveeffects of microbial α-diversity on soil C storage andproductivity were detected, suggesting that there maybe an internal microbiological mechanism to increasethe proportions of photoassimilates in the soil C pooland food chain with higher microbial α-diversity ratherthan higher nutrient turnover rates. Thus, soil manage-ment intensity and associated changes in soil microbialcommunity can steer the multiple functions of ecosys-tems and trade-offs between human demands, and eco-system functions still need to be concerned [ 69].ConclusionsThe data presented here demonstrated that different levelsof grazing had significant impacts on soil microbial com-munities and ecosystem functions in meadow steppes(Fig. 6). Grazing shifted microbial compositions fromslow-growing and fungi-dom inated to fast-growing andbacteria-dominated communiti es. We observed that fungalcommunity was mainly responsible for recalcitrant-SOCdecomposition and that fungal activity was positively corre-lated with fungal abundance. On the other hand, bacterialcommunity was primarily responsible for labile-SOC de-composition, and bacterial activity was associated withβ-diversity. However, microbial activity was suppressed inovergrazing soil. Particularly, soil productivity was not asso-ciated with bacterial or fungal activity but with microbialα-diversity. Thus, we argue that grazing affects soilFig. 6 An overview of the influence of grazing on soil microbial community and soil productivityXun et al.
