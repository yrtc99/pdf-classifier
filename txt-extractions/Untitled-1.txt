Firstly, increases in tempera-tures are known to be detrimental to a number of organisms, especially those insensitive habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests. Secondly, the pressures posedby a changing climate may lead to sets of responses in areas as varied as phenology,range and physiology of living organisms, often leading to changes in life cycles(especially but not only in reproduction), losses in productivity, or even death. Onoccasions, the survival of some very sensitive species (e.g. corals) may beendangered. Thirdly, the impacts of climate change to biodiversity are estimated tobe felt in the short term in respect of some species and ecosystems, but also in themedium and long term in many biomes. Indeed, if left unattended, some of theseimpacts may be irreversible.Many individual governments, NGOs, ﬁnancial institutions and internationaldonors are currently spending billions of dollars in projects around climate changeand biodiversity, but with little coordination. Quite often, the emphasis is onadaptation efforts, with little emphasis on the connections between physio-ecologicalchanges and the life cycles and metabolisms of fauna and ﬂora, or the in ﬂuence ofpoor governance on biodiversity. There is therefore a perceived need to not onlybetter understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, but to also identify,test and implement measures aimed at managing the many risks climate changeposes to fauna, ﬂora and micro organisms. In particular, the question as to how betterrestore and protect ecosystems from the impact of climate change, also has to beurgently addressed.This book has been produced to address this need. Papers here compiled look atmatters related to the use of an ecosystem-based approach to increase local adap-tation capacity, consider the signi ﬁcance of protected areas network in preservingbiodiversity in a changing northern European climate, and the impact of climatechange on speci ﬁc species, and wild terrestrial animals. It also presents a variety ofcase studies such as the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, the effectsof climate change on the biodiversity of Aleppo pine forest of Senalba (Algeria),climate change and biodiversity response in the Niger delta region of Nigeria, andvthe impact of forest ﬁres on the biodiversity and the soil characteristics of tropicalpeatlands in Indonesia. Moreover the book also entails contributions on how topromote the climate agenda and biodiversity conservation at the local level.It is a truly interdisciplinary publication, and we hope it will be useful toscholars, social movements, practitioners and members of governmental agencies,undertaking research and/or executing projects on climate change and biodiversityacross the world.Hamburg, Germany Walter Leal FilhoHamburg, Germany Jelena BarbirManchester, UK Richard PreziosiWinter 2018/2019vi PrefaceContentsWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus of InternationalMaster Programs in Latin America and the Carribian ............. 1Frido Reinstorf, Petra Schneider, Raymundo Rodriguez Tejeda,Leslie Santos Roque, Henrietta Hampel and Raul F.

VazquezAbstract Water is regional priority around the world but synthesis of water resourcemanagement aspects from local-to-global scales is currently not included in notcurrently included higher education curriculua of Latin American and the Caribbean(LAC) universities. This leaves local populations vulnerable to future shifts in climateat global scales and changes in land usage at regional scales. To close this gap, theproject “W ATERMAS—Water Management and Climate Change in the Focus ofInternational Master Programs”, is ﬁnanced by the European Union. The project willdevelop and establish a new standard of higher educational and scientiﬁc knowledgeexchange between Europe and Latin America as well as the Caribbean. This willbe done leveraging existing Master’s courses/programs of Water Management atthe various partner universities in Latin America (LA), respectively in Cuba andin Ecuador.

Reinstorf et al.for the adaptation of local water management facilities and the biodiversity withregard to future challenges in the partner countries targeting a Society-Education-Research Nexus. The project addresses sustainability under the Teaching-Research-Practice Nexus, particularly the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) 4(Quality Education), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 11 (Sustainable Cities andCommunities), and 13 (Climate Action). Besides the water management aspectsthe biodiversity guaranties the functionality of eco system services, which plays animportant role by considering the value of the nature for the mankind.IntroductionWater is fundamental for the economy and quality of life in every country of the world;however, this renewable resource is increasingly threatened by human activities (i.e.pollution, overexploitation). Further, due to this human inﬂuence on earth processes,the global climate is changing, affecting the availability and frequency of naturalrainfall. In Latin America (LA) long term prediction foresees more or less the sameamount of rain in the future but its distribution will change causing longer periods ofdrought and increased intensity and frequency of rainfall resulting in severe ﬂoodingand devastating consequences (IPCC-AR5 2014 ). Moreover, the hydrological cycleis inﬂuenced by complex meteorological phenomena such as “El Niño” and “LaNiña”, which produce extensive damage with regard to the local-to-global economyand can bring also signiﬁcant human losses in the affected countries. In Europe,especially in the southern countries like Spain and Italy, water crisis is more andmore severe each summer, e.g. summer water crisis in 2008 when water needed to beimported to Spain. Only the retention of water in reservoirs, and even the re-use ofheavily salty wells, e.g. in Cataluña, can fairly satisfy the water demand (Maracchiet al. 2005 ).Such climate change is exacerbated by coupled impacts of land use changes asso-ciated with, for instance, agricultural frontier expansion and related water use to feedgrowing populations and satisfy other urban needs. Moreover, in LA, especially inEcuador, in the last few years, aiming at securing and diversifying energy sources,several hydroelectric power stations started to function and many more are underconstruction, e.g. Paute Dam and Mazar Dam (WEC 2017 ). The lack of control onenvironmental ﬂow results in strong impact on the river system functioning and itscapacity of recovery. Contamination due to the lack of control of industrial and agri-cultural activities and lack of water treatment plants prior river disposal (e.g. onlythree cities in Ecuador have adequate sewage treatment systems, in Cuba there areno norms for the design of waste water treatment plans) further aggravates the waterrelated problems. In addition, as the result of the last few years of strong economicdevelopment, water consumption increased dramatically reaching in average 200 Lper day in LA cities. Due to the above mentioned issues all countries globally willhave to face water related problems in the future. But these problems will be espe-cially severe in LA where countries are highly vulnerable due to the lack of mitigationWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 3and adaptation strategies (WWDR 2015 ). In the most affected regions the economicdevelopment growth will be hindered promoting further growth of poverty and des-peration among inhabitants, with potential consequences on the rise of criminalityand other social issues.In the European Union (EU), the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000 )a i m st oachieve good qualitative and quantitative status of all water bodies. Also, the new sta-tus of ecosystems, which considers not only the conservation of biodiversity but alsothe new aspect of improving the ability of ecosystems to deliver eco system services,plays an important role in the strategy of the EU (COM 2011 , 244). However, in LA,where the proposed project will be executed, the focus is different. For instance, inEcuador exists the “Law of the use and exploitation of water resources” but this doesnot mention at all anything on the protection of water bodies but only guarantees“good” and enough water for the population. Strikingly, despite water’s recognitionas a very important regional priority, water conservation, protection, environmentalﬂow deﬁnition, and relation to good ecosystem functioning are very rarely consid-ered in legal regulations and decision-making. Even more signiﬁcant as we lookto future generations of managers, these integral aspects of water resources are notincluded in the vast majority of curricula development for higher education acrossLA. Further, these curricula need to implement up-to-date scientiﬁc and technologi-cal knowledge, aiming at increasing the local skills and expertise of young studentsand professionals as multiplier on key water resources (WR) aspects such as optimi-sation of use, conservation and management; promoting at the same time, commonvalues, social integration, intercultural understanding and language/communicationskills, as a way of overcoming current educational deﬁciencies that constrain pro-fessionals to a narrow working environment. This is what the W ATERMAS projecttargets.The Project: “WATERMAS—Water Managementand Climate Change in the Focus of International MasterPrograms”General AspectsW ATERMAS is a project ﬁnanced by the European Union under the ERASMUS +program in the period 2017–2019. Partners are the University of Applied SciencesMagdeburg-Stendal (UAM, Germany), the Universities of Holguin (UHo, Cuba),Gent (UG, Belgium), Cuenca (UC, Ecuador), Stockholm (SU, Sweden) and thePolytechnical School of Litoral Guayaquil (ESPOL, Ecuador). As such, W ATER-MAS focuses in the regional priority for boosting academic curricula in the ﬁeld ofwater resources (WR) with the innovative goal of including perspectives of conser-vation and protection of WR leveraging management aspects from local-to-globalscales especially in the view of climate change.4 F. Reinstorf et al.Hence, the participating institutions have very high level teaching and/or researchexpertise in a broad range of WR issues. Nevertheless, particularly the LA institutionshave the necessity of connecting to more modern knowledge, especially on waterconservation and management issues, as well as, language skills. In this respect,the exchange of students and teachers targeting an ability to share knowledge andtransfer research among universities in the LA and EU contexts will further providesupport to current and future decision makers and civil society in general. This willguarantee not only the successful execution of the project objectives but also thefuture sustainability of its outcomes.The general approach is to include several important and unique aspects, such as(1) the transference of the EU view on WR management on the basis of the WaterFramework Directive (WFD) application; (2) the wide range of WR related expertiseof the partners (e.g. hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, water quality, water man-agement, river/lake monitoring/restoration, climate change, landscape/aquatic ecol-ogy, ecosystem functioning, environmental ﬂow) will provide a complete overviewon water issues in the view of climate change; (3) the long teaching/research trajec-tory of the participants will ensure effective knowledge transference; and (4) differentWRes problems from the participating countries (e.g. Belgium: severe reduction ofintertidal areas of rivers and related ﬂood events; Germany: pollution vs. water usefrom transboundary rivers; Ecuador: lack of proper legislation for environmentalﬂow, severely increased water consumption) will be analysed and presented as casestudies, proﬁting from the signiﬁcant expertise of the partners.Currently, there exists already a student exchange program between Universityof Applied Sciences Magdeburg-Stendal (UAM, Germany) and University of Hol-guin (UHo, Cuba), through which lecturers/scientists from both universities workedtogether to create a jointly taught course given at the UHo and initiated commonresearch on WR applied on Cuba. Further, the universities of Gent (UG, Belgium),Cuenca (UC, Ecuador) and the Polytechnical School of Litoral in Guayaquil (ESPOL,Ecuador) have a long term collaboration (20 years) through the VLIR (Flemish Coun-cil of Universities) program, which promoted mobility actions, technology transfer-ence and development of research projects and an interuniversity M.Sc. program inWR (while a related Ph.D. program is currently being planned). Hence, the integra-tion of these well stablished and fruitful networks gave birth to the current proposalthat in addition involves the collaboration of the University of Stockholm (SU) dueto its relevant complementary experience on WR and expertise on well-aligned cur-riculum development connecting research and application.Climate Change in Latin America with Focus on Cubaand EcudadorThe climate of the Central and South American continent is extraordinarily complex.On the one hand, the long continent reaches from the tropics of the northern to thetundra climate of the southern hemisphere. On the other hand, the Andes and theWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 5Fig. 1 Location of the countries in the focus of W ATERMASmountains of Central America cause great differences on the west and east sides ofthe continent. Cuba and Ecuador, the countries in the focus of the project, are locatedin the Latin American and Carribbean (LAC) LAC region, see Fig. 1.The LAC countries are considered particularly vulnerable to climate change, onthe one hand by a possible increase in hurricane activity and on the other hand bythe rise in sea levels (IPCC 2007 ,2013 ; UNEP 2010 ). While sea-level rise is morea global phenomenon, but particularly prone to Caribbean islands, the frequencyand intensity of Caribbean hurricanes are heavily controlled by the climate of thetropical Atlantic and the Caribbean itself (Pielke et al. 2013 ). The Caribbean climateis initially determined by the subtropical high above the Atlantic. It lies far to thesouth in winter and brings drought to the region. In the summer, it shifts to the northand makes room for east winds, causing rain from May to November. From June toNovember, when sea surface temperatures are above 26.5 °C, these easterly windsmay develop into tropical storms and hurricanes, bringing the bulk of precipitation.The whole system is under the inﬂuence of the El Niño Phenomenon in the SouthPaciﬁc and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). El Niño years provide more drynessand less hurricane activity across the Caribbean, La Niña years for wetter conditions.A positive NAO phase intensiﬁes the subtropical high pressure area and thus alsocauses a reduction in rainfall (IPCC 2007 ,2013 ).The devastating effects of climate change are already evident in LA today.Expected impacts of climate change in 2050 can be seen in Fig. 2. Regions withincreased vulnerability to weather extremes like storms, droughts and ﬂoods changesin biodiversity as well as the risk of desertiﬁcation can be located. Crop failure, water6 F. Reinstorf et al.Fig. 2 Expected impacts of climate change in 2050 in Latin America (Landa et al. 2010 )scarcity and landslides are some of the consequences as well as a higher risk of dis-eases, impacts on agriculture and ﬁsheries. This especially affects poorer people inthe countryside. For many small farmers, for example, climate change is already anexistential threat today. Overall, it leads in LAC societies to ever greater ecologicaland social upheavals. Added to this is the continued exploitation of natural resourcesfor more and more economic growth, which accepts the social and environmentaldamage that goes along with it.By the end of the 21st century, the LAC region is expected to see a temperatureincrease of about 2–3 °C, slightly less than the global average, which has to do with thedominance of the sea over land (IPCC 2007 ,2013 ). Not less important than the air arethe water temperatures, because they determine the evaporation and the precipitation.Till 2050, the sea surface temperature is expected to increase by 1 °C. This shouldresult in higher precipitation, as predicted by a model calculation for August toWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 7October (Angeles et al. 2007 ). However, the IPCC assumes drier conditions in CentralAmerica and the Caribbean at the end of the 21st century. The reason is that in theEast Paciﬁc, more El-Niño-like conditions are expected in the future, and an increasein the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Both changes lead to less precipitation inthe Caribbean (IPCC 2007 ). An exception is only the northern Caribbean in thewinter months (IPCC 2013 ). A warming of the eastern tropical Paciﬁc, from whichan El Niño develops, intensiﬁes the subtropical jet stream, which in turn ampliﬁesvertical heavy winds across the Caribbean that obstruct the convection of humid air.A positive NAO phase increases the Atlantic subtropics high and the trade winds,causing the Caribbean Sea surface temperatures to cool (Angeles et al. 2007 ).In addition, there are many problems and deﬁciencies that contribute to the vul-nerability of the LA countries in terms of climate change (Leal Filho and Mannke2014 ), as there are:poor or non-existing climate change governance systems,limited awareness on the causes and consequences of climate change,endemic poverty,limited access to capital and global markets,continuous ecosystem degradation,complex disasters and conﬂicts,unplanned urbanization,limited capacity (personal and institutional) to address the problem and its manyramiﬁcations.Conﬂicts due to climate change and environmental degradation, resource exploitationand scarcity of resources are exacerbated by the fact that they are directly linked tothe distribution problem—that is, the question of how beneﬁts and risks are sociallydistributed. On the one hand, the LA example shows the connection of environ-mental and climate problems with social and economic issues; on the other, theglobal dimension of climate change and environmental conﬂicts becomes clear: thegap between the main causes of climate change and beneﬁciaries of the economicsystem in the Global North on the one hand and, on the other hand, people who aremarginalized are continuing to open up, partly because others can protect themselvesagainst the consequences of climate change. But looking at LA not only highlightsthe implications and inequalities surrounding the global climate change problem, italso opens up hopeful alternatives: In some LA countries, people are pioneering waysof reconciling human development, social justice and environmental sustainability.MethodologyTo increase the local expertise for optimising the management of WR, in LAC coun-tries academic curricula needs to incorporate the perspective of protection and con-servation of WR and their advantages, especially in the view of climate change, and8 F. Reinstorf et al.up-to-date scientiﬁc and technological knowledge. EU partners have a very diverseresearch/teaching/technological/management expertise on these WR issues, whichwill help solving local WR problems by increasing local expertise and, in the mid-term, could be incorporated into local/regional decision making systems, which inturn would represent a huge contribution to regional WR management. Further, col-laboration between EU and LAC countries will generate joint knowledge on WRissues, which will allow the establishment of thematic networks that will be sustain-able through common research projects, scientiﬁc publications and mobility actionsinvolving both students and researchers.The main research questions of the project are:Which are the main contents to be included in curricula for teaching water man-agement and climate change in the focus of international master programs for theLAC region?How can a continuing education program for teachers contribute to curriculumdevelopment in the sense of higher education for climate adaptation and sustainabledevelopment?Which competencies are developed individually?How can water management and climate change be integrated into the teach-ing routines in a transdisciplinary way? Which new and innovative pedagogicalapproaches are feasible to be implemented under LAC conditions?What contributions are there for the development of the university?How does the program contribute to the dissemination of climate mitigation andadaptation as a cross-cutting issue in the university and outside?The general approach of the project to provide answers to the above questions is theknowledge value chain according to Weggeman ( 1996 ), which provides a structuredapproach on the base of knowledge management routines. The knowledge valuechain represents a transfer of a technique to teaching, which has proven itself inpractice. The knowledge value chain is starting from MVOS (mission—vision—ob-jectives—strategy), followed by Developing knowledge—sharing knowledge—Ap-plying knowledge—Evaluating knowledge, a process, which is under cyclicalrepetition (Weggeman 2000 ), as analogue to the Deming cycle (Deming 1982 ). Themethodology in the W ATERMAS project is based on the creation of a commonknowledge base by cooperation, exchange and dissemination among the networkparticipants to promote curriculum development with the following key activities:Identiﬁcation of the main topics of the curricula regarding water resources con-servation and management both from a regional and global perspectiveCollection of relevant information material (national standards, publicationsregarding regional and global water management aspects and land use impacts,examples of existing curricula, etc.) among the partners with subsequent assess-ment, summarization and distribution as presentations at workshopsAssessing local and global scientiﬁc information relating to the project aims. Dis-cussion of the information, producing outlines of articles and decisions regardingthe implementation within the virtual data baseWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 9Fig. 3 Methodology for the implementation of the W ATERMAS projectIdentiﬁcation of the main local impacts of land use and climate change on thewater resourcesParticipation in joint investigations targeting the interests of the regions, e.g. ero-sion in landscape and riverbeds, hydrological extreme events, standard hydrolog-ical methods, high ﬂood protection, biodiversity, European regulations and rules(water framework directive, groundwater directive etc.), dam construction, dam-age of dams and spillways, coast protection, International Water Management,which will be implemented through the exchange of M.Sc. students and projectparticipants between universities.Exchange of teachers, researchers and students across different levels of highereducation among the participating universities.Develop skills in technical (e.g. water sampling, water treatment and water supplytechnologies, numerical process modelling, using of Geographical InformationSystems) and methodological (e.g. teaching methods, e-learning) training withinthe group of network participants and other involved persons in the different coun-tries in order to strengthen their skills and abilities (i.e. How can we connect educa-tion and research directly for the beneﬁt of not only students but also researchers?)Development of a list of relating aspects of conservation and management ofwater resources under European standards in consideration of local and regionalcharacteristics to include them within the new curriculum.The methodology for the implementation of the W ATERMAS project will be struc-tured in the following way (Fig. 3):The three main basic working ﬁelds in W ATERMAS, which are inventory, obser-vatory and teaching lead to the three main impact nexus’ for water-energy-food,teaching-research-practice and society-education-research and furthermore to thethree social results society resilience, water resources conservation and climateadaptation.10 F. Reinstorf et al.Teaching and Learning Contents to Be AddressedFundamentals and DeﬁnitionsThe exacerbating impacts resulting on the changes of the climate system on thewater resources systems and the complexity based on interacting systems are issuesthat becoming increasingly importances. Damages and alterations in the atmosphere,global warming, impacts on the oceans, the cryosphere, changes in sea level, as wellas differences in carbon concentrations and other biogeochemical magnitudes areinescapable. These affect the normal balance of ecosystems and force humans toseek alternatives to adapt to new conditions and ﬁnd immediate solutions. In thiscontext the understanding of the impacts requires the consideration of the interre-lations between water resources—water scarcity—water risk—water stress—watersecurity as well as water resources—water use—waste water discharge—waste watertreatment. These fundamental interrelations within the Water Resource Management(WRM) are necessary to implement in learning and teaching contents, including theinterrelations between WRM aspects and other natural resources like ecosystems.Displaying the Scales of the Hydrological Cycleand the Impacts of Climate Change in the CurriculumScope of this part of the curriculum will be to get knowledge of the fundamentals ofhydrology, as well as to get knowledge of hydrological processes and methods forthe estimation of hydrological variables, which are relevant for the dimensioning ofhydraulic structures and for the use of water resources on all levels and scales. Theclassiﬁcation of the spatial scales relevant for hydrology ranges from “micro” (up toabout 1 km2) via “meso” (up to 1000 km2) to “macro” (from 10,000 km2). To showhow the different scales of the hydrological cycle and the impacts of climate changecan be considered in curricula an understanding of the processes and known facts atthe different scales is required. For that, a differentiation into the global, regional,and local scales is needed. Using the concrete examples of Cuba and Ecuador, it willbe demonstrated how this content can be displayed in a curriculum.Dimensions of WR Management to Be Consideredin the CurriculumWater resources are sources of water that are potentially useful for uses like agricul-tural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. Water avail-ability, including the security of water supply and sanitation, is essential to achievingWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 11the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG; United Nations 2015 ).Water availability, which UNESCO refers to as available fresh water resources (UN-Water 2006 ), indicates the amount of fresh water that is available to one personper year. According to Gerlak and Mukhtarov ( 2015 ), water security has emergedas a new discourse in water governance challenging the more traditional dominantdiscourse of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in the past decade.The deﬁnition of IWRM that is most widely accepted and of relevance today wasgiven by the Technical Committee (TEC, former Technical Advisory Committee,TAC), of the Global Water Partnership (GWP). It states that IWRM is “ A processwhich promotes the co -ordinated development and management of water, land andrelated resources, in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare inan equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems ”(GWP 2000 ).IWRM is based on a management approach for balancing water demand and avail-ability under a spatial planning approach, practically combining water managementand water protection at catchment level (Grigg 2008 ). The formalised framework ofIWRM was developed from the Dublin Principles that were ratiﬁed during the 1992International Conference on Water and the Environment, through the following fourguiding principles:Principle 1: Fresh water is a ﬁnite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustainlife, development and the environmentPrinciple 2: Water development and management should be based on a participa-tory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levelsPrinciple 3: Women play a central part in the provision, management and safe-guarding of waterPrinciple 4: Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should berecognized as an economic good.The Human Right to Water and Sanitation (HRWS) was recognised by the UnitedNations (UN) General Assembly on 28 July 2010 (UNEP 2010 ). A revised UNresolution in 2015 highlighted that the two rights were separate but equal (UnitedNations 2015 ). Through its focus on water, IWRM often neglects the needs of usersfrom agriculture and/or energy services. To consider a more holistic approach, theWater-Energy-Food Security Nexus (WEF) has been proposed, linking the decision-making processes of the competitive users and balancing the “trade-offs” betweenthem (Hoff 2011 ).In the last decades, the awareness has grown that water is a scarce resource whichneeds to be managed also under the principles of environmental economics, particu-larly the water value chain, which takes the aspect of water being food into account.The “Water Footprint” (WF) is an indicator that shows the direct and indirect waterconsumption of a consumer or a producer (Hoekstra and Chapagain 2008 ). In con-trast to direct water consumption, the WF also includes indirectly used water. Theamount of water hidden in products is often referred to as “Virtual Water”. The WFdescribes the total amount of water that nations, businesses or consumers consume.12 F. Reinstorf et al.Fig. 4 The green, blue, grey and total water footprints in the LAC region (1996–2005) (Mekonnenand Hoekstra 2011 )The special feature of the concept is that it combines the amount of water that is used,evaporated and/or polluted for production, with information on both the consumingand the producing region of the product. Dividing the used water into categories ishelpful for a later assessment of the WF. “Green water” is the naturally occurringsoil and rainwater, which is absorbed and evaporated by plants. It is relevant to agri-cultural products. “Blue water” is ground or surface water that is used to make aproduct and is no longer returned to a body of water. In agriculture, it is the water forwatering the plants. “Grey water” is the amount of water that is polluted during themanufacturing process. Figure 4shows the green (GWF), blue (BWF), grey (YWF)and total water footprints (TWF) in the LAC region according to Mekonnen andHoekstra ( 2011 ).According to Mekonnen and Hoekstra ( 2011 ), the total WF of production in theLAC region in the period 1996–2005 was 1162 billion m3/y (87% GWF, 5% BWF, 8%Water Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 13YWF) (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011 ). About 21% of the WF within LAC is relatedto production for export. The gross virtual water export of the LAC region to the restof the world was 277 billion m3/y (Mekonnen et al. 2015 ). The LAC average WF ofconsumption was about 1769 m3/y per capita. In LA does exist the Latin AmericanWater Tribunal (Tribunal Latinoamericano del Agua, TLA), which is an autonomous,independent and international environmental justice organization created to helpsolve water related conﬂicts in LA and to support water management (Weaver 2011 ).The TLA work is based on the principles that the balanced coexistence with nature,respect for human dignity, and solidarity among peoples are are required for thepreservation of the region’s water systems. The TLA is committed to preservingthe water commons for future generations and to guaranteeing access to water as ahuman right. Its legitimacy derives from the moral nature of its resolutions and thejuridical fundamentals they are based on.Climate Change—The Role of Biodiversity and EcosystemServicesBiodiversity plays a signiﬁcant role in the frame of the climate change mitigationstrategy development and refers to the variability of living organisms and their eco-logical complexes. It includes (a) the diversity of ecosystems or communities, habitatsand landscapes, (b) the biological diversity and (c) the genetic diversity within thedifferent species. Various forms of the use of the natural capital, including biodiver-sity, have been grouped together under the term ecosystem services, without payingparticular attention to the idea of nature conservation yet (Schröter 2017 ).Ecosystem services (ES) are services produced by ecosystems through the func-tion of the compartiments of the respective ecosystem, that provide essential beneﬁtsto human (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005 ). The Millennium EcosystemAssessment ( 2005 ) derived provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ser-vices. Biodiversity is the prerequisite for a healthy and natural development of allliving individuals and ecosystems. ES include e.g. puriﬁcation of drinking water andair, climate regulation, pest and disease control, pollination and other mechanismof supporting food production, medicinal resources, ﬂood regulation and the recre-ational value. ES are also provided by restored ecosystems, particularly forests undernatural succession like secondary forests. According to a study of Lourens Poorter ofWageningen University in the Netherlands (Poorter 2016), secondary forests, unlikeprimeval forests, allow large amounts of water to circulate and renew soil fertility.Besides, they grow very fast. Covering 28% of LA’s total land area, all industrial pro-cesses that emit CO2could be offset. Having in view the strong interrelation betweenWR and ES, the role of biodiversity and ES for the mitigation of climate change willbe particularly outlined in the curriculum. Figure 5shows the predicted value (perhectare) of ecosystem services and loss in ecosystem services due to habitat loss,2000–2010 (Mekonnen et al. 2015 ).14 F. Reinstorf et al.Fig. 5 Predicted value (per hectare) of ecosystem services and loss in ecosystem services due tohabitat loss, 2000–2010 (Mekonnen et al. 2015 )Structure of the CurriculumThe curriculum will be structured in modules, based on the data collected for theW ATERMAS inventory. The general approach to the structure of the curriculum isbased on the following modules:First semester (theoretical)Module 1 Introduction to IWRM in the LAC regionModule 2 WR conservation and ecosystem servicesModule 3 Circularity: Multifunctional land use and reuseModule 4 Climate change, climate impact, climate adaptationModule 5 Engineered and nature-based solutions for sustainable water and landmanagementSecond semester (practical)Workshop 1 Applying IWRM on catchment scale (project seminar)Workshop 2 Development of a climate adaptation strategy on catchment scale(project seminar)Workshop 3 Water-Energy-Food Nexus and Public ParticipationWater Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 15Green Campus—The Living LabThe universities campus should play a key role in the water management and climatechange master programs as it is part of the student’s real life system, and could beused as living lab for the development of the practical part of the curriculum. Aliving lab is a place-based research concept that utilizes the college campus as test-bed for innovation and knowledge generation, representing the campus as a pilot sitefor climate adaptation. A green campus is a challenge as it means using the builtenvironment to revitalize college education as a form of experimental learning. Afeasible guideline for such activity is the Greening Universities Toolkit of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP 2010 ).Teaching and Learning MethodologyGeneral Didactic Approach—Students Become Self-DirectedLearnersThree main goals characterize the approach to curriculum development in theW ATERMAS project (in analogy to Leat 1998 ):the development of ﬂexible, adaptive learning methods and types of tasks thattransform WR management into a challenging and exciting subjectto help students to understand important key concepts of thinking in WR manage-ment and develop cognitive skills that they can apply in a different context,To support the intellectual development of students so that they can better handlediverse and complex information in the study and beyond.In order to achieve these goals, the W ATERMAS project will develop learning meth-ods and exercises that will motivate students to reﬂect and think in a motivatingsystems thinking way. Decisive is always the thinking process, which leads to thesolution of the tasks. That is why each task has a reﬂection in which the studentsthemselves should become aware of this thought process (metacognitive learning;Ambrose et al. 2010 ; Barkley 2010 ). Working with learning methods also opens theway to a self-directed way of thinking that goes beyond the specialist content of WRlessons. The following thinking strategies play a central role in this context:Compare: Find similarities and differencesLink: Search internal and external connectionsLocate: Map phenomena geographically and assign themChange of scale: Consider phenomena on different scale levelsChange of perspectives: A nalysis of phenomena in multiple perspectivesDeduce and induce: Connect the general and the speciﬁc.16 F. Reinstorf et al.Water and Climate Cycles—Circular ThinkingNature’s systems are based on cycles, and water and climate are prominent exam-ples for natural cycles. Sustainable systems are based on balanced cycles that do notproduce waste. After the development of the cradle-to-cradle (circular) concept byBraungart and McDonough ( 2002 ), water management was one of the key imple-mentation ﬁelds for circular economy principles. Circular economy in water manage-ment include waste water reuse and roof water harvesting. The learning methodologyintends to develop students’ insights into circular approaches as such and in analogyto natural ecosystem cycles. The teaching methodology is based on circularity: theknowledge value chain.Climate Change and Climate Impact Mitigation—SystemsThinkingMain focus of the teaching and learning methodology is to overcome fragmentationin (a) WR management and climate adaptation approaches, and (b) teaching andlearning approaches. To achieve that, the framework for the teaching and learningmethodology is a Nexus approach, mediated through systems thinking.In the last years increases the awareness of the complexity of environmentalproblems and led to the development of new management approaches. Pahl-Wostl(2007 ) proposed to focus on the transition to new management paradigms for systemsto be managed that are complex and adaptive. Systems thinking refers to a holisticapproach that recognises the tendency in nature to form ‘wholes’ that are more thanthe sum of the parts by ordered grouping. While IWRM as a reductionist approachtends towards breaking down complex systems into simple constituents (Dzwairoet al. 2010 ), a Nexus refers to a link or set of links that link two or more things ortopics. At the ‘International Kick-off Workshop: Advancing a Nexus Approach to theSustainable Management of Water, Soil and Waste (WSW)’ in 2013 the WSW Nexuswas hence described: “ The Nexus Approach to environmental resources’ managementexamines the inter -relatedness and interdependencies of environmental resourcesand their transitions and ﬂuxes across spatial scales and between compartments.Instead of just looking at individual components, the functioning, productivity, andmanagement of a complex system is taken into consideration ” (UNU FLORES 2015 ;Avellan et al. 2017 ).The management of natural resources through a Nexus approach has gained sig-niﬁcant importance in the last years. The main Nexus approaches are summarisedbelow. They will form the didactic framework for the transfer of the systems think-ing to the learners. The Nexus’ perspectives below are referring particularly to WR,climate change and the teaching of these subjects in an LA context, and show thesystems thinking dimensions.Water Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 17The WR dimension: Water -Energy -Food Nexus (Hoff 2011 ; Huelsmannand Ardakanian 2014 ; UNU-FLORES 2015 )The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus assesses the interdependencies betweenwater, energy and food security for human well-being and intends to achieve allthree of them in an equitable manner. The Nexus approach is based on the under-standing of the synergies and the regulated negotiation of fair trade-offs betweencompeting uses of water, land and energy-related resources (Schneider et al. 2018a ).A particular WEF approach for transboundary river basins was developed under theUNECE Water Convention for the 2013–2015 program, that is the TransboundaryRiver Basin Nexus Approach (TRBNA) (de Strasser et al. 2016 ).The land use dimension: Water -Soil-Waste Nexus (Avellan et al. 2017 )The Water-Soil-Waste (WSW) Nexus complements the WEF Nexus (UNU Flores2015 ), and asks how resources should be managed to tackle sustainable management.The addition of waste as a resource dimension that often gets omitted in the sectorbased approaches shall arguably result in more effective and efﬁcient solutions toproblems (Avellan et al. 2017 ).The climate adaptation dimension: The Land —Climate —Energy Nexus (Daleet al. 2011 )The Land—Climate—Energy Nexus focuses explicitly on the intersectoral depen-dencies of competitive land use, energy production and the related climate changeimpacts, based on an integrated analysis of climate change, land-use, energy andwater strategies for mitigation and for adaptation purposes.The resources dimension: The Minerals —Energy Nexus (McLellan 2017 )The Minerals-Energy Nexus according to McLellan ( 2017 ) describes the interlink-ages between the extraction and use of mineral resources and the necessary energysupply, underlining energy as necessary resource for the minerals production, butalso the necessary minerals to produce energy. The Minerals-Energy Nexus has alsoa WR dimension in the moment when minerals are extracted from catchments, andparticularly from rivers. This interlinkage was recently illustrated by Schneider et al.(2018a ) using the example of the sand extraction from rivers in South East Asia andthe impact of water power stations as barriers for the sediment transport.The educational dimension: Teaching -Reserch -Practice Nexus (Schneider et al.2018b )Like three-bottom-line of sustainability includes social, ecological and environmen-tal issues, the Teaching-Research-Practice Nexus (TRPN) describes the co-equalexistence of teaching, research and practice in institutions of Higher Education. As aframework for the implementation of sustainability in Higher Education, the TRPNis intended to lead to the integration of an intensive reference to practice in teachingand research.18 F. Reinstorf et al.The regional dimension: Spaces -Practices -Goods Nexus (Schneider and Popovici2018 )The Spaces—Practises—Goods Nexus in the light of water resources refers to thesustainable consumption of locally produced goods representing the regional identity,which promotes the valorisation of regional value chains of sustainably producedgoods.The project intends to open up a complementing Nexus dimension, the Soci-ety-Education -Research Nexus , which describes the socio-economic dimension ofsustainability implementation approaches, particularly through educational activi-ties. The Society-Education-Research Nexus describes the interlinkages between theconditions for the resilience and adaptive capacity of a society, promoted through for-mal and non-formal education for capacity building on water resources conservationand climate adaptation, based on state of the art research.Integrated Water Resources Management—PracticalApplicationAs mentioned above, the curriculum shall include teaching as well as a practicalapplication on IWRM, based on particular regional data bases for river basins in Cubaand Ecuador. The pilot catchments for practical education shall serve as modellingsite for water resources and conservation as well as for the stakeholder analysis tounderstand the real life problems of competing water uses. In the ideal case, thepilot catchments can be used for the stakeholder participation process under theWater-Energy-Food Nexus perspective.Administrating Water Resources—The InstitutionalDimensionThe conservation and sustainable use of water resources is based on the provisionthat water resources are managed and administrated properly in order to avoid over-exploitation and pollution. For a sustainable administration is the establishment ofreliable, transparent and functionable institutional settings, which includes a sufﬁ-cient administrative structure acting under the requirements for good governance.W ATERMAS will outline key aspects for the institutional dimension.Water Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 19Protecting Water and Biodiversity Resources—The SocialDimensionThe protection of water and biodiversity resources that are essential for the long termprovision of water-related ecosystem services. Capacity building in terms of waterand biodiversity resources conservation can support the awareness development forthis problem. W ATERMAS will outline key aspects for the social dimension andhow to prepare capacity building to rase awareness for the protection of water andbiodiversity resources.V alorising Water and Biodiversity Resources—The EconomicDimensionWater is a good for nutrition, and the protection of water resources requires itsvalorisation in economic terms along the product value chain. Therefore, informationon water extraction and distribution investments, water treatment methodologies andtheir operational cost as well as on resulting tariffs for the water consumer must beincluded. Relevant are also innovative water conservation strategies like payment forecosystem services (PES). W ATERMAS will outline key aspects for the economicdimension, under consideration of the environmental and institutional dimensions.Engineered and Nature Based Solutions for the Mitigationof Climate Change Impacts and Disasters—The EngineeringPerspectiveBy now, the majority of solutions for mitigation of climate change extremes anddisasters are engineered solutions, like high tide reservoirs or dams. On the way tothe implementation of sustainable development solutions, the International Union forConservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) fosters nature-based solutions(NbS) to address global societal challenges (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016 ). Accordingto Cohen-Shacham et al. ( 2016 ), nature-based solutions use ecosystems and theirservices to address challenges like climate change, food security or natural disasters.IUCN deﬁnes NbS as: “ Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore naturalor modiﬁed ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively,simultaneously providing human well -being and biodiversity beneﬁts .”Examples of nature-based solutions for climate protection and adaptation includethe conservation of peatlands as important CO2storage, the renaturation of ﬂood-plains as retention areas to mitigate ﬂood peaks, and the use of urban green to retentheavy rainfall events in cities. W ATERMAS will provide key aspects for the imple-mentation of the engineering perspective in the curriculum.20 F. Reinstorf et al.Internalisation of Externalities—The EnvironmentalPerspectiveWater disagreements can occur when opposing interests concern the fair distributionof water resources and especially, when they are superimposed by externalities, e.g.a situation that inﬂuences the welfare of individuals or a community (Young 2000 ).Typical externalities that lead to water disputes or conﬂicts are upstream-downstreamproblems (Kelsey 2009 ), like water pollution or missing ﬂood risk management thatimpact the downstream user. The way to resolve externalities in a sustainable wayis the internalisation of the externalitie’s cost back to the causer of the externality,based on the polluter-pays-principle. In case of transboundary water resources, theresolving of water disputes through internalisation of externalities is supported byhydropolitics. W ATERMAS will outline key aspects for the environmental dimen-sion, under consideration of the economic and institutional dimensions.ConclusionsNatural resources and biodiversity are essential to the economies of the LAC region,where the many threats of climate change to water and biodiversity conservationpose a serious risk to their socio-economic development. Scope of the W ATERMASproject is to address these aspects through the development of international masterprograms on water management and climate change. The project will develop andestablish a new standard of higher educational and scientiﬁc knowledge exchangebetween European and LAC countries. This will be done leveraging existing Master’scourses/programs of Water Management at the partner universities.The water-related challenges facing the LAC region have to do with variations inclimate and hydrology and with the administrative level to which the managementcorresponds. Other factors with equal or greater importance are the differences in thenature and effectiveness of the institutional systems, the disparities in the distributionand demographic structure of the population and macroeconomic factors relatedto world trade. An increase in water abstraction due to increasing population andeconomic development is expected above all in the LAC region.The W ATERMAS project addresses these challenges under the Teaching-Research-Practice Nexus (TRPN), particularly the Sustainability Development Goals(SDG) 4 (Quality Education), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 11 (Sustainable Citiesand Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). The scope of W ATERMAS is toimplement sustainability approaches in the curricula of higher education institu-tions through the development of (key) competences that make it possible to act witha future-oriented and global perspective (Adomßent and Michelsen 2006 ; Mochizukiand Fadeeva 2010 ; Rieckmann 2012 ).Water Management and Climate Change in the Focus … 21Acknowledgements This project has been funded with support from the European Commission.This publication reﬂects the views only of the author, and the Commission cannot be held responsiblefor any use which may be made of the information contained therein.ReferencesAdomßent M, Michelsen G (2006) German Academia heading for sustainability? reﬂections onpolicy and practice in teaching, research and institutional innovations.

Mendoza-Jimenez and Paul HerreraAbstract In the last decade, the Ecuadorian government has designed and imple-mented a variety of policies to enhance the conditions of mangrove forests and theirability to provide ecosystem services. The present work aims to identify the differentpolicies related to mangrove conservation and evaluate the extent to which they pro-duce different outcomes to the population in the Gulf of Guayaquil, a coastal regionhosting more than 70% of mangroves in Ecuador. The main assumption underlyingthis effort is the notion that mangrove conservation might be critically linked to sub-jective measures of welfare improvement for populations that live in and depend onthis ecosystem, in addition to their original conservation purposes. Based on evidenceof recent studies, an institutional economic analysis using the Situation, Structure andPerformance framework is conducted. Results report evidence supporting the origi-nal assumption, as well as identiﬁed challenges to the continuity of current policiesand new but urgent avenues for future research.IntroductionThe Gulf of Guayaquil (GG) represents an exceptional case study whereby theneed for development meets the need for mangrove conservation. Around 71.4%of the Ecuadorian mangrove extension is located in this area (Bravo Cedeño 2010 ).Mangrove resource users deal with high levels of unsatisﬁed basic needs, poverty,D. Ortega-Pacheco ·M. J.

Around half of these products are sold to intermediaries and therest, in markets located in Guayaquil, Machala, and Playas. Mangrove extraction iscommonly destined to wood and carbon industries, construction and handcrafts (CI2016a ). Tourism is another income source that demands food service, supplied bylocal ﬁsheries, but generates considerable wastes (CI 2016b ). Additionally, a greatnumber of commercial productive activities, especially those involving shrimp farm-ing (Bravo Cedeño 2010 ), take place around these populations, and they also facethe pressure of densely populated urban cities—with their associated pollution, suchas Guayaquil (Montaño and Robadue 1995 ).There is an increasing necessity to generate valuable information to inform pol-icy design that allows tackling sustainability challenges in the GG, for it is also thesame location where most of the Ecuadorian marine biodiversity seems to exist (Cruzet al. 2003 ). This area is being threatened by increasing rates of loss of species, suchas birds (Alava and Haase 2011 ), as well as ecological and socio-economic factors(Twilley et al. 2001 ), such as Urban, industrial, agricultural, as well as other aqua-culture development (Alvarez-Mieles et al. 2013 ). Environment and water qualityare particularly sensitive to changes in the use of land (Twilley et al. 1998 ). This factbecomes relevant considering that, according to (Cuesta et al. 2017 ), conservationsloopholes/voids have been identiﬁed precisely in zones located in the central andsouthern coastal areas.Empowering and strengthening laws and regulations is necessary to achieve a legalprotection of endangered species and the conservation of the ecosystem. Decentraliz-ing the management of protected areas may contribute to this purpose, by improvingthe provision and impact of public services through an increased role of communi-ties and local governments in the decision-making (Wright et al. 2016 ). Accordingto ofﬁcial statements from organisms such as the Ministry of Environment (MAE),there is political will among Ecuadorian authorities to explore a decentralized man-agement system that transfers responsibilities and beneﬁts as a mean to preserveenvironmental services that beneﬁt the present and future users of the mangrove(MAE 2013 ). On this respect, there exist ongoing endeavours to design a network ofmarine protected areas that adapts to an institutional context and empowers differentgovernment levels to interconnect fragmented areas of the ecosystem and beneﬁt userpopulations (CI 2016a ,b). This must be evaluated in a double context, where (i) man-grove user communities continue living in considerable levels of poverty and theirincome via cash transfers will likely reduce due to budget restrictions. And (ii) thereis a growing interest in beneﬁts that can be obtained from carbon sinks (Hamiltonand Lovette 2015 ) and protection against ﬂoods (Frappart et al. 2017 )—particularlyin Guayaquil, the world’s third city with largest impact on GDP per capita due toclimate change (Hallegatte et al. 2013 ; Reguero et al. 2015 ). Both services (sink andprotection) could help develop a redistribution system of beneﬁts in exchange forcompensations that weigh-off the opportunity cost of conservation, and help improvelife conditions of mangrove users and those who depend on that ecosystem, withinand outside the GG.Mangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 27During the last decade, the Ecuadorian government has designed and implementedset of public policies aiming to improve mangroves’ health and their capacity toprovide ecosystem services. The assumption underlying these actions is the idea thatmangrove conservation may be related to an improvement of local welfare withinthe population that lives and depends on this ecosystem. In particular, populationsthat cohabit with mangrove ecosystems execute actions that allow them to improvetheir life conditions, and thus their well-being. These actions are related (1) withresources that the policy claims to preserve and (2) the ways in which the communitycan organize in general to achieve their objectives, speciﬁcally, in relation to theimplementation of public policy (Andersson and Gibson 2007 ).The extent to which policy objectives are met is the result of a dynamic wherethe subject of the policy, the community, plays a double role as both origin and des-tination. This, in turn, evidences the need for a careful analysis of experiences fromeach community in order to replicate the path obtained from successful case studies(Miteva et al. 2012 ). From this perspective, the present work attempts to answer therecent, yet global call (Brockington and Wilkie 2015 ) to further evaluation studiesthat pave the way for improving the understanding of how different political instru-ments produce distinct outcomes for populations. Based on locations in the GG, thispaper explores the relationship among three types of governance schemes [(i) cen-tralized, (ii) decentralized or communal, and (iii) decentralized or communal withcentralized incentives], different categories of protected areas, conservation prac-tices and their impacts in human welfare. The analysis derives from an exploratoryanalysis of secondary information. First, a critical revision of multiple sources thatinclude peer-reviewed publications, ofﬁcial and academic studies, as well as reportsand documentation on public policy. In addition, a recently completed study by Her-rera et al. ( 2017 ) provides updated input to understand the perspective from whichbeneﬁciaries of mangrove forests in the GG evaluate conservation policies. Thiswork has been designed as to provide baseline information that will allow deeperunderstanding of how public policy may impact human welfare, i.e. ﬁshermen andcollectors in the GG.The study continues with a second section in which mangrove-related policies rel-evant to our area of study are presented chronologically. The third section describesthe different policies in consideration. The fourth section explores the state of imple-mentation of the policies from a critical perspective of the interaction of three spheres,by arranging the information collected so far into a Situation, Development and Per-formance scheme proposed by Schmid ( 2004 ), a tool that allows for the analyticalassessment of an institutional impact. Preliminary reﬂexions will be procured in orderto identify future options for the design, implementation, evaluation and improve-ment of mangrove conservation policy in the area of study, which will be presented inthe end. The understanding derived from this analysis may inform policy-designersinvolved in mangrove conservation and welfare improvement in Ecuador.28 D. Ortega-Pacheco et al.Chronology of Policies Relevant to the Study AreaAccording the Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008, the population has the right to livein a safe and balanced environment (Art. 14), and the State should procure theconservation of nature by means of programs in which communities participate (Art.57). From a legal perspective, the State acknowledges and guarantees nature’s rights(Art. 71). Environmental legislation of 2003 reafﬁrms that mangrove conservation isin the public interest and thus, prohibits its destruction or exploitation. In addition,ancestral communities are allowed to request permission to serve as “mangroveguardians”.1A chronological revision of the legal framework related to mangrove conservationin Ecuador identiﬁes three periods relevant to this research. Each of them is charac-terized by the assigned role to mangrove land, the allocation of extraction rights andits assessed social value.(1) 1970–1985: Between 1976 and 1979, unexploited lands were taken over, andthe redistribution of land forced the expansion of agricultural borders amidstlandowners, who did not want to lose their underused but biodiversity-rich terri-tories (IICA 1990 ). Furthermore, permissions were granted to shrimp farmers topromote the productive transformation of those territories (Coello et al. 2008 ).(2) 1985–2010: In 1985 the conservation, protection and reposition of mangroveforests were declared “in the public interest”, via presidential decree and envi-ronmental law reforms. In 1999 the government conceded ancestral communi-ties the right to request “custodia” (Acuerdos de Uso Sustentable y Custodiadel Manglar) agreements. In 2000, the MAE communicated the guidelines toconcede custodias to ancestral communities and traditional users.(3) 2010–present: A decade later in 2011 the MAE determined the economic costfor the loss of environmental goods and services—including restoration cost-s—provided by mangrove forests: $89,273.01/ha. In 2014, a new instrumentwith monetary incentives was introduced to promote the conservation and sus-tainable use of mangrove forests: Socio Manglar, an extension of the programSocio Bosque. Socio Manglar attempts to complement, consolidate and improvethe results achieved by the previous custodias in a way that guarantees conser-vation, while enhancing life conditions for users. By January 2017, 23 SocioManglar agreements were active in the coastal region.The evolution of the Ecuadorian policy for mangrove conservation is marked byyear 2000 as the continuation of a neoliberal trend in the context of usage of naturalresources and ecosystem services (Beitl 2016 ), which in turn emerged like a potential1During the ﬁnal stage of the elaboration of this paper, the new Organic Code on the Environmentwas issued in Ecuador, motivated by the necessity of harmonizing and organizing the multifold andcomplex national legislation. The understanding of this dynamic is satisfactory: the unavoidablefact that this new legal framework will modify the competences of regulatory entities and guarantorsof mangrove conservation; as well as the interaction with user communities and subjects of publicpolicy.Mangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 29solution to the conﬂict of land usage between shrimp farmers and mangrove custo-dias. The introduction of new policies implies the introduction of new systems ofincentives. The identiﬁcation of these incentives is necessary to determine the extentto which results may be attributed to the objectives of the policy, which in additionto resource conservation, seek welfare improvement in the communities involved.Stylized Facts of Policies Implemented in the Area of StudyIn the present study, public policies are considered, according to Article no. 85 in theConstitution, as instruments oriented to implement the Ecuadorian rights, includingthe concept of “Buen Vivir”. Such instruments include formal institutions (i.e. norms,regulations) that have been designed, implemented and evaluated by the organisationsinvolved in mangrove conservation.The policies were selected according to a criteria related to the impact or incidencecapacity of the policy in the selected mangrove areas. They have been applied todifferent levels, allowing for a comparison of their respective efﬁciency to alterhuman welfare. It must also be mentioned that this study has not considered policiesthat directly targeted welfare and could have additionally impacted the mangroveecosystem positively. In order to meet the objectives, the analysis will focus on thepolicy instruments described in Table 1.The protected areas are managed by the government (centralized), represented bythe MAE and its local ofﬁces (State). Thus, they operate under prescriptive regulatorytools, known as command-and-control regulation. On the other hand, mangrove areasgranted as custodias belong to the State, but their administration has been delegatedto the organization that signed the agreement (decentralized). Upon approval of aproposed management plan, the government grants local mangrove users the accessto consumption and commercialization of mangrove resources, mainly crabs andclams. Thus, this is an instrument in which actors participate voluntarily in co-management with the governmental authority. Custodias are numerous but small interms of extension. Associations that have been granted a custodia are eligible forthe third type of policy: Socio Manglar program, which provides a monetary transferconditioned on the implementation of a yearly investment plan, in addition to themanagement plans.30 D.

( 2007)bSustainable use of mangroves, category of the National Forest HeritageState of Implementation and Effects of the Main MangroveConservation Policies in the Gulf of GuayaquilThis section analyses how the policies could have impacted the health of mangroveforests and their associated ecosystem services. Theory-based hypothesis will beidentiﬁed, which will be preliminarily explored by using evidenced obtained byHerrera et al. ( 2017 ) and similar studies carried out in the past.Once having described the conservations policies, the Situation, Structure and Per-formance (SSP) analysis framework may be applied. Such a tool is useful to evaluateand compare instruments in contexts that take into account performance and insti-tutional relations (Wells 1998 ). The SSP framework, proposed by Schmid ( 2004 ),allows for the speciﬁcation of relations and description of attributes of goods andservices that create human and ecosystem interdependencies (situations); the explo-ration of characteristics of alternative institutional arrangements (structures); and,the evaluation of the relative effectiveness between those alternatives with respectto the socially desirable objective (performance). The analysis furthered below issummarized in Table 4.Mangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 31SituationWithin this analytical framework, the elements that relate to each other in order tobuild up the situation, are identiﬁed as: transaction (unit of analysis), interdependen-cies and stakeholders (government, communal organization and users). A transactionis an interaction space between individuals and contexts in which costs are alwaysinvolved. In this case, the reference lies on the provision of mangrove conservationand its relation with ecosystem services to ﬁshermen residing in the communitieswithin the area of study. Such services include reproduction and feeding of differentkinds of ﬁsh, molluscs and crustaceans of considerable importance for good nutritionand as a sustainable economic source.Three key interdependencies that seem to emerge in ﬁshing communities in theGG, as hinted by the characteristics of mangrove services and actors involved intransactions of conservation provision: (1) potential incompatible or alternative useof the mangrove for extractive purposes, reaching the point where the quantity andquality of the catches are affected; (2) price problems associated with the provisionof conservation services, where the marginal cost of additional users is too low whencompared to the very high cost of exclusion of extractive users from neighboringcommunities; and (3) lack of information regarding transaction costs.A systematic analysis of the problem of incompatible use of the mangrove withregards to all economically relevant species according to the inhabitants of the com-munities, is out of the scope of this study. What is being discussed is the incompatibleor alternative use of the mangrove for extractive activities related to clam catching byafﬁliated members of the considered associations that have been granted a custodia. Itsufﬁces to mention that, ﬁrst, the interdependencies emerging from the incompatibleuse of mangroves are linked to questions related to property rights over the extractedresource. Solutions to this problem, once the extraction rights have been allocatedand effectively restricted, will essentially depend on whether the continuous use ofmangrove for extraction purposes contributes more to members of the community(or external users) than the negative impact on the revenues of afﬁliated members.Consequently, associates might consider accepting a payment for discontinuing thenon-compliance of ﬁshing closures and respecting extraction rights or implementingsurveillance activities in joint cooperation with the public force and environmentalauthorities, in such a way that private practices of a user do not affect others’.Secondly, while the extraction of clams is a service subject to consumption rivalry(i.e. Fisherman man A may not share the catch obtained by Fisherman B), themarginal cost of admitting an additional member is virtually zero, once exclusiveextraction rights have been allocated, following an optimal distribution scheme thatrespects population dynamics of the resource. Additionally, a certain level of jointconsumption of the clams’ quality can be observed, i.e. all members should obtainthe same quality in a system of extraction rights. Allocating rights and identifyingthe optimal ﬁshing level are characterized by high ﬁxed costs and almost null costsof incorporating an additional user. For this reason, the price of extraction rightsshould allow for the distribution, among all users, of the—relatively—high ﬁxed32 D. Ortega-Pacheco et al.costs associated with the design, implementation and administration of the systemof extraction rights.Thirdly, incomplete information on mangrove conservation and its effect on thequantity and quality of the catch may hinder the service provision, as well as affectcosts of transaction. Although it is possible for ﬁshermen associations to controlthe catches of its users by keeping track of the quantity and sizes of their catches,determining and monitoring the extraction of non-members and foreign ﬁshermenis more complicated, if not impossible, or at least very costly. This is particularlyimportant when considering the lack of technical and scientiﬁc information relatedto optimization of the catch of clams and its population conditions. In many cases,associated and non-associated users ignore the speciﬁc steps that must be undertakenin order to achieve a certain quantity and quality of the catch, contributing to the levelof uncertainty and transaction costs associated to the de facto arrangements betweenthe association accountable for the custodia and its neighbors, including ﬁshermenfrom other regions, also known as independents or pirates (i.e. free riders).StructureThe alternative structures presented include: (i) command-and-control compulsoryinstruments of direct action as in the case of protected areas; (ii) indirect actioninstruments with decentralized governance schemes created to reconcile commu-nity development and conservation by promoting the sustainable use or alternativeincome sources such as custodias (i.e. co-management); (iii) direct instruments witheconomic incentives conditioned on assessable performance, which is presumablyable to achieve additional progress by linking conservation and development, as inthe case of Socio Bosque (i.e. co-management with cash payments as incentives).PerformanceIn this section, the characteristics of the alternative institutional arrangements—-types of policy instruments for the management of mangrove areas—will be consid-ered in order to eventually make predictions about their likely outcomes. Followingthese predictions, a discussion regarding the expected future performance of thesestructures in the considered associations, will be furthered. Potential strengths andweaknesses of the policies will be identiﬁed, considering the recent data obtained byHerrera et al. ( 2017 ) and similar works in the past.According to Miteva et al. ( 2012 ), the diversity of impacts caused by decen-tralized policies is explained by the ambiguity of the term “decentralization”. Theimplications of a decentralized policy may vary in terms of the policy’s scope, theperceived beneﬁts, the rights granted to the different populations and also, the deci-sion power—increasing the authority of bureaucrats at lower levels or the authorityto local users (Larson and Soto 2008 ). Many developing countries have transitionedtowards decentralized forestry governance schemes during the last 25 years (Phelpset al. 2010 ), on the premise that rights and responsibilities of local actors wouldincrease (Agrawal and Ostrom 2008 ). In fact, decision-making autonomy at alocal level is associated with greater levels of ecosystem services (i.e. carbon)Mangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 33and greater beneﬁts to living conditions (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009 ). Despitesuccessful experiences, several authors state that the decentralized implementationstill faces big challenges: inefﬁciencies and weaknesses in the legal and institutionalframeworks have resulted in mismanagement and misappropriation; a high degreeof non-compliance; conﬂicts among users; and tension and lack of trust among thedifferent levels and sections of the government. These factors have resulted in theweakness or lack of empowerment of the poorest users in the system (Wever et al.2012 ). In a recent study, Wright et al. ( 2016 ) point out that decentralization maypositively impact deforestation while involving communities and local governments,by relating their interests with local political actors and their corresponding agendas.In the case of Ecuador, Beitl ( 2017 ) argues that it is critical for the success ofcustodias to empower ﬁshermen with administrative rights. Despite the fact thatthey promote quantitative and qualitative improvements of the catch, they could alsolimit access and mobility of ﬁshermen, which could result in a reconﬁguration ofﬁshing areas and displacement of non-members from their customary work space.In fact, current policies might not seem to introduce enough individual incentives toabide by the regulations, but they do seem to introduce enough incentives at grouplevel to safeguard the base of the resources, that is, the habitat. The improvement ofthe habitat’s conditions should cause indirect and positive effects in ﬁshing activities(Barbier 2003 ). This way, explains Beitl, the policies seem to have promoted a notionof group appropriation that has fostered care for the environment.An integral assessment of the results obtained by these policies is outside therange of this study, however there are a few available. Among these few, the studyof Coello et al. ( 2008 ) stands out for evaluating 26 custodias granted between 2000and 2004. Despite the problems outlined and the diversity of results, general positiveeffects were observed: empowerment of associations, increase of ﬁshing output,enhancement of living conditions, decrease of mangrove deforestation and conﬂictresolution with shrimp farmers. Technical assistance provided by non-governmentalorganizational has been relevant in successful custodias.The recent work of Herrera et al. ( 2017 ) provides updated data on the perceptionof the effectiveness of the three instruments, according to ﬁshermen residing inthe Gulf of Guayaquil. Table 2shows a detailed summary of the studied locationsand approximate population of ﬁshermen and collectors, according to each policy.Figure 1shows the geographic locations of the study.The gathering of primary data involved the application of a questionnaire com-pleted by a sample of 435 individuals during February to November 2017; the esti-mated universe was 2138 ﬁshermen and collectors. The elaboration of the surveywas previously designed and tested with input obtained from focus groups in whichkey actors (among others, local authorities, non-governmental actors, governmentalactors, ﬁshermen, collectors) took part.The study concludes that the policies have favoured the protection and restoringof mangroves in the GG (approximately 1515 ha) during the period 2002–2016,compared to locations in the GG where no policies were implemented. Table 3summarizes the results from the survey related to perceptions of the effectiveness ofthe policies under analysis.34 D.

Regarding the awareness of the existence of Socio Manglar, 27% of the sampleconﬁrmed knowing it. An association between this information and the type ofpolicy and location was veriﬁed. Within areas with custodias, Socio Manglar wasreportedly identiﬁed more that it was in protected areas or the control zone.With respect to the economic incentive (cash transfer) that characterizes this pol-icy, 98% indicates that his household has not received any payment for the ser-vice of conserving the mangroves. 42% of the portion that knows Socio ManglarMangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 37reported a neutral stance when evaluating the argument “community resourcesare well administered”.The information presented in Table 3. has been considered to complete the thirdcolumn of the SPP framework in Table 4. The performance of mangrove conservationpolicies in the GG can be condensed with results obtained from the preliminaryanalysis. Basically, the performance effects reported are observed in the three typesof policies at different scales.About the combined use of incentives to improve the performance of custo-dias. Empirical estimations based on ﬁeld experiments in other Ecuadorian regions(Moreno-Sánchez et al. 2015 ) seem to support the notion that additional revenuesfrom Socio Manglar could be enough to incentivise appropriate behaviour by afﬁli-ated users, and additionally pave the way for a collective impact on the ecosystem’shealth, i.e. program’s transfer payment equivalent to the opportunity cost of surveil-lance, administration, participation in meetings and other activities. Similar to Her-rera et al., Moreno-Sánchez’ study indicates that users’ behaviour is greatly impulsedby motifs such as the well-being of other members of the community—protectionof water quality, increase of job opportunities and improvement of ﬁsh quality, andin the same line as Beitl’s discussion, it was demonstrate that ﬁshermen who wereallowed to coordinate actions (including the extension of ﬁshing permits to third par-ties), extracted 20% less and invested almost twice in administration. Consequently,there seems to be a way to complement direct incentives by strengthening collec-tive action and communication capacities and coordination with the investment ofresources from Socio Manglar.Herrera’s work further relates to Moreno-Sánchez, while both studies report evi-dence that supports the possibility of exploring hybrid systems in which more thanone tool or instrument could be combined, allowing the maximization of beneﬁtswith the least additional ﬁnancial resources. In particular, there exist potential bene-ﬁts of combining custodias with Socio Manglar agreements in communities that havebeen impacted by ministerial decrees declaring their territories as protected areas. Apotential challenge to these hybrid approaches might be transaction costs associatedto the identiﬁcation and implementation of those alternative extraction practices thatcould result in provable changes in quantity and quality of ﬁsh in speciﬁc custodiaareas.Previous studies might not compare to Herrera’s when considering the effect intro-duced by large shrimp farms in neighbouring areas, both in ecosystems’ health dueto quality of the water they dispose and the incentives they represent to weaken com-munity organization, given the potential effect on the demand of collective beneﬁts.The impact of large urban areas in the vicinity of mangrove forests is yet anotherthreat to a habitat’s health, which in turn threatens species in terms of quantity andquality. In this context, the positive effect of Socio Manglar may dissipate due tothe immediate access to alternative sources of income or disincentives by poachingactivities.38 D.

These proposalsderive from the perceived conﬂicts in the relations of interdependence between theecosystem and its users, as well as the identiﬁed weaknesses in the management ofprotected areas and associations as “custodios” of the mangrove, and of course, theavailability of information to researchers.(1) Explore the REDD+ mechanism to provide ﬁnancial sustainability and ﬁs-cal surplus, while decentralizing management and distributing internationalresources to decentralized governments and communities. Connectivity couldbe further guaranteed through the Network of Marine Coastal Areas. This maybe institutionalized by incorporating it in the renewed management plans andsocio-ecological modelling for decision-making (Arias-Hidalgo et al. 2013 ;Busch et al. 2012 ; Frappart et al. 2017 ).(2) Use of subsidies or tax systems as alternatives of funding for initiatives thathave achieved impact (Rode et al. 2016 ).(3) Complement with hybrid systems and buffer areas where a sustainable useof aquaculture, geographic origin and improvement of conservation units arefurthered (i.e., carbon neutrality in protected areas and custodias) (Alava andHaase 2011 ; Egelyng 2014 ; Fisher et al. 2011 ).(4) Effectiveness evaluation of each type of instrument (Brockington and Wilkie2015 ).(5) Improve integral planning at an executive level to avoid power and jurisdictiondisputes (Wever et al. 2012 ).(6) Strengthen the role of organizations that provide technical assistance, such thatit includes follow-ups to the agreements (Bravo 2013 ; Curzon and Kontoleon2016 ).(7) Guarantee exclusive rights and reduce transaction costs by improving infor-mation for optimal extraction and implementing a registration system in asso-ciations (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008 ; Beitl 2014a ).(8) Facilitate the optimization of ﬁshing portfolio and transfer payments to reduceincome uncertainty and high transaction costs (Moreno-Sánchez et al. 2015 ;Raes et al. 2016 ).(9) Construct capacities that builds up conﬁdence and maintain participation byconsidering the observed impact in the bettering of living conditions (Beitl2014b ).(10) Productive improvement and income diversiﬁcation: access to markets withoutintermediaries and value-aggregation (Clements et al. 2014 ).Regarding future perspectives, the ﬁnancial sustainability of Socio Manglar programis a concern. Especially considering the ﬁscal conditions of Ecuador in the following40 D. Ortega-Pacheco et al.years, in light of decreasing oil revenues and increasing foreign debt. Thus, it becomesrelevant to consider the exploration of alternative funding mechanisms for initiativesthat have proven to impact positively. An option might be the implementation ofsubsidies or tax systems. Typically, these instruments imply income redistributionamong the user sectors and beneﬁciaries of the healthy conditions of the mangroves,i.e. community collectors, shrimp farmers and urban populated centres.In order to guarantee changes to human welfare and the ecosystem’s health, alter-native resources might be sought to maximize the beneﬁts of optimal ﬁshing extrac-tion. An alternative might be technical assistance that expose associations to betterpractices (e.g. food processing and preservation) along the value-chain, as well asassociative capacities for crab and clam extraction through commercial sales (aliveand pulp). Gender roles may be empowered considered that men extract and womenprocess, with a better distribution of beneﬁts based on effort and knowledge. Productdiversiﬁcation may involve the sales of decorative and crafty products with added-value.ConclusionsThe discussion presented supports the hypothesis that the impact of mangrove conser-vation policies might happen by alternative mechanisms different than the provisionof larger ﬁshing resources or catches, and instead, they might impact the subjectiveelements of welfare, such as the potential organizational capacities and increasedmember participation. Although this is the reality of communities in the GG, theycannot be extended to diagnose the general situation of all peoples under mangroveconservation policies. In this sense, a systematic analysis of a sample of custodiasis currently necessary to understand the cultural context in which these mechanismswere implemented, and also identify key factors that explain the resulting level ofcollaboration, whether it was higher or lower. Future research should also targetthe improvement of evaluation systems of the studied policies in a context of rela-tions of governances schemes, organization and socio-ecological modelling with afocus on scenery. The resulting information will likely render valuable input for thedesign of hybrid instruments that combine international resource ﬂows, as well asthose from REDD +, and the articulation of management networks of conservationunits, deconcentrating responsibilities and beneﬁts while at the same time approachthe sustainable use and development needs of user populations. Additionally, incor-porating risks and uncertainty in the decision-making process of mangrove usersmay allow for a better understanding of their relationship with the implementationand effectiveness of the policies under analysis, while at the same time increasingpublic funds that might be required to outweigh the total cost of mangrove conser-Mangrove Conservation Policies in the Gulf of Guayaquil 41vation.

The French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity(FRB) and ORÉE, a multi-stakeholder NGO advocating the sharing of good envi-ronmental practices among stakeholders, explored potential ways to approach thecomplexity of climate, energy and biodiversity issues in order to develop sustainablesolutions. They have been studying the links and interactions between renewableenergy and biodiversity through, among others, a conference organized by FRB anda book published by ORÉE.

Hallosserie et al.sures taken to avoid, reduce or offset biodiversity impacts when installing renewableenergy infrastructures. This experience sharing highlighted several ways forward inorder to reconcile biodiversity protection with the shift towards sustainable energy.Thus, the need to better take biodiversity into account in the energy transition wasvoiced both by businesses and the research community. This paper presents the ﬁrstoutcomes of the reﬂections led at the national level by multiple stakeholders, in orderto generate further ideas for research to support the design and implementation ofintegrated climate change and biodiversity policies.IntroductionClimate change has numerous negative, well-established effects for human popula-tions (IPCC 2014 ). Solutions to mitigate climate change are now widely promotedacross the world, with an increasing urge in the wake of the adoption of the ParisAgreement in December 2015. Action is required in all areas of human lifestyle,including the energy we use and how we produce it. Many European countries,including France, have identiﬁed the energy sector as a strategic area to achieve theirtargets of reducing carbon emissions by developing renewables and phasing out fossilfuels (French Government 2015 ,2017 ). This is known as the Energy Transition.Biodiversity loss is the other key global challenge faced by our societies, andthe result of multiple and varied drivers, including climate change (Ceballos et al.2017 ; Crooks et al. 2017 ; Hallmann et al. 2017 ). The main driver however is land-use change, natural or semi-natural areas being converted into intensive agriculturallands or cities as global population grow (Tilman et al. 2017 ). Land is thereforeunder competition for different uses, including renewable energy production, foodproduction and biodiversity conservation.In France, the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act aims to reduce GHG emis-sions and nuclear power, while increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix(French Government 2015 ). Three complementary courses of action should allow toreach these objectives: energy sobriety, which implies a change of behaviour through-out society; energy efﬁciency, which is achieved through technical improvement; anddevelopment of sustainable energy (Trommetter 2017 ). These goals, in line with theParis Agreement, led to the blooming of renewables. In 2015, they provided 10% ofenergy, including 40% from biomass (Cavaud et al. 2016 ), these ﬁgures highlightinga shift of the sector supported by major stakeholders. In parallel, the law for thereconquest of biodiversity, nature and landscapes (French Government 2016 )s e t shigh ambitions in line with CBD Aichi Targets and the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals, acknowledging their contribution to human well-being, including for climatemitigation and adaptation.This paper questions whether the beneﬁts of the energy transition in terms ofclimate mitigation are not actually contributing to further accelerate the erosion ofbiodiversity. It ﬁrst looks at the potential impacts of renewables on biodiversity, andthen shows how the recent developments of climate policy in France may reconcileBiodiversity Issues Should Be Better Taken into Account in the … 47biodiversity and climate policy. Finally, it presents several solutions to mainstreambiodiversity into the energy sector, building on science and stakeholders’ experience.It builds on existing literature, the proceedings of an event organised by the FrenchFoundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB) in October 2017 and on OREE’sguide (Trommetter 2017 ).The Impacts of Renewables on BiodiversityRenewables differ greatly in the sources they rely on (wind, water, sun, biomass,earth) and the technologies they resort to (e.g. ﬂoating or ﬁxed-bottom offshorewind turbines). They have smaller coverage than traditional energy (ﬁssile or fuel)and generate less power per production unit. It means that most renewable energystructures require a wide, dense installation network, affecting ecosystems where theyare settled. The energy transportation and storage network adds up to the resultingland-use change, a major cause of the erosion of biodiversity worldwide, and isbuilt with a range of non-renewable metals. Renewables depend on biodiversity forconstruction (provision of material), energy production, ecosystem services (e.g.water and wood provision), and inspiration through biomimicry. The materials tobuild the renewable energy infrastructures are transformed through the mining andmetallurgy industries which are heavy polluters for ecosystems (Trommetter 2017 ).The impacts of renewables on biodiversity will therefore vary along those linesthroughout their life cycle, and will also depend on the location of the infrastructure(in situ impacts). Ex situ impacts are for the larger part caused by the extraction ofmaterial for the construction of the infrastructures, including sand (e.g. for concrete,silicon), rare earths and copper, but also during operation phase when no-go areas(e.g. offshore wind farms) lead to the displacement and higher concentration ofpressures (e.g. ﬁshing) elsewhere in the natural habitats. The dismantling of theseinfrastructures and the recycling of materials are often complex, costly and limited.They have therefore huge impacts at end-of-life (e.g. dams, wind turbines, solarpanels) (Trommetter 2017 ).If all renewables have an impact on biodiversity, those with the highest onesare biomass energy, which may lead to the destruction of a whole ecosystem, andhydroelectricity, which may cut ecological continuums and prevent the circulationof species (Trommetter 2017 ). Hydroelectricity is expected to increase by 73% inthe next decades, with major dam projects planned on the Amazon, Mekong andCongo rivers. Their watersheds are among the most fragile ecosystems on earth andthe three rivers together represent 18% of freshwater ﬁsh biodiversity (Zarﬂ et al.2015 ). Solar, wind, tidal and geothermal energy mostly impact biodiversity at thespecies or individual level. Table 1largely builds on the synthesis by Gasparatos et al.(2017 ); Trommetter ( 2017 ) and UNEP ( 2016b ) to present for each energy source theprocesses that could impact biodiversity.As for nuclear power, France is still a major producer to meet its energy demand(75% of national electricity production), but the existing hot debate around that48 A.

In November2017, French Government revised its ambition to reduce nuclear power to 50% ofits energy mix by 2025 (French Government 2015 ) to 2030 at the earliest. It is seenas a realistic shift for climate, since scenarios indicate that reducing nuclear powerproduction to 50% by 2025 would imply emitting about twice more CO 2than todaythrough coal and gas energy production, to complement the production of electricityby renewables which would not be high enough (RTE 2017 ). Therefore, a 2030deadline could be relevant for reducing the share of nuclear power to 50% whilestabilizing CO2emissions. The energy mix with the lowest CO 2emissions (9 Mtinstead of 22 Mt today) could be achieved by 2035, but nuclear power would have tobe maintained to 56% of energy production (RTE 2017 ). These ﬁndings are in linewith McCombie and Jefferson ( 2016 ), who highlight that nuclear power generationhas levels of GHG emissions, waste generation and resource use comparable to theones of renewables. Brook and Bradshaw ( 2014 ) remind that when direct damage onbiodiversity is to be prevented, the best options for energy production are the onesusing as little resources as possible. The energy transition should therefore focuson a lower energy consumption, instead of a similar or increasing consumption ofclean energy from renewable sources. Recent progress in nuclear technology andgeneration IV nuclear plants based on thorium could meet the global demand fornon-carbon energy and thorium resources could last millions of years (Brook andBradshaw 2014 ). Today, uranium is still a cheap resource but treatment of radioactivewaste (by stocking or recycling) remains a major issue that needs to be solved, werenuclear power to become widely used (Brook and Bradshaw 2014 ). These issuesadd up to the negative impacts of nuclear power on biodiversity, including pollutionwhen extracting uranium and water temperature changes in rivers because of thecooling process. When looking at the product life cycle, including extraction andtransportation phases, renewables should be submitted to similar analysis as nuclearpower, in terms of biodiversity and climate outcomes. Science could bring answersBiodiversity Issues Should Be Better Taken into Account in the … 51to those questions, and contribute to the public debate which is strongly marked bythe general wariness against radiations. Despite the positive outlook nuclear powercould bring on energy production and biodiversity protection, the risk of a majornuclear disaster remains unresolved.Biodiversity Underlies the French Action Plan for ClimateEvery measure aiming to decrease the demand for energy is very positive for bio-diversity, while the shift from one source to another, be it renewable, is not: anykilowatt per hour that is not produced is an impact avoided on climate and on biodi-versity. Biodiversity stakeholders could seize this approach to strengthen their actionsfurther. More generally, promoting a restraint consumption in energy promotes anoverall austerity regarding the consumption of other natural resources, such as meat,another major source of GHG and of land-use change (FRB 2017 ).French Government released its Climate Plan in July 2017, describing how thecountry will implement the Paris Agreement. It contains several innovative guide-lines, and most actions refer, directly or not, to biodiversity, thus making this climatepolicy one of the most inclusive of biodiversity issues to date (Laurans and Rankovic2017 ). The seven ﬁrst objectives are dedicated to energy efﬁciency and energy sav-ings, including an ambitious target to renovate old buildings for thermal efﬁciency.Objective 15 of the Climate Plan deals with the critical challenge of decreasingimported deforestation (Henders et al. 2015 ) in France. Reducing imported defor-estation, though often referring to the production of food commodities, would alsoapply for biomass imported in France for energy production.The new French Climate Plan may contain some risks for biodiversity, mostlyrelated to two of its objectives. Objective 11 is about reaching carbon neutrality by2050, by limiting GHG emissions to the quantity that ecosystems on Earth are ableto absorb, acting as sinks. Given the current emission trends, this measure wouldput a tremendous pressure on ecosystems as this thirty-three-year timeframe is veryshort (Laurans and Rankovic 2017 ). Some questions need to be addressed if thisis to be achieved through afforestation: what is replaced by new forests? Whichtree species are planted? Carefully planned and implemented, this carbon policy canturn to an opportunity for biodiversity, only if it promotes the protection of existingcarbon-rich ecosystems. Objective 14 of the Climate Plan refers to speeding up thedevelopment of renewables, by simplifying procedures for setting up infrastructures.This reﬂects the well-spread idea that the development of renewables is hindered bycivil society’s actions resulting from a “not-in-my-backyard” behaviour (Mattmannet al. 2016 ), and that, for the energy transition to take place, appeal proceduresmust be streamlined. This measure of the Climate Plan could bear some threats tobiodiversity if it prevents local non-governmental organisations to question and stop,if needed, the development of renewable energy projects in biodiversity-sensitiveareas. As time goes, appeals are however less likely since developers come withmore sustainable cases, and this is indeed good news since appeals reveal a failure52 A. Hallosserie et al.of the consultation process. There are many tools to conduct local consultations,but they regularly fail because projects are not ﬂexible once the format is approved.Changing the qualiﬁcation, size and characteristics of projects after approval shouldbe simpliﬁed, and there would be a lesser need to change appeal procedures (Mermetet al. 2004 ).The Climate Plan is a positive development to advance biodiversity conservationin parallel with climate mitigation and adaptation. It stresses out the contributions ofa rich biodiversity and functioning ecosystems to the climate change ﬁght. However,it could go further in thinking forward the impacts, negative and positive, that someclimate policies, including the development of renewables, might have on biodiver-sity.Mitigating the Impacts of Renewables on Biodiversityfor an Ecological TransitionSo far, renewables have been promoted all as one, but this paper illustrates the vari-ety of impacts that different infrastructures relying on different power sources mayhave on biodiversity. Renewables should be prioritized, taking into account their efﬁ-ciency and impacts (Laurans and Rankovic 2017 ). Biodiversity stakeholders shouldparticipate in this prioritization process, which would be led by the stakeholdersof each energy branch otherwise, with the risk for biodiversity and water-relatedissues to be overlooked. More generally, biodiversity research should better addressenergy-related issues and biodiversity stakeholders should be more active in plat-forms dealing with biodiversity and energy, such as the Strategic EnvironmentalAssessments of the Plurennial Programme for Energy or the Regional Schemes forClimate, Air and Energy. The decentralization implied by the energy transition setsit in a local ground which requires a systemic approach of the territory and energyissues (Trommetter 2017 ).All participants to the event led by FRB on reconciling energy transition withbiodiversity preservation agreed on one obvious but primordial solution: to settlerenewable energy infrastructures in biodiversity-poor areas (FRB 2017 ). The othermajor point is to focus efforts on biodiversity mainstreaming in all sectors, includingenergy, as countries committed at the 13th Conference of Parties of the Conventionon Biological Diversity in 2016 (CBD 2016 ). This can be done for example bydeveloping biodiversity indicators for the energy transition, rather than looking onlyat carbon emissions. This would necessarily make the picture more complex, but it isnevertheless essential not to face unexpected and irreversible feedback throughout thebiosphere. These two guiding principles should then be complemented by a numberof approaches which were discussed at the conference organised by FRB and arepresented below.Biodiversity Issues Should Be Better Taken into Account in the … 53Spatial PlanningRenewable infrastructure would have lesser impacts on biodiversity if located farenough from protected areas (Marx 2017 ). Local studies are key to identify occurringspecies, their ecology and behaviour, which will in turn help understand the potentialimpacts of the infrastructure depending on its location or the time of year (e.g. duringthe migration period, about 60% of birds killed by wind turbines are sparrows, butthe species most vulnerable to turbines are birds of prey with very low numbersof individuals). A recent study from the French League for the Protection of Birds(LPO) reveals that twice more remains of birds are found by wind turbines settledwithin or nearby Natura 2000 protected areas than other turbines, and that the birdskilled are much more often listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species or onthe European Union Bird Directive (Marx 2017 ). The most lethal wind turbines areoften the older and smaller ones, which were built before the Natura 2000 networkwas completed and at a time when environmental legislation was weaker. Majorenergy companies shared their experience on spatial planning during the conference,explaining that when biodiversity issues are factored early in the project designand budget process, they can be addressed more easily: through a small changeof location (e.g. the reorientation of the methane terminal of Dunkirk by EDF) orthe addition of speciﬁc device (e.g. coloured disks on power lines to increase theirvisibility for birds). However, LPO observed that as for wind turbines, none of theexisting devices such as on/off functions controlled by cameras are efﬁcient enoughto remove the threat on birds, and that, for all kind of renewables, only avoidance ofkey biodiversity areas through spatial planning and ecological knowledge is a viablesolution to prevent negative impacts on biodiversity (FRB 2017 ).When this is not possible to mitigate impacts, offsetting must be undertaken(French Government 2016 ). For example the company Engie creates hedge ecosys-tems to compensate the destruction of natural areas for the settlement of its infras-tructure. This is in line with the “Avoid Reduce Offset” triumvirate ofﬁcialised bythe law on biodiversity of 2016, which is key to protect and restore biodiversity(Trommetter 2017 ).Guidance and MonitoringIn order to minimize the impact of renewable energy infrastructure, such as windturbines, on biodiversity, French operators have to monitor and report bat mortality tothe Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle on a yearly basis. However, submissionrate is less than 5%, and data is heterogeneous due to a lack of harmonization ofmethods and metadata (FRB 2017 ). Monitoring is crucial to assess the adequacyof guidance and policies for mitigating biodiversity impacts: the European Unionprovides guidance for wind turbines to be set up 200 m away from woods or hedges,but research has shown that they should be at least 1000 m away for species not to54 A. Hallosserie et al.suffer sublethal effects. It is estimated that 2400 km of hedges became unsuitable forbat habitat in Brittany and Loire regions due to the avoidance of wind turbines by thebats (Coly et al. 2017 ). Enforcement of recommendations is also an issue, for it isestimated that about 90% of wind turbines in France do not follow them. Monitoringthrough citizen science, like the US eBird platform, may be very helpful to providedata to assess the potential impacts of infrastructure such as wind turbines, and haveproved useful to make cases for relocation when it threatened protected species suchas bald and golden eagles (Sullivan et al. 2017 ). Civil society can also support theprocess, such as LPO who launched a large programme to assess the impacts ofwind-turbines on birds and develop solutions to reduce them (Trommetter 2017 ).EngineeringOne of the main difﬁculty in introducing biodiversity concern into decision makingprocess is to assess the reality of the impacts. Product life cycle analysis (LCA)could become a key tool to understand a broad range of the impacts renewableinfrastructure may have, during all phases, and to develop solutions to avoid ormitigate negative impacts. LCA can look at land-use change impacts by taxa, takingalso into account species endemism and vulnerability, based on IUCN data. Theindicators of potential species loss and potentially disappeared fraction of speciesare useful in that regard, but sensitivity of ecosystems, ecosystem fragmentation, localimpacts and differences of practice on the ground and genetic diversity are not yetaddressed in LCAs (UNEP 2016a ). At the current stage, LCAs help raise developers’awareness of key biodiversity issues, but the picture remains general. Research istherefore focusing on conceptualizing and operationalizing biodiversity into LCA.For example, LCAs could cover the ﬁve drivers of biodiversity loss identiﬁed inthe Millenium Ecosystem Assessment : while climate change, habitat change andpollution are factored in, invasive alien species and overexploitation are not. Suchnew approaches have not been used yet on renewable energy infrastructure (Veroneset al. 2015 ).Mobilizing ResearchOn top of the impact assessments of infrastructure for renewable energy, sciencehas also a key role to play to assess the impact of energy policies, at the Europeanand national level. For example, a large ﬁeld open for research is the viability of anenergy strategy relying on biomass. Biomass is a standalone source of energy sinceit is renewable only if the regeneration rate is higher than removal within a speciﬁctimeframe (Trommetter 2017 ). Therefore, more research is needed on the key fea-tures of forest biodiversity in order to fully understand the effects that exploitation ofbiomass would have on French forests, including the relationship between tree ageBiodiversity Issues Should Be Better Taken into Account in the … 55and biodiversity, the importance of dead wood, and biodiversity variations across for-est layers. Forest research could thus help improve the biodiversity potential of forestplantations for biomass exploitation, to avoid large, biodiversity-poor monocultureswithout undergrowth. However, the possibility for biomass-energy exploitation toremain within safe limits for biodiversity preservation will mostly depend on thescale of operation. Davi et al. (in prep.) studied the resilience of the social-ecologicalsystem around the biomass plant in Gardanne, Provence, which is the largest plantproducing energy from wood in France. They identiﬁed current biomass produc-tion levels in the plant’s wood-supply area, assessed the future production trends,evaluated existing ecosystem services and developed indicators on the status of theforest, while factoring in land property. Using a method of reverse engineering, theyfound that the plant would need 855,000 tons of wood by 2025, coming from a400 km radius, in order to be fully operational. This is twice more than the cur-rent volume of wood exploited in the administrative region of Provence-Alpes-Côted’Azur. The study shows that despite increasing forest area in France, current unex-ploited parcels are difﬁcult to access; it is therefore likely that pressure intensiﬁes incurrently exploited areas. Other factors such as climate change reinforce the vulner-ability of the Mediterranean forest and should be taken into account when assessingthe potential impacts of Gardanne plant. In this case, research helped mapping allstakeholders and supported consultation about the project, which was essential forminimizing the impacts of the plant on local biodiversity and quality of life, and forsocial acceptation.Social sciences are crucial to understand the mechanisms of social acceptation ofthe renewable technologies, the share of biodiversity that societies would accept togive up, and how to increase awareness and trainings on issues closely interlinkedsuch as climate change and biodiversity, including in the ﬁeld of energy. Humans arealso to be studied as part of the socio-ecosystems, with their efforts to maintain theresilience of this system through both biodiversity preservation and climate changemitigation (Trommetter 2017 ).Scenarios and ModelsScenarios and models, calling on multiple research disciplines, can play a majorrole to explore the potential effects that energy policies may have on biodiversity.For example, models combining environmental and economic variables show thatbiomass, for biofuel or electricity production, is not as good for the environment asﬁrst thought, because of the overexploitation of forests and land-use change it mayinduce (Valin et al. 2015 ). Harvesting very often results in a reduction of biologicaland spatial diversity which weakens the forest ecosystem and the local biodiversitydynamics (Trommetter 2017 ). Speciﬁc impacts on biodiversity are difﬁcult to modelthrough proxies such as carbon richness, widely used in climate models, because ofthe speciﬁcities of local contexts. Research has therefore been developing biodiver-sity indicators by combining landscape cover and land-use intensity with biodiversity56 A. Hallosserie et al.richness. The resulting indexes are a progress towards the integration of biodiver-sity variables into the models, but they still lack key information to assess habitatfragmentation, populations dynamics, interactions within ecosystems, changes ingenetic diversity etc. There is still progress to do to better understand the impacts ofmeeting the global objectives of carbon emission reductions. Models show that inorder to limit global warming to 2 °C, land conversion for biomass production on onehand and the necessary carbon sinks on the other hand would imply that about 500million hectares would be dedicated to agriculture for biomass (Havlík et al. 2015 ).The unavoidable ex situ biodiversity issues of one area being the in situ issues of theother, the question is whether one can be virtuous at home with a behavior harmfulelsewhere (Trommetter 2017 ): the impacts on biodiversity, especially in developingcountries where the large majority of land would be available for conversion, needto be particularly reﬂected upon.Beyond studying future impacts and guiding policy development, scenarios andmodels can also be used for decision-making, for example through serious gameswhich help stakeholders to step into each other’s shoes and understand each other’skey motivations. Such activities raise stakeholders’ awareness on the multiple aspectsthat are to be taken into account to meet different, sometimes opposing, objectives(e.g. biodiversity conservation vs resource exploitation) (Garcia and Speelman 2017 ).Modelling is also used to assess the resilience of social-ecological systems throughthe description of an area, its resources, stakeholders, institutions and issues, andalternative system developments showing whether the system is becoming more orless resilient (Resilience Alliance 2010 ). This was applied for example by Davi et al.(in prep.) to identify the potential impacts of the operation of the biomass plant inGardanne.EU Countries Should Inspire the W orld for a More Cautious,Time-T aking Energy Transition for the Sake of BiodiversityThe main observation from scientiﬁc literature and the feedback of energy stakehold-ers is that the push for renewables has led to a frantic development of the sector, withan ex post realization of the negative impacts it induces when not thought through.An illustrative case being the promotion at the European Union level of biomassenergy, which lead to the unexpected large importation of wood from the US andfrom Canada which was unsustainably harvested (European Commission 2015 ). Theenergy transition should be operated at a slower pace to allow science to catch upwith it, and an energy mix based on renewables, fossil fuel and nuclear power couldallow to keep meeting energy demand while going for a wise zero-carbon energyproduction. On top of the impact assessments of infrastructures for renewable energy,science has also a key role to play to assess the impact of energy policies, such as theEuropean policy promoting biomass energy that may have indirect impacts beyondthe current players, as highlighted by Gazull in FRB 2017 and in Cuypers et al. 2013 .Biodiversity Issues Should Be Better Taken into Account in the … 57Indeed, the EU is often looked up to by the world, and its endorsement of biomassenergy turns it into a good, clean, innovative source of energy that may provide anincentive for many developing countries to strengthen the exploitation of their forestsfor energy production, which is one of the main drivers of deforestation around urbanareas in the global South. To sum up, the energy transition whose use is local, butwhose resources and deployment are global, must be considered globally (in situ andex situ) when being assessed (Trommetter 2017 ).ConclusionPolicy sectors such as energy and environment are dealt with independently in poli-tics and by stakeholders. Each stakeholder is therefore advancing its own policies toachieve its own objectives, ignoring the fact that some of these may be detrimentalto other policies and targets, or even counterproductive for their own objective sincemany issues inﬂuence each other. When looking at the impact of the energy transitionon biodiversity, it is observed that the question is hardly ever asked, be it in the policy,research or operational area. A few scattered studies analysed the potential or actualimpacts of energy infrastructures on biodiversity, but these impacts need to be betterfactored in by stakeholders of the renewable energy sector, by asking: “what may myimpacts be when it comes to biodiversity?”. This demand would in turn boost researchon the topic, including the development of solutions to mitigate or offset the impactof renewable energy infrastructure. Research can also support decision-makers inbetter anticipating the effects of energy policies and measures on biodiversity, usingtools such as scenarios and models. Recent climate policy development in Francegave a positive signal for all stakeholders to better acknowledge and work on thesynergies between climate and biodiversity. While the energy transition addressesthe urgent need for climate change mitigation and aims to reduce CO2emissions,literature increasingly documents examples of offsetting (rebalancing emissions tozero) or even a net removal of CO 2through biodiversity protection. The internationalresearch initiative 4‰ aims to identify farming practices promoting carbon storagein agricultural land so that it offsets part of human CO2emissions. A territorial andsystemic approach is essential to overcome such challenges. Currently, it is mostlyon the scale of territories that the issues of sustainable development, including theimplementation of renewable energies, their side-effects, and the erosion of biodiver-sity, are perceived and it is probably also there that both fair and democratic solutionscan be found. Policy emphasis on such measures would help rebalance biodiversityversus climate objectives, highlighting the interlinkages between both issues.Acknowledgements We thank Hugo Valin and Anne-Claire Asselin for their useful advice andprecisions regarding different parts of this paper.

GorbatchevIntroductionSustainable economic development requires consideration of economic, social andenvironmental factors. Since the last decade of the twentieth century, there has beena demand for statistical data reﬂecting the state of the natural environment and theimpact on it of human society. At the same time, statistics are required that reﬂectthe impact of ecosystems on the economy.Agenda 21 ( 1992 ), adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development in Rio de Janeiro, considers “Integrating Environment and Devel-opment in the Decision-Making Process” (Chapter “ Implications for Biodiversityof Potentially Committed Global Climate Change (from Science and Policy) ”) and“Conservation and rational use of resources for development” (Section “ NaturalCapital and Ecosystem Services: International Approach ”) as the main developmentpriorities.Costanza and Daley ( 1992 ) considered the concept of “natural capital”, whichincludes “renewable or active natural capital” and “non-renewable or inactive naturalcapital”. At the same time, renewable capital is restored by solar energy. Ecosystemsin this work relate to renewable natural capital. They can produce ecosystem products,such as wood, and also provide ecosystem services, for example, carbon dioxideabsorption. Examples of non-renewable capital are fossil fuels and mineral resources.The ecosystem is deﬁned as a dynamic complex of plant, animal and microor-ganism communities and non-living environment interacting as a functional unit(Millennium 2003 ) and as the beneﬁts that a person derives from ecosystems. Humansare an integral part of ecosystems.The goal of the work is to consider the world trends in the deﬁnition of ecosystemservices, their evaluation and accounting, and implementation of ecosystem servicesin the Republic of Belarus.The practical importance of the work lies in the analysis of the world trendsand policies of the European Union in the development of ecosystem services. Itis shown that Belarus has some unique practices in the ﬁeld of ecosystem servicesmanagement, which also may be analyzed and disseminated as best practices ofecosystem accounting and management.Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services: InternationalApproachNatural Capital is considered as “the environmental stock or resources of Earth thatprovide goods, ﬂows and ecological services required to support life. Examples ofnatural capital include: minerals; water; waste assimilation; carbon dioxide absorp-tion; arable land; habitat; fossil fuels; erosion control; recreation; visual amenity;biodiversity; temperature regulation and oxygen. Natural capital has ﬁnancial valueApproaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 63as the use of natural capital drives many businesses” http://www.gdrc.org/sustdev/concepts/26-nat-capital.html . This deﬁnes the needs in natural capital accounting.The ﬁrst version of the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting(SEEA) was presented in 1993 (United Nations 1993 ). In 2000, the SEEA man-ual was published (United Nations 2000 ), providing practical recommendations forthe implementation of SEEA modules with maximum consistency with national sta-tistical standards.In 2005, the report “Millennium Ecosystem Assessment” (Millennium 2005 )w a spublished, the results of which indicate that over the past 50 years, human activitieshave led to a huge loss of biodiversity and a decline in the volume of ecosystemservices. As noted in the proof, this will have a negative impact on the developmentprocesses in all countries, especially in developing countries.The SEEA-2003 report (United Nations 2003 ) gave a consistent analysis of thecontribution of the environment to the economy and the impact of the economy onthe environment, the composition and functions of natural capital were examined.The report was the basis for the further development of the standard on accountingfor natural capital and ecosystem services.Figure 1shows an approximate structure of natural capital.As it is shown in Fig. 1, in the structure of natural capital the natural resourcesand ecosystems are allocated. First of all the natural capital includes non-renewableand renewable capitals. Non-renewable capital consists of fossil fuels and min-eral resources which humanity consumes only changing the energy balance of theEarth. Greenhouse gas emissions accompanying the process of consumption of non-renewable resources also lead to a change in the energy balance of the Planet.Renewable natural capital forms a different type of ecosystems which produceecosystem products and services. Renewable capital is restored by solar energy, butthere is a global trend towards deterioration in the quality of natural capital and evena decrease in its quantity.It should be noted that the link between non-renewable resources and the ecosys-tem is necessary, since resources are part of ecosystems and their production in manyNATURAL CAPITALNon-renewable natural capital(natural resources)Renewable natural capital(natural resources)Fossil fuel Mineral resourcesEcosystemsEcosystem productsEcosystem servicesFig. 1 Approximate structure of natural capital64 S. Zenchanka and N. Gorbatchevcases leads to ecosystem disruption. For example, open mining of minerals not onlychanges the landscape, but also leads to disruption of underground aquifers.The idea of natural capital structuring and accounting was initiated in the 1980s.However, it was generally adopted into above-like scheme in 2012: the UN Sta-tistical Committee approved the SEEA Central Framework ( 2012 ) as an interna-tional standard for environmental and economic accounting. In addition, guidelineshave been issued on the experimental recording of ecosystems (SEEA 2014 ), SEEAWater Accounting ( 2012 ), SEEA Energy Accounting ( 2012 ) and SEEA account-ing in agriculture, forestry and ﬁsheries (SEEA AFF 2014 ). The system is basedon the integration of environmental and economic indicators. Internationally agreeddeﬁnitions and classiﬁcations (renewable and non-renewable resources, ecosystems,etc.) are connected with corresponding statistical indicators. Ecosystem products’and services’ indicators provide analysis of speciﬁc resources sectors, such as water,ﬁsheries, land, agriculture. The motivation for structuring the natural capital resultsfrom a variety of emerging demands for integration information on environmentalsustainability and human well-being.The main types of ecosystems and ecosystem services were considered in “Ecosys-tems and human well-being: a framework for assessment” (Millennium 2003 ) andby Haines-Young and Potschin ( 2013) :–Providing services —products that people get from ecosystems. These includecropping, livestock and game animals, seafood, food from wild plants and animals;drinking water, water used for irrigation and industrial consumption; plants thatare sources for the creation of biopharmaceuticals, building materials and biomassused as a source of renewable energy. Products can be obtained from sustainablymanaged ecosystems, such as agriculture, aquaculture, forest plantations, naturaland semi-natural ecosystems (hunting, ﬁshing, gathering wild plants and beards);–Regulatory services —beneﬁts derived from self-regulation of ecosystem pro-cesses (conservation of ecosystem assimilation capacity)—biogenic nutrientcycling, climate control, reduction of the negative consequences of natural dis-asters, pollination;–Cultural services —cultural, educational and spiritual beneﬁts received by peo-ple from ecosystems—visiting cultural, historical, spiritual and religious places;opportunities for recreation, for example, recreation, sports, hunting, ﬁshing, eco-tourism; education and research;–Supporting services —the natural processes necessary to maintain other ecosystemservices, such as soil formation.In April 2012, following the intergovernmental negotiations, which lasted sev-eral years and were convened under the auspices of UNEP, an IntergovernmentalScience and Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) wasfounded ( http://www.ipbes.net/about-us ). The mission of IPBES is to strengthen thescience-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservationand sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainabledevelopment (IPBES 2016 ).Approaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 65The UNEP Ecosystem Economics and Biodiversity Initiative (TEEB) has under-taken a series of studies that highlight the importance of ecosystem services and theneed for assessments. The results of these studies are presented in the Guidelinesfor Countries on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB 2013 ). “TheEconomics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity” is an international initiative aimed atdrawing attention to the beneﬁts of biodiversity, covering ecosystems, species andgenes. This initiative covers existing data to emphasize the value of biodiversity andecosystem services, the increasing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degra-dation and the beneﬁts of overcoming these problems.There are eleven proposals in this Guideline directed to reducing biodiversitylosses economically (TEEB 2013 ):1. Make the values of nature visible, for example, by assessing the role of biodi-versity and ecosystem services and their impact on the economy and society;2. Provide the assess to the value of ecosystem services and integrate them into thedecision-making process to improve the evidence base for decision-making;3. Take risks and uncertainties into account, for example, by understanding andapplying minimum safety standards or principles of prevention;4. Provide the future for sufﬁciently long periods of time to take into account theneeds of future generations and evaluate the cost and beneﬁts of decisions andpolicies using different discount rates;5. To manage better, i.e. invest in improving indicators of biodiversity and ecosys-tem services, in mapping ecosystems, and in integrating indicators into nationalaccounts that take into account the roles and values of nature;6. Work with natural resources to reduce poverty, identify synergies betweennature, livelihoods and well-being, and target investments in public goods.Human dependence on ecosystem services and, in particular, their role as alife-saving circle for many poor households, should be fully integrated intopolicies, strategies and implementations;7. Encourage the disclosure of corporate information to compensate for adverseeffects that cannot be avoided, to ensure that there is no “net loss”, includingthrough a natural form of compensation, achieving a net positive effect;8. Change incentives through market reforms (subsidies, pricing, taxes, fees andpenalties), property rights, liability, intellectual property rights and other mea-sures that can make supply chains more “green”, encourage private investmentin the development and Sustainable use;9. Identify protected areas, manage and invest in protected areas to ensure a com-prehensive, representative and efﬁcient network managed on an equitable basis.Protected areas are a certain monetary value;10. Invest in environmental infrastructure to support mitigation and adaptation toclimate change, water security and other policy objectives;11. Introduce the issues of the economy of nature in various ministries, sectorsand relevant policies, i.e. in an economy and ﬁnance, trade and development,transport, energy and mining, agriculture, forestry, planning, etc.66 S. Zenchanka and N. GorbatchevThe above recommendations fully correspond to the trends in the development ofthe world economy.“Green” and “Circular” Economies ConceptsThe concept of a “green” economy was proposed more than 20 years ago (Pearceet al. 1989 ) and became widespread in the 21st century. In 2007, they submitted areport “Blueprint for a Green Economy” to the Shadow Cabinet ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/39015804_Blueprint_for_a_Green_Economy ).In 2008, the UN, in collaboration with many stakeholders, announced the “GreenEconomy Initiative” ( http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/content/un-environment-programmeE99s-greeni-economy-initiative ) which consists of several compo-nents aimed at analyzing and politically supporting investments in “green” sectorsof the economy and involving other sectors in this process. Green Economy Report(UNEP 2011 ) considered investing in natural capital and investing in energy andresource efﬁciency and it has found that a “green” economy values and invests innatural capital. Report (UNEP 2015 ) considers the investment in ecosystem restora-tion and rebuilding of natural capital as an essential part of investments in environ-mental sustainability. This report suggests “to adopt the valuation of natural capitalin national accounts and development indexes, as it enables a country to developa sense of its “true wealth”; and value the natural capital degraded or used up ineconomic processes, as it provides a measure of “true income””.The ﬁnal document of the Rio + 20 Conference “The future we want” empha-sizes that the “green” economy should improve the ability to rationally use naturalresources with less environmental impact, improve resource efﬁciency and reducewaste (Report 2012 ).Key sectors of the “green” economy, such as agriculture, energy, ﬁsheries andforestry, waste, water use, etc., are directly related to the receipt of ecosystem services.The development of the “green” economy led to the development of a “circular”economy, which received priority in making promising decisions to achieve eco-nomic development in the presence of environmental constraints. In the EuropeanUnion, this was reﬂected in the 7th Environmental Action Program, which aims toprotect, preserve and strengthen the natural capital of the European Union. It also setsgoals for the development of a low-carbon, resource-efﬁcient and “green” economy.The program assumes that the global eco-industrial market will double in the next10 years, and the European renewable energy sector will create more than 400,000jobs by 2020 (Programme 2014 ). In addition, European countries increasingly viewthe circular economy as a political priority.A “circular” economy is a continuous positive development cycle that preservesand enhances natural capital, optimizes the proﬁtability of resources, and minimizessystemic risks by managing ﬁnite stocks and renewable ﬂows.The Report of the European Environmental Agency (EEA 2016 ) notes that, withan existing population of the Earth of 7.2 billion people, some planetary boundariesApproaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 67deﬁning areas of safe living have already been violated. This refers to the integrityof the biosphere, the cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, climate change, changes insoil cover, etc.The “Sustainable Development Goals 2030”, adopted in September 2015 (Agenda2015 ), noted that “We are determined to protect the planet from degradation, includ-ing through the introduction of rational consumption and production patterns, therational use of its natural resources and the adoption of urgent measures in connec-tion with climate change, so that the planet can meet the needs of this and futuregenerations”. Many of the 17 sustainable development goals are aimed at conservingnatural capital and using ecosystem services.Methods and LimitationsThe investigation is based on analyzing the legislative base of the Republic of Belarus,their comparison with international ones, analyzing of National strategies and pro-grams, scientiﬁc reports and articles.The article must give an answer on next questions:1. What ecosystem services are presented in Belarus?2. Which legislation governs ecosystem services in Belarus?3. What biodiversity measures have been taken?Ecosystem Services in BelarusProviding ServicesCrop. Agriculture of Belarus is specialized in cultivating traditional for moderatebreadth of cultures. In the structure of plant growing a high proportion is occupied bygrain and leguminous crops, as well as forage crops, which is due to the specializationof the republic’s agriculture, mainly in dairy and meat cattle breeding. The main cropsare barley, rye, triticale. A special place is occupied by potatoes and ﬂax. The mainvegetable crops are carrots, beets, cabbage. In Belarus, about 16% of the world’s ﬂaxis concentrated, or more than 20% of its crops of the European continent (Belagro2016 ; Digest 2016 ).Livestock and game animals . In animal husbandry, mainly cattle are grown forthe production of milk and meat, as well as pigs and poultry (Belagro 2016 ; Digest2016 ).Fish. Commercial ﬁshing in inland waters is one of the directions of the ﬁshingindustry in Belarus. River ﬁshing is concentrated mainly in the southern regions,where the rivers Dnipro, Pripyat, Sozh, Berezina and their tributaries are being68 S. Zenchanka and N. Gorbatchevdeveloped. The ﬁshing value Neman river is much lower, r. Western Dvina for com-mercial ﬁshing is practically not used.About 56 species of ﬁsh live in water bodies and rivers of Belarus but no more than20 ﬁsh species have deﬁnite commercial importance. Analysis of the statistical data ofcommercial catch from lakes, rivers and reservoirs over the past ﬁve years has shownthat about 75% of catches fall on three species—roach, bream and carp. Seafoodaccounts for no more than 0.2%, eel—1.9%, large predators—ichthyophagous (pike,catﬁsh, pike perch, asp)—4.4%.With the adoption of the lease law, ﬁshing grounds were transferred to numeroustenants from state and non-state enterprises and individuals. This led to an increasein the number of water bodies and streams used for ﬁshing. Currently, 281 tenants(including state ﬁsheries) are exploiting for the purpose of ﬁshing about 600 lakes andreservoirs, a total area of 1.2 thousand km2and 2.1 thousand km of rivers (Belagro2016 ).Wa t e r . Renewable freshwater resources of the Republic of Belarus are representedby river runoff and groundwater, the volume of which is formed in natural conditionsdue to precipitation on the territory of the country (internal runoff), as well as theinﬂow of river and groundwater from adjacent countries. The total annual ﬂow ofrivers is determined on the basis of measurement of water levels and discharge.The natural resource of fresh groundwater is the total ﬂow of groundwater ﬂow,which is provided by inﬁltration of atmospheric precipitation. The magnitude of theinﬁltration feeding of aquifers in the zone of active water exchange is 10–20% of theaverage long-term value of atmospheric precipitation. In the general runoff of therivers of Belarus, the share of groundwater is 27%.The main source of surface water resources of the country are medium and largerivers, the volume of water ﬂow by which in average water years, as a rule, does notexceed 57,900 million cubic meters per year. During the high water years, the totalriver runoff increases to 92,400 million cubic meters per year, and in low-water (95%of the supply) it is reduced to 37,200 million cubic meters per year. At the same time,the rivers of the Black Sea Basin account for 55% of the total annual ﬂow, the BalticSea basin—45% (Report 2016 ).Belarus ranks fourth in terms of water resources of rivers in Europe after Norway(376,000 million cubic meters per year), UK (152,000 million cubic meters per year)and Poland (85,400 million cubic meters per year). The natural resources of freshgroundwater are 15,900 million cubic meters per year, and the forecasted resourcesare 18,100 million cubic meters per year.W astewater treatment. The ecosystem function for assimilating water pollutionand waste processing is being regulated. Belarusian Research Center “Ecology”developed a technical code of good practice “Environmental Protection and NatureManagement. Procedure for Conducting a Valuation of Ecosystem Services andDetermining the Value of Biodiversity”. The proposed methods allow estimatingthe value of forest, marsh and meadow ecosystems and the cost of correspondingecosystem services on their basis (Code 2012 ).Timber . Forests and forest resources of the Republic of Belarus are the mostimportant element of the national wealth of the country, which have a signiﬁcantApproaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 69impact on its sustainable social and economic development. If the Republic of Belarusoccupies the 13th place in the Europe, according to the area of land resources percapita, on such characteristics as the forest cover of the territory, the forest area andthe stock of growing timber per capita, our country is included in the ﬁrst ten foreststates of the Europe. The average age of the Belarusian forests, which forms theforest fund of the country, is 54 years. According to experts’ estimates in 2015, thetimber reserves in our country amounted to 1714.3 million cubic meters, which isequal to the total reserves of Great Britain, Hungary and Italy combined (Belagro2016 ).The forest gives valuable birch sap, gill, game and furs, and the integrated use offorest resources, including processing of such wastes as stumps, roots, bark, smalland low-grade wood raw materials, obtained from the crown and during cutting, andtechnical greens, allow produce dozens of valuable products.The Republic of Belarus has a rich potential of low-value wood raw materials andwaste that can be used as boiler-furnace fuel. The development of small-scale energybased on the use of wood fuel is one of the most important directions, ensuringa reduction in the share of imported energy resources, raising the level of energysecurity of the country.Wild medicinal plants. In addition to tree stocks, forest resources also includenon-wood forest products, which are represented by berries, fruits and mushrooms(wild plants). In the Belarusian forests, there are over 140 species and forms ofedible mushrooms, and the possible volumes of wild berry production reach up to200 thousand tons.Currently, almost half of the domestic medicines are made from plant materials,including those grown in the forest. A large number of forest plants-honey-plants area solid fodder base for beekeeping (Report 2016 ).Land and soil. Land resources include all types of land: agricultural, human set-tlements, industry, transport, resorts, reserves, state forest fund. The land fund of theRepublic of Belarus remains unchanged and at the beginning of 2016 it is 207.60thousand hectares. Agricultural lands occupy 41.3% (8581.9 thousand hectares),forest lands—8742.1 thousand hectares (42.1% of the total area).As a result of the Chernobyl disaster, 23% of the territory of Belarus were con-taminated with radioactive pollutions, on which there were 3678 settlements. Themost affected territories of the Brest, Gomel and Mogilev regions. A quarter of thecountry’s forest fund has been subjected to radioactive contamination in Belarus(Chernobyl 2017 ).A special authority, Department for Elimination of the Consequences of the Cher-nobyl Disaster subordinated to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republicof Belarus, is responsible for rehabilitation of lands, forests, water bodies and pro-vision of safe living conditions for people in areas contaminated by radionuclidesReport ( 2016 ). Programme ( 2010 ).70 S. Zenchanka and N. GorbatchevRegulatory ServicesClimate change. In Belarus, as in the whole world, climate change mainly related toglobal processes. However, its share in the world budget of carbon emissions is lessthan 0.01% (Contributions 2015 ). During the period of 1995–2005 on average 1.6%of the GDP was spent on improving energy efﬁciency with increasing to 3.4% of theGDP in 2006–2010, and up to 5% of GDP in 2011–2015. However, the followingclimate change facts that inﬂux on ecosystem services are registered in Belarus:– Reducing the yield of traditional crops and growing new crops;– Climatic zone displacement;– Migrating animals, birds and insects;– Drying of forests, increase in ﬁre hazard in forests;– Reducing the harvest of mushrooms and berries;– Unfavorable and dangerous hydro meteorological phenomena;– Increased growth of parasitic and infectious diseases, allergies;– The emergence of climate migrants due to famine and natural disasters.For the second period of the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol, the Republicof Belarus has undertaken a number of voluntary commitments to reduce energyintensity of GDP and greenhouse gas emissions with target indicators up to 2020,which are reﬂected in the main program documents and normative legal acts of theRepublic of Belarus (Contributions 2015 ):– The target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 by 8% to the level of1990;– Ensuring greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 at the level of not more than 110million tons.Ecosystem effects of Chernobyl disaster . Formation of radioactive contaminationof the natural environment in the territory of Belarus began immediately after theexplosion of the reactor. The peculiarities of meteorological conditions in the periodApril 26-May 10, 1986, as well as the composition and dynamics of the accidentalrelease of radioactive substances, caused the complex nature of the contaminationof the territory of the republic.Analysis of radioactive contamination of Europe with cesium-137 shows thatabout 35% of the Chernobyl fallout of this radionuclide on the European continentwas located on the territory of Belarus. The contamination of the territory of Belaruswith cesium-137 with a density of over 37 kBq/m2accounted for 23% of the totalarea of Belarus (for Ukraine—5%, Russia—0.6%).Surface water is the main factor that determines the migration of radionuclidesin ecosystems. Especially important is the assessment of the transitional role ofrivers, which are the main carriers of radionuclides and contribute, among otherthings, to their transboundary movement. The problem of radioactive contaminationof air masses remains relevant in the areas adjacent to the resettlement zone. It isdetermined by the content of radioactive dust in the surface layer of the atmosphere.Approaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 71Dust formation signiﬁcantly increases during agricultural and other works with anactive technogenic impact on the soil. On radioactive contamination of surface air, asigniﬁcant local inﬂuence is exerted by certain natural phenomena, primarily forestand peat ﬁres.The vegetation of the territories of radioactive contamination forms the basis of thefodder base of wild animals, in which there is an increased content of radionuclidesaccumulating in muscle tissue and bones. Hunting and commercial ungulates showa clearly expressed seasonal dependence of accumulation of radionuclides (increasein the summer-autumn period). The composition and structure of zoocenoses under-goes signiﬁcant changes in the zones of alienation and resettlement. Currently, theecosystem development of contaminated areas is carried out mainly at the expenseof public funds (Chernobyl 2017 ).Cultural ServicesThere are 2 national nature reserves, 4 national parks and 85 local nature reserves onthe territory of the Republic of Belarus. Specially protected natural areas to ensurethe preservation of the natural balance, the genetic fund and serve as centers for thereproduction of plants and animals, combined with limited and consistent use ofother natural resources. About 80% of rare and endangered wild plants and about90% of rare and endangered wild animals live within the boundaries of speciallyprotected natural areas. The conservation of rare and endangered species of wildanimals and wild plants is possible only with the protection of their habitat, takinginto account climatic, geophysical and other conditions. A special role is played bythe preservation of the environment-forming species of wild animals and wild plantsthat form the internal environment of the ecological system. Formation of an optimalsystem of specially protected natural areas of the Republic of Belarus is aimed atpreserving natural ecological systems, biological and landscape diversity, ensuringecological balance of natural systems and sustainable use of animal and plant, naturalterritories (National Strategy 2014 ).Ecotourism is widely spread in Belarus. Tourists are offered routes to such naturalcomplexes as Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve, PripyatskyReserve and others.A key tourist attraction of Belarus, Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, iswhat’s left of the primeval forest which used to stretch from the Baltic Sea to the BugRiver and from Odder to the Dnieper River. Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Parkwas made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. In 1993 it was granted UNESCOBiosphere Reserve status ( http://www.belarus.by/en/travel/belarus-life/belovezhskaya-pushcha ). The park is famous for its ancient named oak trees dating back morethan 500 years. In all there are almost 900 species of trees and ﬂowers. It is also hometo more than 250 animal and bird species. The Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Parkalso boasts a zoo, library and a museum, and supports wood processing, handicraftsand various local industries.72 S. Zenchanka and N. GorbatchevThe Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve is the oldest and the only natural area of pro-tection in the Republic of Belarus of the highest rank. It is a real model of the naturalenvironment, one of very few undisturbed corners of European part of the south-ern taiga ( http://www.berezinsky.by/en/ecotourism/routes/pedestrian/ ). This reservesuggests such routes as “Trail of discovery” (interactive excursion with many eco-logical games, “Along the forest wildlife path” (ecological track) and “KamennayaPlita” (Stone Plate).Pripyatsky Park, one of the national parks of Belarus, is located between the riversPripyat, Stviga and Ubort. Special protection has been granted to about 190,000 hawith more than a third represented as a wildlife reserve ( http://www.belarus.by/en/about-belarus/natural-history/pripyatsky-national-park ). At present the National ParkPripyatsky is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Belarus. The nationalpark is home to 51 species of mammals: wild boar, deer, elk, doe, hare, fox, muskrat,raccoon dog, beaver, etc., including rare species: European bisons, European mink,European lynx, badger, garden dormouse, common dormouse, hazel dormouse. TheNational Park Pripyatsky has the international status of the key ornithological terri-tory. It is home to 256 species of birds (79% of all the birds in Belarus), including65 species in the Red Book of Belarus.Supporting ServicesIn Belarus, biodiversity depends on the state of natural ecosystems, which occupyabout 50% of the country’s territory. These are mostly forested, and their conditionis the most sustainable. To conserve forest ecosystems, there is enough protectionand sustainable use. A strategy for adapting forestry to climate change by 2030 hasalso been developed.Wetlands are another signiﬁcant biosystem in Belarus. They occupy a smaller area,they are less sustainable. Now the wetland complexes occupy 863,000 ha, there aremore than 40% of the Red Book species of birds. In Belarus, for example, a signiﬁcantpart of the populations of spiny reed lives, and the number of large spotted eagles isquite large. In accordance with the Strategy, an inventory of irrigation and drainagesystems will be conducted by the Institute of Experimental Botany together with theForest Institute. It will determine the fate of about 150 thousand ha of drained land.Some of them will re-swamp, and effective reclamation systems stabilize.Polessky State Radiation Ecological Reserve is the largest (more than 215 thou-sand ha) in Belarus. The reserve was organized on July 18, 1988 in the Belarusianpart of the exclusion zone on the territory of the three most affected areas of theGomel region—Bragin, Narovlyansky and Khoiniki. On the territory there are 96abandoned settlements, where before the accident lived more than 22 thousand inhab-itants. Belarusian scientists also observe natural phenomena in the exclusion zone onthe example of the Polessky State Radiation Ecological Reserve (PSRES), formedaround the Belarusian sector of the zone ( http://www.zapovednik.by/ ).Approaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 73Here there is an increase in the number of animal populations, the appearance ofrare species and species that were not previously observed in this area. In turn, thegrowth of wildlife populations is observed on a pan-European scale, and the increas-ing anthropogenic impact on the land around the exclusion zone forces animals tomove to contaminated areas. This does not negate the fact that in the absence ofeconomic activity of a person, such lands are now an excellent testing ground for thestudy of wild animals, reproduction of rare species such as bison, lynx, etc. Scientistsplan to use the unique conditions of Polessky State Radiation and Ecological Reserveto resume such species lost to Belarus as a European cat.Legislation on Ecosystem Services and Biodiversityin BelarusLegislative regulation of environment and ecosystem services is carried out usinginternational agreements, codes of Belarus and government regulations. Legislativeacts are grouped in codes: Water, Forest, Air, Code of Subsoil, Land Code. Addi-tionally, legislation adjusts the procedures related to state environmental expertise,strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment ( http://www.minpriroda.gov.by/ru/deistv_zakon-ru/ ).The ecosystem services accounting in Belarus is distributed among 5 state bodiesand is connected with the collection and analysis of statistical data.1. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection—procurement(harvesting) of wild plants, use of water and natural resources, management ofwastes, emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide.2. The Ministry of Forestry—harvesting, export of wood and use of forest resources,protection of forests from pests and diseases, hunting activities.3. The Ministry of Sport and Tourism—touristic activities.4. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food—ﬁsh resources, sowing of agriculturalplants by varieties and reproductions, special reports related to elimination ofconsequences of Chernobyl disaster.5. The State Inspectorate for the Protection of Fauna and Flora is a specially autho-rized state body subordinate to the President of the Republic of Belarus that,within its competence, exercises state control over the protection and use of wildanimals related to hunting and ﬁshing facilities, tree and shrub vegetation andother wild plants, forest resources.Special reports related to elimination of consequences of Chernobyl disaster,which are collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food from local authori-ties and companies include information on the contamination of agricultural prod-ucts with radionuclides of cesium-137 and strontium-90. Upon analysis of collectedinformation it produces an annual report on the implementation of a set of specialprotective measures on agricultural lands contaminated with radionuclides.74 S. Zenchanka and N. GorbatchevEnvironmental monitoring in Belarus is carried out within the framework of theNational System for Monitoring the Environment in the Republic of Belarus (abbre-viated as NSEM, http://www.nsmos.by ), established in 1993. This system helps mon-itor current ecological state and forecast their future status. Annual reports of thissystem are presented on the site http://www.nsmos.by/content/402.html .Currently, the NSME includes 11 organizational-independent types of monitoring,the environment, that analyses collected statistical and environmental data:Monitoring of land;Surface water monitoring;Groundwater monitoring;Monitoring of atmospheric air;Monitoring of the ozone layer;Flora monitoring;Forest monitoring;Monitoring of wildlife;Radiation monitoring;Geophysical monitoring;Local environmental monitoring.NSMOS is a complex system developing over time and changing conditions. Inorder to ensure the normative legal basis for the functioning and development ofthe NSEM for 2011–2015, the President of the Republic of Belarus adopted DecreeNo. 244 of June 13, 2011 “On the Approval of the State Program for Ensuring theFunctioning and Development of the National Environmental Monitoring System inthe Republic of Belarus for 2011–2015” (NSMOS 2011 ).The legislation of Belarus in the ﬁeld of ecosystems and biodiversity protectionis sufﬁcient to realize the main objectives: protection of species and habitats, main-tenance and restoration of ecosystems, achievement of more sustainable agricultureand forestry, to make ﬁshing more sustainable and water resources healthier com-bating of invasive alien species help stop the loss of global biodiversity. Specialmeasures to collect and analyze data related to Chernobyl disaster are arranged.In September 2015, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus approvedthe National Action Plan for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of BiologicalDiversity for 2016–2020 and updated the Strategy for the Conservation and Sustain-able Use of Biological Diversity (Strategy 2015 ). The Strategy provides the basisfor the formation of a national ecological network, as well as for announcements ofbiosphere reserves created to ensure sustainable economic development of regionstaking into account environmentally oriented use of natural resources and protectionof ecosystems. State programs for the development of the system of specially pro-tected natural areas, a scheme for a national ecological network, a scheme for therational allocation of specially protected natural areas of national importance andregional schemes for the rational allocation of specially protected natural areas oflocal importance are developed and implemented to conserve biodiversity ( http://www.minpriroda.gov.by/ru/deistv_zakon-ru/ ).Approaches to Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Assessment … 75ConclusionThe degradation of ecosystem services could grow signiﬁcantly worse in the begin-ning of XXI century and is a barrier to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals2030. The challenge of reversing the degradation of ecosystems can be partially metunder some scenarios, but these involve signiﬁcant changes in policies, institutions,and practices that are not currently under way. Many options exist to conserve orenhance speciﬁc ecosystem services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs or thatprovide positive synergies with other ecosystem services.The green economy in the EU focuses on the second-generation environmentalproblems, which include problems of climate change and biodiversity loss, develop-ing generalized solutions to ﬁrst-generation environmental problems, which includeair, water, soil, considered in the concept of sustainable development.In 2015 the European Union has funded a project called “Technical Assistanceto Support the Development of Green Economy in Belarus”, which also includedreadiness of national legislation to implementation of ecosystem services (Project2014 ). The project suggests to identify the ecosystem service in national legal instru-ments, choose the scenario: which ecosystem services using market instruments willbe presented in the short and long term.National Report ( 2015 ) “On Human Development in the Republic of Belarus—-Competitive advantages of the regions of Belarus” includes the strategy of ecosystemservices development, introduced by the Ministry of Economy of Belarus. The strat-egy includes main ecosystem services being developed in Belarus: provision of freshwater of normative quality, carbon uptake, preservation of biodiversity and aestheticproperties of landscapes. The formation of the sector of ecosystem services canbe considered as part of the national economy and the economy of regions inte-grated into international relations. In the domestic market, the ecosystem servicessector includes the following subsectors: trading in greenhouse gas emission quotas;Cultural ecosystem services; Wastewater treatment. However, it is stated that thedevelopment of a legislative base in the Republic of Belarus is necessary to createthe subsector “Trade in quotas for greenhouse gas emissions”.Belarus has also some unique practices in the ﬁeld of ecosystem services manage-ment, which also may be analyzed and disseminated as best practices of ecosystemaccounting and management:– Forest resources management related to wild medicinal plants, berries and mush-rooms. This procedure adjusts with the Resolution ( 2016 ) “On the establishmentof the tax value for spurious forest management and harvesting of secondary forestresources”, which introduces a tax on the collection of mushrooms, berries, herbsand so on.– Cultivation of lands contaminated with radionuclides after Chernobyl disasterand monitoring of radioactive contamination, especially related to transpondercontamination between Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.76 S.

Together with the area’s numerous wet-lands, they form a carbon sink of superregional importance. However, studies haveshown that the habitats are threatened by overexploitation and climate change. Inaddition, the natural connectivity of the local population, in particular of young peo-ple to their natural environment and the loss of knowledge on traditional use andcultivation systems is notable. NABU, a German NGO, therefore started workingtowards climate and biodiversity conservation and supports the local population toindependently ensure the long-term conservation of key ecosystems and their servicesfor livelihoods. This paper gives an insight into Participatory Forest Management atthe wild coffee forests at Kafa Biosphere Reserve. The authors outline the proac-tive planning process, constraints and limitations for management as well as lessonslearned from practical implementation of the concept. The results may be used bypractitioners such as representatives from NGOs, administrations of protected areasand communities.IntroductionEthiopia is a world gene centre of origin (McKee 2007 ) and is considered to beone of world’s most biodiverse countries (BIDNTF 2010 ). The remnant highlandforests, although declining, harbour invaluable key ecosystems. The current 3% forestcover descended from a 40% forest cover since the 1970s and still continues toS.

Tekledecrease at an annual rate of between 80,000 and 200,000 ha. If this trend continues,it can be assumed that the marvellous forests will have disappeared in 2020 (EFAP1994 ). Deforestation and degradation are key drivers attributed to population growth,ﬁrewood extraction, agricultural encroachment, illegal settlement and expansion ofinfrastructure and commercial farming.Participatory Forest Management (PFM) in EthiopiaFAO ( 2016 ) deﬁnes participatory forestry as “processes and mechanisms whichenable people with a direct stake in forest resources to be part of decision-makingin all aspects of forest management, including policy formulation processes”. InEthiopia, Participatory Forest Management (PFM) has been in practice since themid 1990s. The term PFM is used to describe forest management systems in whichcommunities (forest users and managers) and government services (forest depart-ment) work together to deﬁne rights of forest resource use, identify and developforest management responsibilities, and agree on how forest beneﬁts will be shared(FARM-Africa and SOS Sahel Ethiopia 2007 ). According to MoA, the EthiopianMinistry of Agriculture ( 2012 ), practical experiences and lessons have proven thatthe communities in and around forested areas can be part of the solution for reduc-ing deforestation and regeneration of forest resources. These practical experiencesgained within Ethiopia, have repeatedly shown that the participation of the commu-nities in the negotiation and drafting of the forest management, conservation and useplans strongly contributes to create community ownership and ensures communityinvolvement at all stages of forest resource management (Beﬁkadu and Luwiza 2014 ).Participation is believed to be the crucial element for sustainable forest management.Essentially, the PFM process leads to the establishment of a forest user group(FUG), which enters into a PFM agreement with the district’s Woreda Ofﬁce ofAgriculture. The agreement as well as a forest management plan set down the rightsand responsibilities of the forest user group and the Woreda Ofﬁce of Agriculture.The management plan lays out the protection, utilization and development of thePFM area. Use rights usually involve the harvesting of Non-Timber Forest Products(NTFP) and limited amounts of ﬁrewood and construction wood. In return, the forestuser group commits to protecting and sustainably using the PFM area with the supportfrom the district and communal administration. This should lead to a reduction ofillegal activities such as clearing for agricultural land, free livestock grazing, logging,ﬁrewood collection and charcoal production. PFM agreements may also involve therehabilitation of previously deforested or degraded land planting native tree species.NABU’s Work in EthiopiaSince 2006 NABU has been supporting people and nature in Ethiopia. NABU is aregistered international NGO and operates currently two ofﬁces in the capital AddisAbaba and four project ofﬁces in different part of the country, partly together withCommunity Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 81partners. Starting with the establishment of Kafa Biosphere Reserve, NABU pur-sued implementing large scale conservation projects in the area, funded by the Ger-man government. NABU’s current project comprises the following components: (i)adaptation of agriculture to climate change for soil protection and food security,(ii) improvement and fostering of Participatory Forest Management, (iii) introduc-tion of community-based wetland protection, (iv) local anchoring of community-based monitoring with nature rangers, (v) expansion and marketing of regional prod-ucts, (vi) Fostering capacity building and education and (vii) project-accompanyinginformation campaign. Upon the establishment of Kafa Biosphere Reserve, NABU,UNESCO and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Federal DemocraticRepublic of Ethiopia signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a networkof biosphere reserves in Ethiopia. Since then NABU became one of the main stake-holders supporting UNESCO biosphere reserves in the country. NABU implementsprojects on biosphere reserve management, sustainable development and incomegeneration conservation, rehabilitation and adaptation to climate change. In particu-lar, NABU promotes community-based resource management systems as an effectivetool against habitat fragmentation and degradation.Implementation Practice of PFM in Kafa Biosphere ReserveForest fragmentation is a major cause of forest loss in Kafa Biosphere Reserve(Dresen 2011 ). Even at a low deforestation rate, fragmentation can lead to a reductionor even a complete loss of contiguous forest and create forest islands with seriousconsequences on biodiversity and ecosystem functions, thereby increasing people’svulnerability to climate change (Dresen 2011 ; De Vries and Herold 2014 ). A reviewon PFM effectiveness in Kafa Zone concluded that PFM has shown positive impactsboth on the state of the forest and living condition of participant households at leastwithin the project life time (Gobeze et al. 2009 ). PFM also (i) promotes awarenesson forests, (ii) facilitates institutionalization of increased community participationin forest management and regulates open access and (iii) contributes towards socialequity in terms of gender and ethnic minority groups.Between December 2009 and February 2013, NABU supported the establishmentof 16 PFM sites covering more than 11,000 ha at the Kafa Biosphere Reserve. ThePFM sites are located in ﬁve of the ten Woredas (districts) of the reserve and wereselected according to criteria such as high pressure on the forest as well as recom-mendation from the local government and urgent demand from local community inthe face of losing the forest to agro-investments. The following methodology wasapplied by NABU in line with current practice (e.g. FARM-Africa and SOS SahelEthiopia 2007 ) for the establishment of the PFM sites:i. Identiﬁcation of potential PFM areas;ii. Consultation, awareness creation and data collection involving all forest users;82 S. Bender and M. Tekleiii. Nomination of planning committees with 112 members, training of members,implementation of Rapid Forest Assessments;iv. Participatory forest boundary demarcation including identiﬁcation of coreareas;v. Mapping and map creation (QGIS);vi. Participatory forest resource assessment with communities and governmentrepresentatives;vii. Participatory development of management plans and contractual agreementsfor each PFM site;viii. Signing of agreements and ofﬁcial handing over by government.In the following, the process is being described in detail. In the course of theestablishment of PFM groups, NABU conducted intensive information and aware-ness creation sessions inviting all 7,778 forest users, grouped according to theirforms of use for instance forest users for honey production or collection of wildcoffee. After clariﬁcation of user rights, requirements and management, the commu-nities were encouraged to nominate a “Plan-Preparatory Committee” (PPC) whichcomprised representatives from the respective forest patches and sub-villages andincluded women as well as youth and minority group members. The number ofPPC members ranged between 12 and 20 people depending on the size of the forestand the village. NABU provided various forms of trainings and capacity building tothe PPC nominees such as Participatory Resource Appraisal tools (PRA) includingresource mapping (see Fig. 1), social mapping, transect walks, participants observa-tion, rankings (preference/pair-wise/matrix), problem analysis, identiﬁcation of theforest resources and associated traditional users. Following this, the status of the for-est, the course of the forest patch’s boundaries and existing border conﬂicts, the typesof use (timber/NTFP) and users as well as the forms of existing user arrangementsare being assessed by the committee supported by NABU.In addition, the users’ social and cultural habits and traditions are being investi-gated as well as the livelihood status and dependence using participatory methods.This entire process helps to build up knowledge and understanding at stakeholders’level for the value of the forest, livelihood dependencies, roles and responsibili-ties and societal dynamics. The FUGs were encouraged to comment and endorsethe ﬁndings which were reﬂected under guidance of NABU and to plan next actions.Hereupon, NABU supported the PPC to conduct participatory forest resource assess-ments (PFRA). At the same time GPS data were collected in the ﬁeld and PFM sitemaps created (see example PFM map in Fig. 2) and ﬁnally the boundaries weredemarcated in the ﬁeld by painting trees.The habitual use forms, usufruct arrangements, traditional user rights and territo-ries were being assessed and data such as area calculation, forest condition estima-tions (i.e. basal area, canopy cover, degradation rate estimation and tree species com-position calculation) collected. NABU facilitated the determination of forest resourceuse trends (improving/stable/reducing), key potentials, main problems, drivers andavailable opportunities at forest patch level. Based on the ﬁndings, NABU supportedthe PPC to reﬂect and generate proposals for management for conservation, develop-Community Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 83Fig. 1 Participatory forest resource assessment with communities.

Alternative livelihood improvement activitieswere also being discussed. Finally, NABU closely supported the drafting of the for-est management plan focusing on three main activities and two cross-cutting tasks:forest conservation, forest development and/or enhancement and forest utilizationas main activities and forest monitoring and livelihood improvement activities ascross-cutting tasks. The draft plan was then presented to FUGs for discussion andapproval. Once endorsed by the community, the plan was submitted to the relevantofﬁces (agriculture or forest section) for assessment and approval. Meanwhile, thePPC also developed byelaws and agreement documents that were simultaneouslysubmitted to the ofﬁces. Finally, an agreement between the relevant governmentofﬁcials and representatives of the FUGs was signed.In general, the establishment process contributes to the following key aspects:(1) Understanding and knowledge building, (2) deﬁnition of territory and habitualresource use, (3) formalization of the rights of traditional users while compromisingthe emerging needs and shortage or dwindling of forest products through negotiat-ing and compromising, (4) determining forest management objectives for optimumutilization, protection and regeneration and forest/product enhancement.This paper summarises methods, practical implementation and ﬁndings of a casestudy implementing Participatory Forest Management in Ethiopia. The authors drawlessons learned to be used by practitioners such as NGO representatives, adminis-tration of protected areas and communities.MethodsStudy Site: The Kafa Biosphere ReserveThe Kafa Biosphere Reserve is situated in Southwest Ethiopia (latitude: 35°29/prime50.55/prime/primeto 36°47/prime33.78/prime/primeNorth/longitude: 35°48/prime50.57/prime/primeto 35°44/prime34.30/prime/primeEast, see Fig. 3). Itwas designated as UNESCO biosphere reserve in 2010. Its planning and establish-ment as one of the ﬁrst biosphere reserves of Ethiopia, was a widely appreciated suc-cess under the technical guidance of NABU and within the framework of a GermanPublic-Private-Partnership project. It has a forest cover of 47% with 4% (28,172 ha)being core zone serving as a refuge for endemic or endangered species (Dresen 2011 ).Administratively, the reserve comprises ten Woredas (districts), 250 rural Kebeles(lowest administrative unit) and 25 towns.With a size of 760,000 ha, the reserve covers also three Regional Priority ForestAreas (compare Fig. 4) designated for national protection. It harbours 45,000 ha ofextensive wetlands and ﬂoodplains as well as the Omo-Gibe and Baro-Akob basinsand has been recognised for its remarkable species endemism (NABU 2017 ). Thearea is particularly noteworthy as global in situ gene bank being the origin andcentre of Coffea arabica ’s genetic diversity. Due to this fact, the area has been ratedat a value of $1.5 billion (Hein and Gatzweiler 2006 ). Along with the forests, theCommunity Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 85Fig. 3 Location of the Kafa Biosphere Reserve at national and regional scale (NABU 2017 )aquatic habitats are the main suppliers of ecosystem services to local communitiesand provide animal fodder, building materials, medicinal plants etc.650,000 people live in the premises of Kafa Biosphere Reserve. With an averageof 98% inhabitation per km2, the range extends from 52 to 210 inhabitants per km2(SNNPR 2013 ). According to Chernet ( 2008 ) the population consists ethnically of81% Kafﬁchos, 6% Bench, 6% Amhara, 2% Oromo and 5% minorities (Manjas).More than 90% of the inhabitants’ livelihoods depend on subsistence farming, the saleof coffee (10% forest coffee/65% garden coffee), forest honey and the use of naturalresources e.g. for food, fuel, building material and medicinal plants or spices (SNNPR2013 ). Mainly grain is being cultivated, including the local Ethiopian grain speciesteff ( Eragrostis teff ), legumes and the locally important Abyssinian banana ( Enseteventricosum ), whose starch-rich stem is fermented for bread. The most commonlivestock is cattle (7.5 per household, 2011/2012, local government), followed bypoultry, sheep and goats. Wild coffee harvesting has been practised over centuries;complex tenure arrangements and traditions and rites have been developed.86 S. Bender and M. TekleFig. 4 Kafa Biosphere Reserve, its protection zones (core/buffer/transition) and Forest PriorityAreas. Source Dennis Moss Partnership ( 2009 )Impacts of Climate Change and Threats to BiodiversityIncreasingly, the natural ecosystems of Kafa Biosphere Reserve are being degraded.The degradation also endangers important ecosystem functions and subsequentlyincreases the human vulnerability to climate change. Due to climate change, there isa rise in temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, more frequent droughts and athreat of the long-term water supply. At the same time, the degradation enforces sur-face run-off and fosters soil erosion, with negative consequences for soil fertility andwater quality through sedimentation and reduced ground-water formation. Besidessevere impacts on biodiversity, the loss of forests has also led to freeing a consider-able amount of CO2and impair the forest’s function as a carbon sink. Climate changeimpacts like irregular and heavy rain falls, extreme droughts and heavy frosts as wellas proliferation of pests are challenging farmers and ecosystems. In particular thewild Arabica coffee is at risk (Davis et al. 2012 ). Though laws and regulations forthe protection and utilisation of forests and biodiversity exist in Ethiopia, insufﬁcientcapacities of the responsible institutions prevent an effective implementation.Community Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 87Data CollectionIn 2014, NABU decided for an evaluation of the 16 PFM sites by external experts inorder to (i) assess existing conditions of forest management; (ii) identify the effec-tiveness of the established PFM sites; (iii) see constraints, challenges and underlyingcauses for failures based on the forest management plan in each PFM sites; (iv) iden-tify measures for improved PFM implementation, management and awareness cre-ation. The evaluators used both primary data and secondary data collection: Guidedinterviews with 146 PFM committee members and reﬂection workshops with 350user community representatives in ﬁve Woredas served for data veriﬁcation.The authors are aware that the presented data is speciﬁc to the case of KafaBiosphere Reserve and may therefore have limitations. Nevertheless, the authors’intention is to support other areas in Ethiopia or beyond on their way to establishPFM and share lessons learned for practitioners.Results and DiscussionFor better understanding, the evaluated 16 PFM sites’ basic data are compiled inTable 1(see underneath) showing the size of each PFM size and number of membersof each group. All of the 16 PFM sites were linked to coffee and honey coopera-tive unions based in the Zonal capital Bonga in order to create income from foresthoney and coffee being harvested in a sustainable manner. For forest developmentand improvement, the PFM sites were provided with 5.2 kg of tree seeds (e.g. Prunusafricana, Cordia africana, Hagenia abyssinica, Millettia ferruginea, Juniperus Pro-cera). In addition, the PFM communities collected locally available tree seeds andcultivated those. As a result, more than 100,000 native trees were planted by themembers following the forest development and conservation goals in the manage-ment plan (Fig. 5).All PFM sites obtained support for a smooth working environment like nurserytools, ofﬁce buildings, stationeries, ofﬁce furniture and vouchers. For enhancingcapacities, the PFM committee members received regular trainings. All PFM groupsalso received livelihood related support: 114 modern beehives, restocking of beehiveswith bees and other related equipment. To improve the honey production and thus thecommunities’ income, technical support and upgrading to a cooperative level wasprovided. The transformation of four PFM groups into cooperatives enabled themto professionalize the marketing of honey and wax through the honey head union.Two PFM sites were afterwards able to sell 10.2 t of honey and 121 kg of bees waxthrough the union and earned more than 750,000 Ethiopian Birr (~24.200 Euro).The results of the assessment proved high involvement and participation of allrelevant actors for instance in the preparation of each management plan, bordernegotiation and setting of rights and responsibilities.

Nevertheless, the activity performance for instance on forest protection anddevelopment for instance replanting differed between the PFM sites. When it comesto economic beneﬁts for the community members, the assessment revealed signiﬁ-cant amounts of cash of 1,100,000 Ethiopian Birr (~35,500 Euro) from the sale ofNTFPs, penalties and compensation fees.Conclusions and Recommendations for PractitionersPFM is a forest management system that showed to be a complementary mecha-nism for safeguarding forests and biodiversity, while respecting traditional users.The value adding to the forest as well as the involvement and handing over of man-Community Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 89Fig. 5 Forest group members assessing the status of seedlings. Picture credit NABU/AbdurazakSahileagement responsibilities create ownership and awareness at community level. Thus,forests at Kafa Biosphere Reserve which were suffering from open access before,are being guarded, protected and developed by the community. Moreover, the FUGsstarted to earn signiﬁcant amounts of cash from the sale of NTFPs, penalties andcompensation fees. Nevertheless, it requires constant follow-up and technical sup-port by the local government or by NGOs in order to ensure PFM is run effectively.Most PFM groups were performing ﬁne when it comes to implementing the utiliza-tion plan, while forest development and forest protection activities were not beingequally. The authors suggest to include PFM into the zoning and daily support schemeof an already existing protected area like a biosphere reserve for constant support,guidance and monitoring. Therefore, a zoning element could be added to the otherzones of the protected area for instance “community-based PFM site”. In general,PFM is considered as a valuable tool for forest and subsequently biodiversity con-servation even though it requires constant input—it can be assumed that some forestsites would be very degraded or even eliminated by now if PFM would not have beenestablished, halting open access or investment projects.The following was found to be of high importance for successful PFM establish-ment in Kafa Biosphere Reserve:•Secure legal recognition and accountability : User rights must be vested forinstance by bylaws and agreement documents. This will enable the PFM sitemembers to take legal actions, e.g. penalty fees against trespassers and illegal useof their resources.90 S. Bender and M. Tekle•Create a strong link and cooperation with local government institutions :Alack of support from governmental ofﬁces has been proven to be a hamperingfactor for an effectively working PFM group.•Respect gender and social aspects : In the course of the PFM scheme both theManja minority and women were recognized equally with no restrictions, leadingto a better positioning at and integration into society.•Assure traditional user rights : With the act of formally recognizing the traditionaluse rights of forest user groups, a sense of ownership developed in the communitiesfor protection and sustainable use of their forest resources.•Increase the value of the forest for communities : By replanting and tendingseedlings in the forest, the communities were able to increase the forest cover andwith it the value of the forest. This may result in higher appreciation and awarenessof the value of natural ecosystems and their services.•Introduce NTFP for alternative income generation : By offering the commu-nities NTFP like spices, coffee or traditional beekeeping systems, the forest usergroups show more commitment for conserving the forest while getting a higherincome.•Create awareness with members and adjacent communities : In order to reach astrong sense of ownership and afﬁliation amongst the members, a constant aware-ness creation is needed. The contents of byelaws and management plans shouldbe accessible and transparent.•Support a smooth working environment : In order to ensure a proper documen-tation and ﬁnancial management, as well as the opportunity to hold meetings andbe visible in the community, it is recommended to establish basic ofﬁces for eachPFM group. Committee members should be regularly trained, but also evaluatedand, if needed, replaced.•Ensure regular monitoring, documentation and reporting : The agreed man-agement plan and byelaws have to be monitored properly and transparently andactivities have to be documented. In addition, patrolling is easier to organize whentime schedules are being set and agreed and reporting and evaluation formats arebeing provided.•Provide livelihood support : Accompanying the forest development, it provedadvisable to support the forest users with livelihood support like beekeeping, spiceproduction and other NTFP.•Demarcate PFM boundaries : For visibility, understanding and ownership itproved valuable to clearly demarcate PFM zones in the ﬁeld (e.g. paint markson trees, planting of border lines with non-native tree species).NABU continued its work on PFM in the Kafa Biosphere Reserve after thedescribed ﬁrst implementation phase and will continue doing so until 2019. It isplanned to further strengthen the almost 30 PFM sites established by NABU throughregular training, livelihood support and the development and legalisation of commonstandards for PFM sites. The latter will also help to easier measure the effectivenessof PFM groups in future (See Fig. 6).Community Action for Biodiversity and Forest Conservation … 91Fig. 6 Content FUG at Kafa Biosphere Reserve.

While many sawﬂy species are serious pests of horticulture and forestry,all sawﬂies found in the Andalusia Region are important pollinators. In order toevaluate if climate change affects sawﬂies in Spain, their present appearance anddistribution sampled form 2013 to 2016 was compared with the data collected from1920s to 1971. The results showed that biological cycle of some Symphyta specieswas advanced 20–30 days when compared with the dates of their usual presencein 1950–70s. While some species have been frequently found in the same areas as50 years ago, changes in climate affected vertical displacements to higher altitudesof other studied sawﬂy species. The most important ﬁndings of this study showedthat in the 21st century four species ( Megalodontes bucephalus, Macrophya militaris,Strongylogaster multifasciata, Dolerus (Poodolerus )puncticollis ) were not observedin any location nor sampling area, meaning that these species (important specializedpollinators) disappeared from the Andalusia region.J.

Barbir et al.IntroductionSawﬂies (Symphyta) are insects widely distributed throughout the world, but mostlyabundant and diverse in the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere wheresome species are characterized as important pests [e.g. Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy1975) known as the European pine sawﬂy]. In Spain, sawﬂies are linked to vegetationtypical for aquatic environments (e.g. ponds and streams) and many species are alsoserious pests of horticulture and forestry where each species of sawﬂy feeds on aspeciﬁc host. On the other hand, many sawﬂy species are important pollinators ofwild ﬂowers in Southern Spain.Sawﬂies (Symphyta) are wasps with a series of very primitive characteristics.They have not developed the agile articulation of the abdomen that characterizesthe majority of Hymenoptera, nor are they specialized, such as the Apocrita (therest of the bees and wasps), which have a drill or a stinger obtained throughoutthe evolution of the group. In addition they are not organized socially either, andtheir larvae conserve in their majority the phytophagous alimentary habits that areconsidered characteristic of the ﬁrst members of the Hymenoptera order. The ﬁrstSymphyta date from the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. The superfamily ofthe Tenthredinoidea, it seems that it had its origin later, in the Jurassic period of theSecondary Era, something more than 120 million years ago. This data indicates thatthey are still about 10 million years older than the butterﬂies (Viitasaari 2002 ).In many sawﬂy species, virgin females produce sex pheromones to attract males.In these cases the copulation between the two sexes takes place. However, there aremany species in which males are very rare such as Tenthredo (Cephaledo )Merid-iana (Serville 1823), Macrophya (Macrophya )militaris (Klug 1817 ) and others,and even in some species the male is unknown. In these species the females areparthenogenetic and the eggs are fertile without having previously copulated. Virtu-ally all generations are parthenogenetic, and usually only females emerge. However,occasionally a functional male may appear, possibly as an adaptive response to envi-ronmental changes (Burke 1962 ), given that sexual reproduction ensures a greatergenetic variety, favouring the appearance of individuals that adapt to the new con-ditions. Parthenogenesis can be adequate when a species is perfectly adapted in animmutable biotope. Considering this primitive biology of sawﬂies, they can be easilyaffected with climate change or other changes in environmental conditions (AguadoMartin 2007 ).Climate change affects biological cycles, habitats and migrations of many dif-ferent species (Hegland et al. 2009 ; Scaven and Rafferty 2013 ). Species may faceextinction if habitat sizes shrink (for example, at the pole or at mountain points), or ifimmigration barriers or limited dispersal ability prevent them from reaching newlysuitable habitat (Lambers 2015 ). Since in Spain sawﬂies are linked mainly to veg-etation typical for aquatic environments, they are vulnerable to changes in climate(especially humidity).Impact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 95Unfortunately, research trends are mainly related to the species that directly affectagricultural production or other economic interests, while species that do not directlytreat or beneﬁt humans are slightly disregarded. For example, direct effects of climatechange on the most important crop pollinators have received much attention lately,due to their crucial function in crop production (Scaven and Rafferty 2013 ; Barbiret al. 2014 ). Regarding sawﬂies, mainly important pests were studied in depth e.g.wheat stem sawﬂy (Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006 ), apple sawﬂy (Graf et al.2001 ), pine sawﬂy (Sholes 2011 ), etc. In all these studies, changes in temperaturesaffected biological cycle of sawﬂies, forcing them to vertically migrate, adapt topresent conditions or in worst cases to face extinction. In this study, all sawﬂy speciespresent in the study area were monitored and ﬁeld data was compared with climaticdata. The main objective of the study is to evaluate if changes in climate affectdistribution and presence of sawﬂies in Andalusia region.MethodologyIdentiﬁcation of Sawﬂy Species in the Andalusia RegionThe study presents some interesting ﬁndings collected in the 20th century and com-pares it with recent data collected in the same locations. The research started with thecompilation of data series regarding the presence of different sawﬂies in Andalusiaregion collected by the Institute of Acclimatization of Almeria in the period from1920s to 1980s (20th century). Subsequently, in the period between 2011 and 2015(21st century) several samples were taken in the same locations and periods as in20th century. This data was collected in order to compare present distribution of thesawﬂy species with their distribution detected in the 20th century.In each of the sampling locations regular transects were carried out, during the dif-ferent seasons, sweeping with the entomological sleeve different types of vegetationand substrates present in each of the previously selected habitats.All material captured in the ﬁeld was labelled including relevant information: date,location, UTM, altitude, type of vegetation, temperature, humidity and observations.Subsequently, captured sawﬂies were identiﬁed in the laboratory. In the speciﬁc caseof some species, larvae and their captive breeding were captured until adults emerge,in order to be able to obtain more details about their biological cycle.96 J. Barbir et al.Study AreaAndalusia sits at latitude between 36° and 38° 44/primeN, in the warm-temperate region.In general, it experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with dry summers.Study was conducted in 13 locations distributed along the Southern and Eastern partof the Andalusia region (Table 1). Three locations were located in Almeria province,four in Malaga province and six in Granada province. The locations were chosen inthe ﬁrst period when samplings were conducted (in 20th century) where the maincriteria for choosing speciﬁc location was presence or absence of sawﬂies in thatarea.As shown in the table above (Table 1), the sampling sites were located in differentattitudes (from 524 to 2500 m) what provided the necessary insight in two mostimportant climatic parameters—temperature and humidity. In order to better visu-alize locations of sampling spots, locations where grouped in three areas: Malaga(1), Sierra Nevada (2) and Alto Guadiana (3) (Fig. 1). Each area is characterizedby different microclimate due to differences in altitude, temperature and humidity(Figs. 1,2,3,4and 5).Table 1 Sampling locationsLocations Municipality Province Altitud (m)Albergue Universitario, SierraNevadaPradollano Granada 2500V eleta, Río Dilar, Sierra Nevada Pradollano Granada 2500Horcajo Trevelez - SierraNevada Trévelez Granada 2176Puerto de la Ragua SierraNevada Bayárcal Almería 2041Refugio Postero Alto, Barrancode Alhorí Jeréz delMarquesado Granada 1900Barranco de Molina, SierraMaría María Almería 1649La Sagra, Fuente Tornajo Huéscar Granada 1558Sierra Alcojona Ronda Málaga 1498Puerto del Lobo, Sierra Nevada Víznar Granada 1386Alpujarras Juviles Granada 1255Puerto del Saucillo, Sierra delas Nieves Y unquera Málaga 1200Alpujarras Laujar de Andarax Almería 804Nacimiento de Moyano, Sierrade Ronda Gaucín Málaga 612Benaoján-Montejaque,Grazalema Benaoján Málaga 524Impact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 97Fig. 1 Locations and altitudes of sampling sites: (1) Malaga; (2) Sierra Nevada; (3) Alto GuadianaIn Malaga (Fig. 1—1) the lowest altitude is 524 m.a.s.l., located at Benaoján-Montejaque, Grazalema. The highest altitude in Malaga (Fig. 1—1) is 1200 m.a.s.l.at Puerto del Saucillo, Sierra de las Nieves. In accordance with the land cover datafrom CORINE (Bossard et al. 2000 ), the vegetation on the lower altitude area is densescrubland with oak trees. In high areas vegetation is dense coniferous forest andscrubland. In addition, there are many streams in this area (Zarzalones, Quejigales,and Moyano) along with the River V erde, which allows the existence of pastureswith different plant species (fam. Ranunculáceae, Pinsapo masses, junipers, oaks,melojos, cork oaks, hawthorns, gorse, rosemary, lavender and rockrose).In Sierra Nevada (Fig. 1—2) the lowest altitude is at Juviles, Alpujarras, with1255 m.a.s.l.. The highest altitude is at Albergue Universitario and V eleta, Río Dilar,in Sierra Nevada, with 2500 m.a.s.l. In accordance with the CORINE Land Coverdata, the vegetation on the lower altitude area is scrubland with patches of coniferousforest. In high areas vegetation is scarce, mainly pasture and scrubland.In Alto Guadiana (Fig. 1—3), only two sampling sites are present at similaraltitudes (1498 and 1558 m.a.s.l.). CORINE Land Cover data indicates scrublandand coniferous forest and dry-land crops.98 J. Barbir et al.Data Collection and AnalysisLocations where sampled in the 20th century (from year 1926 to 1983) and again inthe 21st century (from year 2011 to 2015). Scientiﬁc approach was based on the dataavailable from the Acclimatization Institute of Almeria, collected in the 20th century.These data have been compared with the data collected in the 21st century, deﬁning aset of general displacement trends between the two intervals. In each location wherethe species suffered changes the trends have been identiﬁed.The altitude has been considered as a classiﬁcation factor, since it is closelyrelated with important changes in humidity and temperature even under small spatialdistances. These changes in climatic variables can provoke migration of the speciesto different areas. For this reason, the altitudinal analysis has been complementedwith the climatic data of the Andalusia region obtained from the EnvironmentalInformation Network of Andalusia (REDIAM 2017 ). The data used is: (a) Annualaverage temperature during the most recent reference period considered by the IPCC,1971–2000 (Hoerling et al. 2011 ; Kirtman et al. 2013 ), and the last ﬁve years ofavailable information (2010–2015); and (b) Annual average of Humidity Index (HI)calculated as precipitation (P) divided by the potential evapo-transpiration (ETP),during the intervals 1971–2000 and 2010–2015.The comparison between these two factors and the sampling sites allows dis-cussing the migration trends of each species at local and regional scales.ResultsSawﬂy Species Identiﬁed in the Study AreaField samplings in the Andalusia Region were preformed between 1926 and 1983and allowed identiﬁcation of 22 species of sawﬂies (Table 2). The most abundantfamily is Tenthredinidae with 17 different species, while two species from Argidaeand Cimbicidae families were detected, and one species Megalodontes bucephalus(Klug 1824 ) from Megalodontesidae family was located in the study area (Table 2).The most abundant species in the study area were polyphagous sawﬂies fromSuperfamily Tenthredinoidea (both adults and their larvae). Even within the Super-family Tenthredinoidea some specialized species in the sub-family Selandriinae werefound. This is one of the most primitive sub-families, composed of numerous speciesbelonging mainly to the genus Dolerus . These primitive sawﬂies species are alwayslinked to only one genus of primitive plants (genus Carex ,Equisetáceas (genus Equi-setum ) and Juncaceas (Juncus )). These plants normally grow in meadows, peat bogsand swampy environments and for that reason the sawﬂies feeding and pollinatingthem occupied the same habitat.In 21st century, each location was studied again and the same species as in20th century were searched, as well as connection between distribution of sawﬂiesImpact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 99Table 2 Species identiﬁed in the study areaOrder Family Sub-family Genus Specie Author Sub-specieHymenoptera Argidae Arginae Arge melanochroa Gmelin ( 1790 )Hymenoptera Argidae Arginae Arge ochropus Gmelin ( 1790 )Hymenoptera Cimbicidae Abiinae Abia sericea Linnaeus ( 1767 )Hymenoptera Cimbicidae Coryninae Corynis dusmeti Konow ( 1905 )Hymenoptera Megalodontesidae Megalodonteninae Megalodontes bucephalus Klug ( 1824 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Selandriinae Dolerus(Achaetoprion)uliginosus (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Selandriinae Dolerus (Dolerus) germanicus (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Selandriinae Dolerus(Cyperolerus)anticus (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Selandriinae Dolerus(Poodolerus)puncticollis (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Selandriinae Strongylogaster(Strongylogaster)multifasciata (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Tenthredininae Macrophya(Macrophya)annulata (Lacourt, 1999 )Hymenoptera Tenthredinidae Tenthredininae Macrophya(Macrophya)militaris (Lacourt, 1999 )(continued)100 J.

Besides the effect of climate change on vertical displacementof sawﬂies, the results showed that biological cycle of some sawﬂy species wasadvanced 20–30 days when compared with the dates of their usual presence in1950–70s.Climate Change in the Andalusia RegionProcessing climatic data from the Andalusia region, it has been found that averagetemperature and humidity changed in 21st century in comparison to data processedin 20th century.Changes in TemperatureAnalised temperature data showed that averege temperatures in the inteval from 2010to 2015 increased in comparison with the average tempereatures in the referenceperiod between 1971–2000 (Figs. 2and 3).Fig. 2 Average temperatures in the period from 1971 to 2000: (1) Malaga; (2) Sierra Nevada; (3)Alto Guadiana102 J. Barbir et al.Fig. 3 Average temperatures in the period from 2010 to 2015: (1) Malaga; (2) Sierra Nevada; (3)Alto GuadianaThese changes are specially intense in the lower latitudes of Malaga and SierraNevada at low and mid altitudes, and less on the higher altitudes (> ~1500 m.a.s.l.). Inparticular, higher temperatures rise in valley bottoms, plain and coastal areas, whilehigher peaks keep similar temperatures.In the 21st century average temperatures reached 19° in some regions of Malagaand Sierra Nevada (Fig. 3), while in 20th century maximum average temperatureswere 17° (Fig. 2).Impact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 103Fig. 4 Average Humidity Index in the period from 1971 to 2000: (1) Malaga; (2) Sierra Nevada;(3) Alto GuadianaChanges in HumidityIn addition, data showed important changes in humidity (Humidity Index (HI))between the two periods (Figs. 4and 5). Humidity Index has been signiﬁcantlyreduced in all study areas. In the maps below (Figs. 4and 5), these changes in HIhave been visually presented, showing changes in different blue tones (dark-blueshows high HI and light-blue low HI). These changes are particularly intense in theoriental sampling sites (Alto Guadiana and Sierra Nevada) at all altitudes, but spe-cially at higher mountanious areas (> ~1500 m.a.s.l.) where humidty shows a cleartrend to desertiﬁcation (HI<1).104 J. Barbir et al.Fig. 5 Average Humidity Index in the period from 2010 to 2015: (1) Malaga; (2) Sierra Nevada;(3) Alto GuadianaEffect of Changes in Humidity and Temperatureon Displacement of SawﬂiesIn comparison with data from the 20th century, differences in climatic parameters(temperature and humidity) and distribution of sawﬂy species in studied locationshave been found in 21st century (Table 3). The results showed that in some locationsnumber of sawﬂy species decreased, while in others increased or did not change.In most locations average temperature increased, however in two locations above2000 m (V eleta and Horcajo Trevelez in Sierra Nevada) and one at 612 m (NacimientoArroyo Moyano in Malaga) slightly decreased (Table 3).In addition, the results showed that HI has been reduced in all sampling loca-tions except Benaoján-Montejaque, Grazalema (Malaga), where it slightly increased(Table 3).The most signiﬁcant reduction in HI was noticed in Malaga (Nacimiento ArroyoMoyano) followed by several locations in Sierra Nevada (all above 2000 m).Therefore, decrease of sawﬂy species in the same sampling locations could beclosely related with changes in climate (decrease in humidity or increase in tem-perature) (marked in red-Table 3). Nevertheless, the effect of microclimate and/orhuman activities in each area has a signiﬁcant role and it can bias the obtained results.Impact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 105Table 3 Species count differences for each site compared with temperature and humidity index variations between the intervalsSite Altitude (m) Speciesbefore 1980Species after2010 Difference Tº dif 2010–20151971–2000 HI 2010–2016/1971–2000SierraNevada Albergue Universitario,Sierra Nevada 2500 4 1 −3 1.54223 −0.45907V eleta, Río Dilar, SierraNevada2500 0 5 5 −0.50809 −0.17531Horcajo Trevelez - Srra.Nevada2176 6 4 −2 −0.21871 −0.50198Puerto de la Ragua,Sierra Nevada2041 3 4 1 0.91798 −0.4148Refugio Postero Alto,Barranco de Alhorí1900 1 3 2 0.61558 −0.30692Puerto del Lobo, SierraNevada1386 3 1 −2 0.99955 −0.24939Alpujarras, J 1255 3 4 1 1.22439 −0.24308Alpujarras, LA 804 3 1 −2 1.63547 -0.27855Malaga Sierra Alcojona 1498 3 3 0 0.57329 −0.15898Puerto del Saucillo,Sierra de las Nieves1200 3 3 0 1.32052 −0.23672Nacimiento arroyoMoyano, Sierra deRonda612 4 2 −2 −0.1416 −0.5052Benaoján-Montejaque,Grazalema524 2 3 1 1.22363 0.16542AltoGuadiana Barranco de Molina,Sierra María 1649 3 5 2 0.46915 −0.09233La Sagra, Fuente Tornajo 1558 11 10 −1 1.2768 −0.39631106 J.

On the other side, the results of this study showed that six of the sawﬂyspecies migrated to higher and three to lower locations. Only one species ( Tenthredocoquebertii ) migrated to other locations but without changing the altitude (horizon-tal displacement), while two species ( Corynis dusmeti andTenthredo mesomelas )disappeared from lower altitude and were detected only at higher altitudes (Table 4).The most important ﬁndings of this study showed that in transects conductedin the 21st century four species ( Megalodontes bucephalus, Macrophya militaris,Strongylogaster multifasciata, Dolerus (Poodolerus) puncticollis ) were not observedin any location nor sampling area (Table 4), meaning that these species are not presentanymore in the Andalusia region.Data presented in Table 4was summarized in Table 5, showing that 36% ofsawﬂy species migrated to higher locations, only 14% to lower locations, while 18%of the species disappeared from the study area. The results also showed that 27% ofthe species were not affected by altitude or climatic conditions (Table 5) and theymaintained present in the same locations as 50–80 years ago. In addition, only 5%(one species) displaced horizontally, probably caused by changes in habitat provokedby human activity.108 J. Barbir et al.DiscussionChanges in temperatures affect biological cycle of sawﬂies, forcing them to migrate,adapt to present conditions or in worst cases to face extinction. Changing climateaffects ecosystems since warming may force species to migrate to higher latitudeswhere temperatures are more favourable for their survival. In this study, of twenty-two sawﬂy species found in the 20th century only eighteen species were re-found inthe 21st century in the Andalusia region. Although all initial locations were trans-crossed again in 21st century, the data of this study showed that 4 sawﬂy speciesdisappeared from the study area.In addition, the results showed important vertical and horizontal displacementsof sawﬂies to different locations. This was especially observed in sawﬂy specieswith narrow temperature optima, since they are highly affected with climate change(Sholes 2011 ). Similar ﬁndings have been proven for other insects, as for example,migration of pollinators was described by Scaven and Rafferty ( 2013 ) or adaptationof different herbivores to changes in climate in Gutbrodt et al. ( 2011 ). Regardingsawﬂies, only the most important sawﬂy pests were studied in depth e.g. wheatstem sawﬂy (Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006 ), apple sawﬂy (Graf et al. 2001 ),pine sawﬂy (Sholes 2011 ). However, this study was focused on all sawﬂy speciesdetected in the study area and the results of cross-transects showed that none of thespecies in that area is pest to horticultural or forest crops. In contrary, the sawﬂiesstudied are beneﬁcial since they are natural pollinators of the plants where they growand feed, contributing in maintenance of the botanical biodiversity of landscapes. Forthat reason, disappearance of sawﬂy species in the study area can provoke changesat many levels.Most of the studied sawﬂies are insects adapted to warm environments with highdegree of humidity, usually coinciding with the emergence of adults with the ﬂow-ering of a large number of weeds that will provide them with the necessary proteinsfor their feeding (pollen) as well as the essential sugars (nectar). For that reason,decrease in humidity might be the more important trigger for sawﬂy displacementthan elevated temperature in the 21st century.Although vertical displacement (migration of species to higher or lower latitudes)is mainly related with changes in climate, horizontal displacement can frequently beprovoked by human activities, changes in habitat or landscape etc. Man alters thelandscapes by reducing some of the meadows to expand crops or forest plantations(mainly pine trees), or to extend ski slopes at the Sierra Nevada (Aguado Martin2016 ). All this has reduced and fragmented some habitats and affected the survivalof some species in a very negative way, especially for some sawﬂy species (e.g.Corynis ,Dolerus andMegalodonts ) which have low rate of mobility (they are ableto move only between 40 and 100 meters from the place they were born) (AguadoMartin 2016 ).Among the species studied, the most sensitive ones, both for their nutritionalspecialization and for their habitats, are Megalodontes bucephalus andCorynis dus-meti , both related to plants of the genus Ranunculus , in which their larvae feed andImpact of Climate Change on Sawﬂy (Suborder: Symphyta) … 109adults feed and mate. These plants begin to be scarce in some areas, so these speciesmust so follow water streams to avoid dehydration and survive, or they must ﬂy towooded areas (pine forests, pins pares, underbrush) where these ﬂowers keep grow-ing (Aguado Martin 2016 ). One of the species that disappeared, Strongylogastermultifasciata is linked in the areas studied to the presence of ferns, but these plantshave drastically reduced their habitat. In addition, the maximum temperatures startto be almost insurmountable for the development of their larvae.Disappearance of Dolerus puncticollis cannot be found in its nutritional plants(grasses), since these survive in the study area, but rather in the temperature thresholdstoo high, since it is a very sensitive to high temperatures and they also need a highhumidity for survival.Finally, Macrophya milittaris (species usually lives only in cool and shady areasand close to riverbank forests or water courses) was not found in 21st century, sincechanges in climate affected vegetation drastically. Its disappearance since 1952 isquite striking and it has been telling us how climate change in the south of theIberian Peninsula has been occurring for many decades in a slow and progressive butunstoppable way. This study showed that climatic change caused disappearance andmigration of some sawﬂy species, while others were negatively affected with humanactivity. The main limitation of this study is low number of repetitive observation inthe second observation period. For that reason, it is highly recommended to conductsimilar studies in the future, in order to obtain complete image of what is causing thedisplacements of sawﬂy populations in the Andalusia Region and to ﬁnd the mostsustainable way how to mitigate it.ConclusionsEvaluating the most important climatic parameters, humidity and temperature, havebeen observed that climate changed in the last 100 years in the study area (Andalusiaregion, Spain). In many locations of this study, average temperature increased andhumidity index decreased. These changes can affect survival of many species in theirnatural habitat. The study showed that in some locations number of sawﬂy speciesdecreased while in others increased or did not change. In addition, some of the sawﬂyspecies migrated to higher or lower locations, while others migrated to other loca-tions but without changing the altitude. The study showed that in the 21st centuryfour species ( Megalodontes bucephalus, Macrophya militaris, Strongylogaster mul-tifasciata, Dolerus (Poodolerus) puncticollis ) were not observed in any location norsampling area, meaning that these species are not anymore present in the Andalusiaregion. In conclusion, changes in climate affected vertical displacements of differentsawﬂy species as well as disappearance of four sawﬂy species in Andalusia region.110 J.

The most important function of the shade -grown coffee agroforestrysystem is the reduction of theconcentration of Carbon in the atmosphere. It is esti-mated that one-hectare shade-grown coffee farm with large forest trees can sequester70–80 tonnes of carbon per hectare, which is more or less equivalent to the carbonstored in anequal area of forest. A fullsun–grown or open coffee in one hectare canonly store less than 10 tonnes of carbon. “Monsooned Malabar Arabica Coffee is aspecialty coffee of India, sourced from shade coffee plantation and has geographicalindication (GI) protection. Shade grown coffee also serves as a refuge for biodiver-sity and its diverse and complex structure has a high potential to retain biodiversityin the changing climate scenarios. In this context, this paper discusses the nexus ofcoffee, climate and biodiversity and its implications with Wayanad, Kerala, India asa case study. This paper emphasizes the need for promoting sustainable productionand consumption of coffee as a carbon neutral brand and promotion of shade grown,biodiversity rich and climate resilient coffee can emerge as a highly valued com-N.

Attempts atrevival of the shade grown coffeesystem amongst the small growers with appropriate steps in marketing the coffeeas a specialty product (carbon neutral and grown in bio-diverse environment) arediscussed.IntroductionThe Paris agreement on climate change strengthens the global response to the threatofachanging climate by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increaseeven further to 1.5 °C (UNFCCC 2017 ). Therefore, keeping global temperaturebelow the estimated level by reducing GHG in the atmosphere is essential. Removingatmospheric carbon and storing it in the terrestrial biosphere is one of the options,which have been proposed to compensate GHG emissions (Albrecht and Kandji2003 ). The importance of agroforestry systems as carbon sinks has recently beenrecognized due to the need of climate change mitigation (Soto-Pinto et al. 2010 ).It is also considered as an option aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gasesin the United Nations based REDD + (reducing emissions from deforestation andforest degradation, conserving and enhancing forest carbon stocks, and sustainablymanaging forests) program for tropical developing regions (Atangana et al. 2014 ;Tumwebaze and Byakagaba 2016 ). It has the potential to sequester atmosphericcarbon in trees and soil while maintaining sustainable productivity (Oelbermannet al. 2004 ). It can mitigate GHG emissions, conserve biodiversity and generateincome (Hager 2012 ). Given that the most signiﬁcant increases in carbon storageon land can be achieved by moving from low-biomass, land-use systems to tree-based systems, the practice of agroforestry presents a viable option for forest-basedmitigation (Polzot 2004 ).Coffee agroforestry has emerged as a promising land use system for sequesteringcarbon and contributing to climate change mitigation (Dossa et al. 2008 ; Soto-Pintoet al. 2010 ; Schmitt-Harsh et al. 2012 ). Given enhanced carbon sequestration thatoccurs with tree planting and the practice of agroforestry farming, shade growncoffee systems have been recognized as viable afforestation and reforestation (A&R)strategies under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol(IPCC 2000 ; UNFCCC 2006 ; Schmitt-Harsh et al. 2012 ). Compared to non- shadedor partially shaded plantations, shade-grown coffee stores signiﬁcant amounts ofcarbon in both the abovegr ound woody biomass of shade trees and the litter layerand soil organic matter. These pools contribute to GHG emission reductions and thealleviation of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere (Polzot 2004 ). On the other hand,coffee is cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, a practice that ensures the longevityof the farm, supports biodiversity, and provides communities with a broad array ofecosystem services (Jha et al. 2011 ).Coffea arabica is grown under the shade of trees,which moderate the microclimate for the beneﬁt of the crop (Van Kanten and Vaast2006 ; Siles et al. 2010 ; Hergoualch et al. 2012 ). Moderately shaded Coffea arabicaCoffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 115coffee plants have photosynthetic rates three times higher than coffee leaves underfull sun and planting Coffea arabica under shade is the most important for bothquality improvement and maintaining sustainable production (Alemu and Dufera2017 ). Recent studies in traditional shaded coffee plantations have demonstratedthis agroecosystem’s potential as a refuge for biodiversity (Perfecto et al. 1996 ;Moguel and Toledo 1999 ; Perfecto et al. 2003 ). Shade grown coffee plantation hasdiverse, complex structure and that has a high potential to retain biodiversity in thechanging climate scenarios. However, researches in coffee systems have allowedfor an improved understanding of habitat management and biodiversity, a closerexamination of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services (Jhaet al. 2014 ), and a greater understanding ofthe linkage between climate change andbiodiversity. Thus, densely shaded coffee agroforests besides demonstrable carbonbeneﬁts, it also provides a number of other ecosystem services and functions (e.g. soilconservation, water regulation) similar to natural forest ecosystems (Schmitt-Harshet al. 2012 ). Shaded coffee provides a viable business case to coffee smallholders andsupports biodiversity and ecosystem services. Besides the direct beneﬁts to small-scale coffee farmers, further opportunities to increase the attractiveness of shadedplantations may lie in ecosystem services related to shade trees (Jezeer and Verweij2015 ). While the ecological and socioeconomic costs and beneﬁts associated withshade coffee are clear, many modern management schemes abandon shade practicesand also there are many challenges inbridging sustainable coffee management withlivelihood security (Jha et al. 2011 ). Importantly, biodiversity declines within coffeesystems are of particular concern, given that ecosystem services such as pollination,pest control, erosion control, watershed management, and carbon sequestration areworth billions annually and are largely a function of biodiversity levels (Wardle et al.2011 ; Jha et al. 2014 ).Thus, the rationale behind this paper is to develop a holistic understanding of acomprehensive approach to study carbon beneﬁts, conserve biodiversity, and sustainecosystem services of theshade-grown coffee system in the face of climate change.The objective of this paper is to discuss that the shade-grown coffee has a high poten-tial for carbon storage, studying its carbon proﬁle and promoting their application asa signiﬁcant climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve biodi-versity and to sustain ecosystem services in the Indian context. It is also to highlightthe value of Shade Coffee System in the conservation of quite a good number ofthreatened tree species of Western Ghats (a global biodiversity hotspot), which are inuse as the source of products such as timber, fruits, nuts, resins and gums or barks. Inthis paper, we have taken Wayanad District of Kerala in India as a case study and weoutlined the shade-grown coffee through the lens of climate change and biodiversity.We have also discussed the difference between traditional shade and modern opensystem and highlighted the nexus of carbon stock of coffee production system andbiodiversity. Importantly, we emphasized the need for promoting sustainable pro-duction and consumption as a carbon neutral coffee brand and accentuate that shadegrown, biodiversity rich and climate resilient coffee can emerge as a high lyvalue dcommodity in theworld coffee market.116 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.Coffee, Climate, and Biodiversity of Wayanad, KeralaWayanad is a highland region with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100 m above sea-level and a district in the southern state of Kerala in India that enjoys a unique localclimate and culture (Fig. 1). Major climate trends observed in Wayanad include risingminimum temperatures, weakening in the early phase of the south-west monsoonprecipitation; theincreasing polari zation of daily rainfall and more frequent heavyrainfall days (Srinath and Kumar 2012 ). Thus, it has a hot and humid climate, withaminimum temperature ranging from 14 to 20 °C, maximum 25–32 °C. Becauseof abundant sun and rainfall (2000–3000 mm per year, spread out over 10 months),this is ahighly fertile land (Fransen 2009 ). The topography of Wayanad describedis responsible for a unique climate in Wayanad that is quite distinct from the climateof neighboring regions. It is responsible for a strong gradient in rainfall within thedistrict as well. The primary rainfall season of the region is during the south-westmonsoon period (Kumar and Srinath 2011 ).Fig. 1 Map of the study area—Wayanad, Kerala, IndiaCoffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 117Wayanad is declared as one of the 18 true agro biodiversity hotspots in the world(Joy 2004 ). Wayanad-Silent Valley region in the Western Ghats is a global biodi-versity hotspot. This region is climate vulnerable in terms of scores of factors like(i) higher variation in rainfall, (ii) chances of ﬂash ﬂoods and prolonged droughts,(iii) increased occurrences of forest ﬁre, (iv) landslide, (v) unscientiﬁc land usepattern, (vi) erosion of biodiversity, (vii) concentration of tribal communities andlandless people, (viii) lower ranking in the human development index and highersocial deprivation and environmentally fragile landscapes, and (ix) high percentageofthepopulation of small holder farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture.Today it is home to a complex agro-forestry economy where major plantationcrops such as coffee, pepper and tea along with crops such as rice and banana, alongwith a host of others are grown intensively at multiple times in the year. Wayanad isalso home to a large tribal population (17.43% of thetotal population as per Census2001) who are socio-economically worse off compared to the general populace.Apart from the general climate-dependent nature of the economy, the small size ofland-holdings of most farmers in Wayanad and the large sttribal population rendersthe people and the livelihoods of Wayanad highly vulnerable to climate change andvariability (Srinath and Kumar 2012 ).Coffee is one of the important plantation crops of India, which is cultivated mainlyin the hill tracts of South India especially in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Theother important States of India in which coffee is grown on a limited scale areAndhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam, Andaman and Nicobar Islands,and Madhya Pradesh (Joy 2004 ). Kerala is the second largest producer of coffee inIndia. It produces 23% of the total coffee output in the country. Wayanad produces90% of the total coffee output in the State (Joy 2004 ). Of the territory of Wayanad,54% is agriculture land, 37% is forest. The main product is coffee and it occupies110,000 ha, 58% of the total agricultural land in the district. 80% of total coffee inKerala arefrom Wayanad (Fransen 2009 ). The district is rich in agrobiodiversitythough on-farm erosion of genetic diversity of crops, breeds and strains are reportedhigh in the region (Kumar et al. 2010 ,2015 ).The wild biodiversity of Wayanad is also very rich both in terms of species, genera,families, and high percentage of endemism (MSSRF 2016 ). The area of Wayanad fallsentirely within the Western Ghats of India, which was one of the eighteen biodiversityhot spots proposed originally by Myers (Myers et al. 2000 ; Santhoshkumar andIchikawa 2010 ). The forests here are globally important as they house endemicﬂora and fauna, which include 229 species of plants, 31 species of mammals, 15species of birds, 52 species of amphibians. Among these, 55 species are criticallyendangered, 148 species are endangered and 129 species are vulnerable as per IUCNclassiﬁcation. Moreover, a number of cultivated food plants have their wild relativesin these forests. Among spices, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon and curcumahave their wild relatives largely in these wet evergreen forests (Santhoshkumar andIchikawa 2010 ).118 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.Coffee Cultivation: Traditional Shade and Modern OpenSystemCoffee cultivation provides livelihoods for a large number of people live in thebiodiversity-rich mountainous states of India like Wayanad, Kerala. Coffee ( Coffeaarabica (de Jessieu) Linn) was introduced in India about 400 years ago in theBabaBudan hills in the Western Ghats, which presently a global biodiversity hotspot.India’s wild coffee species are C. bengalensis, C. travancorensis, C. wightiana,C.khasiana andC.jenkinsii. Amongst these species the ﬁrst three were convention-ally placed under the genus Psilanthus , but of late all being treated as species of thegenus Coffea .Coffea robusta L(C. canephora Pierre ex A froehner) and the vari-eties like Cauvery, S.795, and Sln 9 which perform well in a broad range of shade(30–60%) are becoming the preferred choices in the major coffee grown regions ofIndia. Figure 2a and b represents shade coffee farms and open or partially shadedcoffee farm in Wayanad District of Kerala, India. Though Coffee is considered asone of the major agricultural commodities that drive deforestation, the traditionalfarming methods of the small coffee growers in India were on the contrary to thisbelief. Since 1840 the British popularized coffee cultivation on a plantation modein selectively cleared evergreen and moist-evergreen forest slopes of the mediumelevation mountains, mainly in thesouth west and eastern region of India, in threestates Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Now Coffee plantations being spread in thenorth eastern hill regions of the country too. Till early part of 1990s “Arabica coffee”dominated the coffee plantation. The dominance of Arabica has been falling downfor the last 20–25 years with the preference over the Robusta variety-a sturdy, highyielding and sun-loving species. Now, nearly 80% of the Coffee plantations in Kar-nataka and Kerala dominated by the Robusta variety. Another variety that is grownin the region, but not for commercial purpose is Liberian Coffee ( Coffee liberica ).Presently, three different kinds of structural designs for growing coffee (Arabicaand Robusta coffee) have been seen, such as (i) substantially shaded ones (purelyArabica) integrated with large forest trees, which are mainly for growing black pep-per, and ground cover of ginger, clove and turmeric. This practice is mostly followedby the small scale farmers as an income security strategy by having multiple crops(ii) medium shaded farms (both Arabica and Robusta) with predominantly jack treesor the exotic silver oak trees integrated with pepper and ginger, or turmeric as groundcrops; and (iii) un-shaded or open mono crop farms with only Robusta. The predom-inant trend amongst the big planters of the region, is maintaining Robusta mono-cropcoffee farms in view of getting the maximum production from the target crop. Theresearch and development (R&D) system of the country gives more focus on onlyincreasing the total production and productivity of the coffee. Thus, this system ofproduction of coffee is getting popularized, and it is destructive to biodiversity andmany of the beneﬁcial ecosystem services (Kumar 2017 ).Coffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 119Fig. 2 a Shade coffee farms, Wayanad, Kerala, India. bOpen or partially shaded Coffee Farm,Wayanad, Kerala, India120 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.Shade Grown Coffee System Is Akin to Tropical ForestCoffee is shade tolerant and traditionally grown under shade trees in complex agro-forestry systems, thereby providing a refuge for biodiversity and sustaining otherecosystem services. Shade grown coffee is increasingly promoted as a promisingapproach to deal with the twin challenges of biodiversity conservation and localdevelopment. Biodiversity beneﬁts associated with shaded coffee practices are wellresearched and it is clear that these systems hold considerable potential to con-serve biodiversity (Bhagwat et al. 2008 ; Jezeer and Verweij 2015 ). The shade growncoffee forestry system has many features and functions of a tropical forest ecosys-tem. For example, many such farms are ground water recharging catchments andplaying a key role in themaintenance of the local hydrological systems (Kumar2017 ). Habitat on shade-grown coffee farms outshone sun-grown coffee farms withincreased numbers and species of birds as well as animproved bird habitat, soilprotection/erosion control, carbon sequestration, natural pest control and improvedpollination. While sun-grown systems can have higher yields, the shaded farms easilyoutperform them in sustainability measurements with the trees providing an array ofecological services that offer both direct and indirect “income/payback” to farmersand the environment (Rice 2010 ). Shaded coffee provides a viable business case tocoffee smallholders. Besides the direct beneﬁts to small-scale coffee farmers, shadetrees provide a sustainable and ﬁnancially viable strategy to cope with climate andpayments for ecosystem service (e.g. carbon sequestration) can increase farmer s’incomes (Jezeer and Verweji 2015 ).Some large shaded coffee farms in Wayanad district of Kerala were identiﬁed with85 different forest tree species (Table 1), the frog species diversity is also immenselyrich in shade coffee farms, which include 10 rare and threatened frog species (GroundFrog (1sp) Bush Frog (6 spp) and tree frog (3 spp). Out of this 9 species, six arerecently described new species (Refer Box. 1). Figure 3showcases some of the frogdiversity identiﬁed from the shade coffee farms of Wayanad, Kerala. Pseudophilatuswayanadensis is a mid-elevation species inhabiting leaf litter and shrubs and com-monly seen in the coffee plantations. Males are found calling from the top of thecoffee plants at an average heigt of 1.5 m the ground. Eggs laid in the soil under leaflitter (Jerdon 1854 ; Biju et al. 2010 );Raorchestes anili is a mid-elevation speciesinhabiting thick bushes, preferring shady canopy areas of coffee plantation. V ocalis-ing males with their distinct metallic “ting-ting-ting” calls are found during late mayto early October on the foliage up to 3 m and eggs are laid in the soil under leaf litter(Biju and Bossuyt 2006 ; Biju et al. 2010 );Raorchestes akroparallagii is a low-midelevation species having a wide distribution in the Western Ghats. Males are foundcalling from bushes at a height of 1–2 m from the ground. Various color morphsranging brown to yellow colors are observed within this species (Biju and Bossuyt2009 ; Biju et al. 2010 ). Details of information about other frog species are presentedin the Box. 1. Furthermore, over 80 bird species, more than in an equivalent area ofopen coffee land, and exceeded only by primary tropical forest also reported fromthis “semi -forest” plantation type.

Blume; wild turmeric like Curcuma neilgherrensis Wight, Curcuma pseu-domontana Graham, Curcuma raktakanta Mangaly & Sabu, and wild ginger suchasZingiber capitatum Roxb.,var. elatum (Roxb.) Baker, Zingiber zerumbet (L.) J.E.Smith, are the species that can common in a shade coffee farm in the district.Farmers cultivate spices like black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, gingerand turmeric as the intercrops of the coffee farm. The farms, especially the smallfarms also are integrated with thecultivation of areca nut, and species, like gingerand turmeric (Kumar 2017 ). Wayanad is a globally renowned region for its exclusivepeculiarity and uniqueness in harboring an enormous assemblage of diverse spicecrops, among which Wayanadan pepper has got place of pride in internationalmarket, because of its unique quality. The district’s coffee farms once harbored awide range of endemic pepper varieties which grew luxuriantly, yielded well andfairly paid the farmers. There are 25 odd pepper varieties being cultivated in thedistrict, mostly as the intercrop of coffee farms (Table 5). Over the last 150 yearsthis method of cultivation has been evolved into a sustainable, disease and pest freecoffee agro-forestry system (CAS).124 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.Box. 1 The frog diversity identiﬁed from shade Coffee Farms of Wayanad,Kerala, India1. Pseudophilatus wayanadensis is a mid-elevation species inhabiting leaf litterand shrubs and commonly seen in the coffee plantations. Males are found callingfrom the top of the coffee plants at an average height of 1.5 m the ground. Eggslaid in the soil under leaf litter (Jerdon 1854 ; Biju et al. 2010 ).2. Raorchestes anili is a mid elevation species inhabiting thick bushes, preferringshady canopy areas of coffee plantation. V ocalising males with their distinctmetallic “ting-ting-ting” calls are found during late May to early October onthe foliage up to 3 m and eggs are laid in the soil under leaf litter (Biju andBossuyt 2006 ; Biju et al. 2010 ).3. Raorchestes akroparallagii is a low-mid elevation species having a wide distri-bution in the Western Ghats. Males are found calling from bushes at a height of1–2 m from the ground. Various colour morphs ranging brown to yellow coloursare observed within this species (Biju and Bossuyt 2009 ; Biju et al. 2010 ).4. Raorchestes glandulosus is a high elevation species distributed above 800 mabove sea level. Males are found calling at a height of 3–4 m from the coffeeplantations (Jerdon 1854 ; Biju et al. 2010 ).5. Raorchestes ponmudi is a widely distributed species commonly found in thecoffee plantations. Males are observed calling from the leaves and branches ofcoffee plants and small trees up to 3 m in height. During the winter, severalindividuals can be found hibernating in tree holes (Biju and Bossuyt 2005a ;Biju et al. 2010 ).6. Raorchestes neros tagona is a tree dwelling species found in the coffee plan-tations of Wayanad. The cryptic lichen like colour pattern, provides excellentcamoﬂage from predators. Generally they found on the ground during the nonbreeding season. However, during breeding season, males climbing to the uppercanopy of tall trees to advertise their presence (Biju and Bossuyt 2005b ; Bijuet al. 2010 ).7. Racophorus malabaricus is a rain forest adopted canopy species commonlyseen in the coffee plantations. Build foam nest in water tanks of the coffeeplantations (Jerdon 1870 ).8. Racophorus laterralis is a mid-elevation species breed in the water tanks ofcoffee plantations (Boulenger 1883 ).9. Polypedates pseudocruciger is a low and mid-elevation species found inthe wooded areas. Found abundantly in the coffee plantations (Daniels andRavichandran 1995 ).10. Uperdon triangularis is seen in the leaf litter of coffee plantations and evergreenpatches of Western Ghats (Günther 1876 ).Coffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 125Pseudophilatus wayanadensis Raorchestes aniliRaorchestes akroparallagii Raorchestes glandulosusRaorchestes ponmudi Raorchestes nerostagonaRacophorus malabaricus Racophorus laterralisPolypedates pseudocruciger Uperdon triangularisFig. 3 S ome of the frog species found in shade coffee plantations inWayand, Kerala, India. Pho-tographs credits Dr. Anil Sachariya126 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.Know the Nexus of Carbon Stock of Coffee ProductionSystem and BiodiversityWayanad and theadjoining coffee grown areas experience a shift towards mono cropand high input farming. There are wide spread deliberate attempts for growing coffeecompletely exposed to sun with high input agro-chemicals for getting the maximumcrop productivity, and income. This change in farm practices and intensiﬁed use offarm inputs becomes a big sustainability issue, particularly in the context of biodiver-sity loss and the consequent climate vulnerabilities. The region is also experiencingunprecedented and irreversible climate variations like weakening in the early phaseof the south-west monsoon precipitation, increasing polarisation of daily rainfall,more frequent heavy rainfall days and rising minimum temperature. The challengesassociated with climate variations result in staggering poverty, especially amongstthe resource poor tribe communities like Paniya, Adiya andKattunaikka in Wayanad.It is also a fact that the indirect beneﬁt that enjoyed by people of the region in theform of increased removal of carbon through integrated coffee cultivation also hasnow getting diminished.In the light of climate change mitigation, carbon (C) storage in both living biomassand in the soil is a key ecosystem service provided by forests and agroforests (Bonan2008 ; Miles and Kapos 2008 ; Beenhouwer et al. 2016 ). In particular, the ecosys-tem services of traditionally maintained, shaded Arabica and Robusta coffee farmsbecome very prominent largely for increasing carbon removal. The most importantfunction of the shade grown traditional coffee agroforestry system is the reductionoftheconcentration of Carbon in the atmosphere. It is estimated that one hectareshade -grown coffee farm with large forest trees can sequester 70–80 tonnes of carbonper hectare, which is more or less equivalent to the carbon stored in anequal areaof forest. A fully sun–grown or open coffee in one hectare can only store less than10 tonnes of carbon (Noponen et al. 2012 ). A study in the adjacent Coorg regionreported the soil organic carbon sequestration potential of theshaded coffee sys-tem averaged 3.43 t/ha and microbial organic carbon content 831.76 mg/g comparedto 1.84 t/ha and 669.46 mg/g respectively that of thepartially shaded system withexotic silver oak trees (Kumar 2017 ). One of the major challenges at the interface ofclimate change and ecosystem science is to identify points of convergence betweenC storage and biodiversity conservation (Phelps et al. 2012 ). In general, a higherC storage potential is assumed to co-occur with biodiversity conservation (Venter2014 ; Beenhouwer et al. 2016 ). Two recent studies found a correlation when soil Cstorage was included. Woody plant species richness was associated with higher totalC (abovegr ound and soil) storage in a recent study of Costa Rican coffee agroforestrysystems by Hager ( 2012 ) and Saha et al. ( 2009 ) found a positive correlation betweensoil organic C and plant diversity in home gardens of India (Richards and Mendez2013 ).Coffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 127Table 2 Earthworm diversityrecorded from shade coffeefarmsFamily NameGlossoscolecidae Pontoscolex corethrurusAlmidae Glyphidr ilus annandaleiGlyphidrilus achencoiliMegascole cidae Megascolex konkanensisMegascolex trarancorensisOniligastridae Drawida pellucidaDrawida travancorensisDrawida g hatensisEudrilidae Eudrilus eugeniaeTable 3 Termites diversityrecorded from coffee farmsSub family NameMacrotermitinae Odontotermes anamallensisOdontotermes yadeviMicrotermes unicolorApicotermitinae Speculitermes chadaensisNasutitermitinae Nasutitermes matangensisGrallatotermes nigerTermitinae Dicuspiditermes incolaPseudocapritermes nrﬂetcheriTable 4 Ants diversity in thecoffee farmsSub family NameFormicinae Polyrhachis rastellataOecophylla smaragdinaMyrmecinae Tetramorium smithiSolenopsis geminataMyrmycaria brunneaParatrechina longicornisPonerinae Diacamma indicumOdontomachus haematogesLeptogenys minchiniiBothroponera ruﬁpesPseudomyrmecinae Tetraponera rufonigraDolichoderinae Tapinoma melanocephalumTapinoma sessile128 N.

Italy (mostly the Robustacoffee) and Russia (both Robusta and Arabica) are the top two buyers of Indian cof-fee, followed by Belgium, Spain, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, France, Japan andCoffee, Climate and Biodiversity: Understanding the Carbon … 129USA. “Monsooned Malabar Arabica Coffee “is a specialty coffee of India, sourcedfrom shade coffee plantation and has GI protection. This coffee is produced fromthe harvested cherries that are exposed to rain and winds of themonsoon for about3–4 months to make the pHbalance of the seeds neutral. But, this practice has beenalmost disappeared or restricted to only with some elite planters. There is a hugepotential to create animpact on farmers’ income by making shade coffee farming aproﬁtable venture and free from climate change risks (Kumar 2017 ). Because agroforests are human-managed systems, this may present an opportunity for farmersto manage such systems for greater C sequestration. However, this would requirea re-examination of mechanisms to support or reward shade coffee farmers (Davisand Mendez 2011 ; Richards and Mendez 2013 ). For example, small-scale farmershave generally been excluded from REDD, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),and other PES schemes for C sequestration because of the expense involved in man-aging multiple small farms and the lower per-hectare mitigation beneﬁts relativeto afforestation and reforestation projects (Wunder and Borner 2012 ; Richards andMendez 2013 ). Therefore, the promotion of shade grown, biodiversity -rich and cli-mate resilient Coffee can emerge as a highly valued commodity in theworld coffeemarket. Revival of the shade grown coffee system amongst the small growers withappropriate steps in marketing the coffee as a speciality product (carbon neutral andgrown in bio-diverse environment) can improve the farm income and enhance thecoffee agro-ecosystem services.ConclusionAgroforestry systems have been recognized for their potential to sequester largeamounts of C (Noponen et al. 2013 ). Agro ecosystems have the potential to act ascarbon sinks and carbon storage pools while contributing to increased farm produc-tion, environmental conservation and poverty alleviation (Pandey 2002 ; Manjunathaet al. 2016 ). On the other hand, agroforestry systems have substantial potential toconserve native biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. In particular, agro-forestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree diversity and sequestercarbon for climate change mitigation (Richards and Mendez 2013 ). Coffee farms asagroforestry may contribute to GHG mitigation and biodiversity conservation in asynergistic manner which has implications for the effective allocation of resourcesfor conservation and climate change mitigation strategies in the agricultural sector(Hager 2012 ). It is possible to produce high quality coffee without destructing bio-diversity or contributing negatively to some of the critical ecosystem services. Oneof the important steps to make the shade Coffee Agro-forestry System globally vis-ible is acreation of scientiﬁcally valid evidences on the biodiversity and ecosystemservices, and the emission- mitigation potential of this system. Evidence from suchstudy will also help to promote eco-tourism in the coffee production areas. There areno serious studies in India that analyzed the carbon emission in the entire value chainof Indian Coffee production, processing, transporting and consumption system. The130 N. P. Anil Kumar et al.need for atrans-disciplinary approach inclusive of the private industries in under-standing the entire life cycle of the coffee production system is urgent for developingcoffee production system and the value chain as a carbon neutral brand. Also, thereis a need to work upon “consumption awareness” which can positively impact onsustainable production of coffee. Since management practices such as shade use andreforestation inﬂuence both climate vulnerability and carbon stocks in coffee, theremay be synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation that could makeit advantageous to jointly pursue both objectives (Rahn et al. 2013 ). Importantly,there is aneed for policy incentives that encourage the planting and maintenance ofshade trees in coffee plantations for the beneﬁt of carbon sequestration (Tumwebazeand Byakagaba 2016 ). Accordingly, biodiversity of agro-ecosystems have impor-tant consequences for long-term carbon storage, and thus warrants incorporationinto the design, implementation, and regulatory framework of mitigation initiatives(Diaz et al. 2009 ). There have been signiﬁcant efforts to develop robust methods toaccount for the beneﬁts, if any, of sequestration and temporary storage and releaseof biogenic carbon. However, there is still no overall consensus on the most appro-priate ways of considering and quantifying it (Brandão et al. 2013 ). Thus, this paperemphasizes that the sustainably grown coffee helps to increase climate resilience,contributes to carbon mitigation, conserves biodiversity and stabilizes ecosystemswhile also helping farmers stabilize and improve their income and livelihood (Stifung2017 ).LimitationsAlthough this paper was thoughtfully prepared and reached its aim, there were somelimitations. Some of the limitations of the paper includes that (1) this paper hasonly outlined the conceptual nexus of coffee, climate and biodiversity, however,more investigations are warranted to establish the strong scientiﬁc approach to makeconnections among the three; (2) this paper has made an attempt to deepen theunderstanding on carbon stocks of the shade coffee production system of India,nonetheless a strategic methodological approach isrequired to assess the carbonstocks of the shade coffee production system of India; (3) lack of availability ofcarbon stock information at the local level of the shade coffee farms in India is oneof the important limitations of this paper to present any quantiﬁable information ofthe carbon stocks of the shade coffee production system.Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Dr. V .

Full, long-term (over many 100s of years) equilibrium globalwarming commitment, calculated by the constant atmospheric greenhouse gas com-position, is put at ‘about 2 °C’ by the IPCC 2014 assessment. Signiﬁcant furthercommitted warming at 2 °C is expected due to weakened terrestrial carbon sinks andlarge planetary sources of carbon feedback emissions. Committed climate changedue to policy is calculated from national emissions targets. Together these policytargets lead to over 3 °C global warming by 2100, which will increase much moreafter 2100. Commitment clearly shows the climate, oceans and biodiversity globalemergency, requiring the immediate decline of emissions with supporting responsesthat are well known and universally recommended.IntroductionClimate change will exacerbate the ongoing impacts of biodiversity loss. How muchdepends on already committed (locked in) global warming, and that depends on bothclimate science and policy commitments on emissions.This paper grew out of my interest in exploring the most policy-relevant aspectsof climate change, in particular regarding future life. Predicting the higher degreesof future climate change the world faces is essential for driving conservation andfor planning mitigation and adaptation. The greatly increased loss of biodiversity inthe future due to future global climate change is assessed here by looking at today’salready committed degrees of global climate change. This chapter treats biodiversityloss and ecosystem loss as one and the same. Climate change increases biodiversityP. D.

Carterloss, and biodiversity/ecosystem loss increases climate change by reducing landcarbon sinks, e.g., forests.That the world is in a very large extinction event has been known for manyyears. The same applies to climate change, as recorded in the assessments of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 1990 to 2014. It wasin 1996 that Richard Leakey published The Sixth Extinction: Patterns of Life andthe Future of Humankind (Leakey and Lewin 1996 ). In 2017 , Ceballos, Ehrlich,and Dirzo were published under the shocking title Biological annihilation viatheongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines .What is less well known is that already committed global climate change will makethe extinction rate far worse than projected (Urban 2015 ).Increasing Climate Change Increases Biodiversity LossIn its 2007 fourth assessment, the IPCC said:In the medium term (i.e., decades), climate change will increasingly exacerbate human-induced pressures, causing a progressive decline in biodiversity. Projected future climatechange and other human-induced pressures are virtually certain to be unprecedented com-pared with the past several hundred millennia. (IPCC 2007 , Working Group II 4.1.2.)Climate change impacts further increasing today’s accelerating biodiversity loss(Ceballos et al. 2015 ) would be a truly catastrophic case of abrupt climate change,as explained by the National Research Council (NRC) ( 2013 ): ‘The abrupt changesthat are already underway […] include increases in extinction rates of marine andterrestrial species.’ The NRC states that unchecked habitat destruction, fragmenta-tion, and over-exploitation combined with the ongoing pressures of climate changecould result in a mass extinction equivalent in magnitude to the one that wiped out thedinosaurs, and that it conceivably could occur before the year 2100. The predicted‘velocity’ of climate change—that is, how fast populations of a species would haveto shift in order to keep pace with the local climate envelope shift—is unprecedented.Future Catastrophic Biodiversity DeclineAll sources project large increases in species extinctions from global climate change.Even the best-case emissions scenario with immediate global emissions declineincreases the risk of extinctions (IPCC 2014a , WGII Summary for Policy Mak-ers). Both global climate change due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and theincreased extinction of species by climate change have great inertia, each takingdecades (or more for extinction). In view of the fact that the world is in or is enteringa catastrophic sixth major extinction event already, the effect of global climate changeImplications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 137would appear to be potentially cataclysmic to biodiversity, which is addressed in thischapter.The challenge of preserving enough habitat for biodiversity to recover in the futureis enormous. Pimm et al. ( 2014 ) (in arguably the most comprehensive research paperon future biodiversity loss under global climate change) say that conservation iskey, backed up by the point that the rate at which mammals, birds, and amphibianshave slid toward extinction over the past four decades would have been 20% higherwere it not for conservation efforts. Although the paper says that data and researchlag far behind what is needed, we nevertheless do know the two big solutions thatwould have enormous beneﬁt. These are: (1) conservation through the terminationof deforestation, and (2) termination of industrial age fossil fuel emissions. Thesuccess of conservation is a strong argument for the huge conservation upgrade inthe proposed plan of Wilson ( 2016 ) to protect half of the Earth’s land and oceans,and to end deforestation.Several Sources of Committed Climate Changeand Biodiversity LossCommitted climate change and biodiversity loss stem from both climate changepolicy and climate system science. If policies are improved, the policy commitmentmight lessen. Climate system commitment is actually much more than is publishedand is irreversible (locked in). Commitment further reinforces a cataclysmic outcomefor global biodiversity.The data on commitment paints a terrible picture for the future of biodiversity andthe natural world, so at the outset let us be reminded that we have all the solutions.They are well known, as explained by Sutter ( 2016 )i n‘ H o wt os t o pt h es i x t hm a s sextinction’, which included E. O. Wilson’s Half-Earth Project. These solutions aredeveloped, and they can be readily applied.Biodiversity loss is already extreme and accelerating. According to the NRC(2013 ), the extreme rate of acceleration in biodiversity loss is probably unprecedentedin 65 million years; today’s sixth mass extinction event reveals current biodiversityloss as an abrupt planetary catastrophe that will be further greatly accelerated by acommitted, unavoidable increase in global climate change. Data sets (see stateofour-climate.com) show that all climate change indicators from 1900 are accelerating,particularly atmospheric CO2, global surface warming, and ampliﬁed Arctic warm-ing, as well as ocean heating, ocean acidiﬁcation, and ocean deoxygenation.In terms of policy, this is an Earth (or biodiversity) emergency requiring imme-diate measures for concerted and energetic mitigation, adaptation and conservation.Assessing the projected committed impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity in globalclimate change models is essential for urgently planning both biodiversity conser-vation measures and climate change mitigation measures, and to plan strategies for138 P. D. Carteradaptation. Furthermore, committed climate change impacts on biodiversity must beprojected far beyond 2100 (the horizon used by the IPCC).In doing such an assessment, it is necessary to address the several sources thatcause greater committed future global climate change. In general, there are two typesof climate change commitment: (1) locked-in commitment due to climate changescience (for example, due to climate system inertia, observed ecosystem damage andloss at the time observed will be practically irreversible); and (2) climate changeemissions policy commitment. Both lead to a far greater degree of global climatechange than today’s—which is already having severe disastrous to catastrophic localand regional impacts on all continents.Commitment Due to Emissions PoliciesPolicy commitment—current government policy—is recorded by the national gov-ernment emissions targets ﬁled with the United Nations as intended nationally deter-mined contributions (INDCs). Combined, these will lead to a substantial increasein global emissions by 2030, according to an update from the UN Climate ChangeSecretariat ( 2016 ). Indeed, these emissions targets lead to a global warming of over3 °C by 2100 (which will be much higher after 2100), according to Climate ActionTracker ( 2017 ). This warming by 2100 is triple today’s warming of just over 1 °C.Because of ocean thermal inertia, full equilibrium warming long after 2100 wouldbe 6 °C.Also on policy commitment, the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change(UN Climate Change Secretariat 1992 ), to which all governments are bound, requiresthe stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level suf-ﬁcient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. Stabilization ofatmospheric GHG concentrations is the right metric to use because, unlike the globalaverage surface warming alone, the atmospheric GHG concentrations account foradditional committed warming in the future. However, atmospheric GHG concen-trations are already far above a safe level for ecosystems, on land and in oceans, andCO2increase is accelerating.Climate System Science CommitmentThe climate system inertia of the ocean heat lag commits warming by 2100 to doublelong after 2100, which can be seen in Fig. 1by 2300, and which is best explainedby the NRC Climate Stabilization Targets ( 2011 ). Added to that, there will be extrawarming from carbon feedback emissions. A signiﬁcant degree of global warmingcauses more emissions and then more warming, so at least a doubling of warmingfrom now on is predictable. Based on a 2012 global warming of 0.85 °C, the IPCCﬁfth assessment’s WGI ( 2013 ) estimated that the climate system inertia commitmentImplications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 139Fig. 1 Projected climate change impacts on ecosystems and species according to degrees of globalwarming (vs. pre-industrial) (Image reprinted courtesy of IPCC Climate Change 2007 WorkingGroup II Fig. 4.4, published by Cambridge University Press)due to the ocean heat lag would be an extra 0.6 °C by 2100 and a full equilibriumwarming commitment of ‘about 2 °C’ long after 2100 (WGI, Chap. 12). This does notaccount for extra warming by carbon feedbacks. Global warming in early 2018 was1.1 °C and atmospheric CO2was 408 ppm (March 2018 seasonally adjusted meanCO 2), which would put today’s committed warming at about 2.08 °C. AtmosphericCO 2is increasing faster than ever. This can only be expected to lead to a collapse ofglobal and regional ecosystem biodiversity. Also, both committed global temperatureincreases (i.e., policy and science) last for a thousand or more years (Solomon et al.2009 ), over which time many more species will be driven to extinction.Climate Change Danger LimitsThe ﬁrst estimate for a climate change danger limit was in 1990 and was basedon safety for ecosystems. ‘A maximum sea level rise of between 0.2 and 0.5 mabove the 1990 global sea level’ and ‘a maximum rate of rise of between 20 and50 mm per decade’ were recommended to ‘permit the vast majority of vulnerableecosystems, such as natural wetlands and coral reefs, to adapt’ because ‘beyond thisrate of rise, damage to ecosystems will rise rapidly’ (Rijsberman and Swart 1990 ). A140 P. D. Cartermean global temperature rise limited to a maximum rate of change in temperature of0.1 °C per decade was recommended based on an understanding of the vulnerabilityof ecosystems.While global temperature increase in 2016 was just above 1.0 °C, scientists in 1990believed that ‘temperature increases beyond 1 °C may elicit rapid, unpredictable, andnon-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage’ (Rijsbermanand Swart 1990 ). Since the 2012 UN Paris Climate Agreement, the science has treated1.5 °C, rather than 2 °C, as the danger limit.Rijsberman and Swart ( 1990 ) also recommended a maximum CO2-equivalentconcentration of 330–400 ppm in the atmosphere. Yet, atmospheric CO 2-equivalentin 2016 was 489 ppm (NOAA 2017 ), far above ecosystem safety.Although not so deﬁned in the Paris Agreement, since 2009 the standingequilibrium-warming target has been reduced to a target only by 2100. Climatesystem commitment means that this will be double long after 2100.Climate Change and Biodiversity TrendsThe IPCC assessments, the main source of data and information for this chapter, letus know how much and how long we have known about the global climate changeimpacts to biodiversity. With each succeeding assessment since 1990, the climatechange situation for biodiversity has been found, with more research, to be worse, notbetter. Furthermore, the uncertainties make the predictable impacts on biodiversityconsiderably worse than published.Loss of population abundance is a major indicator of biodiversity decline. Thecommitted species extinction rate at increasing degrees of climate change was usedin the IPCC’s fourth assessment ( 2007 ). The last World Wide Fund for Nature Liv-ing Planet Report ( 2016 ) on species population abundance shows a sustained rapiddecline since 1970. Global biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate. The 2016WWF’s Living Planet Index reveals that global populations of ﬁsh, birds, mammals,amphibians and reptiles declined by 58% between 1970 and 2012. We could witnessa two-thirds decline in the half-century from 1970 to 2020—unless we act now toreform our food and energy systems.In this time of continuing global warming, ecosystems matter a lot to global, aswell as regional, biodiversity and the future survival of most of the world’s species.Some ecosystems hold enormous sources of potential carbon feedback emissionsthat are vulnerable to release by global warming acting upon these ecosystems (IPCC1990 ). These large vulnerable carbon pools include permafrost, high latitude peat-lands, tropical peatlands and forests subject to ﬁre and/or dieback.Implications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 141The Worst-Case ScenariosThe IPCC ( 2014a ) projected a global warming by 2100 of up to 7.8 °C when includ-ing climate uncertainty. The worst possible effect of global surface warming on all oflife is an ecosystem change effect of the Arctic releasing wetland and permafrost car-bon. Because global warming will last for over 1000 years (Solomon et al. 2009 ), wecan expect carbon feedback emissions from the several enormous planetary poolsof carbon. The risk of planetary catastrophic ‘runaway carbon dynamic’ was ﬁrstrecognized by the IPCC in the third assessment ( 2001 , 19.6.3.2. Large-Scale Singu-larities). Global energy-related CO2emissions rose by 1.4% in 2017, for a historichigh of 32.5 Gt. (International Energy Agency 2018 ). Global emissions and atmo-spheric concentrations are tracking closest to the IPCC worst-case scenario (Saunois2016 ).Climate Change and Biodiversity Loss InteractionAnother great concern is the potential amplifying negative interaction between bio-diversity loss and global climate change, where each makes the other worse in anegative synergistic manner for both. Climate change reduces the land carbon sinkthrough its impacts on forests, leaving more CO2in the atmosphere. Brook et al.(2008 ) point out that species loss can occur directly and abruptly if habitat destruc-tion or overexploitation of populations is severe. ‘Yet the ﬁnal descent to extinctionis often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be discon-nected from the original cause of decline.’ They reviewed:recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together shows that owingto interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most speciesare more severe than previously recognized. As such, conservation actions which only tar-get single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused byunmanaged synergies. (Brook et al. 2008 )Their paper anticipated that climate change would interact with and accelerate ongo-ing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasivespecies.This synergistic interaction, taken further by Segan et al. ( 2016 ), has to beaccounted for in a general and region-speciﬁc manner to plan priorities in conserva-tion, mitigation and adaptation. Adaptation is urgent today but cannot be expectedto be successful for long without concomitant mitigation; a long-held global climatechange principle is that adaptation must be accompanied by mitigation.The IPCC fourth assessment ( 2007 ) said that global extinction is a crucial keyissue ‘because of a very likely link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning inthe maintenance of ecosystem services.’ Grace et al. ( 2016 ) found that communitiesrich in species are substantially healthier and more productive than those depleted of142 P. D. Carterspecies. Here we take the health of ecosystems and biodiversity as one entity called‘ecosystem biodiversity.’As it is, the current accelerating rate of species extinction is 1000 times the back-ground rate (Pimm et al. 2014 ). With committed and feedback-accelerated climatechange, this is likely to become the highest rate of any extinction event on Earth,with accelerating losses for every degree rise in global temperatures (Urban 2015 ).Today’s emissions targets, which substantially increase (rather than decrease) globalemissions by 2030, are bound to make this extinction qualify as the fastest ever. Thispolicy commitment is, to a large extent, avoidable and would be greatly reduced ifgovernments followed the recommendations of the climate and ocean change scien-tists, which is to immediately and rapidly reduce global emissions.What the IPCC Assessments SayBased on a 2012 global warming of 0.85 °C, the IPCC’s ﬁfth assessment ( 2013 )estimated a full-equilibrium warming commitment, due to climate system inertia, of‘about 2 °C’ long after 2100. Remember, global warming has already reached justover 1 °C since industrialization.The IPCC’s third assessment WGII ( 2001 ) Summary for Policy Makers(SPM)—which is approved by all world governments—reported emergent ﬁndingsthat regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, had alreadyaffected a diverse set of physical and biological systems in many parts of the world,with associations between changes in regional temperatures and observed changes inphysical and biological systems documented in many aquatic, terrestrial, and marineenvironments.The IPCC fourth assessment’s WGII ( 2007 ) SPM reported with high conﬁdencethat recent warming was strongly affecting terrestrial biological systems and changesin freshwater and marine biological systems, with declining oxygen levels and cir-culation. Approximately 20–30% of plant and animal species assessed were foundto be at additional increased risk of extinction above 1.5–2.5 °C. For increases inglobal average temperature exceeding 1.5–2.5 °C and in concomitant atmosphericcarbon dioxide concentrations, there are projected to be major changes in ecosystemstructure and function, species’ ecological interactions, and species’ geographicalranges, with predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity.The IPCC fourth assessment provided a graph (see Fig. 1) of more speciﬁc ecosys-tem and species impacts (IPCC 2007 , WGII Fig. 4.4). Line B1 is the temperatureincrease at constant atmospheric concentrations from 2100 up to committed warmingby 2300. Degrees of warming would be treated as committed for policy relevance.These impact on top of ongoing global ecosystem degradations.For an in-depth projection of ecosystem impacts, see the IPCC fourth assessment’s(2007 ) WGII Table 4.1. Their extinction projections relied largely on Thomas et al.(2004 ), a paper that remains very important, as it is rich with information on globalclimate change and biodiversity. The topic has been revisited and the Thomas projec-Implications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 143tions in general conﬁrmed. The Thomas et al. projections include a high-emissionsclimate change scenario, the latter being the closest to that which the world is nowtracking. The paper draws several crucial conclusions:Minimum expected (that is, inevitable) climate-change scenarios for 2050 produce fewerprojected ‘committed extinctions’ by about half of those predicted under maximum expectedclimate change. These scenarios would diverge even more by 2100. Returning to near pre-industrial global temperatures as quickly as possible could prevent much of the projected,but slower acting, climate-related extinction from being realized. (Thomas et al. 2004 )This is a call for the immediate global decline of emissions, as in the IPCC ﬁfthassessment ( 2014a ) WGIII best-case scenario.A big point of the Thomas et al. ( 2004 ) paper was that by 2050, global climatechange could take over from direct habitat change as the main cause of specialextinctions and biodiversity loss. The worst case was a committed 58% of all speciesby 2050 by climate change alone. The paper estimated that an additional 34% of alloriginal species would be committed to extinction due to habitat destruction from2000 to 2050. The paper adds that extinction risks might be even higher taking otherfactors into account.One of the worst possible outcomes for biodiversity is synergy between globalclimate change and the other non-climate change impacts, where the combined effectsof multiple stressors are greater than the sum of individual effects. Assessments haveassumed that multiple stressors lead to cumulative linear effects, with little interactionamong threats considered. Findings serve as a reminder that these assessments shouldseriously consider the potential synergy of multiple threats interacting; Fortini andDye ( 2017 ) indicate the seriousness of ‘potential synergisms and compounding threatinteractions, especially with stressors that are as complex as climate change.’It is important to realize that because of commitment, to prevent an impact pro-jected to occur at, for example, 3 °C, global warming must be limited to 1.5 °C dueto total climate system inertia.The IPCC’s ( 2014a ) ﬁfth assessment is grim for the future of biodiversity andspecies:A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk underprojected climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate changeinteracts with other stressors, such as habitat modiﬁcation, over-exploitation, pollution, andinvasive species ( high conﬁdence ). (IPCC 2014a )Extinction risk is increased under all IPCC ( 2014a ) RCP (representative carbonpathway) scenarios, with risk increasing with both magnitude and rate of climatechange. The IPCC ( 2014b ) graphic below (Fig. 2) shows projected impacts on biodi-versity. Warming and impacts are only up to 2100. As shown in Fig. 2, the assessmentsaid that many species will be unable to track suitable climates under all scenariosexcept the best case (RCP2.6) this century. Those that cannot adapt sufﬁciently fastwill decrease in abundance or go extinct in some or all of their ranges, with largelosses of biodiversity.The IPCC ( 2014a ) assessment shows the velocity capacity of species comparedto the rate of climate change. It shows that above the RCP2.6 best-case emissions144 P. D. CarterFig. 2 Projected impacts on ecosystems and species (Image reprinted courtesy of IPCC ClimateChange 2014 Synthesis Report Fig. 2.5, published online by IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland)scenario, which causes the slowest rate of climate change, most trees and herbaceousplants cannot keep up with climate change, leading to an extremely high risk ofterrestrial extinctions in general. As the best-case emissions scenario, RCP2.6 is theonly scenario not above 2 °C by 2100; it is an increase of 1.6 °C from pre-industrial.According to the IPCC’s ﬁfth assessment ( 2014b ) Synthesis Report, continuedemission of greenhouse gases increases ‘the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irre-versible impacts for people and ecosystems.’ Furthermore, ‘many aspects of climatechange and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenicemissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. […] The risks of abrupt or irreversiblechanges increase as the magnitude of the warming increases.’The IPCC ( 2014a ) assessment predicted that within this century, magnitudes andrates of climate change associated with all but the best-case emissions scenario(immediate global decline) pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible impacts onterrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands. These impacts include thepotential of ecosystems to become a source of feedback carbon emissions. Examplesthat could lead to such substantial impacts on climate are the boreal-tundra Arcticsystem and the Amazon forest. Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., inpeatlands, permafrost, and forests) is susceptible to loss to the atmosphere. Increasedtree mortality and associated forest dieback are projected to occur in many regions thiscentury, due to increased temperatures and drought. Feedback from forest diebackposes risks to carbon storage and biodiversity. Indeed, forest dieback has alreadystarted, with the IPCC ( 2014a ) reporting that ‘extensive tree mortality and widespreadforest dieback linked to drought and temperature stress have been documented onall vegetated continents.’ This includes the great Amazon and Boreal forests.Implications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 145The forests of the Amazon Basin are being altered through severe droughts, land use (defor-estation, logging), and increased frequencies of forest ﬁre. Some of these processes areself-reinforcing through positive feedbacks, and create the potential for a large-scale tippingpoint. […] Climate change contributes to this tipping point by increasing drought severity,reducing rainfall, and raising air temperatures. (IPCC 2014a ,F i g .4 . 8 )In 2017, the ﬁrst-ever global database of trees (by Beech et al. 2017 ) revealed thatout of 60,065 total, 9600 tree species are threatened with extinction. Adding that threatto so much actual tree mortality and forest dieback makes the impact on biodiversityin general very clear. [The IPCC ( 2014a ) assessment of species extinctions goes onlyup to 2100, which does not constitute total committed extinctions since warming iscommitted to substantially increase after 2100.]The fact that trees and herbaceous plants are unable to keep up with the rate ofclimate change equivalent to a global warming of 1.6 °C by 2100 is of enormousconcern because of a domino effect: a plant extinction impacts many animals. Cas-cading biodiversity loss as a result of climate change originates mostly from plantspecies and is indirectly transferred to animal species. Therefore, climate change hasan even greater negative effect on the biodiversity of animals through losses of plantsand trees (Schleuning et al. 2016 ). Kew’s ( 2016 ) State of the World’s Plants 2016estimated that 1 in 5 plants are threatened with extinction.Coastal biodiversity is high. But according to the IPCC ﬁfth assessment ( 2014a ),coastal biodiversity is threatened by sea level rise and eutrophication-driven deoxy-genation. Figure 2shows that impacts have started.Ocean biodiversity is severely threatened by the combination of deep open oceanheating, deoxygenation and acidiﬁcation. These are all accelerating—with oceanheating going deeper—and the IPCC ( 2014a ) says that they are predicted to combinesynergistically, creating a situation with the potential for ocean biodiversity collapse,which alone would be a calamity for life on land.Marine species are being impacted by ocean acidiﬁcation and warming extremes(IPCC 2014a ). The progressive acidiﬁcation of oceans due to increasing atmosphericcarbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organ-isms (e.g., corals) and their dependent species. As Fig. 2shows, already someforaminifera and pteropods are being affected. At an acidiﬁcation with a global sur-face warming of 1.6 °C, 20–50% of corals, echinoderms and mollusks are affected.At a global warming of 2.4 °C, vulnerable taxa are increasingly affected and warmwater coral reefs are marginalized.There is little to no effective adaptation available for ocean ecosystems and species(IPCC 2014a , SPM Box 2 Table 1). For all emissions scenarios except the best-caseimmediate global emissions reduction scenario, ocean acidiﬁcation poses substantialrisks to marine ecosystems, associated with impacts on the physiology, behaviour,and population dynamics of individual species from phytoplankton to animals:Ocean acidiﬁcation acts together with other global changes (e.g., warming, decreasing oxy-gen levels) and with local changes (e.g., pollution, eutrophication). Simultaneous drivers,such as warming and ocean acidiﬁcation, can lead to interactive, complex, and ampliﬁedimpacts for species and ecosystems. (IPCC 2014a , WGII SPM)146 P. D. CarterCoral reefs worldwide would seem committed to extinction at a 2 °C globalwarming plus acidiﬁcation. To protect at least 50% of the coral reef cells, globalmean temperature change would have to be limited to 1.2 °C (1.1–1.4 °C), not takingocean acidiﬁcation effects into account (Frieler et al. 2013 ).From 1910 to 2010, there is a recorded 70% decline in ocean biomass and ﬁshstocks (IPCC 2014a ). The progressive expansion of oxygen minimum zones andanoxic ‘dead zones’ is projected to further constrain ﬁsh habitat. Open-ocean netprimary production is projected to redistribute and to fall this century globally underall RCP scenarios. Climate change adds to the threats of over-ﬁshing and other non-climatic stressors (IPCC 2014a ).Finally, new research shows that the phenomenon of interspecies mismatch-ing/mistiming, another huge climate change concern, is now happening (Kharoubaet al. 2018 ), adding a further devastating layer to climate change impacts on biodi-versity.Limitations of the ChapterThe climate change projections applied in this paper are medians that do not accountfor higher climate sensitivities at higher warming, nor extra emissions from largesources of carbon feedback emissions. Uncertainties including abrupt changes andtipping points are not applied in IPCC warming projections. Interactions of multi-ple adverse climate change impacts on species and interspecies interactions are notquantiﬁed. The IPCC ( 2014a ) mentions that ancillary stresses on species due to over-harvesting, habitat destruction, landscape fragmentation, alien species invasions, andﬁre regime change are not accounted for in projections on species. It also notes underuncertainties that capacity for, and limits to, ecological adaptive processes are knownonly in a few cases and tipping points remain a major source of uncertainty with highpotential consequences.For a standard environmental health risk assessment, the approach could be furtherdeveloped with current near worst-case emissions scenarios and worst-case rangesof projections.Conclusions and RecommendationsDue to climate system inertia, the world is in a committed biodiversity loss emergencyaffecting both land and oceans. The global aggregate of national emissions policiescommits (indeed, condemns) the world to a future global biodiversity collapse. Thenow recommended global warming limit of 1.5 °C, on top of the 6th mass extinction,is still deadly for global biodiversity. It is important to keep in mind that in theIPCC ( 2014a ) projections, climate system commitment is 2 °C equilibrium warmingImplications for Biodiversity of Potentially Committed Global … 147and policy commitment is over 3 °C by 2100, which is a full policy equilibriumcommitment of over 6 °C after 2100.The imperative now is mitigating catastrophic global climate change impacts toecosystems and biodiversity. From multiple lines of evidence, we see that this requiresthe immediate and rapid decline of global greenhouse gas emissions, reaching nearzero within decades. This depends on achieving some form of safe removal andsequestration of some atmospheric CO2, which, for the sake of biodiversity, deﬁnitelycannot be biomass energy (burning) with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS).The imperative of near-zero emissions by mid-century requires ending fossil fuelsubsidies fast; ending deforestation and deforestation-driving government subsidies;and charging central fossil fuel producers the full environmental and social costs oftheir pollution.Clearly, the imperative is also for a massive global upgrade of conservation (pro-tecting huge swathes of the world’s land and oceans, as suggested in the proposed planof E. O. Wilson in 2016 to protect half of the Earth’s land and oceans) and attemptsat assisted ecosystem adaptation, with priority on global biodiversity hotspots. Thiswill require massive injections of funding for the necessary research, conservation,and adaptation.The effective measures for ecosystem adaptations are essentially the same as formitigation, that is, large expansion of protected areas and termination of deforesta-tion. The strategies of coastal afforestation, watershed management, and maintainingwetlands and urban green space (IPCC 2014a , Table SPM.1) will only be successfulif they accompany the most aggressive global climate change mitigation measurespossible.Mitigation of both climate change and biodiversity loss is, in theory, achievable,with large countervailing beneﬁts to human populations and the future of humanity.No more research is required to know that these must happen. There are well knownsolutions, but now they really do need to happen with urgency, because committedglobal climate change gives us—and all species—no more time to act.ReferencesBeech E, Rivers M, Oldﬁeld S, Smith PP (2017) GlobalTreeSearch: the ﬁrst complete globaldatabase of tree species and country distributions.

Smith et al.leverage co-beneﬁts from the same investment; (2) use resources more efﬁciently;and (3) ensure that one action does not negatively affect another policy priority. Forexample, investments in greenhouse gas reduction have the potential either to pos-itively impact biodiversity and sustainable development, or to result in unintendednegative consequences; chances of positive synergies are greatly increased by coop-eration and joint policy, planning and implementation. The challenge now is to learnlessons from the vast and diverse number of approaches being tried around the worldand to enhance co-beneﬁts. This paper describes the major inter-linkages betweenglobal commitments for conservation and development. It demonstrates the impor-tance of enhancing synergies among global agreements and avoiding unintended andnegative consequences, particularly on biodiversity, by providing examples of bestpractices and describing some of the pitfalls that occur when implementation of oneagreement does not explicitly seek to enhance co-beneﬁts with other agreements. Inconclusion, the paper presents the case for the central role of nature-based solutionsin simultaneously attaining global commitments for biodiversity, climate change andsustainable development.IntroductionThe world is at cross-roads with the convergence of several crises: catastrophicclimate change, the sixth mass biodiversity extinction event, land degradation on amassive scale (Ripple et al. 2017 ) and increasing economic inequality in spite of areduction in extreme poverty (World Bank 2016 ). Despite bold global commitments,and some speciﬁc successes, progress on all of these issues has been too little andtoo slow.The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation(UNCCD) and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and its associated Sus-tainable Development Goals (SDGs), all recognize, in various decisions, the inter-linkages between their agreements and the beneﬁts of co-implementation. Whilecommitments have been made to enhance synergies, co-implementation has provento be difﬁcult in practice and negative impacts on biodiversity in particular, fromimplementation of other priorities, frequently occurs.The cost of fully implementing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD, theParis Agreement of the UNFCCC, the SDGs and the UNCCD’s target of land degra-dation neutrality (LDN) is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars per year until2030 (CBD High-Level Panel 2014 ;S t e r n 2015 ; Schmidt-Traub 2015 ). The sheerscale of investment required is argument enough to ensure that progress towards onegoal does not hamper progress towards another. Add to that the inter-relatednessof these goals and enhanced effectiveness and efﬁciency that could be gained fromworking in concert across issues, and the need to develop ways for effective co-Ensuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 153implementation becomes obvious (Science for Environmental Policy 2015 ; Cadenaet al. 2017 ; Quéré et al. 2014 ; Executive Secretary of Convention on BiologicalDiversity 2017 ; Schultz et al. 2016 ; Steiner 2017 ). Despite some notable exceptions,and efforts at the global level, there is little consistency or cross-referencing betweenglobal goals (Bodin and Santamari 2016 ). Potential approaches have been proposed,including enhancing resilience thinking (Cadena et al. 2017 ; Schultz et al. 2016 ), theecosystem approach (Bodin and Santamari 2016 ; Epple et al. 2016 ), the landscapeapproach (Sayer et al. 2013 ), landscape management (Peterson 2011 ) adaptive man-agement (Epple et al. 2016 ), ecosystem-based adaptation (Herr and Landis 2016 ) andusing the CBD’s National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans as mechanismsto foster integrated thinking (Cadena et al. 2017 ; Executive Secretary of Conventionon Biological Diversity 2017 ). Even from the perspective of climate change goalsalone, taking an integrated approach is essential, including for enhancement of car-bon sinks in terrestrial and coastal sectors (IPCC 2014 ) and placement of renewableenergy infrastructure (Science for Environmental Policy 2015 ). Yet at the national andregional levels there are relatively few successful examples of attaining co-beneﬁts.Many countries and organizations have already emphasized the importance oftaking measures that maximize synergies among global goals and minimize negativeimpacts and externalities (Bodin and Santamari 2016 ) [i.e. tackling Aichi Biodi-versity Targets on protected areas and ecosystem degradation and speciﬁc Sustain-able Development Goals (Brooks et al. 2015 )]. These provide valuable principles toguide countries towards co-implementation and co-measurements of success. Theneed now is to go beyond principles and to develop the capacity and concrete toolsfor making decisions that enhance implementation of global commitments, at dif-ferent scales, without creating undesirable impacts and unnecessary trade-offs. As2020 approaches, and progress towards biodiversity, climate change and sustainabledevelopment goals are assessed, the importance of turning principles into concretedecision-making tools has become urgent.In this paper, we analyze—through different approaches—major convergencepoints between the Rio-Conventions and the 2030 Agenda, exploring entry pointsthat can be useful to regional, national and subnational efforts to increase co-implementation and avoid potential trade-offs.Biodiversity and Nature-Based Solutions to Climate ChangeMitigation1. T errestrial EcosystemsTo keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C, relative to pre-industriallevels, emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere must be reduced by50–70% by 2050 and to zero by 2100 (IPCC 2014 ). Several actions will have to betaken simultaneously: (i) reduction and eventual phase-out of fossil fuels; (ii) reduc-154 R. Smith et al.tion of emissions from land use and land use change; (iii) removal of carbon dioxidefrom the atmosphere (The Economist 2017 ; Rockström et al. 2017 ;I P C C 2014 );and (iv) maintenance of natural carbon sinks and storage (Rockström et al. 2017 ).Recognizing that Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) accountfor approximately 24% of total greenhouse gas emissions—almost equivalent toenergy and heat production (25%) and more than transportation (16%) or industrialactivity (21%) (Thompson 2014 )—the Paris Agreement on Climate acknowledgesthat nature-based solutions will play an important role in reducing greenhouse gasemissions (see Article 5, UNFCCC 2015 ). The necessity of this approach has beenreinforced by the International Declaration on Nature-Based Solutions for WaterManagement Under Climate Change (Marrakech Partnership et al. 2017 ), the RED-PARQUES Declaration (REDPARQUES 2015b ), the inclusion of nature-based solu-tions in some—albeit only a few—Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) toclimate change (Laurans et al. 2016 ) and in the scientiﬁc literature (Rockström et al.2017 ). According to some estimates, nature-based solutions to climate change, suchas restoration of forests, wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands, afforestationand protection of ecosystems that are currently sequestering and storing carbon,could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 37% by 2030 (Griscom et al.2017 ). In the interest of advancing an integrated approach the CBD, at its thirteenthConference of the Parties, expanded the sectors in which it intends to mainstreambiodiversity to include energy and mining, manufacturing, processing and healthsectors (CBD 2016 ).One important feature of nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation isthat LULUCF can reverse the negative impacts of past activities (UNFCCC 2014 ).Carbon stocks in forest biomass decreased by an estimated 0.22 Gt annually from2011–2015, mainly because of a reduction in forest area. Through better forest man-agement, forest restoration and afforestation these losses can be reversed.Brazil’s NDC to the Paris Agreement provides an example of how nature-basedsolutions can be integrated into climate change mitigation. Brazil aims to reducegreenhouse gas emissions by 37% below 2005 levels by 2025, through the imple-mentation of policies that also build resilience of populations, ecosystems, infrastruc-ture and production systems, by reducing vulnerability, and through the provision ofecosystem services [Federative Republic of Brazil (FRB) 2016 ].2. Marine EcosystemsOceans, including coastal ecosystems, have sequestered approximately 30% of thecarbon dioxide in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times (Thompson 2014 ). Bluecarbon—the carbon stored in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses—is a majorcarbon sink, covering less than 20% of the total ocean area, but accounting forapproximately half of the total carbon sequestered and stored in marine sediments.These habitats are found on every continent except Antarctica and combined cover49 million hectares (The Blue Carbon Initiative 2017 ).The role of coastal ecosystems in climate change mitigation is better understoodthan open ocean ecosystems, and is often included in calculations of the impor-tance of ecosystems in climate change mitigation (Duarte et al. 2013 ; Roberts et al.Ensuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 1552017 ; Epple et al. 2016 ). For example, the loss of vegetated marine habitats, such asseagrasses, salt-marshes, macro-algae and mangroves is estimated to result in a netemission of 1 Gt CO 2per year (Duarte et al. 2013 ). This compares to the 4.9 Gt annualemissions from land use change, including forestry (Griscom et al. 2017 ). IUCN esti-mates that if half of the annual coastal wetlands loss was halted, emissions wouldbe reduced by a 0.23 Gt CO 2per year (Herr and Landis 2016 )—equivalent to tak-ing 50,000 cars off the road (calculated from US Environmental Protection Agency2017 ). Although the potential for forest activity to sequester carbon is greater than forcoastal marine habitats, the coastal marine habitats provide a signiﬁcant contributionand their importance to biodiversity is equal to that of forests (Duarte et al. 2013 ;Herr and Landis 2016 ).As of 2016 only 28 countries had included coastal wetlands as part of their NDCsfor climate change mitigation, most of which speciﬁcally refer to mangrove protec-tion, conservation and restoration. More widespread inclusion of coastal wetlandsin NDCs would have signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts for both biodiversity and sustainabledevelopment (Herr and Landis 2016 ).Ocean acidiﬁcation is increasingly recognized as a carbon-driven problem threat-ening ocean food webs, food security and livelihoods. Since the industrial revolution,the acidity of ocean water has increased by about 30%, potentially threatening shell-building marine life, including phyto- and zoo-plankton, which are the base of themarine food web (Paciﬁc Marine Environmental Laboratory Carbon Program 2017 ).The need to reduce ocean acidiﬁcation is prominent in both the SDGs and the AichiBiodiversity Targets, further highlighting the need to integrate efforts.Marine protected areas (MPAs) can enhance the ability of the oceans to sequestermore carbon without increasing ocean acidiﬁcation and without negatively impactingmarine species. There are two mechanisms by which this can occur. First, ﬁsh excreteammonia or ammonium through their gills, making the most bioavailable form ofnitrogen available to primary producers, which in turn sequester CO2from the atmo-sphere. Enhanced ﬁsh populations, which are protected from overﬁshing in MPAs,will make more nitrogen available, resulting in increased primary productivity. Thiseffect can be signiﬁcant. One study showed that nitrogen cycling can be enhancedby four to ﬁvefold in unﬁshed sites compared to ﬁshed sites. The second mechanismby which marine systems can increase carbon sequestration is just beginning to bebetter understood. Fish are known to affect the marine inorganic carbon cycle bycalcifying carbon in their guts and excreting carbonate [i.e. calciﬁed carbon], muchof which ends up as stored carbon in marine sediments. However, information islacking on several aspects of this process, making it difﬁcult to determine its overallcontribution to removal of atmospheric CO2(Roberts et al. 2017 ).Just as deforestation results in CO 2emissions to the atmosphere, activities thatdisturb the ocean ﬂoor, such as bottom trawling and seabed mining, can readilyremobilize stored CO2with unknown consequences to the marine carbon cycle.MPAs have the potential to serve as a valuable tool to manage these impacts.All nature-based solutions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and improvecarbon sequestration can have an impact on biodiversity and on the livelihoods andwell-being of people who depend on biodiversity. There is no magic, one-size-ﬁts-all156 R. Smith et al.tool that will ensure that decisions to meet one goal do not have a negative impacton others. At the project assessment level, a decision-screen that weighs impact andmaximizes all beneﬁts is needed.The Relationship Between Biodiversity and the SustainableDevelopment GoalsBiodiversity is relevant to all SDGs, including those that do not directly reﬂect theAichi Biodiversity Targets. An overview of the importance of the 2030 Agenda forSustainable Development, and associated SDGs, as an enabling environment for theachievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets has been provided by the Conventionon Biological Diversity (Executive Secretary of Convention on Biological Diversity2017 ; Schultz et al. 2016 ). Brieﬂy, achieving the SDGs addresses the drivers ofbiodiversity loss, builds the institutional capacity for governing biodiversity andaids in mainstreaming biodiversity through recognition of the ecosystem servicesprovided by biodiversity (Schultz et al. 2016 ). Aware of the strong links between theSDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP13) to the CBD decided that Parties and all relevant stakeholders should integrateand mainstream biodiversity into implementation of the SDGs.The Relationship Between Land Degradation Neutralityand Other Biodiversity and Climate TargetsThe UNCCD has made land degradation neutrality [LDN] the central focus of itsglobal strategy, recognizing the health of the land as a unifying theme that inﬂuencesbiodiversity, human livelihoods and climate change in equal measure. The SDGsexplicitly support attainment of LDN in SDG 15.3, to: “combat desertiﬁcation, restoredegraded land and soil, including land affected by desertiﬁcation, drought and ﬂoods,and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world”. Attaining LDN impliesa drastic reduction in land use change such as deforestation and loss of naturalgrasslands, which in turn has positive impacts on climate change mitigation andbiodiversity conservation.Mitigating Climate Change, Safeguarding Biodiversity,Reducing Land Degradation and Supporting SustainableDevelopment Goals1. Spatial PlanningEnsuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 157Spatial planning—on both land and in the ocean—is the ﬁrst step to enable inte-grated thinking across a landscape. There are good examples of how spatial plan-ning can work for safeguarding or enhancing biodiversity, mitigating climate changeand taking into account sustainable development. Several European countries haveimplemented a project screen for renewable energy projects in which sensitivity map-ping locates important biodiversity areas, including protected areas, and avoids thesewhen locating wind or solar energy infrastructure (Science for Environmental Policy2015 ). German law prevents the siting of renewable energy infrastructure at locationsthat conﬂict with conservation goals (Peschel 2010 ). In response, the German SolarIndustry Association, in conjunction with the German Society for Nature Conser-vation, has drawn up criteria to guide nature-friendly solar development (Peschel2010 ). Solar photovoltaic arrays and wind installations—both of which are impor-tant for reducing fossil fuel use—are situated to avoid protected areas and carbonsequestering ecosystems, retain trees and hedges, avoid disturbance of birds and batsduring breeding season and surrounding vegetation is managed for the beneﬁts ofwildlife.South Africa has taken a landscape approach in which sensitivity mapping, at var-ious scales, identiﬁes protected areas, endangered ecosystems and ecological supportareas needed to maintain resilient ecosystem services. This spatial mapping allowsfor the identiﬁcation of appropriate areas for production, development and conser-vation, thus implementing CBD, UNCCD, UNFCCC and the SDG goals, with onecomprehensive process (Peterson 2011 ).Supported by spatial mapping, several tools are available to facilitate decisionsthat provide multiple beneﬁts. At a global or national scale, Key Biodiversity Areas(KBAs) are “sites contributing signiﬁcantly to the global persistence of biodiversity”and therefore help to plan development in ways that minimize negative impacts onbiodiversity (IUCN 2016a ). Similarly, the identiﬁcation of High Conservation V alueAreas (HCV A) is a tool widely used in landscape mapping, conservation and naturalresource planning and advocacy. Its six values cover environmental and social priori-ties shared by a wide range of stakeholders (Senior et al. 2015 ). The many gap analysistools available, such as the USGS Gap Analysis Program (USGS 2017 ), help to max-imize the effectiveness of protected area networks by locating protected areas in themost suitable locations for multiple beneﬁts. IUCN has developed a framework forcountries to rapidly identify areas suitable for forest landscape restoration—Restora-tion Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM). This tool allows for optimiz-ing positive impacts of land use transitions on key ecosystem services, includingcarbon sequestration, the provision of hydrological services, water yield and sedi-ment retention and nutrient retention (IUCN 2016b ).It is important to note that spatial planning is somewhat controversial becauseits use can make trade-offs among different values and sectors more immediate andtangible. For this reason, it is essential to build in robust stakeholder and publicparticipation into planning processes.2. Land and Freshwater Management158 R. Smith et al.Once spatial planning has identiﬁed current land and water use, and made proposalsabout future uses, many land management tools are available to protect multiplevalues across a landscape.Protected Areas and Other Effective Area -Based Conservation Mechanisms (OECM)The pivotal role that connected, well-funded, well-managed protected areas play insupporting not only biodiversity goals, but also sustainable development and climatechange goals, is increasingly recognized (Nature Needs Half 2017 ; Ripple et al.2017 ; REDPARQUES 2015a ; Dudley et al. 2010 ,2014 ,2017 ; Secretariat of theConvention on Biological Diversity 2016 ). About 312 Gt of CO 2a r es t o r e di nt h eworld’s protected area network, equivalent to 15% of the world’s terrestrial carbonstock (Dudley et al. 2010 ).Emerging information supports the beneﬁts of well-planned and managed pro-tected areas in implementation of the SDGs. For example, in Costa Rica and Thailand,districts adjacent to protected areas experience 10 and 30% less poverty, respectively,than districts without protected areas (Turner et al. 2012 ). The natural ecosystemsmaintained by protected areas contribute to a range of ecosystem services, includingfood and water security, disaster risk reduction and health and recreational servicesand the economic values of these are increasingly being recognized.REDPARQUES (Latin American Technical Cooperation Network on NationalParks, and other Protected Areas and Wildlife) is a unique network of protected areaagencies that seeks to improve the management of national parks and other protectedareas through technical cooperation and the exchange of knowledge and experienceamong its 19 member countries. One of the unique elements of REDPARQUES isthat it has expanded recognition of the importance of protected areas in mitigationof and adaptation to climate change, thereby providing a model for using protectedareas to attain multiple goals. The Amazon Vision, one of the REDPARQUES part-ners, includes an initiative on “Protected Areas, Natural Solutions against ClimateChange (NASCC)”. This initiative recognizes that protected areas are key to buildingresilience to mitigate the impacts of a changing climate, to ensuring the provisionof ecosystem services on which people depend and to protecting biodiversity (RED-PARQUES 2015a ; Suarez et al. 2015 ). The Amazon Vision makes extensive useof spatial mapping to identify climatic conditions, climate risk and opportunities toenhance resilience in the Amazon’s protected areas network. This tool provides afoundation for decisions on management of existing protected areas and creationof new ones that include multiple goals and values and facilitates a climate smart-landscape approach to other agendas, including participatory land use planning andthe development of infrastructure (Suarez et al. 2015 ).Global efforts to encourage different forms of conservation management, whichallow for economic activity without losing the ecosystem values of the natural sys-tems, could lead to recognition of new types of protected areas and the prevention ofcarbon-emitting land conversions such as deforestation. Furthermore, the potentialof conservation outside the protected areas network is gaining increasing recogni-tion. The initially confusing wording of Aichi Target 11, which referred to “protectedareas and other effective area-based conservation measures” has been the trigger forEnsuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 159debate on the deﬁnition and recognition of a set of sites that, whilst not being fullprotected areas or having nature conservation as a primary aim, are nonetheless man-aged in ways compatible with the long-term maintenance of biodiversity, reductionof land degradation and integration into climate change strategies (Laffoley et al.2017 ). Indigenous conservation areas could play a previously unrecognized role,as could watershed protection areas, well-managed forestry and traditional grazingareas. Tenure-secure indigenous forest lands—some of which would be consideredconservation areas—in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia are equivalent, in terms of car-bon sequestration, to taking 9–12.6 million passenger vehicles off the roads for ayear (Watts 2017 ).The potential for leakage highlights the importance of considering the effects ofprotected areas creation and other conservation actions such as logging bans acrossdifferent spatial scales. Leakage happens when the creation of protected areas in onelocation leads to compensatory increases in habitat loss in another. For example, inSouth East Asia, some countries have reversed the trend of conversion of naturalforests through strong policies and enforcement. In neighboring countries, wherepolicies, enforcement and governance are weaker, the pressure for conversion ofnatural forest lands, particularly to agriculture, has increased (Leadley et al. 2016 ;Bodin and Santamari 2016 ).Ecosystem RestorationGiven the signiﬁcant contribution of degraded or converted natural ecosystems togreenhouse gas emissions, many people have turned their attention to ecosystemrestoration as part of the solution to climate change mitigation. Opportunities exist indrylands to halt and reverse desertiﬁcation, in agricultural lands to increase carbon insoils as a climate mitigation strategy and also to reduce soil erosion, and in restorationof peat and other wetlands for multiple ecosystem functions. It is estimated thatrestoration of degraded forests, grasslands and wetlands could reduce greenhousegas emissions signiﬁcantly by 2030 (Leadley et al. 2016 ; Griscom et al. 2017 ),ensure habitat for species, including those at risk and provide an array of ecosystemservices, such as disaster risk reduction and provision of fresh water. However, despitea plethora of guidance on how to restore speciﬁc ecosystems (Society for EcologicalRestoration 2012 ), there is still a net loss of forests and ecosystems that sequesterand store carbon (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2014 ).Although ecosystem restoration was originally intended as a process to restoreecosystems to their historical state (Society for Ecological Restoration 2012 ), inmore recent years the term has also been used more loosely to describe reforestationor afforestation efforts that might aim to gain carbon sequestration potential withoutconsidering other ecosystems services and biodiversity. Reforesting with monocul-tures of exotic species falls into this category, where reforested area may indeedsequester carbon, while being detrimental for biodiversity (Ferez et al. 2015 ). Fur-thermore, climate change increases the possibility that restoration to an “original”state is impossible from a practical perspective and that restoration to a new butecologically functioning ecosystem may be more realistic.160 R. Smith et al.The New Y ork Declaration on Forests—an update of the Bonn Challenge—aimsto bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land into restoration by 2020and 350 million hectares by 2030. This declaration recognizes that these restorationefforts have to be implemented with national priorities in mind, such as water andfood security, rural development, climate change, biodiversity and land degradationneutrality. As of September 2016, commitments for forest restoration under this ini-tiative include 63.3 million hectares in Africa, 23.6 million hectares in Latin Americaand 22.4 million hectares in Asia (Bodin and Santamari 2016 ).Investments in ecosystem restoration have increased over the past few years onall continents (Bodin and Santamari 2016 ). It is time to measure the successes andchallenges from existing approaches in attaining co-beneﬁts for biodiversity, climatechange and sustainable development.REDD +Some initiatives originally intended for climate change mitigation have beenexpanded to include biodiversity conservation. Reducing emissions from deforesta-tion and degradation (REDD) in developed countries was expanded in the Bali ActionRoadmap to include conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhance-ment of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) (Harvey et al. 2010 ).REDD+ supports climate change goals as well as conservation and sustainable devel-opment goals articulated in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and SDGs. Some of theways in which REDD+ now supports multiple goals are: the expansion of the eligi-bility for funding to countries with historically low deforestation; use of criteria thatensures REDD+ does not result in the conversion of natural forests to plantations,exotic monocultures or non-forested systems; use of criteria to prevent leakage—en-suring that protecting forests in one place does not result in deforestation in anotherplace; and prevention of funds to projects with questionable mitigation beneﬁts andfew or no biodiversity beneﬁts (e.g. palm plantations) (Harvey et al. 2010 ).Many REDD+ projects have already demonstrated the beneﬁts of this newapproach, including: the Taita Hills Project in Kenya, which generates carbon offsetsfor the protection of forest and savannah outside Tsavo National Park; the RukingaWildlife Sanctuary, also in Kenya, which provides income to the community, govern-ment and local landlords for avoiding greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation(IPCC 2014 ). A model looking at the potential for REDD+ to positively affect bio-diversity, demonstrated that in Brazil the number of threatened species could bereduced to 6 species from 311 by simply enforcing Brazil’s new Forest Code (Mead2016 ), which is now known as the Law of Native V egetation Protection (LNVP).Mangroves are now eligible for REDD+ funding, and efforts are underway toestablish a voluntary carbon standard to create sustainable ﬁnancing for other bluecarbon habitats.3. Management of Marine SystemsThe development of the SGDs and the increasing recognition of the role of oceansin regulating global climate offer important opportunities to better integrate coastalEnsuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 161and ocean management with climate mitigation efforts. In addition, the dramaticimpacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems, such as the increase in ocean surfacetemperature, acidiﬁcation, shrinking of Arctic sea-ice and sea-level rise, will havesigniﬁcant impacts on global food security, biodiversity and risks from disasters(IPCC 2014 ; Melillo et al. 2016 ).Many tools described above for land management—protected areas, ecosystemrestoration and spatial planning—are also being applied in coastal and ocean systems.Five per cent of waters under national jurisdiction are now protected (UNEP-WCMCand IUCN 2016 ) and the United Nations is considering governance mechanisms formanaging biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction—the 60% of the planetknown as the high seas.4. Enabling PolicyLarge scale replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy is a component of mostscenarios to attain climate change goals (IPCC 2014 ). This approach could be positiveor negative for biodiversity and sustainable development, depending on how it isimplemented. Tools for identifying trade-offs and minimizing negative impacts areclearly needed. For example, an increase in bioenergy, coupled with carbon captureand storage (BECCS), is prominent in most scenarios that result in attainment ofthe Paris Agreement. However, a massive increase in bioenergy would require landuse change, including the conversion of natural habitats to agriculture and existingagricultural area from food production to bioenergy production. Land use change onthe scale required would result in negative impacts on both biodiversity and SDGs(Leadley et al. 2016 ). The same trade-offs are apparent in planned increases in hydro-electric power, which can result in deforestation, loss of aquatic habitat (Charity et al.2016 ) and the release of CO2and methane (Deemer et al. 2016 ; Scherer and Pﬁster2016 ).Some countries have enshrined the importance of multiple beneﬁts in law. TheGerman Renewable Energy Sources Act only allows installations of solar parks onland that has been previously disturbed such as by farming or military use. Ideal sitesinclude brownﬁeld and degraded land—creating so-called “brightﬁelds”.Increases in economic activity, related to SDG Goal 8 on “decent work and eco-nomic growth”, has the potential to result in policies and activities that encourageeconomic activity at the expense of biodiversity conservation and climate change mit-igation and adaptation. An example of this is the 134,866 km of fossil fuel pipelinescurrently under construction or planned (Tubb 2017 ) in countries that are Parties tothe Paris Agreement on Climate Change in North America (Canada, U.S., Mexico),South America (Brazil, Peru, Colombia), Middle East (Iran, Oman), Russia, EasternEurope (Turkey), Western Europe (U.K., Denmark, Norway) and Asia (China andIndia). Given limited ﬁnancial resources, investments in fossil fuel infrastructure tieup funds that could otherwise be used for renewable energy.Provision of positive incentives for conservation, climate change and sustainabledevelopment, and removal of harmful subsidies, will go a long way towards mobi-lizing resources for change (Ripple et al. 2017 ; Secretariat Convention on Biological162 R. Smith et al.Diversity 2010 ; United Nations 2015 ). A focus on incentives for implementingnature-based solutions is a highly cost-effective approach. This would include ‘strongﬁnancial impetus’ for afforestation on degraded land, reforestation on converted for-est land, restoration of carbon sequestering ecosystems and protection of carbonstoring ecosystems (Rockström et al. 2017 ).A successful model for mobilizing resources for positive outcomes is the Biodiver-sity and Protected Areas Management Programme (BIOPAMA). This is a partnershipbetween IUCN and Joint Research Center of the European Commission (EC-JRC).BIOPAMA addresses threats to biodiversity in African, Caribbean and Paciﬁc (ACP)countries, while reducing poverty in communities in and around protected areas.BIOPAMA has had signiﬁcant success in building the capacity to manage protectedareas for multiple values and to improve access to science, knowledge and data thatenhances decision-making on biodiversity conservation and sustainable development(BIOPAMA 2016 ).Another entry point for enabling policy is to overcome the traditional sectorialsilos and avoid tensions and potential trade-offs between different policies (e.g. anincrease in deforestation rate due to a policy of agricultural expansion). A shift onthe focus of a sectoral perspective of issues in a country’s administration into amore holistic one requires policy changes. The SDGs address this systemic issueand encourage Parties to enhance Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development(PCSD). A useful framework to progress on PCSD has been developed by the OECDproviding general guidance to: (1) conduct analysis to identify policy coherenceissues; (2) align existing institutional mechanisms for policy coherence to otherenvironmental and development agendas; and (3) consider key elements for trackingprogress on policy coherence for sustainable development (OECD 2016 ).ConclusionsThe world is currently focused on the imperative to reduce atmospheric greenhousegases and avoid catastrophic climate change. However, the loss of biodiversity andassociated ecosystem services, the loss of land and soil resources, the decline ofglobal ﬁsheries and the plight of the world’s poorest citizens are equally pressingissues. Given the scale of ﬁnancial resources required, avoiding unanticipated nega-tive consequences, and ﬁnding solutions that enhance synergies are necessary.The large number of solutions being tried at different scales around the worldamount to a global experiment in integrated thinking. The task now is to pull togetherthe lessons learned from the many diverse approaches and actors, and turn them intopractical tools that will allow countries to effectively meet their global commit-ments. A focused effort to integrate the work of the three Rio Conventions with theSustainable Development Goals has long been discussed; it is now in urgent needof implementation. Unique and sometimes difﬁcult partnerships have to be forged,including among conservationists, poverty-reduction advocates, industries and thoseconcerned with climate change policy.Ensuring Co-Beneﬁts for Biodiversity, Climate Change … 163We demonstrate that among the examples presented, spatial planning, protectedareas and ecosystem restoration are distinguished by the multiple beneﬁts theyprovide—beneﬁts that go far beyond their primary purpose. We also show thatnature-based solutions provide an essential tool in tackling several global problemssimultaneously. While a few countries have already identiﬁed nature-based solutionsin their NDCs to the Paris Climate Agreement, and some countries have developedguidelines or legal instruments to ensure that co-beneﬁts are obtained, more countriesneed to include nature-based solutions in their tool kits to tackle climate change.This paper has identiﬁed the problem and provided suggestions and examplesthat support a co-beneﬁts approach to implementing multiple agreements. Futurework of global organizations such as the International Union for the Conservationof Nature (IUCN) needs to draw on successful approaches already in use, as well asthe results of policy and scientiﬁc research, to develop comprehensive guidance forsimultaneously protecting biodiversity, addressing climate change and implementingthe SDGs.ReferencesBIOPAMA (2016) Development capacity for a protected planet in Africa, the Carribean and thePaciﬁc.

The energy (hydropower) sector is specially starting to beaffected by those changes. Changing rainfall patterns, rising temperature, droughtsand extreme weather events may affect hydroelectricity generation, causing dam-ages to the infrastructure or disruptions in service. EbA is mentioned in the BrazilianNDC, highlighting the need to increase national capacity in water security (NationalWater Security Plan), conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity (NBSAP). Inaddition, the Energy Sector Strategy of the NAP mentions the environmental issues,especially regarding the protection and recovery of natural resources (fauna, ﬂora andphysical environment). This paper discusses how the hydropower generation in Brazilcan shift to a sustainable hydropower pattern, capable of dealing with climate changeissues and, additionally, contributing to increase local adaptation capacity using anecosystem approach, as accorded on Paris Agreement. A set of EbA measures arepresented as opportunities to reduce the climate vulnerability and/or increase theresilience of local ecosystems and of the communities depending on them, wherehydropower projects are installed or are being planned.Hydropower Generation, Biodiversity and Climate ChangeConcerns about the protection and conservation of biodiversity have been gainingmore attention in international political discussions. As one of the richest countries inthe world in terms of biodiversity, with high rates of endemism (MMA 1998 ), Brazilhas been engaged in the international context and has been developing strategies,plans and programs adapted to its needs and reality.

Garcia et al.biodiversity-related conventions ratiﬁed by Brazil, we mention The Ramsar Conven-tion on Wetlands of International Importance, Convention Concerning the Protectionof the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, Convention on International Trade inEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and the Convention on BiologicalDiversity (CBD).Parallel to the growing concerns about biodiversity protection and conservation,there is also an increase in global energy demand (EIA 2015 ). With this growth, thepressure on biodiversity is also expected to increase. In Brazil, part of the projecteddemand for electricity will be supplied by the expansion of hydroelectricity (Brazil,MME/EPE 2015 ). A major issue is that many of the sites that have potential forhydroelectric generation expansion also have a high value in terms of biologicaldiversity with sensitive ecosystems and with local communities that depend on theseecosystems as food suppliers or as a source of income, which means, in other words,an overlap problem (Table 1).A number of important negative impacts to biodiversity are particularly related togeneration plants as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure, which mayoccur during the implementation or operation phases. Table 2indicates some possibledirect and indirect impacts of electricity generation, transmission and distributionactivities to biodiversity, identiﬁed in environmental studies in Brazil.Nowadays, impacts related to hydroelectricity are considered in several planningstages, from long term planning studies (30 years) to the 10-year expansion plan,and especially in the project phase, when requiring environmental permits. However,these evaluations focus on minimizing/controlling each impact, rather than the cumu-lative impacts of other activities in the basin. Moreover, none of these studies assessneither how the biodiversity could be affected by possible climate changes, nor howlocal populations could be affected with a possible loss of biodiversity, and hence ofthe environmental services. As a consequence, such populations may become evenmore vulnerable.The main objective of this paper is to propose the use of the so-called “climatelens” and “lens of ecosystems” when assessing the impacts at all levels of the expan-sion and operation planning of electric power generation, and more speciﬁcally of thehydroelectricity plants. These aspects are not only aimed at minimizing/controllingthe impacts of energy generation, taking into account the current and future vul-nerability of the region, but also deﬁning a set of programs that can contribute toincrease the capacity of adaptation of these sensitive areas. Minimizing environmen-tal impacts is an important vector of resilience that also relates to the concept ofEcosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), deﬁned ﬁrst at the Convention on BiologicalDiversity.Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA) is deﬁned as the use of ecosystem manage-ment, conservation and restoration, to provide ecosystem services that enable societyto adapt to the impacts of climate change. EbA can have many positive impacts onbiodiversity and on local communities (Fundação Grupo Boticário 2015 ), such as:Sustainable Hydropower: Using Ecosystem-based Adaptation … 169Table 1 Main international conventions related to biodiversity ratiﬁed by Brazil (Garcia 2007 )Conventions Year Biodiversity Aspects coveredby the ConventionBrazilina Legal FrameworkRAMSAR: The RamsarConvention on Wetlands ofInternational Importance1971 Maintenance of ecosystemsintegrity and the provision ofgoods and services providedby ecosystemsLegislative Decree No. 33 ofJune 16, 1992, andpromulgated by the Presidentof the Republic by Decree No.1905, dated May 16, 1996Convention Concerning theProtection of the WorldCultural and Natural Heritage1972 Protection, conservation andpresentation of the cultural andnatural heritageLegislative Decree No. 74 ofJune 30, 1977, ratiﬁed onDecember 2, 1977 andpromulgated by Decree No.80,978 of December 12, 1977CITES: Convention onInternational Trade inEndangered Species of WildFauna and Flora1973 Reduction of losses ofbiodiversity components(biomes, habitats andecosystems, species andpopulations, genetic diversity)Legislative Decree No. 54 ofJune 24, 1975, andpromulgated by Decree No.92,446 of March 7, 1986.

UNDP highlights some examples of EbA:tree planting with high water retention capacity in drought areas;identiﬁcation and planting of species to reduce erosion and landslides;maintenance of ecosystem connectivity;preservation or restoration of sensitive areas;natural resource management to ensure maximum beneﬁt to communities.We believe that projects and actions aligned with the concept of EbA can be encour-aged when building and operating hydroelectric plants in regions with high environ-mental sensitivity. Plants that have a long-term vision of environmental conservationcan present a set of EbA measures from the construction phase to the operation phase,aiming the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services, which can help thelocal populations to adapt to possible adverse impacts of climate change.Guidelines from the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA)stress that “ (…) impact assessment (IA) can ensure that the design of policies,Sustainable Hydropower: Using Ecosystem-based Adaptation … 171plans, programs and projects adequately take into account mitigation of changes(the effects of the proposal on greenhouse gas emissions), and adaptation to cli-mate change (effects of climate change on the proposal). Taking climate change intoaccount in decisions, through IA, can help reduce vulnerability to climate change,thereby improving the resilience of natural and human systems (…) ”. This meansthat IA can help and also play a signiﬁcant role in achieving national, regional orsectoral climate change objectives (IAIA 2013 ).According to the IPCC ( 2014 ), adaptive capacity is the ability of a system toadjust to climate variability and extreme weather and weather events, mitigatingpossible damage and taking advantage of opportunities or dealing with consequences.It depends on two variables: vulnerability and resilience. The lower the vulnerabilityof a system and the greater the resilience, the greater its potential for adaptation(IPCC 2014 ).Adaptation to climate change is the process of adjusting to the current orfuture climate and its effects (IPCC 2014 ). In human systems, adaptation seeks tomitigate, avoid harm or explore beneﬁcial opportunities. In natural systems, humanintervention can facilitate adjustment to the future climate and its effects. There area number of approaches to adapting to climate change, such as the hazard-basedapproach, risk management, vulnerability studies, resilience-based approach, andthe Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA), discussed in this paper.EbA and the International Agreements Ratiﬁed by BrazilDespite been neglected in the past as a viable tool for adaptation and mitigation, EbAis gaining more recognition in the international climate policy scene since the ParisConference, when the focus began to rapidly shift from theory to action, mainlydue to the commitments set out in the Intended Nationally Determined Contribu-tions (INDC). EbA is mentioned in the Brazilian NDC, when the need to increasenational capacity in water security it is highlighted (National Water Security Plan)and when the need for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity is mentioned(National Strategic Plan for Protected Areas and the Brazilian Forest Code, in par-ticular for Permanent Preservation Areas). In addition, the Energy Sector Strategyof the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), instituted in 2016, mentions the need totake into consideration the issues related to environmental legislation regarding theprotection and recovery of natural resources (fauna, ﬂora and physical environment)in the adaptation studies of the electricity sector.The Brazilian NAP also presents an assessment of biodiversity and ecosystemsloss considering several climate change scenarios. The adaptation options prioritizedconsidering these scenarios were: use of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) in areaswhere the risk of extreme climate events is high; modelling consequences for bio-diversity and ecosystem services caused by conservation, recovery and sustainableuse of biodiversity public policies; and monitoring in 50 federal protected areas toassess in situ the current and future impacts of climate change on biodiversity.172 K. C. Garcia et al.EbA in Practice: Proposing and MeasuringEfﬁciency/EffectivenessAccording to the International Institute for Environment and Development(IIED/IUCN 2016 ), although many countries make commitments aligned with theconcept of EbA, this rarely leads to clear goals and targets, which would allow anassessment of the effectiveness of adaptation measures over of time. Even wheremeasurable targets are deﬁned, it is unclear whether they will be enough to meetadaptation needs in the communities and ecosystems that are affected (IIED/IUCN2016 ).Some organizations around the world are evaluating the effectiveness of EbAmeasures for the development of robust adaptation plans, taking into account localeconomic interests as well as social and environmental needs, thus allowing greateraccess to funding for adaptation (IIED 2016 ).In this sense, effective EbA measures should follow some basic principles (UNDP ,s.d.):build actions based on good practices in integrated natural resource management;involve local communities;develop strategies with multiple partnerships (governments, communities, privatesectors, NGOs, researchers, etc.) of diverse interests, such as conservation, devel-opment and poverty reduction; andintegrate EbA with a broader context of adaptation.From these basic principles, a methodology based on four components is proposed(UNDP , s.d.):Component A: Deﬁne the context of adaptation, noting the possible climatic or non-climatic pressures on biodiversity, the ecosystem services, and the needs of localcommunities.Component B: Development for change, which means planning the EbA actions thatwill be implemented, including the deﬁnition of its objectives and goals, as well asthe indicators to be used to monitor the performance.Component C: Implementation of the adaptation measures, including monitoring,data interpretation, evaluation and route adjustment (ﬁnishing the plan, do, check,act cycle).Component D: Selection of appropriate adaptation measures according to the speciﬁclocal context. The options can be grouped according to ecosystem services and theirbeneﬁts, always aiming to maintain or increase resilience.In order to be effective, actions should enable communities to maintain or improvetheir adaptive or resilient capacity and reduce their vulnerability to climate change,while improving co-beneﬁts that promote well-being. Another aspect to consider iswhether actions restore, maintain, or enhance ecosystem capacity to continue pro-ducing ecosystem services for local communities, allowing ecosystems to withstandthe impacts of climate change and other stressors. The ﬁnancial/economic aspectSustainable Hydropower: Using Ecosystem-based Adaptation … 173is also important to be evaluated. Therefore, actions should be supported by local,regional and national governments and involve synergistic interactions between mul-tiple sectors considering social, institutional and political issues that can inﬂuencethe implementation of EbA initiatives (IIED 2016 ).This work proposes all these issues to be considered when evaluating, proposingand implementing EbA actions in the planning and operation of hydroelectricitygeneration, in addition to deﬁning the objectives and goals to be achieved over time.In order to do so, we propose some examples of possible measures to be exploredthat can meet the mentioned criteria and are in accordance with the commitmentsestablished by Brazil in the NDC and with the NAP .EbA and Sustainable HydropowerIn the previous section we mentioned the principles of the EbA. This paper suggestssome possible actions, which should be complementary and synergistic, and caneffectively contribute to the restoration, maintenance or enhancement of ecosystemcapacity to produce environmental services that are essential to local communities,thus increasing their capacity to adapt to climate changes. In this way, the need forintegrated vision in the deﬁnition of measures is reinforced. We also suggest somemeasures to be integrated on: a Biodiversity and Ecosystem Conservation Plan, a Planto Support Sustainable Local Economic Activities, and a Plan to Promote ScientiﬁcResearch. Other possibilities may be evaluated in each environmental study andaccording to each context.Biodiversity and Ecosystem Conservation PlanThree possible complementary actions aligned with the concept of EbA are sug-gested: ﬁnancial support to protected areas; creation of new protected areas andimprovement of existing protected areas, as described below.Financial support to existing protected areas:A contribution to the conservation of ecosystems is always guaranteed, since currentBrazilian legal framework already requires the payment of environmental compen-sation when implementing new hydroelectric projects. An alternative action that ﬁtsthe principles of the EbA is the additional support for protected areas, which may bein the form of ﬁnancial resources.The ﬁnancial resources can be very important for the implementation and mainte-nance of protected areas, as there is often a need to remove people, or even for CAPEXinvestment, such as new vehicles or other equipment important to support monitor-ing activities. A good example of ﬁnancial support program is the ARPA Program,174 K. C. Garcia et al.“Protected Areas of the Amazon”, created by the Brazilian Environment Ministry(MMA 2015 ), aiming the conservation and sustainable use of tropical forests.Creation of new protected areas:The participation of the company in the process of creating new protected areasis another interesting possibility. According to ICMBIO,1the legal process for thecreation of protected areas in Brazil is a manifestation of interest of some sectorof society (ICMBIO 2015 ). This is a great opportunity for the concessionaire toact within this process, such as suggesting the location of the new protected areas,which should be preferably in the vicinity of the plant or reservoir, joining the mosaicof protected areas in the vicinity. Another possibility is the creation of a protectedarea managed by the company, which is called in Brazil RPPN (“Reserva Particulardo Patrimônio Natural or Private Natural Area”, in Portuguese). The RPPN shouldcover the surroundings of the hydropower project, aiming to prevent the expansionof human occupation over the natural or forested areas, guaranteeing the ecosystemconservation and maintenance. The RPPNs can also act as buffer zones for existingnon-private protection areas, creating a biodiversity conservation corridor.Improvement of existing protected areas:The entrepreneur may also consider the support for the improvement of existing pro-tected areas under the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Conservation Plan, either throughpartnerships or even helping in the assessment of management effectiveness of a pro-tected area. Regarding partnerships, we mention the ICMBio published in 2009 andthe Manual of Procedures (ICMBIO 2009 ). Although the latter does not deﬁne a spe-ciﬁc regulatory framework for shared management, it deﬁnes ways of establishingpartnerships for the participation of other entities in management of protected areas.There are some examples from the electricity sector and also from other sectorsin Brazil where there was an effective participation of large structuring companiesin the processes of creation and maintenance of protected areas that shows a greatvalue for the conservation of the ecosystems (CEPEL 2016 ).Another way of assisting in the improvement of protected areas is by establishinga continuous process of assessing the effectiveness of the management of protectedenvironments, identifying strengths and weaknesses and planning for future actions.This applies to protected areas generally under the responsibility of the entrepreneur,such as the reservoir borders. Currently there is a methodological framework avail-able for this purpose in the literature, with emphasis on the RAPPAM—Rapid Assess-ment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management method (Ervin 2003 ). Eval-uation of management effectiveness is recognized worldwide as a vital componentfor obtaining a transparent, proactive and well-run conservation unit management.Besides being an essential tool for the local, regional and national level, this type ofevaluation has gained a great deal of attention in the international context (Hockingset al. 2006 ).1Acronym for Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (Portuguese: Instituto ChicoMendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade). ICMBio is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment’sadministrative arm.Sustainable Hydropower: Using Ecosystem-based Adaptation … 175Local Economic Activities Support Plan (LEASP)The Local Economic Activities Support Plan (LEASP) must contain a spectrum ofactions that is capable of promoting a better regional insertion of the hydroelectricprojects in its areas of inﬂuence, promoting environmental conservation and sus-tainable economic activities. The participation of the stakeholders involved in thisprocess is important for the success of the proposed initiatives, since they shoulddevelop autonomy to continue the activities promoted by the plan and its programs.The composition of LEASP encompasses environmental programs that are cur-rently used in the basic environmental plans of hydropower plants in Brazil. Thenovelty of this proposition is the focus on restoring, maintaining or increasing thecapacity of ecosystems to produce environmental services that are essential to localcommunities.Another area that may inspire the elaboration of plans, programs and projectsaimed to promote sustainable local economic activities at local and regional leveland environmental conservation are the national reports that show good practices inthe management of protected areas. The publication of ICMBio/IPE ( 2014 ), is one ofthese reports, and contains some examples of practices, such as the ones highlightedbelow:Taim Ecological Station (Rio Grande, RS): The project focuses on the negotiationprocesses with local community to expand the protected area through the creationof an advisory council. The methodological basis was to qualify the participatoryprocesses, identify and expose the different needs of the beneﬁciaries of environ-mental services, produce documents in a participatory way and give transparencyand wide publicity to the process.Tefé National Forest, Extractive Reserve of the Jutai River, Extractive ReserveBaixo Juruá, Extractive Reserve do Juruá, Extractive Reserve of the Unini River,Marine Extractive Reserve do Soure: The project “Y oung Protagonists” seeksto diagnose and foster the emergence of new youth leaderships in federal pro-tected areas. For this, it develops community strengthening actions and amplifythe knowledge of the participants about conservation, biodiversity monitoring andenvironmental education.Trombetas River Biological Reserve (Oriximiná, PA): The Project “ParticipatoryMonitoring of the Reproduction of Amazonian Chelonia” transformed a conﬂic-tive relationship between the managers of the protected area and the surroundingquilombola community, who came to be seen as an important player in the biodi-versity conservation.Medium Purus Extractive Reserve (Lábrea, AM): ICMBio has built agreementswith local communities to carry out sustainable ﬁsheries management in the region.After ﬁve years an annual quota of expenditure was released and rules for theexpenditure were established, followed-up by ICMBio. As a result, there was adecrease in illegal catch and marketing, which promoted community engagementand illegal catch control.176 K. C. Garcia et al.Plan to Promote Scientiﬁc ResearchThe System of Investments in Research and Development and Energy Efﬁciency bythe concessionaire, permission and authorized companies of the electricity sectorin Brazil, establishes a regular source of ﬁnancial resources for the developmentof R&D projects, which originated from generation, transmission and distributioncompanies that operate regularly in Brazil (CGEE 2015 ).The scientiﬁc presence and monitoring of biological, geological, ethnic, archaeo-logical, social and cultural diversity through permanent research stations can providescientiﬁc information and relevant analyses. Thus, the present proposal suggests theestablishment of a Plan to Promote Scientiﬁc Research, consisting of a set of guide-lines for all research activities from the implantation to the operation of the plant.With the insertion of a major infrastructure project in a region with low anthro-pogenic occupation, opportunities for development and ﬁnancing of research projectsare opened, with emphasis on expanding the scientiﬁc knowledge base on the regionin the physical-biotic or social aspects. What is proposed here is to go beyond thesurveys required to carry studies for the environmental permits, establishing a con-tinuous research program that can encompass different aspects, expanding scientiﬁcknowledge about biological, geological, ethnic, archaeological, social and culturaldiversity of the region. This knowledge may be used as important inputs for the devel-opment of public policies focused on biodiversity conservation and maintenance.Here we suggest some major themes that can be worked out within the frameworkof a Scientiﬁc Research Promotion Plan and which are directly related to the mostevident research needs in sensitive areas that can be affected by possible climaticchanges. Examples are: landscapes, ecosystems and species (population studies -monitoring, speciﬁc studies (e.g. ichthyofauna), ecology of target species, geneticsand taxonomy, latu sensu landscape studies, ex situ conservation, reintroduction,geographic distribution); environmental pressures (conﬂicts with human practices,pollution, climate change); invasive alien species (impact of alien species); sus-tainable use of natural resources; and socio-biodiversity (conservation medicine,thematic maps, social and economic studies, ethno-cognition).ConclusionThe present paper showed that it is possible to establish a set Ecosystem-basedAdaptation measures (EbA) since the planning and project phase up to the operationof hydroelectric plants that aim to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, tothe generation of socioeconomic beneﬁts to local communities and to constructionand maintenance of the knowledge and practices of traditional local communities .Sustainable Hydropower: Using Ecosystem-based Adaptation … 177Table 3 Summary of proposed EbA measures for Sustainable Hydropower in BrazilEbA measure EcosystemserviceBeneﬁts Adaptive capacityneeded Exemples of indicatorsExpansion ofprotected areas R/P/S/CaDirect Medium Area or % of protected areaReforestation R/P/S Direct Low Area or % of reforested areaRestoration ofecosystems R/P/S Direct Medium Area or % of restored areaConservation offorest remnants R/P/S Direct Low AreaSupport for localsustainableeconomicactivitiesP Indirect Low Number of plans supportedNumber of stakeholdersinvolvedLevel of cooperationbetween govern-ment/companies/communityR&D R/P/S/C Indirect Low Number of studiesSpecies and ecosystemsbeneﬁted by the studiesCommunities beneﬁtingfrom the results of thestudiesaRRegulating Service; PProvisioning Service; SSupporting Service; CCultural ServiceIn addition, by working to promote the sustainable use of nature and biodiversity, thedevelopment and implementation of EbA measures promotes coherence with severalrelevant international commitments, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity,the Convention on the Protection of World Heritage, Cultural and Natural Heritage,the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, among others.Table 3resumes how some suggested measures may be viewed as EbA measures,highlighting the related ecosystem services beneﬁted, the potential beneﬁts (director indirect), the adaptive capacity needed and some examples of indicator for EbAefﬁciency/effectiveness assessment.ReferencesBrasil, MME/EPE (2015) Plano Decenal de Expansão de Energia 2024/Ministério de Minas eEnergia.

Disponívelem: www.undp.orgThe Y ellowstone to Y ukon ConservationInitiative as an Adaptive Responseto Climate ChangeCharles C. Chester and Jodi A. HiltyAbstract The need for connectivity across large areas has long been a core principlein the ﬁeld of conservation biology. Whereas early rationales for conserving connec-tivity included the maintenance of genetic health and the protection of ecosystemprocesses, the more recently recognized threat posed by climate change to biodiver-sity has only ampliﬁed the focus on connectivity. Within the last decade, the term“large landscape conservation” has become a generic term applied to efforts intendedto align on-the-ground conservation programs with the scale of the potential changesresulting from climate change. An early example of such an approach was the Yel-lowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y), spanning the Rocky Mountainsbetween Canada and the United States. First conceived in the early 1990s, Y2Yconnoted not only a region, but also a science & advocacy network, a conservationorganization, and—particularly in its early years—a challenge to the conservationcommunity to broaden its vision of what will be required for effective wildlife conser-vation over the coming century. This includes consideration of how, under conditionsof climate change, biological communities may disarticulate and then reorganizeacross time and space, and of the consequent need for intact land conservation net-works to allow species to move through increasingly human-occupied landscapes.Accordingly, a key aspect of the programmatic work under Y2Y focuses on pro-tecting ecologically intact landscapes as a core approach to effective biodiversityconservation. Today, Y2Y has become widely cited for its groundbreaking efforts toexpand the conceptual scale of effective conservation landscapes in North Americaand the world.C. C.

HiltyIntroduction: Science and Conservation in the Y2Y RegionAlthough biodiversity is responding to climate change in myriad ways, range move-ment across landscapes (and seascapes) is perhaps the most widely recognized. Inparticular, species movement both latitudinally (e.g., poleward) and/or altitudinally(e.g., upslope) has been documented in numerous cases, although the overall patternsof species movement are complex and do not indicate a simplistic species responsemechanism (see Lenoir and Svenning 2015 ; Pecl et al. 2017 ). Nonetheless, at local,national, regional and global levels, many actors in the conservation communityhave responded to the threat of climate change by focusing on “large landscape con-servation,” a generic term applied to those efforts intended to align on-the-groundconservation programs with the scale of these documented and projected movements.The Yellowstone to Y ukon (Y2Y) region has been widely proﬁled and recognizedas one of the world’s ﬁrst large landscape conservation efforts—sometimes called“continental scale” conservation efforts (Johnson 2017 ). Much of the programmaticwork currently conducted under the Y2Y aegis focuses on the need for ecologicalconnectivity across large landscapes, with the ultimate goal being to enhance theresilience of wildlife to the threat of climate change. Yet to garner a full understandingof Y2Y’s current approach to grappling with the threat of climate change, it is usefulto begin with a short review of Y2Y’s early history.Within two years of its ﬁrst conception in 1993 (Locke 1993 /94), Y2Y had evolvedinto a highly active “virtual network” of biologists and conservationists who wereinterested in the idea. Over the following half-decade, an organization with the formaltitle Y2Y Conservation Initiative solidiﬁed with the mission of both promoting a largerlandscape vision across the broad region and of prioritizing conservation resourcestoward areas of critical conservation concern (Chester 2006 ). Overall, the idea of“Yellowstone to Y ukon” has since manifested itself in at least four principal ways:Y2Y is a region stretching 3218 km across one of the planet’s most intact mountainsystems, from the Arctic Circle in the Y ukon south to Greater Yellowstone Ecosys-tem’s Wind River Range, encompassing ﬁve US states, two Canadian provinces,and two Canadian Territories.Y2Y is a network of hundreds of individuals, conservation organizations, busi-nesses, and other actors both within and outside the region.Y2Y is an organization based in Canmore, Alberta, which conducts a range ofconservation activities throughout the region.Y2Y is a conservation vision of a continental scale, one of the ﬁrst of its kind.Over the subsequent twenty-plus years since its original conception, Y2Y has becomecommonly cited as one of world’s most ambitious examples of large landscape con-servation; as one observer described, Y2Y has become “perhaps the granddaddy ofcitizen-generated large-landscape projects” (Hiss 2015 ).The Yellowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative as an Adaptive … 181Today, one can see the same suite of large mammals in the Rocky Mountains thatAlexander MacKenzie saw in 1793, when he became the ﬁrst Caucasian to cross thecontinent north of Mexico (Gailus 2010 ). However, many of these species, includingwolves ( Canis lupus ), grizzly bears ( Ursus arctos), wolverines ( Gulo gulo) , and cari-bou ( Rangifer tarandus ) have become imperiled, particularly in the southern portionof the Y2Y region. Approximately 700 protected areas in the Y2Y region—whichincludes the world’s ﬁrst national park (Yellowstone), Canada’s ﬁrst national park(Banff), and the world’s ﬁrst international peace park (Waterton-Glacier)—are thecore mainstays of biodiversity conservation for the area (Chester 2015 ; Chester et al.2013 ).Scientiﬁc understanding has been at the core of the Y2Y vision since its concep-tion. Both the theory of island biogeography and metapopulation theory served askey rationales, both of which indicated that the survival of individual species andmaintenance of overall biodiversity would be enhanced by larger protected areas thatwere situated both closer together and within a permeable matrix (Hilty et al. 2006 ).Although the Y2Y region has a comparatively high percentage of its land base inprotected areas, on their own they will not adequately protect biodiversity partiallybecause they do not extend over the region’s full breadth of natural habitats, andpartially because their extent is sufﬁcient to maintain either lasting populations ofwide-ranging species nor the natural processes they depend upon (Hilty et al. 2006 ).Methodology and LimitationsOur primary purpose here is to explain the role of Y2Y in activities pertaining tobiodiversity conservation in the Northern Rockies of Canada and the United States,with a particular focus on both (1) the effects of climate change on biodiversity and(2) the conservation responses to the threat of climate change. Both authors have beeninvolved in Y2Y for a combined thirty-plus years as academic researchers and asboard members and/or staff. In addition to our own experience with and involvementwith Y2Y , we have cited a range of sources from the academic literature—mostlyjournal articles and academic books, but also reports from the conservation com-munity (mostly NGOs) and media/press coverage. While our background with Y2Yenhances our historical insights and we have attempted to examine Y2Y objectively,this association requires up-front recognition. Another important potential limitationincludes the fact that we do not closely examine several other early efforts at largelandscape conservation, such as those that occurred in Central America, regions ofeastern United States (such as New Y ork and Florida), and other areas (see Worboyset al. 2010 ), and our focus on Y2Y should not be interpreted as a claim that Y2Ywas alone in early efforts to foster large landscape conservation.182 C. C. Chester and J. A. HiltyY2Y as a Response to Climate ChangeScientiﬁc reviews from on climate change and biodiversity repeatedly recommendand prioritize (1) increasing the number and size of protected areas and (2) workingto functionally connect protected areas as the key actions that society should taketo conserve biodiversity into the future (Heller and Zavaleta 2009 ; nearly a decadeafter this groundbreaking review, there remains active discussion over the role ofconnectivity in biodiversity conservation; see, for instance, Bonebrake et al. 2018 ;Reside et al. 2018 ; Jones et al. 2016 ;S i r a m ie ta l . 2017 ; McGuire et al. 2016 ). Suchrecommendations are essentially congruent with the Y2Y mission of connectingand protecting the habitats across the Y2Y region. Progress with regards to suchgoals has been made; in the ﬁrst 20 years since the operationalization of the Y2Yvision, the area under strict protection (e.g., legislated parks, wilderness, and otherdesignations) increased from 9 to 14% of the region (Wendy et al. submitted). Still,parts of Y2Y are disconnected for some species, and increasing human activitiescontinue to threaten to isolate protected areas currently connected.A wide range of sectors are highly active in the conservation arena in the Y2Yregion, including government agencies, industry, indigenous communities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The latter includes traditional conservation andenvironmental groups employing advocacy and litigation, as well as sportsmen andangler organizations, land trusts, scientiﬁc institutions, local community groups andwatershed associations. Notably, Y2Y the organization (more below) has supportedscientiﬁc work in the region to identify and draw attention to place-based and issue-based conservation priorities, and has worked to bridge efforts amongst partnersworking to further scientiﬁc understanding of the region.In the context of this conservation-rich and science-rich history, a vast array of gov-ernment, academic, and independent scientists have conducted a myriad number ofbiological, social, economic, and political conservation-relevant investigations in theY2Y region, with the result that the Y2Y region is probably one of the better-studiedregions of the world when it comes to the practice of conservation. Partly because theregion has been imbued with these conservation values and biological insights, theconservation community has been relatively quick to focus on the challenge of cli-mate change. That said, much remains to be done, and preparing for climate changewill need to occur at multiple scales from the very local to pan-regional.Overall, as climate change confronts the historical legacy of conservation in theY2Y region, the conservation community holds itself to a two-fold proposition: ﬁrst,that a 150 year-old experiment in protecting wildlife and wildlands will continue tobeneﬁt future generations, and second, that in this era of climate disruption, on-the-ground conservation from the local scale to the continental scale will foster effectiveresilience and adaptation.The Yellowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative as an Adaptive … 183Range of Anthropogenic Threats to BiodiversityHuman population density in the Y2Y region is relatively low. Natural resources,be it land, wildlife, minerals, or oil and gas, are managed through a complex webof federal, provincial, state, and local agencies. Natural resource extractive indus-tries in the region include mining, and oil and gas extraction, forestry, agriculture,ranching, and grazing. While these activities still dominate in many parts of theregion, the economy has increasingly shifted toward “nonconsumptive” industriessuch as outdoor recreation, tourism, a wide range of service sector businesses, andamenity migration, which as been deﬁned as “population movement towards naturalamenity-rich rural communities, a phenomenon that has been prominent in manyparts of the world in the last four decades” (Matarrita-Cascante 2017 ). While thereare prima facie reasons to interpret these developments as beneﬁcial for conservation,two key points must be taken into account. First, the term “nonconsumptive” maybe a misnomer; for example, the impacts of tourism—even “ecotourism”—can besigniﬁcant (see, e.g., Blumstein et al. 2017 ). Second, although these changes haveled to a diversifying political landscape, the region’s politics remain largely favorabletoward the extractive industries.While biodiversity across the Y2Y region is threatened by a familiar list of humanactivities, the degree and types of threats change from south to north. Southward,rural residential sprawl constitutes the most signiﬁcant factor in land-use changeand the resultant threats to wildlife species (Hamilton et al. 2016 ;F a r re ta l . 2017 ).For grizzly bears, a single house per square mile can mean the difference betweengood habitat and sink habitat—that is, where conﬂict with humans typically meansthe demise of bears (Schwartz et al. 2012 ). As one moves north through the region,areas with little permanent human presence are increasingly facing new or expandedforms of natural resource extraction—including unsustainable forestry practices, oiland gas development, mineral exploration, as well as the placement and extent ofrenewable energy projects and infrastructure. On top of this lies the threat of climatechange.To protect the region’s biodiversity, conservationists have relied on a wide rangeof tools, including advocacy for enhanced protected areas, private land conserva-tion, wildlife restoration initiatives, incentive programs, and education and conﬂict-reduction programs. In regard to targeting key public and private lands, approximately14% of the Y2Y region lies protected under a range of designations, including wilder-ness areas, wildlife refuges, and national, state, and provincial parks (Francis et al.Submitted for publication). Extensive work on connectivity and road ecology hasfocused on mitigating the impacts of roads and highways, with particular focus onkey transportation corridors such as the Trans-Canada Highway (which bisects BanffNational Park) and Highway 3 (which runs through the Crowsnest Pass area of south-ern Alberta) (Paul et al. 2014 ; Sawaya et al. 2014 ). Signiﬁcantly, the “Path of thePronghorn,” the ﬁrst federally designated migration corridor in the United States,lies in the Y2Y region (Berger and Cain 2014 ; Degen 2014 ).184 C. C. Chester and J. A. HiltyAt each of these scales, connectivity work furthers the larger vision of the Y2Yregion working as an enormous corridor made up of protected core areas andcorridor linkages—which collectively ensure the long-term viability of the region’sbiodiversity.Climate Change ImpactsClimate change can be seen as an external driver spread over the above “tradition-al” threats to biodiversity—one that will manifest itself differently across the Y2Yregion, but overall will entail “profound effects” (Guay et al. 2016 ; although focusedon the US portion of the region, this publication provides a thorough review of theeffects of climate change for this area).The Y2Y region is home to several research initiatives on the effects of climatechange, with focal points ranging from niche habitats of particular species to exten-sive large landscape analyses. While the status of US government supported researchinitiatives remains uncertain, a few prominent examples of such research initiativeshas included the Paciﬁc Climate Impacts Consortium, the US Forest Service RockyMountain Research Station, the US Geological Survey’s Northwest and North Cen-tral Climate Science Centers, the Northern Rockies Adaptation Partnership, and theDepartment of the Interior’s Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative.1While these efforts indicate that scientists and government ofﬁcials have commit-ted to research and understanding the impacts of climate change across the RockyMountains and adjacent ecoregions, continuing support for such research remainsunclear for the US as of publication.The potential for rapid climate change in the Rocky Mountains has been longrecognized (Luckman and Kavanagh 2000 ). Mountain ecosystems are both beingimpacted by climate change at a faster rate than most other places (Pepin et al. 2015 ),and Y2Y is no exception with rates exceeding the global averages (Graumlich andFrancis 2010 ). At the same time, Y2Y and other intact mountain ecosystems arehighly likely to contain refugia for species during climate change since mountainousregions offer different aspects, elevations, and north-south movement options overrelatively short distances (Chen et al. 2011 ).A sizeable and expanding body of scientiﬁc evidence has shown that not only isthe Y2Y region currently experiencing climate change impacts, but that continuedchanges will impose signiﬁcant alterations to the region’s ecology (Reiners et al.2003 ) as well as agriculture (Hannah et al. 2013 ). Compared with the historicalrecords, the region’s mean annual temperatures have been increasing, precipitationpatterns have changed, and there has been an increased frequency of extremeweather—the last of which could have the highest impact due extreme temperaturesleading to stress, reproductive failure, and even death for the many species withrelatively narrow climate envelop requirements (Graumlich and Francis 2010 ).1Weblinks to these institutions can be found at http://ieinfo.net/geo-na-y2y.html .The Yellowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative as an Adaptive … 185Compared to previous decades, winters have been shorter and warmer in thetwenty-ﬁrst century. Precipitation is increasingly falling as rain instead of snow,which entails signiﬁcant impacts on seasonal water availability as well as glaciers.One notable consequence has been the climate threat to Glacier National Park, wherethe park’s namesake features are at risk (Luce 2018 ). Moreover, some species suchas the wolverine ( Gulo gulo ) that may depend on permanent ice and snow through-out the year (typically for food caches and insulation) will experience the greatestimpacts—although how this will unfold is highly complex, particularly in compari-son to other anthropogenic threats aside from climate change (McKelvey and Buotte2018 ; Stewart et al. 2016 ). Beyond such direct physical changes, species are experi-encing phenological alterations, including shifts in species distributions, changes inhibernation patterns, and the potential decoupling of phenological timing betweencodependent species (Graumlich and Francis 2010 ). In some cases, climate changecould entail beneﬁts such as reduced cold stress and longer foraging seasons, yet theextent of such beneﬁts is not clear. An illuminating case study can be found withmarmot species ( Marmota spp.) in the Rocky Mountains; on the one hand, whilethey may beneﬁt from increased capacity to colonize new territory and increase pop-ulations, a drier and warmer active season may entail signiﬁcant negative impacts(Armitage 2017 ; Turnock et al. 2017 ). Overall, the available observational data andmodeling data point to (1) the changing species distributions in the Y2Y region,and (2) the likelihood of further change over the current century. As a consequence,species that are unable either to adapt or to relocate to areas with conducive climateand habitat conditions are unlikely to survive (Graumlich and Francis 2010 ).Widespread outbreaks of pine beetles (most signiﬁcantly, the mountain pine bee-tle, Dendroctonus ponderosae ) have given the Y2Y region its most visible climateimpact, with expanding stands of dying and dead trees now ubiquitous in much ofthe Y2Y region. Although a native species that has incurred extensive past infes-tations, recent infestations have been widely characterized as unprecedented, espe-cially in regard to the beetles’ effects on higher elevation, ﬁve-needle pine species,such as whitebark pine ( Pinus albicaulis ). These extensive infestations largely resultfrom milder winters and the pine beetle’s resultant capacity to shorten its life cycle(Loehman et al. 2018 ).Discussion: Opportunities and ChallengesFor conservationists working in the Y2Y region, climate change is not a newly-recognized threat (see, e.g., Luckman 1990 ). And when the concept of “Y2Y” wasﬁrst proposed in the mid-1990s, the threat of climate change was one factor consid-ered in the rationale for conservation at a large landscape scale (Harvey 1998 ). Yetthe broad focus of conservation science at the time was on the increasing islandiza-tion effects of increasing natural resource extraction activities and the developmentof human infrastructure (e.g., roads & buildings).186 C. C. Chester and J. A. HiltyAlthough the conservation community has by no means eliminated any of theselong-standing threats, over the course of the last decade it has widened its focus toencompass the threat of climate change. Accordingly, climate science is advancingacross the region, and to some degree has become a central focus for conservationactivities in the region (Hilty et al. 2017 ). Climate change science both helps toinform how and whether conservation efforts to date will fare in terms of climatechange and helps identify refugia. In the Columbia Headwaters region, for instance,Y2Y is working with the organization Wildsight and other partners on an expandedconservation vision based on science indicating that this area is likely to continueto serve as a climate refuge to a greater degree than other areas in the region (Utzig2015 ). Such climate refugia will promote persistence for some species (McLaughlinet al. 2017 ) and can reduce rates of change and related extremes. Climate refugiasuch as in the Columbia Headwaters can exist for a variety of reasons, from weatherpatterns to topographic inﬂuences and vegetation attributes (Ashcroft 2010 ; Macleanet al. 2017 ).While river systems have long been known to be vital to biodiversity in the Y2Yregion and new research continues to expand on the importance of river systems(Hauer et al. 2016 ), Y2Y and partners are increasingly focusing on headwaters con-servation both because water conservation is a major 21st Century climate exac-erbated issue and because the issue resonates with people. One example of such aconservation push is in the Bighorn, an area lying mostly along the eastern notchbetween Banff and Jasper National Parks. More than 88% of the water for the city ofEdmonton originates in the Bighorn, and recent polls show that residents in Edmon-ton are keen to conserve their headwaters (Hilty et al. 2017 ;Y 2 Y C I 2016 ).Another common recommendation of scientists for helping biodiversity duringthis time of climate change is restoration of impaired systems. The Kootenai V alleyin north Idaho along the US-Canada border has suffered decades of major land usechange, transforming this forested lowland ecosystem into a managed landscapeof agriculture, cattle grazing, and dysfunctional hydrology that compromises thisecosystem’s ability to adapt to the hotter, drier climate conditions forecasted for thisregion. Grizzly bear scientists mapped out large landscape connectivity prioritiesfrom the perspective of grizzly bears (Kendall et al. 2016 ; Proctor et al. 2015 ). To date,Y2Y has worked with land trusts in the region to purchase key connectivity lands, andcurrently Y2Y is engaging with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to restoreecological functioning to 250 acres of forested lowland in the Boundary-Smith CreekWildlife Management Area in the Kootenai V alley for the purpose of increasing theresiliency of this ecosystem to climate change. In this area, which is considered anessential corridor in the context of large landscape conservation, restoration effortswill include the construction of two ephemeral ponds for native amphibians, theplanting of 50,000 native trees and plants, the restoration of ephemeral ﬂood cyclesto 1 mile of dry streambed, and the restoration of 35 acres to forested pollinatorhabitat. These restoration efforts are designed to increase this ecosystem’s resiliencyto climate change by restoring hydrological functioning to a portion of this watershedand by using topographical alterations to maximize cool air refugia; these effortswill also enhance connectivity for large mammals and local wildlife including paleThe Yellowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative as an Adaptive … 187jumping slugs and western toads, both listed as Species of Greatest ConservationNeed in Idaho (IDFG 2017 ; Lucid et al. 2016 ).Increasingly, conservation efforts across Y2Y are incorporating climate changeconsiderations into prioritization and actions; at the same time, conservationresponses to climate change—be it by government agencies, conservation NGOs,private sector entities, communities, or other actors—have varied widely across theregion. Some have emphasized continuing with traditional land conservation efforts,such as local land trusts—although here there are a growing number of cases wherethe impact of climate change on water dynamics are being considered at a morelocal level. Other conservationists have responded to the threat of climate change bymaking the case that, in essence, their long-standing conservation priorities alreadyarea response to climate change—at least to the degree that their traditional focuson maintaining connectivity, protecting core areas, and eliminating threats such asinvasive species are also the priorities that will enhance resilience and the capac-ity to adapt to climate change (see Butt et al. 2016 ). And others are engaging withnew approaches and tools, ranging from incorporating the impacts of climate changeinto formal analyses (Weaver 2011 ,2017 ) to targeted beaver ( Castor canadensis )restoration efforts to help raise ground water levels, cool in-stream water, and extendmountain water run-off periods (Gibson and Olden 2014 ).But even as climate change considerations are being incorporated at the planninglevel in the Y2Y region, the reality is that many institutions are still working toaccount for climate change in their working agendas; moreover, a relatively new USfederal agenda intends to gut climate change preparedness initiatives. Yet perhapsmore fundamental challenge for the conservation community is the degree to whichmany citizens living in the Y2Y region reject the premise of anthropogenic climatechange. Despite overwhelming scientiﬁc evidence, this backlash inﬂuences particularsectors in the Y2Y region and presents signiﬁcant challenges in incorporating climatechange considerations into policy and management decisions. Without addressingthis problem directly, the conservation community in the Y2Y region will continueto face institutional resistance to incorporating climate change into natural resourcemanagement.It is important to point out that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughrenewable energy can, under some conditions, entail roughly equivalent impacts ascarbon extraction in terms of footprint on biodiversity and habitats. For example,growing wind and hydro power generation projects are increasing their collectivefootprint in the Y2Y region. As they expand, they could conﬂict with a number ofspeciﬁc conservation priorities unless carefully placed.Another central challenge to the conservation community may be its own his-tory, which since the 1872 establishment of Yellowstone National Park has been oneof parceling out speciﬁc areas on the assumption that stasis in land use (i.e., landpreservation) is equivalent to inherent conservation value. This approach assumedthat if a sufﬁcient portion of land were to be designated as “protected areas,” theycould effectively conserve a region’s biodiversity. Although protected areas remainkey to conservation, their role is shifting; the threat of climate change now requiresconservationists to work across much larger landscapes, not only to ensure their188 C. C. Chester and J. A. Hiltycapacity to move across those landscapes, but to preserve ecosystem functions. Gen-erally speaking, both a precedent and a mechanism for effective and coordinatedmultijurisdictional planning and implementation remain lacking.Ultimately, conservationists in the Y2Y region—as with conservationists aroundthe globe—are beginning to incorporate and prioritization adaptation to climatechange in various efforts. Still, these efforts will not be successful unless the worldsteps up efforts on the mitigation side of the climate equation. Also, while most peo-ple working to address large landscape conservation in the Y2Y region understandthat the adaptation means ensuring that ecological changes sustain changing conﬁg-urations of biodiversity, climate science and supporting information is still lackingto guide clear decisions in all cases. This means that some partners are hesitant toincorporate climate change considerations or to adapt what they are doing to bettersupport climate resilience. In the Y2Y region, both because of the rapidly expandinghuman footprint and the increasing evidence of climate change-related impacts, it isclear that time is limited and, consequently, that the more actors across the regionstep-up to consider climate change, the likelier that the region’s biodiversity willpersist into the future.Although we do not know exactly how climate change will affect the Y2Y regionover the coming decades, we do know enough to expect that the region will seesigniﬁcant and unpredictable ecosystem changes due to alterations in temperatureand precipitation. Consequently, if it is to remain relevant and effective, the conser-vation community has not choice but to forswear the assumption that a traditionalconservation model will sufﬁciently protect the region’s biodiversity. At a globallevel, as hydrodynamic ﬂows are altered by climate change, ensuring the region’sfreshwater supplies to its full range of users is likely to become one of the mostcontentious resource challenges facing humankind. In the Y2Y region, changes inprecipitation form (viz., rain or snow) and quantity is likely to result in certain seasonsbecoming more arid, with resultant higher demands during certain times of year fromagricultural and municipal users. This in turn is likely to lead to pressure for moredams—even as climate change makes survival challenging for aquatic species thatdependent on free-ﬂowing and cool streams. If such conﬂicts are not prioritized andaddressed proactively, it is unlikely that these vulnerable species will be protectedunder conditions of unmanaged resource scarcity. Similarly, ensuring connectivityfor wide-ranging and migratory species will be critical, and thus understanding whichkinds of corridors or linkages will remain robust over long-term conditions of climatechange will be essential (Cross et al. 2012 ).Another promising approach is to identify and protect regions of “climate refugia,”or areas where glaciation did not occur (Dobrowski and Parks 2016 ; Graumlich andFrancis 2010 ). Although the location of past refugias hold no necessary promise forwarmer future, the multifaceted mountainous terrain of the Y2Y region may wellensure conditions that protect species from current and impending changes.The Yellowstone to Y ukon Conservation Initiative as an Adaptive … 189ConclusionOver the past century, portions of the Y2Y region have been the subject of extensiveand intensive scientiﬁc attention. As a result, there is a substantial body of scientiﬁcknowledge and insight to undergird biodiversity conservation as the region becomesincreasingly subject to conditions of climate change. Despite this knowledge, how-ever, considerable uncertainty remains both for the region as a whole and for anyparticular subregion of the landscape. With such uncertainties in mind, the conser-vation community must ensure that across the Y2Y region as a whole, plants andanimals can move and shift into appropriate habitats and niches according to localand subregional patterns of a changing climate. As one of us helped to articulate ina defense of US system of Large Landscape Cooperatives (LLCs; see Baldwin et al.2018 ), Y2Y’s response to climate change must incorporate the following objectives:1. maintain and expand placement of core conservation areas;2. build network connectivity responsive to the changing climate;3. assess habitat vulnerability to potential land-use change;4. integrate social constraints with biodiversity and ecosystem-service goals, and5. compare alternative scenarios.When Y2Y was ﬁrst conceived in 1993, conservation biologists were primar-ily concerned with decreasing genetic connectivity due to anthropogenic landscapechange. As climate change became more widely recognized in the conservation com-munity, the need for effective connectivity as a tool for responding to climate changebecame a driving rationale in efforts to conserve habitat. Accordingly, over the courseof the past decade, working at a “large landscape scale” has become de rigueur inthe arena of conservation biology and conservation implementation.In such a world of accelerated climate change, the Y2Y region presents one ofthe world’s most signiﬁcant opportunities to work at a large landscape scale. Theecological integrity of the Y2Y region derives from a number of factors: the regionis comparatively intact and untrammeled, it contains a wide latitudinal range, andits mountainous terrain incorporates both elevational gradients and diverse north-east-south-west aspects (Pecl et al. 2017 ). Together, this means that the Y2Y regionwill carry more resilience to climate change than many other regions. Given theopportunity presented by the Y2Y region’s high level of resilience, it remains criticalto devise and implement “climate-effective” conservation actions today so that theregion’s species will remain viable under conditions of dramatic change.190 C.

In Northern Ethiopia, large forests have been convertedinto arable land; today the last remaining refugia for native woody plant species arefound around churches. The so-called church forests are considered as the last nat-ural seed banks for native trees species, reference areas for local endemism and lastcorner stones for species distribution. Against this background, NABU, a Germanoriginated NGO, initiated a conservation programme and investigated the speciesand structural composition of 10 pilot church forests. A total of 74 woody species(41 tree, 26 shrub and 6 liana species) representing 32 families were recorded. Dif-ferences between forests were strongly expressed in species number (14–35) andnumber of seedlings (150–4150/ha). Similarities between forests decreased follow-ing the altitude difference. It was found that for successful restoration of the pilotforests, interconnecting them by vegetation corridors, creating buffering areas andlivestock fencing as well as and reforesting were suitable measures. NABU thereforeimplemented a restoration programme for safeguarding the last green forest islandstogether with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.T.

BenderIntroductionClimate change is one of the most serious environmental, social and economic threatsaffecting millions of people worldwide. Its impact is much more visible in developingcountries by deepening poverty, food insecurity, poor livelihoods and unsustainabledevelopment (FAO 2005 ;I P C C 2007 ). This level of vulnerability is largely because ofthe population’s high dependence on ecosystem services and limited capacity to adaptto a changing climate (MEA 2005 ). Hence, adapting to these changing conditionsis becoming a necessity in order to decrease their impact on human wellbeing. Inthis context, forests conservation must be considered as one of the major optionsfor adaptation to a changing climate. This is largely because a signiﬁcant part ofthe population relies on forests as safety nets during harsh periods (Nkem et al.2007 ). In Ethiopia, land degradation and deforestation are impairing the capacity offorests and the land to contribute to food security. The country is facing a populationgrowth rate of at least 2.9% (Anteneh 2017 ) which is one of the highest in the worldand results in extensive forest use and clearing for farmland, fuel wood, fodder andconstruction materials. Furthermore, a constant fragmentation of forests into smallpatches is inﬂuencing the forest structure and species composition and ultimatelyleading to habitat loss (Echeverria et al. 2006 ). The fragmentation and isolation offorests in Northern Ethiopia Highlands, at Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve, representsa particular case.At Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve region, forest cover has decreased from 40%to less than 1% within the last 50 years. Most of the forest residuals, mainly smallpatches are now located at churches and monasteries (zur Heide 2012 ). These so-called church forests are integral part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church(EOTC), which originate in the fourth century AD (Wassie 2002 ). Almost all EOTC,are surrounded by a ring of forests and remained in the landscape, even though large-scaled deforestation has occurred in the Ethiopian Highlands. These “church forests”provide sites for religious ceremonies, social gatherings and burial grounds. Most ofthese forests, though poor in regards to species abundance and biodiversity today;are dominated by natural, indigenous tree species. Many forests host endemic andendangered species that are extinguished in other places. They can be consideredas important reserves for species and biodiversity conservation and buffer againstdepletion. Church forests are also an important seed source for rehabilitation fordegraded areas. Overall, church are considered as forests serving as in situ conser-vation sites for biodiversity, in particular for indigenous trees and shrubs, whichescaped from being destroyed forever under the shelters of the church value (Wassie2002 ). Deforestation threatens the long-term water supply of the local population.There are also rises in ground-surface temperature, altered precipitation patterns andmore frequent droughts induced by global climate change, which amongst otherthings, has a negative impact on agricultural yields. Some case studies of Ethiopiaand other sub-Saharan countries (partly considered in the IPCC 4th state of playreport) have modelled the interaction of climate change, changes in land use, defor-estation and surface run-off, as well as groundwater recharge in catchment areas.Saving the Last Endemic-Church Forests in Ethiopia: The Case … 197It became apparent that rising temperatures increases evapotranspiration and in sodoing reduces groundwater recharge, whilst the increase in heavy rainfalls markedlyincreases surface run-off and groundwater recharge. In combination with deforesta-tion and the degradation of pasture and agricultural areas, which also increase surfacerun-off, these factors further advance soil erosion, and lead to ﬂooding and reducedwater quality downstream. The latter will have a serious impact on Lake Tana itself.Although church forests have been considered as stable for several decades, theyare now visibly affected by encroachment from adjacent farms, unlawful livestockgrazing within the church compound, illegal harvest of forest products (Woods et al.2017 ), and extensive expansion of non-indigenous tree like Eucalyptus spp. (Lianget al. 2016 ). Additionally, these forests are residuals from previously well-establishedand connected forests, but now exist as isolated forest fragments in the landscape.Fragmented forests are generally more susceptible to degradation compared to largeintact forests due to edge effect that creates artiﬁcial boundary (Laurence et al.2011 ). They are also much more exposed to higher wind, higher temperature andlower humidity at the edge compared to the interior of the forest (Laurence et al.1998 ) resulting to mortality of seedlings (Zambrano et al. 2014 ). This all affects thelong-term existence of these small forests.Against this background, NABU, a German originating NGO, initiated a churchforest, conservation programme in 2013. NABU supported technically and ﬁnan-cially the establishment of Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve as a wider approach forconserving habitats, culture and biodiversity, while opening up sustainable devel-opment opportunities like ecotourism or regionally produced and labelled productsfor local communities. NABU works towards conservation and sustainable develop-ment in Ethiopia since 2006 having a specialisation on UNESCO biosphere reserves’establishment and management. After securing the legal protection of parts of thearea as core zones of the UNESCO biosphere reserve, it seemed of major signiﬁcanceto maintain the last forest islands of the former forested area. According to NABU,ecological restoration efforts should both focus on maintaining forest species diver-sity and ecosystem services of the last remaining forests by creating conditions thatfacilitate regeneration of the various species within the forest as well as expandingforest area, interconnecting patches and creating new ones. In order to understandforest structure, ecology, threats and socioeconomic pressures, a baseline study onspecies and structural composition as well as the living conditions of adjacent com-munities, was therefore assigned by NABU to the Amhara Regional AgriculturalResearch Institute (ARARI). Based on the study, detailed and participatory elabo-rated forest management plans for restoration and interconnection for each forestas well as income generation schemes for the local communities living around thechurch forests were planned to be developed. In the course of an extended ﬁeldsurvey on present church forests in the wider area, ten pilot church forests at LakeTana Biosphere Reserve were selected and assessed in detail. This paper presents theecological main results of the study addressing the following questions: (1) What isthe forest structure and species composition of the 10 church forests? (2) Which pos-sible measures could be taken for conservation and restoration of the church forestsin order to preserve biodiversity and contribute to adaptation to climate change?198 T. Kassahun and S. BenderThe ﬁndings of the study and NABU’s approach for conserving some of the lastforest patches and their biological diversity might add to the little existent knowledgeon forest churches in the Lake Tana Basin and support the biosphere reserve manage-ment unit, local administrations and other stakeholders in their efforts to maintainthe last indigenous forest resources of Lake Tana area.Materials and MethodsStudy AreaThe study was conducted in north-eastern Ethiopia, at Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve(see Fig. 1). The Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve is located in the Amhara NationalRegional State approximately 563 km northwest of Addis Ababa in the north-westernpart of Ethiopia. The biosphere reserve comprises Lake Tana, the largest lake inEthiopia, the main source of the Blue Nile, which provides important ecosystemservices. The area is a hotspot of biodiversity, internationally known as an ImportantBird Area and is of global importance for agricultural genetic diversity. The area ischaracterized by an enormous heterogeneity of land uses and natural ecosystems.Amongst the 10 administrative districts (locally known as Woredas) that are encom-passing the Tana Lake, the Dera district has been chosen for both the study and thepiloting of selected measures. Dera is located at the eastern part of the lake coveringan estimated area of 149,726 ha, at an altitude ranging between 1500–3200 m.a.s.l.The rainfall is characterized by a bimodal distribution with the main rainy seasonfrom June to August and a small rainy season from March to May. The average rain-fall varies between 1000 and 1500 mm and the annual average temperature rangesbetween 13 and 27 °C (BoA 2013). The topography comprises uneven and raggedmountainous highlands, extensive plains and few deep gorges. The area is part ofthe most degraded and eroded parts of the regional state of Amhara. The commonsoil types are nitosol and vertisol. The dominant land use system is farming coveringalmost 46% of the district followed by small forest patches, in which almost 50%of it belonging to the so-called church forests. The district has a total population of259, 113 of which 98% are members of the EOTC (CSA 2007 ).Out of 1404 church forests in that administrative zone (South Gondar adminis-trative zone), 10 church forests were selected for the study. The selection criteriafocused on forests being bigger than 1 ha and of comparable altitude, with the excep-tion of Abune Aregawi church forest (0.7 ha) which was included as it is located in astrategic location and useful as a stepping stone to link other forests ecologically. Allstudied forests are located in so called the buffer zones of the Lake Tana BiosphereReserve and cover a total area of 89.3 ha (Table 1).The church forests sizes varied between 0.7 and 44.2 ha; most churches wereestablished between 368 and 1984 A.D (Wassie et al. 2010 ). Out of the 10 selectedchurch forests, only 5 served for pilot measures and monitoring.Saving the Last Endemic-Church Forests in Ethiopia: The Case … 199Fig. 1 Location of the study area in the South Gondar Administrative Zone, at Lake Tana BiosphereReserve, Ethiopia (NABU 2017)Ta b l e 1 Characteristics of the 10 pilot church forests selected for the studyName of church andforestAltitude (m) Forest area (ha) No. of plots*Abune Aregawi 1846 0.7 2Denbiso Abo 1906 1.85 4Wagira Mariam 1888 2.5 8Aba Libanos 1932 2.8 11Wonchet Michail 1935 6.2 12Fisa Michail 1846 6.9 16Woyebila k/miheret 1878 7.43 22Zara Michail 1906 8.3 21Gindatemem 1863 8.4 27Wolet Ppetros 1797 44.2 20*Each plot measures 10 m ×10 mData CollectionIn all 10 forests, a randomly oriented transect line was laid out with 10 m ×10 m plotslocated at a distance of 50 m along transects. Other transects were then laid out parallelto this ﬁrst transect, at 50 m distance from each other. For the largest forest, WoletePetros, 44.2 ha, transects and sample plots laid at 100 m intervals. Consequently, 2–27plots were established in each forest depending on their size leading to 148 samplingplots. For each church forest, the forest borders were mapped and the areas coveredby trees within the boundaries were calculated (Fig. 2). The areas occupied by churchbuildings as well as other non-forested sites were measured and subtracted from the200 T. Kassahun and S. BenderFig. 2 Aerial photograph of a typical church forest surrounded by arable land at Lake Tana Bio-sphere Reserve ( Photo Prof. Michael Succow)total area to reach the actual forest area. The altitude of the forests was determined atthe central location within the forest. In each sample plot, tree and shrub species, wereidentiﬁed and counted to estimate the number of individuals per species. Diameter at1.3 m height was measured for each tree in the sample plots having >5 cm diameterand >1.3 m height and the number of saplings with <1 cm diameter and <1.3 m heightwas recorded in each sample plot. Seedlings were counted in a 5 m ×5 m sub-plotswithin each of the main 10 m ×10 m plots. Plants with multiple stems at or below1.3 m height were treated as a single individual. The heights of all woody specieswere measured using a hypsometer and meter tape. Leaf litter depth was measuredfrom the litter surface to bare organic soil at 4 points, one at the centre, at two cornersand one in the middle of one side of each plot. The number of clearly visible cattletrails and dead stumps (>5 cm diameter) were recorded for each plot. Common andscientiﬁc names of all woody species where identiﬁed and recorded. Identiﬁcationwas done using Hedberg and Edwards ( 1995 ), Edwards et al. ( 1995 ,2000 ), Azeneet al. ( 1993 ).In-depth interviews were also conducted with church priests, community leadersand guards. Furthermore, site visits with guided walks led by persons assigned fromthe churches and additional support from satellite images, served to document thephysical features of the church forest systems. Focus group discussions were alsoconducted covering different groups such as elders, inﬂuential leaders within thecommunity, women who are commonly engaged in fuel wood collection and youthwho are frequently landless and I need of income.Saving the Last Endemic-Church Forests in Ethiopia: The Case … 201Data concerning soil seed bank aspects at the various church forests and its con-tribution to restoration, as well as the number of livestock in the study area and theirimpact on seed germination and seed survival, are important aspects that need to betaken onto account. However, this is unfortunately beyond the scope of the study dueto limitation in time and resources.Data AnalysisForest structure was described in terms of mean maximum height (calculated fromthe maximum height recorded in each sample plot), and mean basal area was as thesum of the cross-sectional stem areas of the overstorey plants and scaled to hectare(m2ha−1). The density per hectare was calculated for the overstorey and understoryplants. The species richness of trees was determined by counting the number of allwoody species including seedling and sapling recorded in each sampling plot. Thediversity of each church forest was estimated using the Shannon-Wiener DiversityIndex (H) and Evenness or Equitability Index (E) (Magurran 1988 ).Dominance was described in terms of Importance value index (IVI) which is ameasure of the relative importance of a species in an area and combines relativedensity, relative frequency and relative dominance (Van Andel 2003 ) .I V Ii sa l s oa nimportant parameter that reveals the ecological signiﬁcance of species in a givenecosystem (Lamprecht 1989 ). Species with high IVI values are considered moreimportant than those with low IVI value. The IVI values can also be used to prioritizespecies for conservation, and species with high IVI value need less conservationefforts, whereas, those having low IVI value need high conservation effort.ResultsForest CompositionA total of 74 woody species (41 trees, 26 shrubs and 6 liana species) representing32 families were recorded in the 10 church forests. From these species, 70 wereindigenous Ethiopia and 4 were exotic. Fabaceae (7) and Moracea (3) families hadthe highest number of species. The total number of species and families in each of the10 church forests ranges from 14 to 35 species. The mean basal area ranged from 6.39to 17 m2/ha and the mean number of seedlings ranged between 150 and 4150/ha. Theaverage maximum height ranged between 16 and 45 m. The maximum stand density(7075 individuals’ ha−1) was recorded in Fisa Michael and followed by Aba Libanos(5254 individuals’ ha−1) and Zara Michael (4790 individuals’ ha−1) (Table 2). Onespecies, namely Diospyros abyssinica dominated the woody vegetation in manychurch forests. For instance, it contributes up to 20–60% of the total density in sixchurch forests and ranks as ﬁrst in Gindatememl, Fisa Michael, Wolet Petros, DenbisoAbo, Zara Michael and Aba Libanos, and second in Wagira Mariam and WonchetMichael church forests (Fig. 4).202 T.

The population structure of woody species showedhigher stem densities in the lower diameter classes (seedling and sapling) and pro-gressively declining stem densities with increasing diameter classes (tree) in manyof selected church forests. A greater proportion of individuals of all woody species,were found in lower diameter size classes, compared to larger diameter size in manyof church forests. This forest condition resembles inverted “J” shape (Fig. 3). Thepopulation structure of some dominant species showed different population structurethan the normal structure observed in all woody species (Fig. 4).Mimusops kummelandAlbiia shimperiana showed broken “J” structure indicating a failure of repro-duction. Species like Celtis africana andEhretia cymosa showed broken inverted“J” shape, although there is relatively good early recruitment and establishment ofseedlings but showing failure of further development to sapling and mature tree.Species Richness and DiversityThe church forest varied in their species richness and diversity. Species numberranged from 14 to 35. The Shannon’s diversity index was maximum in WonchetMichail (2.69) followed by Abune Aregawi (2.45) and Weybila K/Miheret (2.42),while the evenness measure was 0.86, 0.87 and 0.68 respectively (Table 2).Only three woody species ( Diospyros Abyssinia ,Millettia ferruginea and Crotonmacrostachyus ) were found commonly in all 10 church forests. Species richness anddiversity values decreased with altitudes.204 T. Kassahun and S. BenderFig. 4 Population structure of selected woody species in ten church forestsDiscussionWithin the administrative zone of our study site (South Gondar administrative zone),more than 1404 church and monastery forests exist. The agriculture departmentof the administrative body reports that there are 125 woody species in the studyarea (SGAZDA 2004 ), but in our survey we found 74 species just from 10 churchforests. Similarly, a study by Wassie et al. ( 2010 ) in the same administrative zonefound 168 species from surveys conducted on 28 church forests. This implies thespecies richness of these church forests is massively underrated and more speciesare to be expected in other church forests. Hence, these church forests can playimportant role in conserving biodiversity as refuge and natural gene bank for seedproductions especially in areas that are continuously threatened by deforestation andfragmentation.Saving the Last Endemic-Church Forests in Ethiopia: The Case … 205Although the size of the assessed church forests varies from 0.7 to 44.2 ha, therewas no indication regarding a trend between species richness and forest area. Theabsence of a relationship between species richness and forest area was also reportedin other studies (Haig et al. 2000 ; Santos et al. 2007 ; Wassie et al. 2010 ). However,in some of the larger forest patches such as Wolet petros (44.2 ha) and Zara Michail(8.3 ha) slightly more species were recorded.This could be attributed to ecological processes like island effects (Hill and Curran2003 ) and also to sampling effects, in bigger forest patches containing more plotsthat sampled more of the community (Hill and Curran 2001 ). The edge effect couldalso be one factor why smaller church forests had still relatively higher richness. Theedge effect may have increased the niches available inside the forest and disturbancesfavouring species in these smaller patches (Wassie et al. 2010 ). Even though largerpatches of forest are important for maintaining a viable population, small patches orremnants forests role should not be neglected (Fisher and Lindenmayer 2002 ).In our study, we observed a small trend in species richness decreasing with increas-ing altitude. Our ﬁnding is supported by an earlier study by Wassie et al. ( 2010 ) whichfound a similar decrease in species richness in 28 church forests. Other studies inthe tropics also conﬁrm species richness and diversity declining at higher altitude(Mohandass et al. 2017 ; Lacoul and Freedman 2006 ). When it comes to structuralcomposition of the forests, human inﬂuence had a strong effect on all church forestsexcept Zara Michael forest, which is fully protected with stone walls surroundingthe entire forest boundary. Hence, Zara Michael had the lowest stump density com-pared to the other forests. The other forests typically faced high degrees of exposureto human and animal pressure. The majority of the shrubs and herbaceous speciesfound at the external boundary of the forests are browsed or the seedlings are tram-pled. In the smaller church forests such as Aba Libanos, similar challenges wereobserved, but the threat was more severe as the forest area was very small and manytall trees were removed for construction and as income source for the church.Local Communities’ Perception Towards Church ForestsThe various respondents stress the church forests as an intrinsic part of socio-religiouspractice within the Orthodox Christian religion. Even though they are important forreligious and social services, they are not protected ofﬁcially for their ecosystem ser-vices or biodiversity. Furthermore, they do not offer direct beneﬁts to communities’livelihoods as for instance communal property or resources provide. Only nuns andmonks who live or work in the church forest compounds beneﬁt directly throughcollection of fruits etc. However, community members stress the signiﬁcance of pro-tecting the forest as it belongs to the church and this attitude of belonging to thechurch was found as a good deterrence against overuse of church forest resourcesat least in most of the forests (Klepeis et al. 2016 ). From an economic perspectiverespondent refer the beneﬁts of the forest for collecting fodder grass, trees seeds andeven seedlings, which can be bought directly from some church forests.When it comes to the level of degradation, the community does not principallyagree with the premise that the forests are degraded and in danger of being lost.Nevertheless, they emphasize on the lack of proper management and replacing cut206 T. Kassahun and S. Bendertrees with seedlings. Furthermore, the tendency of replacing indigenous tree speciessuch as Mimmusops kummel orAlbiia shimperiana with income generating speciessuch as Coffea arabica or foreign species which have a direct negative impact on theecology of the respective ecosystem like Eucalyptus spp. is concerning. Nevertheless,some respondents consider these procedures as the right approach for sustaining thechurches ﬁnancially. As future solution, the majority of the respondents suggestederecting stone wall around the forest for multiple reasons: Firstly, it can clearlydemarcate the boundary of the church from the surrounding arable lands; secondly,it prevents cattle from ranging freely in the forest while disturbing the ecosystemseverely, and ﬁnally it adds prestige to the church (Klepeis et al. 2016 ).Application of the Results to Church Forest Managementand ConservationNABU’s aim is to conserve the church forests at Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve asshelter sites for species and biodiversity and buffer against climate change impactsand to develop schemes for conservation and restoration of the church forests. Takinginto account the main outcomes of the study and continuous discussion with thelocal community and church community, free grazing near the church forest, illegaldeforestation and farmland encroachment towards the forest were identiﬁed as criticalproblems (Fig. 5).Church forests have existed for hundreds of years due to strong but largely informalindigenous protection systems backed by the local community’s shared religiousvalues and traditions (Wassie and Teketay 2006 ; Klepeis et al. 2016 ). In addition,the recent establishment of the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve will deﬁnitely helpin ending the continuous cycle of ecological degradation in the area. Most of thechurch forests surrounding the lake fall within the biosphere reserve region. Ideally,this gives them further protection and makes them useful to restore deforested landsin the area (zur Heide 2012 ). In our study, we surveyed 10 church forests and founda total of 74 woody species and an indigenous tree such as Prunus africana , which isincluded in the IUCN red list of threatened species (IUCN 2006 ). Thus, these forestsare very critical and serve as refuge for many indigenous species in the area. Thismakes the conservation of church forests as the priority in the biosphere reserve.Following the study results and conducting intensive literature review, NABUimplemented the conservation program on church forests successfully. The inter-ventions focus on: (1) maintaining forest species diversity and ecosystem servicesby supporting efforts that help for regeneration of various species within the forest;(2) expanding the forest size in areas where possibilities exist; (3) creating bufferzones and interconnections between the church forests; and (4) establishing areaclosures to improve degraded areas.Saving the Last Endemic-Church Forests in Ethiopia: The Case … 207Fig. 5 A stone wall fence surrounding a church forest at Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve ( PhotoAngelika Berndt)Moreover, NABU in collaboration with the local community and the churchesstarted erecting stone wall around the ﬁve target church forests. Stone walls haveshown clear ecological beneﬁts: (1) enhancing the regeneration potential by protect-ing seedlings from disturbance, reducing edge effects and grazing threats (Wassieet al. 2009 ) and (2) improving the ﬂoristic composition of the seedlings in the forestespecially for species with low regeneration status such as O. europaea ssp. (Woodset al. 2017 ).As part of the applied integrated approach to protect the church forests, a model ofecological corridors network has been developed to deal with the effect of fragmen-tation and loss of corridors between patches. Hence, the concept of interconnectingthe selected ﬁve church forests by decreasing the distance between them and bycreating buffer areas around them (such as area enclosures) as well as developingmore vegetation patches in the landscape has been followed (Fig. 6). The selectedforests showed clear potential for expanding them. Therefore, NABU together withthe local administration and with active community participation started reforestationand enrichment planting with endemic species (e.g. Mimusops kummel ) that show alow natural regeneration capacity and are under threat of disappearing. As it is alsoa keystone species, it can speed up restoration.So far there is great enthusiasm among the leaders of selected church forests andlocal communities living in the vicinity of the churches. They have been activelyengaging and participating in the conservation efforts and erection of stone wall. Inthe future, it will be important to monitor how effective the stone walls have been in208 T. Kassahun and S.

The basin providesresources for ﬁshing, agriculture, medicine, forestry, water transport and other eco-nomic activities. However, its area is grossly affected by climate change due topopulation growth, urbanization, industrialization, increasing commercial activitiesand inadequate provision of sanitation services which have caused a lot of pollution.This climate change is likely to lead to loss of biodiversity in terms of species rich-ness. Moreover, the increase in the population growth around Lake Victoria Basinis associated with an increase in economic activities that lead to ecosystem vul-nerability and social-ecological disequilibrium. Climate change is likely to affectbiodiversity as species struggle to adapt to climatic changes. In order to address theissue of climate change, proper communication and information sharing among thestakeholders around the Lake Victoria Basin is paramount. This paper addresses thisneed, by discussing major socio-economic activities taking place around this Basin,their impact on climate change and its impact on biodiversity thereof, and problemsrelated to resource management. The study took place in the districts of Buikweand Mayuge in Uganda. Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were used,data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science researchsoftware. From the ﬁndings, there are variations in access to communication gad-gets, mobile phones being top on the list of accessibility. The study concludes byidentifying the best option for communication and information sharing based on theO.

Godfrey et al.factors evaluated and recommends an integrated web-based and mobile applicationtool for better management of resource in Lake Victoria Basin.IntroductionLake Victoria is the largest fresh water lake in Africa with a surface area of 68,800 km2(EAC 2006 ). It is a very important resource for the ﬁve riparian countries: Uganda,Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. The basin provides resources for ﬁshing,agriculture, medicine, forestry, water transport and other economic activities. How-ever, Lake Victoria Basin is facing problems of drastic climate change due to rapidpopulation growth, urbanization, industrialization, increasing commercial activitiesand inadequate provision of sanitation services which had in turn caused a lot of pol-lution. Climate change is responsible for the deterioration of the quality of water andnatural resources in the Lake Victoria Basin. Increased human activities, poor landuse practices and pollution of water bodies greatly reduce the quantity and qualityof the available water resources in the basin (Okurut 2010 ).Without adequate intervention in the management of climate change in LVB, it isclear that the disadvantaged communities will continue to suffer. Managing scarceresources requires the application of appropriate technology, which is embedded intraditional knowledge and some inspired by fresh science research work and newinsight (Mongi et al. 2010 ). Water resource management is the activity of planning,developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of water resources (Okurut2010 ). In an ideal world, water resource management planning seeks to allocate wateron an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands (Diggs 1991 ; Ssozi 2015 ).This research arose out of the observation that there has been a steady populationgrowth around Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a change in climate around the Basin ismanifested by ﬂoods, drought events, and sedimentation, etc. The population growthhas over the years led to a number of socio-economic activities which have alsocontributed tremendously to climate change. Moreover, there is no ICT tool that canfacilitate reliable information sharing among the local population and local leadersaround the Basin. There was therefore a need to investigate and identify the majoreconomic activities, the major energy sources, transport means, etc. that can lead toclimate change. There was also a need to identify the available ICT tools currentlyused in the dissemination and sharing of relevant information about environmentconservation around the Basin so as to avoid the effects of climate change on theecosystems and biodiversity. This paper is one of the papers in which we intend toaddress the issues of climate change and its impact on biodiversity and developing atool to address the gap in information dissemination and sharing.Factors Affecting Communication and Information … 213Related WorkClimate in Lake Victoria Basin is continuously changing and it is getting worse astime passes. Bad periods are becoming more frequent than before, resulting in poorperformance in agriculture and consequently food shortages in several areas in LVB.This has made farmers from different age groups to acknowledge the impact andare trying to adapt in different ways (Mongi et al. 2010 ). However, communitiesattempting to adapt to the adverse effects of climatic change are recognizing thepotential role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in respondingto it (Ngonidzashe and Adekunle 2013 ).According to East African Community Development Strategy Assessment (EAC2006 ), it was revealed that communication and knowledge sharing are vital for waterresources management in Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), and that at the moment, thereare inadequate stakeholders’ participation, inadequate communication and informa-tion sharing strategies; water quality monitoring and evaluation process is entirelymanual. This had led to poor governance of the scarce water resource in LVB(Okurut 2010 ). Hence, there is a need to develop a tool which can be used by selectedpeople and community leaders to timely communicate and coordinate activities ofgovernance of resources in Lake Victoria Basin.It is estimated that 200 tons of untreated efﬂuents are discharged into the Lakeeveryday from economic activities around the lake (Okurut 2010 ). The problemaffects millions of people whose livelihood depends on the natural resource base(UNDP 2007 ). Decline in volume of water in the basin may also have impacts onthe socio-economic and political stability of the EAC. Some member countries areusing LVB resources without consideration of its sustainability. Examples are; Jinjadam for Hydro-electric Power in Uganda and Shinyanga-Kahama water project inTanzania (UNDP 2007 ). Management of resources therefore calls for an integratedapproach, in order to address these challenges (Philippe 2011 ).Rinawati et al. ( 2013 ) noted that climate change creates potential major threatsto global biodiversity. The authors further observed that “the multiple componentsof climate change are projected to affect all pillars of biodiversity, from genes overspecies to biome level”. This is true of the biodiversity around Lake Victoria Basin(LVB) which is threatened by climate change as noted by Case ( 2006 ). Case arguesthat because of climate change, the ecosystems and the livelihoods that depend onthem are threatened. Muhweezi ( 2014 ) also noted that Biodiversity and ecosystem-speciﬁc goods and services in Uganda are likely to be adversely affected by climatechange in the future. This he argues, is due to rising temperatures, which will increaseby more than 2 °C by 2030.Malcom ( 2003 ) and Green et al. ( 2003 ) noted that “recent reviews demonstratea high conﬁdence that climate change effects are already showing in living things.Despite this, there have been few attempts to model climate change impacts onbiodiversity at the global scale”.Case ( 2006 ) further observed that the effects of climate change such as risingtemperature and changes in precipitation are undeniably clear with impacts already214 O. Godfrey et al.affecting ecosystems, biodiversity and people. There are a number of socio-economicactivities being carried out around Lake Victoria Basin. These not only affect the bio-diversity, but also affect the management and governance of the water as a resource.Weggoro and Ntamubano ( 2010 ), suggested that some of the practices in whichgovernance of water resources can be improved includes; increase transparencythrough the provision of information concerning operating policies and procedures,programs, and projects to the general public. Information should be exchanged tostimulate debate, deepen understanding, and nurture new perspectives on trans-boundary environmental challenges and increase efforts to involve the public. Severalconceptual frameworks have been developed to model the relationship between ICTand natural resources under climate change. These model suggests that governanceof such natural resource has a chain of three major underlying components: method-ologies, participation and results which are to be monitored and evaluated at differentstages (Linuma and Tenge 2017 ).Information and Communication Technologies have had an increasing impact oneconomic and social development, resulting from their capacity to generate and dis-seminate information to facilitate the coordination of different actors in and beyondgovernment (Y onazi et al. 2012 ). ICTs are highly diverse and can be implementedon different scales such as sensor networks, satellite earth stations, meteorologicalsystems and mobile phones that individuals can use to access information, reportproblems or share experiences(Ospina and Heeks 2010 ; Mongi et al. 2015 ).Research MethodologyStudy SitesThe study was conducted in Buikwe, and Mayuge districts. Measures were under-taken in choosing the type of community that contributed positively to research worksthrough random sampling. The rationale for selecting these districts were based onthree factors; First, their location within the Lake Victoria Basin. Second, the major-ity of its population depends on ﬁshing, agriculture, charcoal burning, local herbs andwater transport as their major sources of income. Third, the areas are vastly affectedby decline in water resources and also the community’s willingness to contributetowards achieving the project objectives.Sampling ProceduresResearchers used probability and non-probability sampling methods. In proba-bility sampling, simple random sampling was employed to come up with repre-sentative of community members from the two villages. In non-probability sam-pling, purposive sampling method was employed to select key informants who pro-vided key information on LVB. These are people who are knowledgeable on cli-mate matters, examples, Community Development Ofﬁcers, Environmental Ofﬁcers,Factors Affecting Communication and Information … 215Law Enforcement Ofﬁcers, and NGOs working on environments and other povertyeradication program.Population Size and DistributionA sample size of 89 respondents from two study areas in Buikwe and Mayugedistricts was selected using Morgan and Krejcie ( 1970 ) tables. Both purposive andstratiﬁed random sampling procedures were used to ensure representation of allrelevant stakeholders to ease reliability and efﬁciency in data collection. There were30 key informants and 59 community members.Data Collection MethodsPrimary data collection was done through questionnaires survey using structuredquestionnaire, focused group discussion by using prepared guide questions and keyinformants interview by using interview guide. Questionnaire method for data collec-tion helped to collect a lot of information in a short time. This enabled the researchersto ﬁnd out ready information easily for the study. Focus group discussion were donethrough inviting village people such as agricultural extension workers, commercialfarmers, peasant farmers, ﬁsheries, cattle keepers and other community workers. Thisaided an efﬁcient digging of information through interaction. The pertinent concernincluding why there still exist illegal cutting of trees for charcoal and ﬁrewood, illegalﬁshing tools and corruption was clearly identiﬁed.Reliability and Validity of the Research ApproachTo address the issue of reliability, questions were checked to determine if they areprompting the types of responses expected. A pilot test with a small set of peoplefrom the target population was also done and the tools were found reliable. Theobservation protocol/record keeping sheet was also critical in getting credible data.Three experts in the study area of the research (expert in water resource managementand climate change) were used to check and provide guidance on the questionnaireused as a data collection tools.Data AnalysisThe statistical tool, SPSS, was used to generate descriptive statistics and other resultsas discussed in the next section. Content analysis was used for Qualitative data bywhich they were categorized into major themes related to research.ResultsRespondents’ CharacteristicsAs shown in Fig. 1, majority of the respondents were male (71.4%) while 28.6% werefemales. 44.8% of the community members were in the age group 36–50 years. 37.7%216 O. Godfrey et al.Fig. 1 Respondent characteristicsof the community members had secondary school education; 22.6% had tertiaryeducation. Most of the respondents (81.3%) had stayed in their current places ofresidence for over 15 years. Low level of education has a impact on the use andadoption of technologies.Major Economic ActivitiesA ss h o w ni nF i g . 2below, the major economic activities are crop production (47.2%),ﬁshing (16.3%), small businesses (10%), Wage Laborers (4.5) and Livestock keeping(7.5).Most of the respondents are involved in crop production and ﬁshing.ICT Facilities and UsesAs shown in the Fig. 3below, the most accessible ICT facilities are radio (48.9%),mobile phone (52%) and TV (13.1%). Access to internet is low (2.7%) and computer(2.7%). Community access to information on LVB water resources is low (44%).Owners of Transport AssetAs shown in the Fig. 4below, most of the community members use bicycles fortransport (32.6%), boat (5%), motorcycle (4.5%), motor vehicle (1.8) and Boat (5%).There is a big problem of transport as the majority rely on bicycles to facilitatetheir movement. As a result, ﬁeld ofﬁcers working for Governments, NGOs, in themanagement of water resources become less effective in performing their duties.Factors Affecting Communication and Information … 217Fig. 2 Major Economic activitiesFig. 3 ICT facilitiesFig. 4 Methods of transport218 O. Godfrey et al.Fig. 5 Energy sourceMajor Energy SourcesFigure 5, shows major household energy sources: Kerosene (47.5%); ﬁre-wood/charcoal (57%); grid electricity (7.2%), solar (9%) and Gas (8.6%). The mostaccessible and widely used energy source is ﬁrewood/charcoal. This could be becausethe electricity is still very expensive for the community as well as solar and gas. Theresults of forest cover depletion is felt as people cut down trees for ﬁrewood andcharcoal.Major Governance Issues for Sustainable LVB Water ResourcesFigure 6shows governance issues rating (1–3) in relation to degradation, inadequateparticipation, lack of transparency, lack of equity, lack of coordination, corruptionamong ofﬁcials and climate change.Perceived Beneﬁts of LVB Water ResourcesThe perceived beneﬁts of Lake Victoria basin were; income generation (28.8%), foodsource (28.8%). source of water supply (22%), Tourism (8.3%), Construction sand(5.1%), Timber (3.4%), Weather (10.2%).Community Perception on Major Causes of LVB Water Resources DegradationThe community perceptions on the causes of Lake Victoria Basin water degradationare; poor governance, high population, deforestation, poor farming methods.Key Informant Perception on Major Causes of LVB Water Resources DegradationThe key informant perception on major causes of Lake Victoria Basin water resourcesdegradation is; illegal ﬁshing activities, negligence of people, lack of employment,poverty, inadequate knowledge, industrial activities, limited community participationand awareness, mining activities, poor enforcement of laws and regulations.Factors Affecting Communication and Information … 219Fig. 6 Major governance issuesWeaknesses in Existing Policies on LVB Water Resource ManagementMajor Weaknesses in the existing policies on Lake Victoria Basin resource man-agement are; Lack of enforcement of laws, Limited community participation andawareness.DiscussionSince there is low level of education as indicated in the results, the design of ICTtechnologies needs to be user friendly, and must be community oriented if success isto be achieved. The fact that the majority of the respondents stayed in their currentplace for a long time, implies that they have really felt the effect of climate changeand their report was therefore trusted.The most accessible ICT facilities are mobile phones (52%) and the access tointernet and computer is still low (2.7%). Given this situation in mind, the successof any resource management tool for community, should be developed under com-munity context and therefore consideration on the gadgets owned by those people isworth mentioned. Hence, the system should integrate internet and mobile phone.Most of the respondents are involved in crop production and ﬁshing. The increasein population around Lake Victoria has a big effect on the forest cover as peopleclear bushes to pave way for crop production hence resulting into adverse effect ofclimate change. Also ﬁshing practices need to be totally streamlined as many peopleget involved as a way of survival because of lack of employment.220 O. Godfrey et al.The major accessible household energy source is ﬁrewood/charcoal (57%) whilethe lowest is Gas (8.6%). This had again impacted on forest cover since the growingpopulation cut down trees indiscriminatively for charcoal and ﬁrewood. The littleuse of electricity could be due to it being expensive which is not affordable to thelocal community. Governance issues in relation to degradation, inadequate partici-pation, lack of transparency, lack of equity, lack of coordination, corruption amongofﬁcials have been found as a serious problem. The proposed ICT technology willcurb down this vices by adequately aiding the community participation and efﬁcientimplementation of policies on LVB.Limitation and Constraints of the StudyLake Victoria Basin covers ﬁve countries including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania,Rwanda and Burundi. For this exploratory and preliminary study it was not pos-sible to visit all the countries of the East African Community (EAC) due to logisticalconstraints. However, this will be the case in future when the current logistical con-straints are solved. There was apprehension from some of the research participantswho never wanted to be interviewed or ﬁll the questionnaire having known that theresearch is about the activities they are involved in around the Lake. This took theresearchers a lot of time to identify willing participants to take part in the study.Conclusion, Recommendations and Further ResearchConclusionThis study examined the challenges being faced and the impact of climate changeon water resource and biodiversity around Lake Victoria Basin. A number of majoreconomic activities and energy sources were identiﬁed and these have been found tohave an effect on climate. It was also discovered that participation of all stakehold-ers in the governance of water resources is paramount if success in curbing downchallenges facing water bodies due to adverse effect of climate change is to be real-ized. Furthermore, it revealed that there is no way participation in governance can beachieved unless there is a reliable communication system in place. Since stakeholdersare different and complex in nature, and given the fact that they are equipped withdifferent communication gadgets, there is need for an integrated system to bring allpersons on board which will enhance water resource governance in LVB. Also, thestudies noted that there are weaknesses in the enforcement of policies as well as littleawareness of those policies. This could be so, because of lack of reliable communi-cation platform which can help stakeholders to share and coordinate information ongovernance. The government and other non-state actors should invest more money toproduce a reliable communication system to coordinate the activities of governance.Factors Affecting Communication and Information … 221RecommendationsThe proposed recommendation to curb down challenges affecting Lake VictoriaBasin is; improved enforcement of rules and regulations, high community involve-ment in the management of water resources, awareness creation, ﬁght against cor-ruption and improved communication among stakeholders. We recommend that asystem should be developed to enhance effective communication at all levels of gov-ernance. According to the ﬁndings, the most communication gadgets available tothe population that are commonly in use are; Mobile Phones, Internet, Radios andTelevision sets. This implies that the ICT tool to be developed should incorporate atleast two of these communication gadgets.The researchers recommend an integrated mobile application tool which willincorporate mobile phone, internet and web-based in one platform. This tool willbe used by selected people such as key informants, community leaders, Govern-ment workers concerned with LVB, NGOs etc. in enhancing management of waterresources in LVB.Lessons Learned and Further ResearchThis study revealed that majority of the people around the Lake Victoria Basin are un-ware of the dangers posed by their economic activities. Moreover, the local leaderslack effective and efﬁcient means of disseminating and sharing the information aboutthe dangers brought about by climate change and its impact on the ecosystems,biodiversity and the water resource.Areas for further research include developing an ICT tool that integrates all theavailable communication channels. This tool will be used to enhance communication,dissemination and sharing of information about methods and procedures that can betaken to preserve and protect the shores and waters of LVB.Acknowledgements Many thanks goes to the local communities and leaders in the study areas forcooperating with us in providing the reliable information necessary for this study.

Lacks of knowledge at regional level have ledto the development of a research program: “Climate sentinels” ( www.sentinelles-climat.org ). A research hypothesis is that the effects can be studied from indicatorsof species that have weak displacement. These “sentinel” species will be the ﬁrstto respond to local climatic variations by adaptation or local extinction. In France,New Aquitaine region is a relevant research laboratory. It offers both sensitivity toclimate change and a variety of natural ecosystems. The approach to understandingthe response of these indicators to climate change is based on observations in a wholeregion, standardized protocols in relationship with models using mainly abundancedata, validated data linked to associated sufﬁcient coverage and relevant observationsin connection with time and space scales. In this paper, we will present 3 pointscharacterizing this project: (1) the research-action approach of the program bringstogether different types of actors (decision makers, naturalists, managers, researchersand the public), within an independent organisation and catalyst “Cistude Nature”, (2)the method of establishing a list of development indicators called “Climate sentinels”,(3) the protocols and data analysis of multi-ecosystems, multi-species at differentscales that are used to support projections of climate change impacts on biodiversity.The aim is to share feedback on this topic concerning the structuring of the programat the interface between science and society.F.

CouderchetIntroductionThe complex inﬂuences of climate on biodiversity and the intrinsic adaptive responsesof species are still little followed and unknown (Berteaux et al. 2010 ). Effects specif-ically related to climate change are difﬁcult to highlight because of the multiplefactors to be taken into account such as lack of knowledge about interactions andspecies adaptation, on observation results done only locally and over too short periodsof time. The example of terrestrial ecosystems illustrates this multiplicity of pres-sures, impacts and interactions. In particular, the dual pressure of climate change andland use are confusing the understanding of the impacts of climate change (Mallard2016a ). The organisms are confronted with these cumulative effects of multiple dis-turbances. If the dissociation of effects is not really feasible, it is possible to choosesystems that give access to the effects of climate such as protected, natural environ-ments, ectothermic animals whose ecology and physiology are directly dependenton amñbient thermal and hygrometric conditions.The lack of knowledge and data is progressively reduced thanks to long-termobservations, the improvement of understandings of ecological processes, data pro-cessing techniques, and the choice of various and complementary models. In practice,understanding the response of biodiversity to climate change in order to implementconservation strategies requires: (1) to combine regional and local space scales, timeseries data for biodiversity and climate (Root and Schneider 2006 ) to provide ele-ments of knowledge for the implementation of actions by the local natural areasmanagers but also to the regional decision-makers driving forces (Berteaux et al.2010 ), (2) to perform observations, protocols ﬁelds related to models with abun-dance data, (3) to provide validated data, associated sufﬁcient coverage, scalablecampaigns based on these data, and relevant observations linked to time and spacescales, (4) ﬁnally to communicate aggregated information to different actors.Today, there is no long-term monitoring, indexed, and standardized allowing aglobal analysis of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity state at the regionalscale. These shortcomings lead to new research approaches that extend the workof monitoring species populations. Being aware that these gaps must be ﬁlled asa priority, the Cistude Nature association has created links with partners to set upa multi-year study program: “Climate sentinels” (2016–2021). The challenge is tomove forward fundamental knowledge by reasoning in terms of multi-scale spaceand time operation. In this context, it is essential to know and to take into accountvariables coupled in space and time, to combine different theoretical disciplines fromvarious ﬁeld studies, by facilitating the analysis and the multi-public circulation ofknowledge. This program raises the following question: How to assess and predictthe response of regional biodiversity to climate change? A research hypothesis is thatthe effects can be studied from indicators of species that have weak displacement.At a regional or local scale, the most endangered species are those with latitudinaland altitudinal spatial restrictions and limited dispersal capacity (Feehan et al. 2009 ).These “sentinel” species will be the ﬁrst to respond to local climatic variations byadaptation or local extinction.Climate Sentinels Research Program: Developing Indicators … 225In this paper, the ﬁrst part describes a research approach responding to this prob-lem in a new discipline of ecology to be developed, which would be ﬁrst of all ascience of climate-biology relations: the ecology of climate change. The second partidentiﬁes the scientiﬁc perspectives for the development of indicators monitoring theeffects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems through the search of species orgroups of species that are sensitive and indicative of this climate change. The iden-tiﬁcation of these sentinel species of climate requires the choice of a study area thatis coherent at the biological level, but also for biodiversity conservation actions andfor the dissemination of knowledge. The terrestrial ecosystems of New Aquitaineregion (France) are selected according to ecological, climatological and topographi-cal criteria. Finally, the third part presents the approach of global analysis of programindicators and the modelling of spatial distributions and future projections of speciesin the face of climate change. The ecological data used come from two types: speciespresence data from existing regional observatories and abundance data from sam-pling protocols implemented speciﬁcally. Three universal responses of these plantand animal species are studied and are based on changes in distribution, physio-logical and phenological adjustments (plasticity) or micro-evolutionary phenomena(selection) (Daufresne et al. 2009 ).The purpose of this paper is to share a feedback on how this program is structured(after a ﬁrst year of implementation), how to address the issue of climate changeand biodiversity at the interface between science and society. The project “ClimateSentinels” presented is reproducible. The methods and models developed in thisprogram could be referred to discussion, generalized and applied in other territories atboth national and European level to increase knowledge of biodiversity. The methodsput in place, the data processing tools and the reﬂections around the formation ofa community of actions, whose role is to act on the political orientations, considera standardization process and allow a transposition to other territories. The aim isto strengthen the links between researcher community and naturalists, natural areasmanagers of and the decision-makers who implement environmental policies, as wellas the general public which guides societal choices. The scale of study brings togetherthe actors of the region level. This scientiﬁc exercise is part of epistemological changecontext. We hope this shared experience will promote, inspire and export this initiativeto other territories.Research ApproachHypothesis and Objectives Related to the ProblematicAnswering the problem requires identifying relevant and operational indicators at aregional level (New Aquitaine, France) to assess the state of biodiversity, to projectit and to try to predict the biodiversity response to climate change. The indicatorsallow a reduction in the number of measurements and parameters, thus simplifying226 F. Mallard and L. Couderchetthe approach of complex, interdependent phenomena. Their function is to describe,distinguish, simplify, aggregate, evaluate and be a basis to project the impacts ofclimate change on biodiversity. For biodiversity indicators, the objectives are alsomultiple. They make it possible to evaluate at the same time, the viability, the dura-bility, the resilience, the productivity and the vulnerability. In short, to take stock ofthe state of health of biodiversity and to allow users to make decisions and evaluatethe consequences.As a result the indicators used are “biological” and concern species (or groupsof species) of ﬂora and fauna studied in their environment. The status and evolutionof these indicators are related to a set of meteorological and climatic parametersat different time and space scales. These data concern temperature, hygrometry,rainfall, solar radiation and wind speed, in order to identify trends in the impact oftheir variations on the state of biodiversity.Three types of impacts of climate change on biodiversity are currently recognized:(1) expansion, persistence of the species to the modiﬁed climate in the habitat (geneticadaptation, phenotypic plasticity), (2) slippage, migration to more appropriate refugeareas or (3) contraction, local extinction, collapse, decline (Davis and Shaw 2001 ).The number of local extinctions will strongly depend on the ability of the speciesto move (Foden et al. 2008 ) or to adapt. At the regional or local scale, the mostendangered species are those with latitudinal, altitudinal spatial restrictions and lim-ited dispersal capabilities (Feehan et al. 2009 ). Amphibians, reptiles, micromammalsand some invertebrates have lower movement capabilities than large mammals or ﬂy-ing species. We hypothesize that these species should be among the ﬁrst to respondto local climatic variations and thus constitute “Climate sentinels”. On the otherhand these species, not very mobile, are generally easily observable which allowsfor simple and less expensive study protocols. In addition, they generally have anafﬁrmed heritage aspect.From these indicators, two main objectives are then distinguished:The ﬁrst is ecological and determines the potential effects of climate change bydissociating them from other anthropogenic factors by monitoring the status ofthese sentinel species. Most of the impacts on species will be detected over time,in relation to their intrinsic response time and changes in climate change. Theseeffects cannot be detected easily in the ﬁeld over a short time, which impliesobservations of greater sensitivity and in sufﬁcient quantity in the early stages.The second is biogeographic. On the basis of these data and associated models,it is necessary to evaluate, characterize, at different local and regional scales, theresponse of these sentinel species of the climate.Climate Sentinels Research Program: Developing Indicators … 227Action ResearchTo describe the complex relationships between society and the environment, a pos-sible framework of reasoning is to rely on the analysis model called “DPSIR” Driver(D)—Pressure (P)—State (S)—Impact (I)—Responses (R) to provide a method forunderstanding synergies between the effects of climate change, ecological processes,political decisions and management actions (Smeets and Weterings 1999 ). It allowsto describe, to classify the origins, the causes and the consequences.A ﬁrst stage of the framework lists all disturbances on the natural elements ofthe landscape. The “Drivers” correspond to the driving forces mostly related tohuman activities. The actors who inﬂuence these forces are ultimately the generalpublic. These decision makers who implement policies including environmental.The decision makers of the program (here European Union, Region New Aquitaine,departments of Gironde and Pyrénées-Atlantiques) are ﬁnancers and support theprogram. Even these driving forces cause pressures (“Pressure”) of various natures,climate change is an impact which becomes a pressure component from a biodiversitypoint of view.The second step involves monitoring the state of natural ecosystems based on thepresence, abundance of animal or plant species that live there and are subject to thesepressures. Information from this state is collected by naturalist experts of the program.The essence of this monitoring is to take into account all “impacts” or spatial-temporaleffects, including those induced by the “climate” component. The state ﬁrst takesinto account the vulnerability, gap between its levels reached and its limit level,but also the resilience of the ecosystem. Next, projections of the impacts of climatechange on biodiversity over time are essential for the development of conservationstrategies. They are largely derived from bioinformatics analysis strategies, involvingspatial-temporal modelling of each species, each functional group, each community,and ecosystems. Academics and research laboratories in collaboration with CistudeNature develop the modelling part.This last approach becomes a meeting point between applied research and basicresearch, between those who experiment, provide data and those who model, increase,aggregate information. The coupling of the two approaches (bottom-up/top-down)allows a so-called “hypothetico-deductive” approach. The process consists of for-mulating a hypothesis in order to deduce observable consequences (Fig. 1) and theseobservations in turn determine their validity. Although complex to set up, the scien-tiﬁc literature encourages hypothetico-deductive approaches by frequently linkingﬁeld studies, models and experiments in order to attest to a causal and not only cor-relative association between climate change and decline of biodiversity (Pradervandet al. 2014 ).Finally, with this DPSIR framework, the ﬁnal step is to evaluate the effective-ness, and to identify adaptation and mitigation actions to climate change effects toimplement. This step also helps to explain, and to sensitize, in short to carry out amediation work with a large public that inﬂuences implementation of the measures228 F. Mallard and L. CouderchetExperimenta ƟonField observa Ɵons andexperimental dataConcepts, theories,experimental resultsSystems modelingHypo-deduc Ɵve approachInducƟveDeducƟveBoƩom-up Top-downEmpirical-deduc Ɵve approachFig. 1 Bottom-up and top-down approaches in ecology for indicator research (Mallard 2014 ). The“top-down” and “bottom-up” approach makes it possible to formalize relevant leads on what itwould be interesting to study for indicators search. The coupling of the two approaches becomesa hypothetico-deductive approach which consists in formulating a hypothesis in order to deduceobservable consequences, allowing to determine in return its validity, by ﬁeld data, experimentalvalues. This program context becomes a scientiﬁc meeting point between applied and basic researchleading to action research between managers and scientistsdecisions, in particular by the choice of the political programs (“Responses”). Thisapproach leads to an “action research” at the interface between science and society.The resources put in place in this program promote a coordinated work that linksthe different disciplines of study. In practice, the “Cistude Nature” association, (anassociation under the Associations French Act 1901 status), approved at the regionallevel for the protection of nature, has a mediating role to mitigate the institutionalor language barriers between academics and naturalists. It is also the coordinatingstructure at the interface between science and society. The association becomes aprivileged link between the decision-makers and those who carry out naturalisticexpertise. It develops, in co-partnership, modelling with researchers. Through itsScientiﬁc Council, it ensures the validation of methods and proposes communicationand mediation tools for all audiences (Fig. 2).Development of Sentinel Climate IndicatorsClimate Change Effects State of ArtTo develop sentinel climate indicators, a ﬁrst step is to carry out a structured bib-liographic inventory in order to identify groups sensitive to climate change.

The program is part of an action research approach at the interface betweenscience and society. Cistude Nature is an independent association which coordinates the program. It helps to create the links between researcher com munityand naturalist, natural areas managers of and the decision-makers who implement environmental policies, as well as the general public which guides s ocietalchoices. This structure has a mediating role to mitigate institutional or language barriers between academics and naturalists. The associations co llect the data(bottom-up approach). Researchers analyse and model the data (top-down approach)230 F. Mallard and L. Couderchetglobal scale was therefore realized as part of the program. Groups of indicatorspecies commonly used to characterize the state of the environment were identi-ﬁed: mosses, ferns, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms, insects (Bumblebees, Odonata,Lepidoptera), amphibians, reptiles (lizards) and small mammals (rodents, AlpineMarmot) (Mallard 2016a ).This bibliography, available on the website of the study ( www.sentinelles-climat.org), shows that climate change is a pressure that affects the structure and dynamicsof ecosystem functioning through a wide range of effects that can be classiﬁedaccording to their nature and characteristics: direct, indirect, induced and temporary,permanent and cumulative (Fig. 3):– Direct effects are the major ones directly related to climate change that unequiv-ocally inﬂuence key ecosystem processes,– Indirect effects come from the retro-action combination of direct effects, whichtend to increase them at different spatial-temporal scales,– Induced effects are derived from anthropic responses that are related to the mea-sures put in place related to political decisions,– Cumulative effects include in summary the interaction of direct, indirect andinduced effects. Other anthropogenic factors will synergize positively or nega-tively with climate change and increase pressure on species survival (Kremen andOstfeld 2005 ).Climate Sentinel SpeciesFollowing the bibliographic synthesis, it was necessary to deﬁne study areas to iden-tify indicator species. These different geographical areas have varying intensities ofclimate change (GIEC 2013 ). They contain species with different sensitivities to thepressure of climate change (Bertin 2008 ;L ie ta l . 2013 ). In France, New Aquitaineregion is an open-air study laboratory in the sense that it is both particularly sensitiveto climate change, with contrasting local climatic zones and a wide variety of naturalecosystems (Le Treut 2013 ; Mallard 2016a ).Rare species are not only those that are the most sensitive to climate change. Thecommon species of a taxa, because of its speciﬁc variability, are also sensitive to thisevolution (Pearman et al. 2011 ). The state of the art of knowledge (Mallard 2016a ),deﬁned criteria and a large empirical database of ﬂora atlas productions (atlas online:ofsa.fr ) and fauna in Aquitaine (atlas online: si-faune.oafs.fr ) (Berroneau 2015 ; Ruysand Couzi 2015 ; Gourvil et al. 2016 ), indicator species and groups of species havebeen developed for 5 types of climate-sensitive ecosystems (Fig. 4): dunes, dry, wet,forest and mountain.From this territory, in summary below, 20 indicators of climate change in thedifferent ecosystems were chosen. The evolution of ﬂoristic process indicatorswill be followed for each of these natural environments. Within these ecosystems,the following animal species are studied: insects (Lepidoptera, Odonata, bumble-Climate Sentinels Research Program: Developing Indicators … 231Fig. 3 Effects of climate change on the components of ecosystem (adapted from Mallard 2016a ). Climate change is a pressure that affects the structure anddynamics of ecosystem functioning through a wide range of effects that can be classiﬁed according to their nature and characteristics: direct, indir ect, induced;temporary, permanent; cumulative. According to the bibliography, animal and plant species can be classiﬁed according to their sensitivity to clima te change:exposed, vulnerable, extinction232 F. Mallard and L.

The originality of this program liesin the monitoring of multi-ecosystems, multi-species over time and at the 84,000 km2scale of the region. This last part describes the modelling process implemented whichis part of the program, according to French geographer Roger Brunet: we mustgo through a model to understand and be understood (Brunet 2000 ). Based on theexploitation of bibliographic data and speciﬁc collected data within the frameworkof the program, the modelling objective is to evaluate the forecast responses of thesentinel species.Modelling does not start with computer model, it starts as a schematization. Amodel is a simpliﬁed representation of a reality. To be relevant, the ﬁrst step is tounderstand and justify its incoming and outgoing. Thus, a very ﬂexible model with-out ecological justiﬁcation will give biased predictions and signiﬁcant uncertainties(Araújo and Peterson 2012 ; Bell and Schlaepfer 2016 ).In order to visualize what we had to consider as factors, and the answers weexpected from the model, we give a reﬂection scheme which summarizes it (Fig. 5).Naturalistic Data from Regional ObservatoriesIn order to study the effects of climate change on biodiversity at the regional scale,the collection of information in the ﬁeld requires many observations to obtain sig-niﬁcant results. The regional observatories are tools allowing access to a mass ofnaturalistic observations validated and distributed throughout the territory (Bœufet al. 2012 ). In New Aquitaine, two mechanisms aim to collect, manage, validateand disseminate all the information on biodiversity produced by data producers andparticularly the technical partners. The Wildlife Information System (SI Faune) has8 thousand data and the Observatory of Plant Biodiversity (OBV) of New Aquitaine3 million data. These atlas biodiversity data can be processed in the form of speciespresence. The observation effort is heterogeneous in the territory and does not allowa relevant analysis of presence and absence of species. This type of data can still beused in the scientiﬁc literature. For example, Brotons et al. ( 2004 ) used bird atlasdata in Catalonia. According to the authors, presence and absence of species data234 F. Mallard and L.

In order to study the effects of climate change on biodiversity at the regional scale, theobservation in the ﬁeld requires sufﬁcient data in order to obtain relevant results. Regional observatories are tools to access a mass of naturalisti c observations,validated and distributed throughout the territory. However, these data allow us to access mainly the presence data. The data come from naturalistic observationprotocols not yet standardized protocol. At this scale the Météo-France data are used. The abundance data of individuals contain a wealth of importan t analysis.The combination of this second type of complementary data with that of the presence data ones enriches and validates the models. These data require, in allcases, protocolized monitoring of natural populations in the ﬁeld. To be linked to climate change, the monitoring of sentinel species is supplemente db ys p o tmonitoring of temperature and humidity at each site through a weather station. Ecophysiology can contribute to a global vision of the impacts of clima te changeon organisms, ecosystems and their evolutionary responses. Species and their life stages have different thermal ranges reﬂecting specialization i n temperatureregimes, habitat and lifestyle characteristics. Their temperature limits can be modiﬁed by acclimation or evolutionary adaptation to speciﬁc limi ts. Thermalprobes are used to mimic the thermal and hydric properties of organisms. The type of climate model adapted to the program is the MDS (Species Distributi onModel) integrating all biological, climatic, historical and recent indicators, as well as the scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate C hange (IPCC)Climate Sentinels Research Program: Developing Indicators … 235allow projections by generalized linear models (GLM) more accurate than ecologicalniche factor analysis (ENFA) using only presence data. Species with less stringentecological requirements are modelled with less precision than species with lowerrequirements. Models for large and tolerant species are more sensitive to absencedata, suggesting that presence/absence methods may be particularly important inpredicting distributions of this species type. It is more difﬁcult to accurately projectindependent generalist species distributions with the method used (Brotons et al.2004 ). In the program, we selected small species, mostly specialists. The presencedata are then sufﬁcient for predicting the evolution of these sentinel climate speciesin the face of climate change.Protocoled Monitoring DataThe abundance data of individuals and the relative proportions of species allow awealth of analysis. The combination of this type of complementary data with speciesincidence or presence-absence data enriches and validates models and the levels ofuncertainty for analysing the effects of global changes on biodiversity. Incidenceor presence-absence data from species are easier to obtain than abundance datafrom individuals and relative proportions of species related to number of individu-als observed (Howard et al. 2014 ). These last data require, in all cases, protocoledmonitoring of natural populations in the ﬁeld. Long-term monitoring of natural pop-ulations is generally considered as essential. Direct observations should be madeover periods of several decades (Bertin 2008 ). The implementation of protocols formonitoring climate and biological indicators standardized and adapted to the prob-lem of climate change is necessary. As part of this project, monitoring protocols forclimate and biological indicators were deﬁned in 2016 (Mallard 2016b ).For each fauna or ﬂora indicator, the sampling plan deﬁnes the criteria for theassociated study sites. A working hypothesis for the selection of study sites is torely on a state of conservation of sites limiting, as much as possible, the inﬂuenceof anthropogenic factors other than climate change, which may often have a greaterimpact on local biodiversity. In this study, the selection of the sites is thus based ona reference of a state of conservation described as “good”.In a climatic region, the climate varies from place to place; local microclimateschange according to altitude and latitude. The climatic conditions are peculiar andresult from topography and vegetal cover. The combined action of climatic fac-tors, and especially the temperature-humidity pair, directly affects the distribution ofplant and animal species and the development of their populations. Monitoring sen-tinel species is therefore complemented by spot measurements of temperature andhumidity at each site. These two factors are the most representative and most easilymeasurable climatic conditions of populations at this local scale (Mallard 2016b ).A ﬁrst ﬁeld campaign in 2016 allowed the installation of equipment and the testingof protocols. The protocols validated in 2016 are based on methods recognized atnational level. Depending on the indicators of the different dune, dry, wet, forested,236 F. Mallard and L. Couderchetmountainous environments, the number of monitored sites ranges from 5 to 80. Floramonitoring is carried out once a year per site in 2017 and renewed for 3–6 years.Wildlife indicators are measured annually during the duration of the program with2–9 surveys per year and per site (Mallard 2016b ).Ecophysiology can contribute to a global vision of the impacts of climatechange on organisms, ecosystems and their evolutionary responses (Bozinovic andPörtner 2015 ). In this program, the ecophysiological responses of individuals arestudied using experimental ﬁeld devices such as probes and thermocouples placedin biomimetic models to imitate the thermal and hydric properties of organisms(Sinervo et al. 2010 ).Projection ModellingIn order to establish an overall analysis of all the data collected, we have identiﬁedand analysed existing models on climate change and biodiversity. The method ofanalysis is the same as the one of the state of the art of the effects of climate changeon the different groups of species (Mallard 2016a ).Over the past 20 years, studies on modelling of species distribution and climatechange have been very numerous. We have listed and described the computer modelsused “impact factor” review papers to determine the relevant model(s) for the chosenindicators of the program. We have identiﬁed potential gaps in current models andresearch pathways to obtain predictive maps of species distributions. The models areclassiﬁed in 4 main categories, from the simplest, like GLM—Generalized LinearModel, to the most complex ones, like Random Forest (RF) or ANN—ArtiﬁcialNeural Networks (Mallard 2017 ). The models are used alone or in combination,their results being mostly improved when combined (Leathwick et al. 2006 ; Watlinget al. 2015 ). In practice, a frequently used model is the Species Models Distribution(SDM). Its approach is ﬂexible and allows to integrate a large number of factorssuch as fragmentation, dispersion or altitude but also climate scenarios. SDM canbe based on three different types of models (empirical, analytical or mathematical,mechanistic) (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000 ). According to some authors, it is quiteaccurate and gets good results when compared with other models. However, it alsohas limitations and has been controversial in some studies.The uncertainty of the model can result from the initial hypotheses (Dormannet al. 2008 ). If the questions asked of the models are not sufﬁciently deﬁned, theresults will be biased and will not be acceptable (Elith and Leathwick 2009 ). Simpli-ﬁed model boundaries describe complex processes, such as models describing futureclimate conditions or algorithms describing species-environment relationships. Thealgorithm remains the most important source of uncertainty. The result of the mod-elling must be interpreted carefully. Models are limited by lack of data, inaccuratedata, or missing data (Dormann et al. 2008 ). In Climate sentinels program, the dataused for modelling is largely derived from established protocols, which minimizesprediction errors. Failure to take certain factors into account may inﬂuence modelClimate Sentinels Research Program: Developing Indicators … 237results such as altitude (Oke and Thompson 2015 ), dispersal (Gonçalves et al. 2016 )or biotic factors (Singer et al. 2016 ). A small number of factors will not yield solidresults. With too many factors, the model becomes too heavy to run. The predictivemaps are then biased and the results no longer make it possible to isolate the climatechange factor. This state of affairs has been taken into account in our reﬂection andintegrated into the models applied to the program the essential factors (biological,climatic, spatial or even anthropogenic) in order to obtain reliable and robust resultsallowing to observe the modiﬁcations related speciﬁcally to the climate change. Thenumber of factors can also be a barrier to the transferability of the models developedin the program. From one territory to another, even very similar, the factors differ andthe results too (Duque-Lazo et al. 2016 ). The use of direct factors/resources makesthe model more generalizable and transferable. In regard to the different scales andvaried territories present in the program, it is highly probable that for each indicatorthe model must be adapted according to the scale, the environment, and the climaticconditions. That is to say that during the data campaign and associated modelling,algorithms have to be adapted to become more efﬁcient according to the species andthe spaces concerned. Scale and time transferability is not the only difﬁculty encoun-tered when transposing a model from one territory to another, extrapolation is also asource of error, especially when models must predict future conditions, particularlybecause landscapes futures will likely include climate data that will not be similar.Models that are too complex can lead to biased predictions during extrapolation. Asa result, predictions can be biased and become useless for guiding decision-makingas part of environmental management measures (Bell and Schlaepfer 2016 ). Allof these criticisms are indispensable in the improvement of the model. Naturalists,researchers in the same project can propose improvements, model adjustments tominimize biases.Even though the SDM is sometimes controversial (Heikkinen et al. 2007 ;G u oet al. 2015 ), its remains an option in a modelling approach in the context of speciesmobility linked to climate change. This model has shown its robustness in predictions(Bell and Schlaepfer 2016 ). The main criticism was to give biased results when nottaking into account a factor or because of an inappropriate use without thinkingdeﬁned beforehand (Oke and Thompson 2015 ; Gonçalves et al. 2016 ; Singer et al.2016 ). Nevertheless, over the years, the addition of different factors by the researchershas signiﬁcantly improved its performance (Bell and Schlaepfer 2016 ).The SDM integrates all sentinel biological indicators, climate, historical andrecent data, as well as scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC). The RCP (Representation Concentration Pathways) scenarios consideredin the program are RCPs 4.5 and 6 which gives a stabilization of greenhouse gasemissions and the RCP 8.5 which remains the most pessimistic scenario and doesnot provide any reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, rather an increase inthem (GIEC 2013 ). Not taking into account these scenarios would distort our futurepredictive maps. Predictive performance and model correlation are evaluated by sta-tistical measures. AUC—Area Under Curve—and TSS—True skill statistic, calledalso Hanssen Kuipers discriminant, allow to test the predictive performance of the238 F. Mallard and L. Couderchetmodel in terms of presence/absence of species (Watling et al. 2015 ; Phillips-Maoet al. 2016 ).ConclusionBecause of its rapidity and intensity, current climate change is a major (direct orindirect) pressure on biodiversity. The Climate sentinels program contributes andoffers an innovative global approach in applied ecology, based on a strong scientiﬁcbase, to understand the interactions between climate variations and the biodiversityresponses. Ongoing work is being done on a regional scale relevant to the imple-mentation of conservation measures: New Aquitaine, west of France. This work isbased to clarify short and long-term impacts, negative or positive inﬂuence levels,direct, indirect and induced effects on fauna and ﬂora species in various ecosystems.The emergence of sub-branches of ecology related to human activities is relativelyrecent. The concept of “ecology of climate change” does not exist to our knowledgeyet. The study establishing the ecology of climate change is thus rooted in a multi-disciplinary approach, at the interface between ecology, climatology and geography,at the interface between research and naturalistic expertise.Twenty biological monitoring indicators, known as climate sentinels, have beenselected and developed from species or groups of species that are among the mostsensitive to climate change, and are easy to follow to ensure work at the level ofNew Aquitaine. This research ﬁeld is essential to feed data and to use projectionmodels. This requires consistency efforts to set up shared methods, repositories toaddress, and complete or continue ongoing research. With all the various partners ofthe program, scientiﬁcally standardized climate and biological monitoring materialsand protocols were set up, tested and validated in 2016, the ﬁrst campaign beingdone in 2017.The diversity of 5 lowland environments, from littoral to mountain environmentsare considered on more than two hundred sites which will be followed till 2021.These data are the basis of the projections of future impacts of climate change onbiodiversity. The data will feed the transfer of information to stakeholders, drivingforces, which is necessary for the development of conservation strategies and thepromotion of informed and voluntary environmental policies. The awareness of theactors will be all the more important and accepted that the method and results ofresearch are widely disseminated. Mediation tools are developed and adapted totargeted audiences to disseminate and make available bibliographies, means, methodsand results of the program.Acknowledgements We thank the European Union, the region of New Aquitaine, the Departmentof Gironde and Pyrénées-Atlantiques for their support and the funding of the program.

With climate change, species require disper-sal skills to follow displacements of their suitable climates and therefore, spatialconservation interventions need to consider such dynamics. In general, commonplanning frameworks identify networks of conservation areas seemed important forspecies range shifts. However, it is highly unlikely that all the areas in a networkpresent synchronous conservation value. Furthermore, given the continuous (spatialand temporal autocorrelated) nature of threats and ecological processes, the valueof each area is largely dependent on the state of the neighboring areas in the recentpast. In this study, a family of three models centered on the prioritization (not ofsingle areas but) of temporal chains of areas as conservation units is presented.These models drive the use of ﬁnancial investments through time in order to maxi-mize the persistence of biodiversity in dynamic environments. Alike the most typicalapproaches, the here introduced models allow investments to be transferred betweenareas losing conservation relevancy to the areas that gain relevancy. A ﬁctitious (butplausible) conservation plan for ten mammal species in Iberian Peninsula up to 2080is used to illustrate the setting-up and outputs of the models. Results evidence thatthe conservation effectiveness achieved in each model depends on singular spatio-temporal distribution relationships among species and between species and distinctland-uses. Planners should then investigate the sensitivity of their goals to distinctdecision-support tools even when driven by similar designs and constraints.D.

CerdeiraIntroductionBiodiversity conservation typically runs under constrained budgets and with overar-ching aspirations. At present time, growing impacts of anthropogenic activities onhabitats and species have been attested (V enter et al. 2016 ). These make protectedareas (PA) attractive instruments to counteract these negative effects. Planned to setaside biodiversity from local impingent stressors, the typical way PA are established(as territories of perpetual protection) is not ingenious enough to counter the effectsof pervasive and dynamic threats, as the ones typically arising from climate change(Hannah and Salm 2003 ). Under this context, novel-informed decisions are requiredin order to make long-term conservation (characterized by complex, non-linear pro-cesses) effective. A paradigm shift is needed in order to align PA establishment withthe dynamics of climate such that biodiversity responses are anticipated and inte-grated within conservation models (Araújo et al. 2011a ; Scott and Lemieux 2005 ;Dodd et al. 2010 ).As the spatial patterns of climate change with time, species rearrange their dis-tributional ranges in order to keep track of their suitable climatic conditions (Garciaet al. 2014 ). Species that were adequately represented in PA may lose protection.Species that were once poorly covered in PA may gain protection. New species, oncenot part of a given region, may appear while other species may leave (Araújo et al.2004 ). Under such a melting pot of responses, planners need to control out whichspecies need to be represented and to what levels those representations should bemaintained into the future within PA, to make them persist.In the last two decades several PA selection models have been proposed. Broadly,these models followed two general Operations Research problems (Williams andReV elle 1997 ): the minimum set cover and the maximal coverage. In the minimumset cover ( minCost ), PA are identiﬁed in order to cover a given representation levelof each biodiversity feature in the minimum area (or with the minimum ﬁnancialinvestment). In the maximal coverage model ( maxCoverage ), PA selection is madeto maximize the number of biodiversity features adequately represented, with a ﬁxedbudget to spend on area protection (see Table 1for a comprehensive characterizationof these models). These models have mostly been used with a static overview onbiodiversity distribution and conservation area cost, thus retrieving PA maps unlikelyto counter-back the negative consequences of climate change. A smaller number ofstudies used these same problems integrating time-varying biodiversity distributionsin decisions protocols (for a review see, Alagador et al. 2016 ). Capable to deliversolutions for PA establishment with regard to climate change effects on species, theproblems formulated therein were not dedicatedly developed, nor are fully optimized,to handle environmental dynamics. For example, solution maps built to anticipateclimate change effects over several decades into the future, do not give informationon the timing each spatial conservation unit is likely to gain (or to lose) relevancy toenter into (or to be released from) an effective PA network. Also, because solutionmaps do not present a time-component, it is not possible to identify a conservationunit that may functionally replace a given highly disturbed conservation unit.Introducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 245Ta b l e 1 The minimum set cover and the maximal covering problems for PA selectionMinimum set cover ( minCost )Maximal covering(maxCoverage )Objective Minimize total solutionarea/costMaximize total number ofspecies adequately represented(i.e. over a predeﬁned target)Constraints Each feature is representedover a predeﬁned target (e.g.range area, number ofpopulations, number ofindividuals, number of alleles,etc.)A ﬁxed budget limiting thearea to selectData needed For each spatial conservation unit data on features (e.g.occurrence, number of populations, number of individuals,presence of alleles, etc.) and on conservation costsThis paper introduces a new viewpoint on conservation units when consideringclimate-change-concerned area selection models. Differently to the typical spatialprioritization frameworks, the study here presented optimizes the use of ﬁnancialresources in a dynamic manner, allowing the investments made in areas that loseconservation relevancy as climate changes to be reallocated to areas that present thelargest cost-effectiveness for most of the concerned species. Speciﬁcally, the paperadjusts area selection models settled around the minCost andmaxCoverage modelsto enable climate change effects to be addressed in conservation plans. A third areaselection model that complements the two previous ones is also introduced. Differ-ences among PA solutions retrieved by these three climate-change-concerned areaselection models are discussed using a plausible conservation plan for ten mammalspecies in Iberian Peninsula up to 2080 as an illustrative example.A New Conservation Unit: The Climate-Change ConcernedConservation CorridorWhile typical conservation decisions are framed around spatial units of land, whentime comes into play as a new dimension on which conservation decisions have tobe made, spatio-temporal conservation units gain relevancy. If a conservation plan isto be implemented, and distribution data exist { ot0s,j,ot1s,j,…,otNs,j} for each species sofas e t Sof species among every spatial unit j(i.e. grid cell) of a map Jfor a sequenceof periods of time { t0,t1,…,tN}, a climate change concerned conservation corridor(spatio-temporal corridor; herein, st-corridor to simplify) is a set of Nspatial units,one unit deﬁned for each period of time, on which the persistence of a species isevaluated.246 D. Alagador and J. O. CerdeiraFig. 1 Schematic representation of st-corridors. In apersistence scores are associated to three st-corridors ( c1,c2andc3) using data on probability of occurrence ( o..) and probability of successfuldispersal ( d..). In bthe evaluation of a non-independent set of corridors is illustrated. The st-corridorsc1andc2usej3att1andc2andc3usej3att2. These are therefore non-independent. Contrarily,although made by the spatial unit, j3,c1and c3use it at different periods of time periods andare therefore independent. The maximum persistence additively associated to all possible stable(independent) sets of st-corridors measures the persistence of a species sin the ﬁnal solutionIn accordance to probability theory, the probability of an entity to persist withina system evaluated at discrete-times (assuming independence) is the product of theprobabilities of the entity to occur in each period of time with the probabilities ofthe entity to pass from one time to another. With otisjas the probability of a species sto occur in spatial unit jat time ti(data typically retrieved through habitat suitabilitymodels, Araújo and Guisan 2006 ), then the probability of a species to persist in ast-corridor, cmade by { j0,j1,…,jN}i s :Pc(s)/equal1ot0s,j0×dt0,t1s,j0,j1×···× dtN−1,tNs,jN−1,jN×otNs,jN(1)where dtn,tn+1s,jn,jn+1is the probability of a species sto successfully disperse from jntojn+1at[tn;tn+1] time-interval. Given that species-speciﬁc dispersal rates are highly variablein space, accurate data are hardly available to be used at speciﬁc contexts for severalspecies. Dispersal kernels are therefore used as general models to infer how dispersalsuccess varies with dispersal distance. In general, the largest the dispersal distancethe lowest the probability of success. In limit, if a species does not disperse thendtn,tn+1s,j,i/equal10, for j/negationslash/equal1ianddtn,tn+1s,j,j/equal11. For distances larger than the distance a speciesis able to disperse in a given time-period, dmax s, (i.e. dist (jn,jn+1)>dmax s), thendtn,tn+1s,jn,jn+1/equal10. An illustrative example on how persistence scores are evaluated isoutlined in Fig. 1a.Introducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 247The selection of PA supporting the persistence of species along time (from t0totN), passes by the identiﬁcation of a given number of st-corridors for each of thespecies. However, in order to be fully effective, the st-corridors identiﬁed for eachspecies should form a stable set in the sense that, no two corridors may use the samespatial unit in the same time-period (Fig. 1b exempliﬁes the evaluation of total speciespersistence in a non-stable set of st-corridors). In this way negative contagious effectsthat may occur in each spatial-unit in a certain period of time are not spread into otherst-corridors, thus promoting redundancy in the set of st-corridors of each species.With st-corridors, the effect of a disturbance acting in a speciﬁc location andtiming may be measured in every other spatial units and time periods (see Fig. 2,f o ran illustration of a portfolio of disturbing factors acting at distinct spatial units andtime-periods).Persistence as Conservation T argetsThe ultimate goal of conservation is to promote the persistence of biodiversity fea-tures at long-term. However, the evaluation of persistence is hardly made anticipa-tively, as by nature implies time to collect and analyze data. Therefore, several generalrules have been used to estimate persistence and therefore to deﬁne conservation tar-gets in area selection models. For example, amount area, number of species, numberof populations and allele frequency within PA have been considered as targets toachieve in ﬁnal solutions (Neel and Cummings 2003 ; Pressey et al. 2003 ). In areaselection models, like the ones here introduced, the estimation of persistence maybe upgraded adding the temporal dimension, as mentioned in Eq. 1(Alagador andCerdeira 2017 ). In the following section, the difﬁculties associated with the deﬁnitionof persistence targets will be discussed and proposal for their deﬁnition made.Area Scheduling Models: Area Selection Through TimeSettled as conservation units, st-corridors may be used with distinct area selectionmodels developed to handle the spatially-dynamic impacts of climate change imping-ing biodiversity. Instead of spatial units, these climate change concerned models oper-ate with the evaluation and selection of st-corridors for maximizing (or minimizing)some beneﬁt (or cost) function.A proximate version of the minCost model may be built using st-corridors asselection units ( K-minCostst). Like minCost , the objective in K-minCoststis theidentiﬁcation of a solution of minimum cost (but now made by st-corridors) in whichthe established persistence targets are fulﬁlled. There is, however, a detail that needsto be highlighted when quantifying solution cost using st-corridors instead of spatialunits. Unlike the static models, for which solution cost is made by adding up the costsassociated with the selected spatial units, solution cost in st-corridor-based models248 D. Alagador and J. O. CerdeiraFig. 2 The multiple effects of disturbing factors over the persistence of a species in st-corridors.arepresents the persistence of a species in a st-corridor within a referential landscape; band cthe effect of a disturbance at the local level, changing species suitability in time t0or time t2,respectively; dand ethe effect of a disturbance on the dispersal capacity of a species, either actingin the [ t0;t1]o ri nt h e[ t1;t2] time intervals, respectivelyare not additively taken from the costs of the selected st-corridors. Instead, when asolution is made by st-corridors using the same spatial unit for the same time-period,the cost associated with the use of that conﬂuence area is only counted once. Thismakes unnecessary the estimation of cost for each st-corridors, given that, in thesemodels, the cost is evaluated at the level of the spatial unit.Driven by persistence targets, the here introduced models are highly exposed tounfeasibility (i.e. no solution exists attaining all the established requisites). Given thatpersistence targets have not a clear direct relationship with a spatial explicit index,if they are established too high (even if for a single species) no feasible solutionmay exist (Alagador and Cerdeira 2017 ). A new parameter K, deﬁning the minimumIntroducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 249number of species that need have their targets fulﬁlled in ﬁnal solutions, may thusallow the problem to be relaxed, and the “faulty species” to be identiﬁed.Similarly, the maxCoverage model may be easily transformed in order to accom-modate climate change concerns into conservation planning ( B-maxCoveragest). LikemaxCoverage , in this st-corridor-based version, the objective is to maximize the num-ber of species with targets fulﬁlled when the budget ( B) for area selection across timeis limited. In this problem, the use of budget may be established in two modes: (a)a unique budget to be wasted along the analyzed horizon of time, or (b) a stricterversion, in which budgets are deﬁned (and used) in each time-period of analysis.As with their static analogs, the K-minCoststand the B-maxCoveragestmodelspresent a kind of dual relationship. That is, being mCK, the cost of an optimal solutionofK-minCostst, making B/equal1mCKthe objective value of B-maxCoveragestisK.T h echoice of the model to run thus depends largely on the speciﬁc question plannersneed to answer and also on complex issues associated with problem-solving. Thebalance between the number of species in analysis and the number of spatial unitsacross time determines the time needed to get a full optimal solution. In the mostcases, spatial units largely overweight number of species making solutions for theK-minCoststeasier to get.In the above models, if ﬁnal solutions only partially achieve the target for aspecies, no beneﬁt value is accounted at all for that species. That is the beneﬁt thatthe st-corridors in ﬁnal solution provide to species is measured with an all-or-nothingfunction. To avoid this lack of evaluation, a model may be built accounting for anyinvestment made for a species, even if it does not sufﬁce to fully achieve the target.In the model— BK-minShortfallst—the objective is to minimize the sum of target-shortfalls among species, within the selected st-corridors using the budget B, andsuch that at least Kspecies have their targets fulﬁlled.Given the large number of viable st-corridors that may be deﬁned for each species(depending on the number of spatial units where species occurs in t0and on thespecies dispersal ability) a pool of st-corridors presenting the largest persistencescores may be used to limit the range of variables and therefore to reduce problemsize.An Illustrative ExampleThe Iberian Peninsula is a biodiversity-rich region with a large area under a Mediter-ranean climate regime. Bordered by the Atlantic at the southern, western and northernmargins and by the Pyrenees at the eastern margin, is a region in which the largeexpected climate change will have tremendous impacts on biodiversity. Moreover,given the pervasiveness of human land-use (dominated by agriculture, forestry, cattle-raising and urban sprawl), species range shifts within the region are highly restrained.To illustrate the outputs from the climate change concerned area selection models,a set of ten mammal species listed in the Portuguese and Spanish red-lists, are used.Data on the predicted climatic suitability of each species, s, from present time to250 D. Alagador and J. O. Cerdeira2080, tN,(otNs,J) were obtained for all the region, J, using bioclimatic models, whichstatistically relate a series of climatic predictors with species occurrence data to inferthe favored climatic conditions for a species to occur (Araújo and Guisan 2006 ). Themodels were then projected into the future, using data on future climate tendenciesaveraged across 30 yr. time-periods, centered in 2020, 2050 and 2080 (and assuminga plausible, extreme green-gas-house emission scenario, A1FI, IPCC, 2007 ). Datawere obtained for 10 km ×10 km spatial units spanning the region (for a detaileddescription of the modelling protocol see, Araújo et al. 2011a ). Species’ suitabilitydata for present-time was ﬁltered such that the spatial units where species were notrecorded were considered unsuitable, therefore reducing commission errors. Dis-persal data for each species was obtained assuming a dispersal kernel that relatesthe probability of successful dispersal from a source, jn−1to a target point, jn(in30 yr time) with the geographic distance between those points dist(jn−1,jn) and themaximum dispersal distance a species presents for that time-interval ( dmax s):dtn−1,tns,jn−1,jn/equal1exp−αs.dist(jn−1,jn)/dmax s(2)where αsis a species speciﬁc parameter. On the absence of accurate speciﬁc data forthe species in analysis the same value, αs/equal12.9957, was settled for all the species.For the prescription of species persistence targets, climate (and land-use) of futuretime-periods were considered as replicates of present-time climate and land-use (i.e.no-change scenario). The 500 st-corridors presenting the largest persistence scoresfor each species were selected and the BK-minShortfallstwas run using B/equal1∞(i.e. a large number), K/equal10, and with (transient) targets for the ten species set to ∞(i.e. a large number). Because in this analysis, an inﬁnite Bdoes not limit the ﬁnalsolution, the cost to conserve each spatial unit was arbitrarily settled to one (for alltime-periods).The values maxPerssobtained from the analysis above were then rescaled, such thepersistence targets to be deﬁned ( tgs) reﬂect the perceived importance of conservationfor species.

For each spatial unit, j, in each time-period, t, the fraction coverwith agriculture ( ft,agrj ), pasture ( ft,pastj ), forests ( ft,fo rj ) and urban lands ( ft,urbj )was measured and the cost to use each spatial unit in a given time period (Alagadorand Cerdeira 2018 ) settle as:costtj/equal11+ft,agrj +ft,pastj +ft,fo rj +ft,urbj (4)The K-minCoststmodel was run using K∈{1, 2, …, 10}.

With the less demanding scenario, all the ten species achievedtheir targets. Solution cost varied exponentially as Kincreased, but this increase wasmore pronounced with the most demanding target setting. For K/equal16, the solution costin this scenario was four times larger than the cost obtained with the less demandingtargets. The patterns obtained with the K-minCoststmodel translated into the B-maxCoveragestas a step function, in which the gain of attaining a new target-ﬁlledspecies was much costlier after the targets of several other species have been fulﬁlled.The BK-minShortfallstresults showed that with the lowest budgets, B, andforK∈{0, 1, 2} the less demanding target setting generated solution with largerrelative target-shortfalls when compared with the more demanding target solutions.However, for K∈{5, 6} (under the same B) the less demanding target settinggenerated solutions with smaller target-shortfalls. Also, increases in Kdid notgenerate loss of solution effectiveness.Introducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 253Fig. 4 Shortfall to persistence targets (as a percentage of targets) obtained for each species in solu-tions of varying cost (budget) using: aK-minCostst,bB-maxCoveragest,a n d cBK-minShortfallstmodels.

The accrue of target-ﬁlled species in K-minCoststfollowed asequential-cumulative pattern with Ocu, Asa, Fsy, Clu, Mca andCpy being added tothe set of target-ﬁlled species respectively. This nested pattern of target-ﬁlled specieswas not reproduced in the B-maxCoveragest.

Here,the six K-minCoststsolutions presented higher stability when compared with thesolutions retrieved by the two other models (Fig. 5). The 54 solutions obtained withB-maxCoveragestdelivered a homogeneous map of number of species beneﬁtingfrom the selection of spatial units with time. Finally, BK-minShortfallstsolutionspresented a large variation in the species favored by the prioritized areas. Most ofthe spatial units supported two to three species, but in some regions (NW and NEof Iberian Peninsula) spatial units contributed for the conservation of six to sevenspecies within all the time-periods assessed.DiscussionThis study introduces a novel concept in conservation planning (the climate changeconcerned conservation corridor, st-corridor) that deﬁnes a ﬂexible conservation unitto be used when the effects of dynamic processes over multiple species (as the onesgenerated from climate change) need to be anticipated. Using st-corridors as conser-vation units in distinct area selection models, planners are able to deﬁne a schedulefor the uptake (or release) of areas to (from) the side of conservation. When a spatialunit is expected to lose conservation value to other spatial unit(s), it may be releasedfrom conservation focus and the investments here saved are transferred to spatialunits predicted to retrieve larger conservation beneﬁts. In this way, PA selectionsurpasses the typical greedy protocols, under which areas are accumulated as timepasses, and is converted to a ﬂexible framework that still needs to accommodate tothe impacts of the most pervasive socio-economic activities, but that requires lessarea to retrieve the same or even larger conservation beneﬁts (Fuller et al. 2010 ).With the time dimension at play, the most natural way to evaluate the effectivenessof st-corridors is through a quantitative evaluation of species persistence reﬂectingthe vulnerability of species to climate change (or other threats under analysis) andthat, depending on data availability and spatial scale, may present distinct structures(Williams et al. 2008 ). The biogeographical scale of the study-case here used, per-Introducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 255Fig. 5 The mean number of species protected by each spatial unit in each time period obtainedamong several solutions made by varying KandB,i n aK-minCostst,bB-maxCoveragest,a n d cBK-minShortfallstmodels using the most demanding persistence targets. Histograms represent thenumber of spatial units protecting, in average, a given number of species for solutions generatedwith: dK-minCostst,eB-maxCoveragest,a n d fBK-minShortfallstmodelsmitted species persistence scores to be assessed using broad-scale evaluations ofclimate suitability (i.e. exposure level) and species dispersal abilities (i.e. speciessensitivity) through time. From the side of exposure, the effects of micro-habitatsand topographic buffering may be integrated for a measure of climate suitability(Potter et al. 2013 ; Lenoir et al. 2017 ). The synergistic effects of climate with otherfactors may also be important to be evaluated. For example, the effects of new occur-ring species, of excluded species and new species interrelationships (Araújo et al.2011b ), and the occurrence of new threats (like new uses of land) may be integratedinto this local suitability score. From the side of sensitivity, genetic, phylogeneticand behavioral plasticity are factors that leverage species’ adaptive capacity at thelocal scale (Shoo et al. 2013 ). Besides dispersal, other sensitivity indicators as lifehistory traits (e.g. reproductive rates, life-span, metabolic rates), population dynam-ics (extinct-colonization events under a meta-population structure) and abundancedata may also aid to get a more integrative picture of the likely species persistencewithin the analyzed spatio-temporal system (Hampe and Petit 2005 ). By acting antic-ipatively to the effects of climate change over time, the here proposed framework islargely dependent on predictive tools that naturally incorporate uncertainties. Someuncertainties may be quantiﬁed and controlled within the ﬁnal solutions such thatrobust assessments are made. Measures on the effects of assuming distinct climate256 D. Alagador and J. O. Cerdeirascenarios, distinct bioclimatic model types (Araújo and New 2007 ) and on the likelyvariability of spatial unit cost (Salomon et al. 2013 ) may allow an uncertainty layerto be produced. By merging uncertainty and cost, ﬁnal solutions will tend to givehigher priority to the less costly spatial units with the more stable estimations onlocal suitability (Lemes and Loyola 2013 ).While ﬂexible to be used in some particular cases, the models here presented sufferfrom general caveats. As stated above, although in theory the models here presentedmay incorporate a portfolio of threats acting at the local suitability and dispersalcapabilities of species, the models are mostly appropriate to handle climate change.The st-corridors selected are areas that should be given full consideration as pathwaysenabling species natural adaptation through time. Given that the states of areas (forthe different species) are not dependent on the history of previous decisions (andinterventions) either locally on in neighboring areas, testing the effect of changingland-use practices in order to mitigate threats for single or various species should becarried out using pure dynamic implementations of area prioritization models. Giventhat these effects are stochastic by nature, a large number of potential system statesneeds to be evaluated which implies greater complexity and new quality-heuristicmethods to be developed (Sheldon et al. 2010 ).In the models here described, there is the possibility to save investments withreallocation of ﬁnancial efforts from the areas that lose conservation effectivenesstowards the areas whose cost-effectiveness compensate such losses. In practice,more than a redirection of investments, real-world land-markets allow new ﬁnancialresources to be generated from the released areas. Interest rates, selling or rentingcontracts may provide new proﬁts for conservation agencies. With the anticipativemodels here introduced these imbricate economic details may be approximated inadvance by informing the cost of intervene in spatial units with possible ﬁnancialrevenues associated to the release of area from conservation focus.Identically to the example here presented, it is very likely that, faced with the sameeffectiveness requirements (i.e. Kvalues) and with the same ﬁnancial resources toinvest in conservation ( Bvalues), planners will be confronted with distinct solutionswhen using different area selection models. Importantly, planners need to state theirgoals clearly; to formulate an adequate optimization protocol (using either a mini-mum cost or maximum beneﬁt scheme), and to test the sensitivity of their models toparameter variability. This is a process that goes well beyond a few maps of priorityareas. Ideally, it should involve a wide array of stakeholders such that intangiblevariables are considered (Knight et al. 2010 ). The models here introduced are notprescriptive and may be adopted as support tools to optimally anticipate the wide-ranging effects of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.Conclusions and Future ProspectsThis study introduces the st-corridor as a new conservation unit that has relevancyin anticipative conservation plans, as it allows to ﬁnd well delimited pathways ofspecies persistence into the future while also identifying the timing spatial units gainIntroducing Spatio-Temporal Conservation Units: Models … 257relevancy to support species range adaptations as a response to changing climates.These conservation units may be integrated in distinct assignment problems runningwith distinct goals and constraints and, therefore, have potential to assist stakeholdersand decision makers in testing different attitudes towards climate-change-concernedconservation planning. In the future, these models may be implemented in real con-servation frameworks looking to resolve the broad question driving conservationplanners and policy-makers: where, when and how to use conservation resources inorder to make species to persist the increasing challenges from climate change.Acknowledgements This research was funded by FEDER funds through the Fundação paraa Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) and Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade—-COMPETE—and was undertaken under the projects PTDC/AAG-GLO/3979/2014 (ref. 9471-RIDTI) and UID/MA T/00297/2013.

The ever increasing temperature conditions and erraticrains have raised concerns among local communities in the region. The changing cli-matic conditions has affected both man and animal in almost equal measure. Speciﬁ-cally, migration and disappearance of terrestrial animals have been observed. Climatechange and biodiversity and speciﬁcally terrestrial animals are interrelated. Climatechange affects water and pasture which are the lifeblood to terrestrial animals. Theseanimals need water for transport of nutrients and other metabolic processes. Theyneed pasture to acquire nutritional components and for growth and development.Any adverse change on climate therefore affects the animals directly. This paperpresents an assessment of the impact of climate change on terrestrial animals. Thespeciﬁc objectives of the paper include: to assess the changing weather and climaticconditions; to document climate change impacts on terrestrial animals, and to explorethe strategies put in place by stakeholders to address the problems. The study adoptsa descriptive approach including the use of ten local community leaders and con-servation agents as key informants to obtain thematic data on terrestrial animals inthe selected areas. Four focus group discussions were organized each with ten localcommunity members to give additional information on climate change and terrestrialanimals. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and presented graphically inline with the emerging themes. The study generated knowledge and valuable infor-mation to global conservation agents, national governments, policy makers and theacademia on climate change and biodiversity and speciﬁcally terrestrial animals.B.

OthocheIntroduction: Climate Change and BiodiversityClimate change and weather variability have been observed globally in the recentpast. Climate change is the signiﬁcant and long lasting change in the statistical dis-tribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from a decade to millions of years(Blast 2010 ). Climatologists have identiﬁed upward trends in global temperaturesand now estimate an unprecedented rise of 2.0 °C by the year 2100 (Partz et al.1996 ). The changing climatic conditions have affected the quality of both terrestrialand ocean biodiversity in different ecosystems.Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on earth measured at genetic, speciesand ecosystem levels (Benn 2010 ). Under favorable conditions, biodiversity ﬂourishand becomes healthy and more productive. The distribution of biodiversity acrossthe globe is inﬂuenced by physical and anthropogenic factors. Latitudinal gradientsin species diversity has been observed (Field et al. 2009 ; Y oung 2003 ; Tittensoret al. 2010 ; Myers et al. 2000 ;G a s t o n 2000 ). Generally, biodiversity is in greatabundance in the equatorial and tropical areas than it is in the temperate and polarregions. Speciﬁcally, terrestrial biodiversity tends to be abundant in the tropical areaswhile marine biodiversity is abundant along the coastal regions. This is due to warmtemperatures and abundance of rainfall in the tropical and equatorial regions (Fieldet al. 2009 ). The tropical forests for example cover less than 10% of the earth’s surfacebut contain 90% of the world’s species. In general, biodiversity hot spots occur infavorable environments in relation to latitudinal changes (McPeek and Brown 2007 ;Peters 2013 ; Robosky 2009 ). Terrestrial biodiversity plays an important role in thelife of man and other animals in general. Indeed, biodiversity offers services andproducts that sustain ecosystems.The services offered by biodiversity can be categorised as provisional, regula-tory and cultural services. Provisional services involve the production of renewableresources such as food, wood, and fresh water. Regulatory services include those thatregulate climate and weather patterns and disease and pest control. Cultural servicesrepresent human value and enjoyment and includes cultural heritage, landscape aes-thetics, outdoor recreation and spiritual signiﬁcance (Cardinale et al. 2012 ; Wrightand Bernard 2002 ; Daniel 2012 ).For biodiversity and speciﬁcally terrestrial biodiversity to ﬂourish in an area,there should be adequate supply of water. Climate change affects continuous supplyof water from direct precipitation (Adams and Dannele 2008 ). This in turn affectswater sources that rely on precipitation. Examples of sources of water that rely onprecipitation directly and indirectly include rivers, water pans and boreholes. Thesewater sources are sustained by the hydrological cycle which dictates the amount ofwater that eventually reaches the earth’s surface and remains available for plants.From plants the feeding chains are sustained and therefore existence of ecosystemsguaranteed. Sustainable water supply is no longer guaranteed in most parts of theworld. This problem has been aggravated by the changing weather and climatic pat-terns (Bates et al. 2008 ; Parmesan and Y ohe 2003 ; UNESCO 2003 ). In the study arearainfall patterns have been erratic for most part of the last decade thereby affectingThe Impact of Climate Change and V ariability on Wild Terrestrial … 261water supply. Rivers and streams have turned into seasonal channels and some havedried out completely leaving behind sand and gravel during the dry season. Waterpans have also dried up and borehole water volume reduced.Climate change has impacted on biodiversity in different ecosystems worldwide.Both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have been affected in one way or the other.More so, climate change has impacted on terrestrial animals speciﬁcally (Sahney et al.2010 ). It has been established that every organism has a unique set of preferencesthat enables it to establish its own niche with speciﬁc environmental conditions. Eachniche has speciﬁc conditions that enables the organism to survive. The environmentalconditions associated with each niche where each organism survives include climate,soil conditions, competition, latitude, among others. Any alteration of an animal’sniche especially when climatic conditions change will deﬁnitely affect the wellbeingof the speciﬁc animals. Climate change therefore is a major factor to consider wheninvestigating biodiversity and sustainable environmental conditions.Climate change might result in low productivity in the terrestrial animal ecosys-tems, poor health of animals, migration and disappearance of the animals as well asextinction of the same animals where adverse conditions spread over a long periodof time (Pimm et al. 2014 ;R u s t a r d 2008 ; Pearson and Dawson 2005 ). In the studyarea, manifestations of climate change have been established. This is in the form ofprolonged droughts, ever increasing temperatures and erratic rains (Makenzi et al.2013 ). Animals have adversely been affected due to prolonged droughts and inad-equate pasture in the midst of erratic rains. It is with this in mind that this paperinvestigates the impact of climate change on terrestrial animals in the North andSouth coastal region of Kenya.The Study ObjectivesThe speciﬁc objectives of the study included: to assess the changing weather andclimatic conditions; to document climate change impacts on terrestrial animals, andto explore the strategies put in place by stakeholders to address the problems.The Rationale of the PaperClimate change and biodiversity conservation are global issues in the contemporarysociety. Biodiversity conservation is an urgent matter due to the ever increasingthreats. In order to arrest this trend, researches on biodiversity and climate change arenecessary on a continuous basis. It is with this background that this paper investigatesthe impact of climate change on terrestrial animals. The study highlights the problemsassociated with climate change and biodiversity thereby contributing towards ﬁndingsolutions on biodiversity conservation amidst effects of climate change. V ery fewstudies have addressed the effects of climate change on terrestrial animals in the262 B. Othocheselected study areas hence this study addresses and ﬁlls the gap in literature in thisarea. The study also contributes to the professional development component therebyenhancing scholarly work in climate change science.MethodologyThe Study AreaThe study area is located in the coastal region of Kenya. Speciﬁcally, the studywas carried in two counties, namely Kwale and Kiliﬁ in the South and North Coastrespectively. Communities in the South Coast are mainly the Digo, while in theNorth Coast they are mainly the Giriama. Both communities belong to the Mijikendagroup of the coastal region of Kenya. The communities are mixed farmers; henceclimate and agriculture are key livelihood resources. The ecosystems that formedreference base for terrestrial animals for the study because of the high concentrationof such animals are the Arabuko Sokoke Forest in North Coast, (Kiliﬁ County) andShimba Hills, in South Coast, (Kwale County). The most important ecosystem inthe north coast of Kenya is the Arabuko Sokoke forest. The forest is located at3°16/primeS39°49/prime. In terms of area, the park is 6 km2. Apart from Arabuko Sokoke, othermajor forest resources in the North Coast include the Dakatcha Woodland and theDida forest. Arabuko Sokoke is the largest coastal forest (GoK 2016 ). Part of thisforest has been designated as a national park. Shimba Hill National Reserve is locatedat 04°/prime26/prime/primeS39º23/prime16/prime/primeE and has an area of 192.51 km2. Indeed, Arabuko Sokoke andShimba Hills are conservation areas managed by Kenya Wildlife Service as well asthe Kenya Forest Services assisted by other conservation groups.Research DesignThis study adopted a descriptive approach that resulted in data acquisition, analysisand presentation. This design is used as a framework that addresses research questionsand gives the methods and procedures used in sampling, data collection and analysis.Sampling and Sample SizeThe study used purposive non-probability sampling method.

Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics andpresented graphically in line with the emerging themes.Results/DiscussionClimate in the Selected Study AreasIt was established that the average annual rainfall in the study area increases slightlyfrom the coast, from 900–1000 mm, to more than 1100 mm. The region receives bothlong and short rains. The ﬁrst rainy season (“Long Rains”) starts normally towardsthe end of March. Near the coast the rains are heavy in April and May, and decreasegradually until October in most years without a distinctive end. The second rainyseason (“Short Rains”) starts indistinctly around the middle of October, and lastsuntil December or January but with no pronounced end, and variability is high. Theunpredictability of the rainfall patterns in the coastal region of Kenya affects humanactivities and the farming calendar (Othoche 2013 ).In terms of temperature conditions, the highest is 34 °C, while the lowest is 22.5 °C.The average temperature conditions are 30 °C though this varies according to seasonsand location as well as other environmental factors. The average relative humidityranges between 60–80%. Wind speed in the region in terms of km/h ranges fromminimum values of 4.8 to maximum of 10.9 (Kenya Meteorological Department(KMD) 2014 ).Biodiversity in the Study AreaKenya is rich in biodiversity (World Resources Institute 2007 ). Generally, the coastalforests have a rich biodiversity. The region has over 50% of Kenya’s threatenedspecies of plants, 60% of birds in Kenya and 65% of animals. Large concentrationsof terrestrial animals in the study area are mainly found in protected areas such asArabuko Sokoke and Shimba hills. However, wildlife also lives with communitiesoutside the parks. Indeed, in Kenya, about 70% of wildlife live on private lands(Othoche 2011a ,b). Terrestrial animals are also spread across the landscape in privatelocal community land in both the south and north coastal regions of Kenya. This hasexposed such animals to human wildlife conﬂicts.264 B. OthocheT errestrial Animals in North CoastThe most common terrestrial animals in the North Coast include Elephants, Buffalo,Birds, Snakes, tortoise, Crocodiles, Turtles, Fish. The area also has forest reserves,crocodiles and snake parks. Speciﬁcally, Arabuko Sokoke protects many endemicand near endemic species of animals to include the birds. The endemic birds includeClarke’s Weaver bird. The near-endemic species include Sokoke Pipit, Sokoke ScopsOwl and the Amani Sun Bird. Other endemic and near endemic animals include theGolden-Rumped Elephant Shrew, the Sokoke bushy tailed Mongoose, the Ader’sDuiker, Savannah elephants, African Civeta, Baboons, V ervet Monkey, and a diver-sity of amphibians. Arabuko Sokoke has 40 mammals, 270 birds, 49 reptiles, and 25amphibians (Kenya Forest Service (KFS) 2013a ,b).T errestrial Animals in South CoastThe most unique ecosystem in the South Coast that harbors most terrestrial animalsis Shimba Hills. This is a protected area. Shimba Hills is the center of terrestrialanimal concentration in the region. The most common terrestrial animals in thesouth coastal region of Kenya include the Elephant, the endangered Sable Antelope,Giraffes, Leopards, Hyenas, the Gazelle, the Hippo, Buffalo, Zebra among others.The park also has a number of birds such as the Ostrich, Falcon, Hornbill, Sunbird,among others; reptiles include the Python, Cobra, Lizard, and Gecko) while insectsinclude Butterﬂies, Mosquitoes, and Beetle). Shimba Hills has 111 birds and 22 ofthese are coastal endemic. In general, Shimba Hills has about 700 Elephants and 100Antelopes. Other rare animals include the Hyena and Leopard (Kenya Forest Service(KFS) 2013a ,b).Changing Weather and Climatic Conditions in the Northand South Coastal Regions of KenyaResearches have conﬁrmed that climate and weather patterns in the study area have orare changing (Othoche 2013 ; Makenzi et al. 2013 ). A summary of long term averagerainfall ﬁgures shows variability of the climatic parameters. For the South Coast,(Kwale County) annual rainfall varies between 500 and 1700 mm with a mean of977 mm of rain. On average the region experiences 60 days of rain per year thoughthis has been ﬂuctuating from as low as 35 to as a high as 100 rain days. Rainfallﬁgures at Shimba Hills shows a decline in average values. The mean annual rainfallvalue is 1380 mm. The year 2016 average value was only 739 mm. This was thesecond driest year in the region after 1974 which had 693 mm. Mean rainfall andtemperature statistics for North Coast also show ﬂuctuating trends (Table 1).The Impact of Climate Change and V ariability on Wild Terrestrial … 265Ta b l e 1 The mean rainfall and temperature statistics for north coastNorthcoastalregion1960–1969 1970–1979 1980–1989 1990–1999 2000–2009 2010–2015Meanannualtemperature 29.8 29.6 29.6 30.0 30.3 29.7Averageannualrainfall 875.3 899.8 880.7 957.6 1108.2 910Source KMD, Mtwapa ( 2016 )Table 1shows interdecadal average values of temperature and rainfall conditionsfor North Coast. It is observed that the mean annual temperatures have remained highwith an average ﬁgures of 30 °C. The mean rainfall values are also high but withgreater monthly and yearly variations. The interdecadal values hide signiﬁcant vari-ations of very low and very high rainfall patterns. Weather variability is an importantindicator of climate change.In this study, responses from FDs revealed the same trend of temperature andrainfall patterns. The following are some of the manifestations of climate change inthe coastal region of Kenya. The responses are given in percentages derived fromaverage values for the four FGDs groups. The responses from ten ofﬁcials indicatethat climate change has threatened terrestrial animals as it affects water resources andpasture. This has resulted in disappearance or migration of animals to better wateredparts of the region (Table 2).There was above average response on the various manifestations of climatechange. There was nearly 100% agreement that climate and weather variability in thestudy area are real. Local communities and ofﬁcers from selected sites conﬁrmed thesituation on the ground. These manifestations have been conﬁrmed in various stud-ies (IPCC 2007 ,2013 ; Othoche 2013 ). Data from Kenya Meteorological Department(KMD) has revealed that rainfall totals in the study sites and in Kenya in general hasbeen ﬂuctuating from the normal (KMD 2016 ). This is in line with the ﬁndings basedon FGDs. Temperatures are on the rise and showing an upward trend in maximumoccurrences. This is also in line with the IPCC ( 2007 ,2013 ).The Impact of Climate on T errestrial Animals in the CoastalRegion of KenyaThe North and South coastal region of Kenya has a rich plant and animal life. Thecoastal forests such as Arabuko Sokoke and Shimba Hills are unique ecosystems.These unique protected areas form habitat for terrestrial animals and plants. However,266 B.

This further endangers the animalsresulting in migration or disappearance. Climate change results in illegal extrac-tion/activities hence increased pressure on wildlife from surrounding communities.Strategies Put in Place by Stakeholders to Addressthe Impact of Climate Change on T errestrial AnimalsThe key informants gave detailed information on biodiversity conservation and cli-mate change. Due to the adverse impacts of climate change observed in Kenya, anumber of strategies have been put in place to address some of the problems.

Kenya there-fore participates in the annual COPs which are the offshoot to of the Kyoto Protocol268 B. Othocheand of which the most current include COP21 in Paris in 2015, COP22 in Marrakechin 2016 and COP23 in Bonn in 2017.The Kenya Meteorological Department also has encouraged the use of locallyavailable technology to monitor weather and climate variability. There is concertedeffort to ecosystem services to be monitored through Ecosystem Based Adaptation,(EBA) which involves use of biodiversity and ecosystem as part of the overall adap-tation strategy to the impact of climate change. This includes planting of trees, andcover crops. Due to the various issues observed in relation to climate change, Kenyahas put in place policy guidelines for different sectors. V arious policies on ClimateChange and Biodiversity Conservation have been enacted. There is also collabora-tion with the international community to address the changing weather and climatepatterns. Some of these policy documents include: The National Environment Policy(2012/2013); Forest Policy (2014); The Kenya national Environmental Action Plan(NEAP); the National Development Plan (NDP) Alternative Livelihood Industry;Climate Change Policy (KCP); the National Food and Nutrition Security Policy,2011, among others. The national and county governments have embarked on cam-paigns to create awareness among local communities on climate change adaptationand mitigation as well as biodiversity conservation. Indigenous knowledge is beingapplied at grassroots level in climate change adaptation and mitigation and biodiver-sity conservation.There are various strategies that have been put in place to conserve biodiversityin Kenya within the changing climatic conditions. Membership to various biodi-versity conservation bodies is a strategy aimed at enforcing the global agenda onbiodiversity conservation. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for exam-ple was adopted in the year 2010 during the 10th Conference of Parties (COP10).The objectives of this convention is to develop national strategies for conservationand sustainable utilization of biological diversity (Heinrich 2002 ). The CartagenaProtocol on Biosafety was adopted in the year 2000 to protect biological diversityfrom potential risks posed by living organisms resulting from biotechnology. It isa requirement that products from new technologies be based on the precautionaryprinciple. In line with biodiversity conservation bodies, Kenya has also embarkedon establishment of protected areas for biodiversity conservation; establishment ofzoological gardens which are refuge areas for rare animals that could disappear with-out captive breeding such as the zoos and aquariums. These are conservation areasfor preservation of genetic stocks for re-introduction to the wild when conditionsbecome favorable. They are also used for educational and scientiﬁc research.Botanical gardens/Arboretums are set aside for research and exhibition of plants,documentation of local ﬂora, preserving samples of rare and endangered species andmaintenance of specimen collections for future use. It acts as a museum for plants forexample, the East African Botanical Garden in Nairobi. Indeed, the National muse-ums of Kenya are actively involved in biodiversity conservation through establish-ment of botanical gardens. Seed banks have been established as an ex situ approachwhere storage of conservation materials in form of seeds is monitored with regardto viability through germination tests and purity analysis. National parks and gamereserves have been established on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with the objec-The Impact of Climate Change and V ariability on Wild Terrestrial … 269tive to preserve wildlife that cannot co-exist with human beings and human activities.National parks are under the jurisdiction of central government while game reservesare managed by the local county council (Othoche 2011a ,b). Other measures includeawareness creation and education of local communities on the importance of protect-ing the terrestrial animals; ecotourism activities on private land to generate incomehence reduce pressure on animals; and enactment of laws on wildlife and biodiversityin general.ConclusionsEmpirical data on climatic variables, from Kenya Meteorological Department andfrom the ofﬁcials from Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Forest Services, mostlyrainfall and temperature have conﬁrmed that there is variability of these climaticparameters. The rains are unpredictable and temperature conditions on the upwardtrend. There is both temporal and spatial variability of these climatic parameters.Temporal variability is further manifested in daily, monthly, seasonal and annualvariability.This scenario is conﬁrmed by qualitative data from local communities in thestudy area through FGDs and key informant interviews. Local people observed thatclimate change and variability has manifested itself in different ways. These includeprolonged drought and low and erratic rainfall totals. The Kenya Government throughvarious parastatals has come up with regulatory measures and policies on climatechange and biodiversity conservation. There is indeed collaborative effort to involvelocal communities to accommodate wildlife and be involved in conservation througha shared or participatory approach.Limitations of the W orkThe paper covered selected areas in the north and south coastal region of Kenya. Thespeciﬁc areas included Kwale and Kiliﬁ Counties in the coastal region of Kenya. Thepaper covered only the impact of climate change and weather variability on terrestrialanimals in the selected areas. Rainfall and temperature trends were covered. Primaryand secondary were used. However, there are quite a number of ecosystems that offerhabitat to terrestrial animals that could be investigate in future studies.Constraints of the PaperTiming was a major constraint to this work but this was addressed by use of datacollection procedures that ensured acquisition of adequate data for the paper.270 B.

Geogr J 169:120Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connectedwith the UV Climate ChangeAliaksandr Krasouski, Siarhei Zenchanka, Elena Loginovaand Maxim AndreevAbstract Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a signiﬁcant impact on human health,state of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles and air quality.International agreements on the protection of the ozone layer have contributed tothe development of research in this ﬁeld and in the expansion of the monitoringnetwork for measurement of the ozone layer depletion and the total ozone. The studyof various factors that affect ultraviolet radiation is given great attention. A closelink and a mutual inﬂuence of climate change and changes in the ozone layer haveshown during recent studies. Moreover, changes in the ozone layer lead to changesin UVR and inﬂuence on biodiversity. The identiﬁcation of these relationships, thestudy of the state of the ozone layer and the intensity of UV radiation has becomeone of the aims of this article. Another aim of the article is to assess the impact ofchanging UVR levels over the territory of Belarus on the development of elementsof wildlife and agricultural productivity. The analysis showed that the main objectof exposure for large animals is the organs of vision, whereas for small animals thedegree of their coloring is essential. The basic composition of wild vegetation inall landscapes has changed. Typical crops for Belarus were replaced, which led toa change in agricultural technology. This is due to changes in the distribution ofclimatic zones on the territory of Belarus. Studies have also shown that over theterritory of Belarus, unlike the Western Europe, there is still no restoration of theozone layer, which increases the risks of exposure of the UVR to biodiversity.A.

Krasouski et al.IntroductionConvention on biological diversity (Convention 1992 ) deﬁnes biological diversityas “the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia,terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes ofwhich they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and ofecosystems”.On 25th September 2015 countries adopted new sustainable development goalsdirected at the transforming our world during the next 15 years (Resolution 2015 ).Goal 15 “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,sustainably manage forests, combat desertiﬁcation, and halt and reverse land degra-dation and halt biodiversity loss” refers to the biodiversity conservation. Some targetsand corresponding indicators for this goal are presented in Table 1.These targets and indicators are in close correspondence with the Strategic Plan forBiodiversity 2011–2020 and the Aichi Targets (Strategic Plan 2011 ) which consider 5strategic goals and 20 targets. The Strategic Plan provides that “by 2050, biodiversityis valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services,sustaining a healthy planet and delivering beneﬁts essential for all people”.Ta b l e 1 Biodiversity conservation targets and indicators (Report 2017 )Target Indicator15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation,restoration and sustainable use of terrestrialand inland freshwater ecosystems and theirservices, in particular forests, wetlands,mountains and drylands, in line withobligations under international agreements15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total landarea15.1.2 Proportion of important sites forterrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that arecovered by protecting areas, by ecosystem type15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation ofsustainable management of all types of forests,halt deforestation, restore degraded forests andsubstantially increase afforestation andreforestation globally15.2.1 Progress towards sustainable forestmanagement15.3 By 2030, combat desertiﬁcation, restoredegraded land and soil, including land affectedby desertiﬁcation, drought and ﬂoods, andstrive to achieve a land degradation-neutralworld15.3.1 Proportion of land that is degraded overtotal land area15.5 Take urgent and signiﬁcant action toreduce the degradation of natural habitats, haltthe loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protectand prevent the extinction of threatened species15.5.1 Red list index15.9 By 2020, integrate ecosystem andbiodiversity values into national and localplanning, development processes, povertyreduction strategies and accounts15.9.1 Progress towards national targetsestablished in accordance with AichiBiodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan forBiodiversity 2011–2020Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 275Human activities have led to fundamental changes in our ecosystems and, indeed,they destabilize our ecosystems. The latest assessment on the state of the biosphere(Rockström 2015 ; Steffen et al. 2015 ) shows that as a result of human activities,mankind have already crossed four planetary boundaries (climate change, biodiver-sity loss, deforestation and fertilizer use). It is seen that biodiversity strongly dependson climate change and in its turn the ozone layer depletion contributes to climatechange (UNEP 2010 ,2014 ) especially in its regional component (Krasouski andZenchanka 2018 ).In their review Cardinale et al. ( 2012 ) presented six consensus statements:1. There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efﬁciency bywhich ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, producebiomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients.2. There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystemfunctions through time.3. The impact of biodiversity on any single ecosystem process is nonlinear andsaturating, such that change accelerates as biodiversity loss increases.4. Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species thathave a large inﬂuence on productivity, and differences in functional traits amongorganisms increase total resource capture.5. Loss of diversity across trophic levels has the potential to inﬂuence ecosystemfunctions even more strongly than diversity loss within trophic levels.6. Functional traits of organisms have large impacts on the magnitude of ecosystemfunctions, which give rise to a wide range of plausible impacts of extinction onecosystem function.There are two aims of the article:1. The study of the link and a mutual inﬂuence of climate change and changes inthe ozone layer, which lead to changes in UVR and inﬂuence on biodiversity.2. Assessment of the impact of changing UVR levels on the territory of Belarus onthe development of wildlife species and agricultural productivity.The article consists of the next section:•Methods:– Theoretical approach– Instrumental methods.•Cause-effect relationships: climate change, ozone layer depletion, ultraviolet radi-ation and biodiversity changes:– Ultraviolet radiation and ozone layer.– Ozone layer depletion and Climate Change.– Impact of UV radiation on biodiversity.276 A. Krasouski et al.•Results. UV radiation over the territory of Belarus.– Investigated areas.– Measurement.•Discussion and Conclusion.MethodsTwo approaches to the investigation were used: theoretical and instrumental.Limitations of investigation are deﬁned by its aims—the study of the state ofthe ozone layer and the intensity of UV radiation and the assessment of the impactof changing UVR levels over the territory of Belarus on biodiversity. One morerestriction is connected with the limited places of research.Theoretical approach includes the analysis of scientiﬁc reports, programs and arti-cles.Three sections—Ultraviolet radiation and ozone layer; Ozone layer depletion andClimate Change; Impact of UV radiation on biodiversity—describe different aspectsof interaction between climate change, ozone layer depletion and incidence ultravi-olet radiation and their inﬂuence on biodiversity.V alues of UV power and daily doses of UV for various biological effects (ery-thema, DNA damage, etc.), as well as the values of the UV Index, were calculatedfrom measured UV spectra in accordance with WMO requirements.Instrumental methods . The measurements of energy density spectra (EDS) of solarradiation in the spectral range of 285–450 nm on the earth’s surface were carried outwith the help of ultraviolet spectroradiometer PION-UV and its polar modiﬁcationPION-F, developed at the National Ozone Monitoring Research and Education Center(http://ozone.bsu.by/ ).PION-UV (Fig. 1) is an automatic ultraviolet spectroradiometer.PION-UV is a compact instrument for measuring absolute intensities and spectraldistribution of direct and scattered ultraviolet solar radiation in the spectral range of280–450 nm intending for use in the monitoring network of solar UV-B radiation,as well as in studies on the effect of UV radiation on natural and anthropogenicecological systems. The optic of the device is optimized for any measurements ofUV radiation; tightness and thermal stability ensure operation in any weather.Its advantages over analogues are:•Portability;•Mobility;•Low cost;•Import substitution.Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 277Fig. 1 PION-UVspectroradiometerFig. 2 PION-F photometerUnlike PION-UV , PION-F (Fig. 2) is an autonomous remote system for monitor-ing the state of the ozone layer and measuring the dose of active biological ultravioletradiation (UV Index). It consists of two-channel photometer and a solar panel.PION-F is completely autonomous and does not require external power sourcesand communication with a computer for data storage and processing. The resultsof measurements are transmitted via the GSM network to the remote server, whichallows continuous monitoring the ozonosphere online. The autonomy of the systemand the use of the GSM network for data transfer allows the photometer to be installed278 A. Krasouski et al.virtually anywhere where there is coverage of the mobile operator, which allows thecreation of a network for effective monitoring of the ozonosphere and prompt warningof the risk of UV radiation in the shortest possible time.Using a modern electronic base allowed to achieve high energy efﬁciency of thedevice (the energy consumption in sleep mode is only 13 mW).The use of microcontroller with ARM architecture allows calculating the totalozone and UV Index directly by the microcontroller program. In addition, the pro-gram calculates the time of sunrise and sunset, which automatically allows the pho-tometer to be put into sleep mode at night.If it is not possible to use the GSM network (for example, carrying out measure-ments in Antarctica), an alternative wireless communication channel at a frequencyof 433 MHz and a maximum range of 1 km is provided in the photometer. In thiscase, the data are transferred to a PC or laptop.Cause-Effect Relationships: Climate Change, Ozone LayerDepletion, Ultraviolet Radiation and Biodiversity ChangesUltraviolet Radiation and Ozone LayerIn recent years, along with the general deterioration of the environmental situation,climate change, pollution of the atmosphere and the aquatic environment, a problemhas arisen associating with the effects on the human health of excessive ultravioletirradiation. The global process of degradation of the Earth’s ozone layer, one of themanifestations of which is the formation of “ozone holes”, led to the disruption ofthe usual mode of natural UV radiation.The sun is the main source of optical radiation coming to the surface of the Earthfrom space. In quantitative terms, ultraviolet radiation is about 5% of the total ﬂux ofsolar radiation reaching the Earth’s atmosphere. Visible and infrared ranges accountfor 39 and 56%, respectively (Fig. 3).The ultraviolet component of solar radiation is called biologically active, as havingthe most pronounced effect on the living organism. Taking into account the pecu-liarities of the biological effect, UV radiation is divided into three spectral ranges(Fig. 3): UV-C (radiation wavelength 100–280 nm); UV-B (280–315 nm) and UV-A(315–400 nm).The most dangerous, with a strong bactericidal effect (leading to the death ofmicrobial cells and viruses), is UV-C radiation. It is completely absorbed in theupper layers of the atmosphere by stratospheric oxygen and the ozone layer and doesnot reach the surface of the Earth.UV-B radiation is also absorbed by the ozone layer of the atmosphere andonly about 6% reaches the Earth’s surface, but it causes the main undesirableeffects—burns and skin tumors, diseases of the eyes, depression of the immunesystem.Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 279SunlightUV radiaƟon(100 – 400) nm5 %Visible radia Ɵon(400 - 760) nm39 %Infrared radia Ɵon(760 - 5000) nm56 %UV-C(100 – 280) nmUV-B(280 – 315) nmUV-A(315 – 400) nmFig. 3 Solar radiation spectrumFinally, UV-A radiation is slightly attenuated by the atmosphere, but the biologicaleffect produced by it is approximately 1000 times weaker than that of UV-B radiation.Given the signiﬁcant impact of UV radiation on the biosphere and human health,it is extremely important to carry out its constant monitoring, as well as to study thefactors which determine the arrival of UV radiation to the Earth’s surface.Ozone Layer Depletion and Climate ChangeThe strong ozone depletion in the spring months in Antarctica in the early 1980s led tothe adoption in 1985 of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer(Convention 1985 ) and the signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol on the reductionof the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (Protocol 1987 ).The main goal of the measures taken is to protect the biosphere (primarily to preventthe harmful effects of UV radiation on human health) from the increased doses ofUV-C that are possible with the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. Given thesigniﬁcant impact of UV radiation on human health and the biosphere as a whole,it is extremely important to conduct its constant monitoring, as well as to study thefactors determining the arrival of UV radiation to the Earth’s surfaceIn addition to inﬂuencing the intensity and spectral composition of UV radiation,changes in the ozone layer lead to climate change (Hegglin et al 2015 ; UNEP 2010 ,2014 ).Krasouski and Zenchanka ( 2017 ) consider two mechanisms of interaction “ozonelayer depletion—climate change”: “the “radiation” mechanism which is responsiblefor the formation of ozone in the upper stratosphere and lowers the height of thetropopause, the other operates in the troposphere and called “thermodynamic”. Itcreates conditions for the dry and moist instability and thereby raises the height of thetropopause and decreases the total ozone content. Mutual inﬂuence and the relativerole of tropospheric (“thermodynamic”) and stratospheric (“radiation”) mechanisms280 A. Krasouski et al.vary according to region and season. Thermodynamic processes (convection) prevailin the tropical region. “Radiation” mechanism prevails in the unstable troposphereand in the polar latitudes”.Changing of regional climate distributes biodiversity at local sites.Impact of UV Radiation on BiodiversityThe Sun UV radiation always plays important roles in our environment, andaffects nearly all ﬂora and fauna. The changing of UV irradiance can affect pri-mary production in all ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic, natural, managed, orexploited with a potential cascade of effects. Current understanding of these processesdoes not enable conﬁdent prediction of the impacts. Chapin, Sala and Huber-Sannwald (Scenario 2013 ) pointed that “little is known about the effects of increasingUV-B on either biodiversity or ecosystem function”. It is necessary to consider aspositive as negative impact of UV radiation on living organisms and plants.There are serious impacts of ozone depletion on biodiversity. For example,increased UV radiation reduces the levels of plankton in the oceans and subsequentlydiminishes ﬁsh stocks. It can also have adverse effects on plant growth, thus reducingagricultural productivity. A direct negative economic impact is the reduced lifespanof certain materials.In forests and grasslands increased UV-B radiation is likely to result in changesin species composition (mutation) thus altering the bio-diversity in different ecosys-tems. Physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UV-Bradiation, even by the amount of UV-B in present-day sunlight. Despite mechanismsto reduce or repair these effects and a limited ability to adapt to increased levels ofUV-B, plant growth can be directly affected by UV-B radiation (Secretariat of theConvention on Biological Diversity 2014 ).The negative impact on living organism is connected with eye diseases, the defeatof the skin, malfunctions in the immune system, On the other hand, the positive effectof UV radiation on living organisms is connected with synthesizes the vitamins ofgroup D necessary for health, which prevent the development of such diseases asrickets, osteoporosis and some types of cancer.Plants, as primary producers, are fully dependent on solar radiation. Light isthe source of energy for them, driving photosynthesis and directing developmentfrom germination to ﬂowering. UV radiation might increase the amount of activesubstances in medicinal plant. However, sunlight, especially its UV component, cancause negative effects on plants: decreasing the plant growth, changing plant color,plant productivity, etc.These three sections—Ultraviolet radiation and ozone layer; Ozone layer deple-tion and Climate Change; and Impact of UV radiation on biodiversity—show mutualinteraction of climate change and ozone layer depletion, and their inﬂuence on theintensity of the UV radiation which impact on elements of biodiversity.Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 281The Results. UV Radiation over the T erritory of BelarusInvestigated AreasMonitoring of power, doses of biologically active solar radiation and UV Indexesare carried out at the Minsk Ozonometric Station of the NOMREC, bio-station ofthe Belarusian State University on Lake Naroch, as well as at the meteorological siteof the Gomel University ( http://ozone.bsu.by/instruments.htm ). These three placesare disposed at different parts of the Belarus belonging to different climatic zones(Loginov 2017 ). Besides that Lake Naroch is a recreation area and measurement ofUV Indexes is very important for peoples’ health.MeasurementMonitoring UV radiation is becoming more and more important, especially in viewof the continuing changes of the processes in the ozone layers of the atmosphereand the consequent effects on the environment and physical health. As mentioned byChubarova et al. ( 2016 ) the pattern of temporal and spatial variability of the UVR israther complicated due to the impact on it of variations not only of ozone, but alsoof other geophysical factors—cloudiness, aerosol, and surface albedo. It should benoted that in many regions in recent years a noticeable increase in UV radiation.At Figs. 4and 5the results of UV Index measurement are shown.In accordance with the recommendation of the WHO and WMO the UV Index usesto assess the degree of risk of UV radiation exposure for human (WHO 2002 ). TheFig. 4 The UV Index in Minsk282 A. Krasouski et al.Fig. 5 The UV index near Lake NarochUV Index (UVI) is calculated from measurements of total ozone (TO) and maximumlevels of UV radiation (UV maximum) making in an astronomical afternoon. UVImaximum deﬁnes risk of maximum irradiation of human, ecosystems, etc. in theabsence of clouds. The real UV Index was measured and then it was re-calculatedusing the average value of UVR level in the period from one hour to and one hourafter astronomical afternoon. This level is always less than the maximum. The dailybehavior of UV Index can be modeled by changing the zenith angle. Informationon the UV Index is used to determine the potential danger of excessive exposure ofsunlight on human health. As can be seen, the maximum of the UV Index (maxUVI)is observed in the spring-summer and summer-autumn periods.Data on the spectral composition and intensity of UV radiation are used to cal-culate the doses of biological effects of erythema, DNA damage, cataracts and skincancer.“Erythema dose” is an amount of radiation that, when applied to the skin, causeserythema (temporary reddening).Figure 6presents the results of retroanalysis of the total annual “erythema dose”for the Lake Naroch area.This curve was obtained by re-analysis using data on the recovery of ozone, meancloudiness and aerosol content. Maximum “erythema dose” in 1995 coincides withthe existence of an ozone hole over the territory of Belarus.The average annual dose of biological effects of erythema, skin cancer andcataracts in the Minsk region is 400, 800 and 1500 kJ/m2, respectively. The main con-Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 283Fig. 6 The total annual “erythema” dose for the Lake Naroch areatribution to the total annual dose of UVR is given by six months of the spring-autumnperiod, they account for about 85% of the annual dose.Despite the successes achieved in the conservation and sustainable use of bio-logical diversity, the impact of negative factors on natural ecological systems andpopulations of species of wild animals and wild plants of the Republic of Belaruscontinues.One of the main factors of natural origin is climate change, which leads to aggra-vation of competition between aboriginal and alien species of wild animals and wildplants, the formation of conditions favorable for the development of diseases andpests. Under the inﬂuence of global climate changes, the area of boreal species ofwild plants and wild animals has been reduced, a number of new species typical ofthe steppe and forest-steppe zones have been observed, a decrease in the number ofpopulations of certain species of wild plants and wild animals in a ﬂoodplain, coastaland wetland ecological systems.The analysis of the yield of agricultural crops was carried out between 1990and 2015 on the basis of the data of the statistical committee ( http://www.belstat.gov.by/ofitsialnaya-statistika/realny-sector-ekonomiki/selskoe-hozyaistvo/ ). Thisanalysis showed that the yield of the main crops (barley, rye, wheat) tends to increaseand coincides with the trend of climate change and with the shift of climatic zones.Similar data for the period 1979–2011 are presented by Hitrikau ( 2015 ).284 A. Krasouski et al.Discussion and ConclusionSeveral problems were considered in the article: UV radiation and its link withozone layer depletion; ozone layer depletion and climate change; measurement ofUV radiation; and impact of UV radiation on elements of wildlife and agriculture.Importance of constant monitoring of UV radiation and the factors which deter-mine the arrival of UV radiation to the Earth’s surface was considered taking intoaccount signiﬁcant impact of UV radiation on the biosphere and human health.The role of “radiation” and “thermodynamic” mechanisms responsible for theformation of ozone in the upper stratosphere and lowers the height of the tropopausewas discussed.The methodical part of the work considers the theoretical and instrumentalapproaches to the study of the ozone layer, the intensity and distribution of UVradiation. Brief descriptions of two UV measurement devices are given.The obtained results show the seasonal dependence of the UV Index and itsdependence on geographic coordinates. In the mid-latitudes, the UV Index values arein the range 1–10 and depend mainly on the height of the Sun above the horizon, thetotal ozone content in the atmosphere, the cloudiness and the state of the underlyingsurface. V alues of UV Index for risk assessment are presented in Table 2.UV Index for Minsk region can reach 7 in autumn what corresponds high levelof risk, but of Lake Naroch region, it reaches only 5 what corresponds middle levelof risk.The calculated “erythema curve” at the maximum coincides with the period ofthe ozone hole over the territory of Belarus.The effect of the ozone layer and the associated intensity of UV radiation onwildlife and plants, as well as on crops, is considered. On the basis of statis-tical data, an increase in the yield of agricultural crops is shown. This is con-cerned with regional climate change in which “radiation” and “thermodynamic”mechanisms of “climate change—ozone layer depletion” interaction make a con-tribution. Changes in climatic zones have led to the appearance of unusual forBelarus species of birds (Phylloscopus inornatus, Pelecanus Crispus, Larus micha-hellis, Larus hyperboreus) ( http://greenbelarus.info/articles/26-12-2016/4-novyh-vida-ptic-zaregistrirovali-v-belarusi ). Besides that, some species of plants may disap-pear from the territory of Belarus because of climate warming, especially for borealspecies such as spruce, mistletoe, etc.Ta b l e 2 UV Index anddegree of irradiance (humanrisk)Risk UV IndexLow ≤2Middle F r o m3t o5High F r o m6t o7V ery high F r o m8t o1 0Extremal ≥11Biodiversity Risks for Belarus Connected with the UV … 285National Ozone Monitoring Research and Education Center plans to increaseozone and UV monitoring network in Belarus by placing measuring devices in allregional centers.

Thisstudy aimed to determine the impact of forest peatland ﬁre severity level on theplant diversity and soil chemical properties of wet tropical peatland in Central Kali-mantan, Indonesia. The severe peat ﬁre extremely decreased diversity, number ofindividuals as well as number of plant species. The accumulation of ashes in forestpeat ﬁres impacted area instantly increased pH, organic matter, humic acid content,hydrophobicity, available-N and available-K. However, their availabilities had onlybeen temporary as they were easily diminished and washed way which result inlong-term land degradation. An opened and dried peatland had low water holdingcapability and, hence, it was relatively easy to burn during the dry season but ﬂoodedduring the rainy season.

Agus et al.IntroductionIndonesia is the country with the widest tropical peatland area in Southeast Asia,which covers 20,695,000 ha or 81.7% of the total tropical peatland in Southeast Asia(Rieley et al. 1996b ). Peat swamp forest is one of the wet land type which its existencehas been most threatened by human activities. Land use change of forest’ function intoagriculture or plantation may threaten the existence of the natural peat swamp forest.It is reported that the carbon content of peatland in Sumatera was 22,293 milliontons in 1990 and it was decreased into 18,813 million tons in 2002 (Wahyunto et al.2004 ). It means that in 12 years periods (1990–2002) the carbon reserve decreasedapproximately 3470 million tons or 289.16 million tons per year of the total carbonreserve in peatland in Sumatera. Land use change and over exploitation of tropicalforest ecosystem lead to the land degradation and damages (Agus et al. 2004 ,2011 ,2016 ,2017 ; Agus 2013 ,2018 ; Kita et al. 2008 ; Cahyanti and Agus 2017 ; Asdak2002 ).Degradation of peat swamp forest ecosystem may result on the loss function ofhydrology, biogeochemical, biodiversity and ecology. This is because peat swampforest represents ﬂood buffering space, water reservoir during dry season, ﬁlteringsystem of water quality, and habitat of various germplasm. The peat swamp areaplays an important role as producer of woods, food stuffs, and living and breedingenvironment of water biota, soil microbiota as well as various life supporting systems.Furthermore, swamp area also supports the historical role, cultural values, science,and other social systems (Barchia 2006 ).Forest ﬁre presents signiﬁcant impact on the condition of peatland, particularlyon its function as carbon reserve. Forest ﬁre will likely emit a huge quantity ofcarbon dioxide. According to Krisnawati et al. ( 2015 ), the carbon dioxide emission inCentral Kalimantan resulted from the forest ﬁre was 24,305,601 tons, 348,780 tons,and 10,565,491 tons in 2009, 2010, and 2011 respectively. As one of greenhousegases, the carbon dioxide triggers global warming. Forest ﬁre affects peatland byproducing CO2, CO and hydrocarbon. The CO resulted from incomplete burningof forest ﬁre may emit greenhouse gases as one of global warming contributor. Inaddition to the CO, forest ﬁre may also result on high particle emission that posesdanger for human’s health. The quantity of the particle resulting from the forest ﬁrewill accumulate in atmospheric moisture which then form thick fog (Adinugrohoet al. 2005 ). Indonesia has committed to reduce the emission of the greenhousegases up to 26% under business as usual (BAU) level in 2020 and to up to 41% ifthere was an international support (Krisnawati et al. 2015 ).Indonesia’s wet tropical forest provides rich biodiversity. However, forest ﬁre,illegal logging, and irresponsible human activities greatly contribute in the reductionof the width of the forest area over the years. Forest ﬁre causes degradation and inﬂictson economical, ecological, social and cultural losses. Moreover, it has caused thefailure in the implementation of sustainable forest management. In another word, ithas been unable to fulﬁll the existing ecolabel requirements. Economically, it causesloss of forest resources, decrease the potential result of lumbers representing one ofThe Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 289the basic capitals in national development. Furthermore, it may also decrease both thequantity and quality of biological natural resources along with the ecosystem whichserves the function of supporting life. This, in effect, would decrease t diversityof ﬂora and fauna as the sources of germplasm, quality of soil, change in foresthydrological function as well as global warming. The forest ﬁre that had affectedpeatland has signiﬁcant impact on the global warming as the peatland played animportant role in carbon, water and geothermal cycles. It was therefore necessary toconduct a study of the soil characteristics and the vegetation composition of the areaaffected by the forest ﬁre.The Distribution of Peat Swamp ForestThere is 37,734,300 ha tropical peatland in the world (about 10–12% of global peat-land), distributed in South America, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa and paciﬁccountries. About 67.1% of the tropical peatland worldwide can be found in SoutheastAsia, which is 25,329,400 ha (Rieley et al. 1996b ). Indonesia has the widest tropicalpeatland in Southeast Asia, which covers 20,695,000 ha or about 81.7% of the totaltropical peatland in Southeast Asia (Rieley et al. 1996b ), distributed in Kalimantan(6.79 millions ha), Sumatra (8.25 millions ha), Irian Jaya (4.62 millions ha) and theremaining peatlands distributed in Sulawesi, Halmahera and Seram (Radjagukguk1997 ).According to Wahyunto et al. ( 2004 ), peatland in Kalimantan has the maturationlevels of ‘Fibric’ (i.e., in raw condition and has not undergone weathering process),‘Hemic’ (i.e., half-weathered), ‘Sapric’ (i.e., completely weathered/dissolved) and/orthe combination of one of the three or the entire three levels. The thickness of thepeatland in Kalimantan varies from very thin (<50 cm) to very thick (>8 m). It hasbeen estimated that the carbon content of the peatland in Kalimantan was 11.3 gigatons (GT).The Diversity of Plant Species in Peat Swamp ForestPeatland represents an important land resource for people as it produced lumbers(including ramin, meranti, belangiran, bamboo, nyatoh, kempas, pulai, terantang,geronggang, mahang, punak, betanggur and balam), clothing materials (includingleaves and barks), food stuffs (including paddy, corn, sago, tubers and vegetables),and even herbal medicines (including kepayang, krinyu, katalayu, lukut, galam, luwa,rengas, sarigading, jingah, gulinggang), as well as ﬁtness materials (including pasakbumi and gingers) and industrial materials (including rattan, hemp and jelutung).There are also many annual plants growing in the peatland such as coconut trees,coffee trees, rubber trees, oil palms, pepper, orange, rambutan, durian, cempedak,jackfruit and pineapple. There are also rare and exotic fruits found in the peatland such290 C. Agus et al.as big mangosteen ( Garcinia sp.), sweetsop fruit ( Anona sp.), red ﬂesh durian ( Duriosp.) and its family members like pampakin, lai-lidung, lahong, mahrawin, kamundai,and likol/leko ( Durio graveolens ). Family members of rambutan such as taap andkopuan ( Arthocarpus spp.), butter fruit ( Diospirus discarlon ), pitanak ( Leukocinitisspp.), gitaan ( Leukconitis corpidae ), rambai padi ( Baccaurea mutleana ), kapul/puak,ramunia ( Bouea macrophylla ), and balasungkawa (Noor et al. 2007 ) also has itscontribution. There are about 60 species of trees with economic value which produceslumbers (Barchia 2006 ) in addition to about 310–376 species of other plants in thepeatlands in Kalimantan and Sumatera with the density of 1300–3200 individualsper hectare (Wibisono 2005 ). There are also many species of ﬁshes, birds and otherfauna found in the peatland that are rich in protein, fat, vitamin and mineral sources.There are about 104 wild faunas, including 32 mamalia (13 protected species), 8reptiles (5 protected species), 60 species of birds (9 protected species). It has beenpredicted that there are about 100–500 species of ﬁshes found in the peat swampwaters (Dahuri 1997 ).The Characteristics of Peat SoilTropical peatland is composed of litters of various plants growing in the tropicalswamp forest, consisting of stems, branches, raw roots that were still indicative oftheir original plants. Driessen ( 1978 ) describes that physical characteristics of peat-land soil is a result from a number of variables which inﬂuence each other. One of thephysical characteristics of the peatland soil which often to be compared to mineral soilis soil moisture content. The capability of the peatland soil to keep moisture is greatlysigniﬁcant, ranging from 200 to 1000% based on weight or 50–90% based on volume(Andriesse 1988 ). The capability of the peatland soil to keep water is signiﬁcantlyinﬂuenced by the maturity of peat and groundwater depth (Rieley et al. 1996a ). Fibricpeat material able to keep the moisture of 500 and 1000% of weight, while hemicand sapric peat materials only able to keep the moisture of 200 to 500% of weight.In saturated water condition of catotelm zone, the ﬁbric peat material may keepmuch more moisture than hemic and sapric peat materials. However, in non-water-saturated condition or in acrotelm zone, the capability of the peat material varieswith its distance to groundwater surface. Bulk density represents the most importantcharacteristics because some other characteristics of the peat soil are closely relatedto it (Andriesse 1988 ). Compared to the mineral soil, the bulk density of the peatsoil is much lower. The bulk density of tropical peat soil is generally lower than thatof non-tropical soil, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 kg dm−3and it usually decreases withdepth (Rieley et al. 1996a ).The tropical peatland is characterized by low nutrient content and high acidity(Rieley et al. 1996a ) as a result from the formation process of its peat materials whichis inﬂuenced by rain water deﬁcient of minerals. The composition of the nutrientsis highly dependent on the plant‘s nutrient composition produced by litters.. Themajority of the tropical peatland contains less than 5% minerals. The total content ofThe Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 291chemical elements of ombrogen peatland is lower than that of topogen peatland andmineral land (Rieley et al. 1996a ). The macro and micro elements contained in thelow layer of the peatland are usually lower than that of the upper layers (Ahmad-Shahet al. 1992 ). Thus, nutrient deﬁciency often has its occurrence in thick and ombrogenpeat land.The total nitrogen (N) content of the tropical peatland in some areas in Indonesiaranges from 0.3 to 2.1%, in Malaysia 0.9–1.7%, and in Brunei 0.3–2.2% (Sajarwan1998 ). The range of available mineral-N for plants is less than 1% from total Ncontent. The mineral nitrogen contained in the peatland is not easily available forthe plants because of its high C/N ratio, which is range from 25 to 50 (Jali 1999 ).The majority of phosphor (P) in peatland is in the form of organic-P and only smallamount of the organic-P is in the form of organic-P compound. The available soil-Pis more likely depend on the mineralization results of the organic-P compound. Themineralization and the immobilization of the P by microorganisms is signiﬁcantlyinﬂuenced by the C/P ratio of the peatland (Tisdale et al. 1985 ). The total P contentof the tropical peatland is generally less than 0.1% and its C/P ratio is 15–20 timeslower than the C/N ratio (Jali 1999 ).The Tropical Peatland FireThe forest ﬁre that has affected the tropical peatland, especially in Southeast Asia, hastaken place in a long period of time. Usually, it occurs during dry season, especiallyin reclaimed peatland areas. The ﬁrst severe forest ﬁre occurred in 1982/1983 duringthe El-Nino dry season in which about 500,000 ha of the peatland, especially inEast Kalimantan was burned out (Page et al. 2002 ). Another severe forest ﬁre tookplace in 1997/1998 and affected about 1.5 million ha of the peatland in Indonesia(BAPPENAS 1998 ). Among the affected areas, 750,000 ha are located in Kalimantan,which included approximately 500,000 ha at PPLG in Central Kalimantan (Page et al.2002 ).The forest ﬁre during the dry season might be triggered by natural occurrencessuch as dried branches and leaves which are unintentionally burned by human. Somemajor causal factors of the ﬁre related to human are burning practice to clear the landfor agricultural purposes, land drainage, logging, human recreation activities such ascamping and excursion, hunting and ﬁshing, especially electrical ﬁshing (Abdullahet al. 2002 ). The forest ﬁre in Malaysia is caused by land clearing for agricultural use(Abdullah et al. 2002 ). Meanwhile, forest ﬁre in Central Kalimantan is assumed tobe related to forest clearing and drainage of peatland. This is because 80% of the ﬁrespots are found in the PPLG area and concentrated around the drainage and irrigationcanals (Page et al. 2002 ).The forest ﬁres may give either direct and indirect impact to peatland. The directimpacts of the ﬁre are, among others, the loss of the upper layers of litters of the peat-land (Jaya et al. 2000 ), the decline in the biodiversity, the environmental degradation,and the deteriorating of health condition of living organism in the surrounding areas292 C. Agus et al.affected by the ﬁre (Musa and Parlan 2002 ). The forest ﬁre in Central Kalimantan in1997/1998 causes the decrease in the vegetation density, loss of 75% of the peatlandof 35–70 cm of depth, and loss of 0.2–0.6 Gt carbon (D’Arcy and Page 2002 ). Fur-thermore, Noor ( 2010 ) reported that a million hectare of opened peatland in CentralKalimantan has annually contributed 0.425 million tons of CH 4to the global emissionof greenhouse gases. The carbon emission of the peatland opened for agricultural useapproximately 2.25–3.74 tons C/ha/year. Thus the opening of a million hectare ofthe peatland would have the potential emission of the greenhouse gases equivalent to8.07–13.58 million tons CO2annually. The lost carbon has extraordinarily signiﬁcantimpact on the emission of CO 2into atmosphere. Meanwhile, the indirect impactsof the forest ﬁre that affect the peatland represents the post-effects resulting fromthe recovery process of the peatland both naturally and deliberately by human beinginto its original condition. This may have happened for many years depending on thecapability to recover the peatland and also the quality of the peatland itself. Therehas not been any study reporting the post-effects of the forest ﬁre that have affectedthe peatland‘s characteristics. After the forest ﬁre, the canopy of the forest was moreopend and the peatland became more exposed. Consequently, the peat soil was moreopened to atmosphere (aerob) compared to its natural condition. Therefore, it waspredicted that the characteristics of the peatland would change after the ﬁre.Ffolliot and Bennet in De Bano et al. ( 1998 ) classiﬁed the severity of the forestﬁre based on the observed damage of trees into:Low ﬁre severity : at least 50% of trees are indicative of observed damage caused bythe ﬁre such as the burned crown, the dead shoots (the upper parts were burned, butgerminating) or the dead roots, while >80% of the damaged/burned trees survive.Moderate ﬁre severity : 20–50% of trees are indicative of unobserved damagecaused by the ﬁre, 40–80% of the damaged/burned trees survive.High ﬁre severity : <20% of trees are indicative of unobserved damage, the majorityof the damages resulting from the ﬁre is observed in the dead roots, while <40%of the damaged/burned trees survive.The Degraded Land After Forest Fire in KalimantanThe impact of the above 3 kinds of forest ﬁre severity on the characteristic of biodi-versity and soil were studied in the Special Purpose Forest (KHDTK) of TumbangNusa located in Jabiren Raya Sub-district, Pulang Pisau District, Central Kaliman-tan which was under the management of Indonesian Center for Environment andForestry Research and Development (BP2LHK) Banjarbaru. The forest ﬁre in 2015,was one of the biggest forest ﬁres that has ever taken place in the area of KHDTKTumbang Nusa showed that more than 50% of the area of the KHDK Tumbang Nusawas burned at various severity levels.Secondary forest represented the land with the biggest number of individuals thatwas not affected by the forest ﬁre in 2015. There were 106 individuals found intact,The Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 293Fig. 1 The condition of the forest during the ﬁre and after the ﬁre in 2015. aThe condition ofground ﬁre that caused burned crown. bThe condition of the ground soon after the severe ﬁre. cThe dead roots followed by falling down of the trees because of the ﬁre. dThe condition of thesevere ﬁre a year after the ﬁre.

Meanwhile, there were 16 trees found dead in theland which means 73.33% of the trees survived of the forest ﬁre in 2015. The severelyburned land without any vegetation cover had only 4 remaining trees after the ﬁre in2015. Meanwhile, the condition of the severely burned land with vegetation coverwas the same as that of the burned land without any vegetation cover after the ﬁre in2015 in which all of the trees had been burned out and there were only a very smallnumber of surviving trees. However, after the ﬁre, the land with vegetation coverexperienced natural rejuvenation that the in-ﬁeld data of the vegetation gathered in2017 were indicative of the increase in the number of individuals and the species.The most severe ﬁre was ground ﬁre which the heat under surface of the groundcaused the death of trees resulted from burned-out roots. In effects, trees were unableto survive. Moreover, the ground ﬁre also led to surface ﬁre that reached the crown(Fig. 1a). Almost all of the trees in the area had burned out leaving only the standingburned trees (Fig. 2d). The severe damage resulting from the severe ﬁre is presentedin Fig. 1.294 C. Agus et al.Fig. 2 The condition of the land after severe ﬁre that has been covered by vegetation. aThe generalcondition of the land. bThe growing species Acacia auriculiformis ,cThe growing species Acaciamangium .dThe growing species merapat/tumih ( Combretocarpus rotundatus )The condition of the land after the severe ﬁre showed that the land has beencovered by vegetation and this occurred in the land having bigger number of standsand higher trees compared to the land that has not been covered by vegetation afterthe ﬁre. Figure 2showed the condition of the land after the severe ﬁre. It has beencovered by the vegetation of the species of Acacia mangium ,Acacia auriculiformis ,and merapat/tumih ( Combretocarpus rotundatus ). The increase in the number of thevegetation two years after the ﬁre in the severely burned land had been covered by thevegetation. It might be due to the presence of sidewalk plants that helped distributethe seeds of the acacia with the blowing wind. Thus species became invasive as theland was situated 20 m from the main road in which the Acacia mangium representedthe species growing on the sidewalk. This is the pioneering species able to naturallyregenerate itself in severely damaged location. It has able to adapt to various typesof soil and environmental conditions.The land that had been severely burned without any vegetation represented smallnumber of stands and trees. The existing remaining individuals were the survivors ofthe severe ﬁre. The absence of acacia in severely burned land might be due to the longdistance of this area from main road which approximately 1 km. This long distancemight hamper the seed distribution. Therefore, there was a signiﬁcant differenceThe Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 295 -10,00020,00030,000Amount (Individu ha-1)Fire severitySeedling Poles Trees0246810Species amountFire severityBelowground Seedling Poles Trees -0.501.001.502.002.503.00Density (Individu m-2)Fire SeveritySeedling Poles Trees0.000.501.001.502.00BT BA BM SF BT BA BM SFBT BA BM SF BT BA BM SFID ShannonFire SeverityBelowground Seedling Poles TreesFig. 3 The number of the individuals and the species, the density of the vegetation and Shannon’sDiversity Index at various growth levels and ﬁre severity.

Figure 2a illustrates the conditionof the secondary forest in which the species of Balangeran ( Shorea balangeran ),Gerunggang ( Cratoxylon arborescens ), Meranti ( Shorea spp.), Merapat ( Combreto-carpus rotundatus ), Meranti Daun Lebar ( Shorea uliginsoa ), and other species werefound. The number of the individuals and the species tended to increase because ofthe minimal presence of interference.The number of the species at growth levels of seedling, stake, pole and trees afterthe moderate ﬁre was very low, a species for each was Merapat Combretocarpusrotundatus ). Merapat is the local species of Kalimantan well-known as ﬁre resistantbecause of its thick bark. It was evidenced in 73.33% of the trees remained after themoderate ﬁre. The causal factor of the big number of the surviving trees after the ﬁrewas the presence of the ﬁre resistant species in higher severity level of the ﬁre. Landwith moderate ﬁre level only affected on the surface of the ground, did not affect thelower layers, and did not burn crown unlike in the land with severe ﬁre.The number of the individuals at all growth levels tended to decrease with theseverity of the ﬁre. However, the value was more likely to vary at the growth level296 C. Agus et al.Fig. 4 a The condition of the vegetation covered in secondary forest. bThe condition of the landafter the moderate ﬁre that was dominated by the species Merapat ( Combretocarpus rotundatus ).cMerapat trees with the characteristics of thick bark that enabled them to be ﬁre resistantof ground plants. The land affected by the severe ﬁre had the bigger number ofindividuals compared to that affected by the moderate ﬁre and the secondary forest(Fig. 3a). The species of the ground plants found in the affected land after the severeﬁre and without any vegetation cover were dominated by ferns. These ferns played animportant role in forest ecosystem as well as in humus formation, and in protectingground against erosion.The causal factor of the big number of the ground plants in the land affected bythe severe ﬁre was the condition of the land that was still opened and the early phaseof succession. Meanwhile, the secondary forest affected by the moderate ﬁre hadwide vegetation cover and it resulted in the suppression of the growth of the groundplants by other plants at the growth levels of seedlings, stake, pole and trees (Fig. 4).Figure 2c illustrates the decrease in the density of the trees with the severity levelof the ﬁre. The more severe ﬁre was, the lower density was. This was consistent withThe Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 297D’Arcy and Page ( 2002 ) that the forest ﬁre which affected the peatland in CentralKalimantan in 1997/1998 has caused 75% decrease in the density of the trees.Shannon’s diversity index at each of the growth levels of the vegetation was alsomore likely to decrease with the severity of the forest ﬁre. According to Shannon,this was because the forest ﬁre resulted on the loss of various species growing in theland. The index shows that the highest pole and trees were found in the secondaryforest and classiﬁed into moderate diversity, while the index was low in the case ofthe forest ﬁre in 2015.The Characteristics of Soil After Forest FireThe forest ﬁre that affected peatland resulted in the environmental condition withmore free air ﬂow (aerob) than that in its natural condition, as such found in thepeatland rarely affected by the ﬁre and represented secondary forest. The more aerobecondition enable the change and the maturation of the peat materials which occurredin the peatland after the ﬁre because of the high precipitation.The compression has either reduced the volume of the peat mass (Dexter 2004 )or increased its weight. Figure 5illustrates the soil pores extant in the land after thesevere ﬁre with or without vegetation cover, which was denser compared to the otherpeatlands after the ﬁre. The dense soil pores resulted in soil compression and groundsolidifying and, hence, it led to the increase in the weight volume.Based on the results of the study, the WHC values ranged from the lowest(162.59%) in the peatland after the severe ﬁre and with vegetation cover to thehighest (189.12%) in the secondary forest that were rarely affected by ﬁre (Fig. 6)although they did not show signiﬁcant difference. All of the WHC values were above100%, which was consistent with the statement by Mutalib et al. ( 1992 ) that the watercontent of the peatland was in the range of 100–1300% of its dry weight.The organic carbon content of the peatland after the ﬁre was in the range of thelowest (77.04%) in the peatland after the severe ﬁre and covered by vegetation to thehighest (93.39%) in the secondary forest that was rarely affected by the ﬁre (Fig. 6).The values tended to be higher compared to the range of the organic carbon of normalpeatland, which was in the range of 54.3–57.84% (Barchia 2006 ). The high organiccarbon content of the peatland after the ﬁre without any vegetation cover mightbe inﬂuenced by the accumulation of organic materials in the land because of thetransfer of the organic materials resulting from the burning process during the ﬁre.Not only they came from the inside parts of the trees in the land, but also from theupper parts of the trees such as stems, branches and crown. In addition, the increasein the organic materials was also caused by the residue of the burning process whosemain components included hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin that became carbondioxide (CO2) and carbonate (CO 3) compound. The CO 2was released as gas, whilethe CO 3would accumulate as ashes that the carbon content of the peatland increased(Lutz and Chanler in Iswanto 2005 ).298 C.

This may be because the moderate ﬁre happened only on the surface ofthe ground which did not cause massive damage as found in the land without anyThe Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 299vegetation cover (Agus et al. 2004 ; Agus 2013 ,2018 ).This could be proven that theremaining trees in the land affected by the moderate ﬁre was 73.33%, while therewas only 10% of the remaining trees in the severe ﬁre without any vegetation cover.The pH value of each of the peatlands was in the range of the lowest (3.27) to thehighest (3.76). This corresponds with the statement by Noor ( 2010 ) that the majorityof the peatland reacted from acid to very acid condition (pH < 4). The value wasclassiﬁed in ultra acid to extremely acid categories, while the mineral soil usually hadthe pH value of 5–8 (Barchia 2006 ). The mean pH of the peatland in the secondaryforest was 3.27, meaning that it increased in the area affected by the moderate ﬁreto 3.62 and in the area affected by the severe ﬁre (BA) to 3.76. This shows that theforest ﬁre caused the increase in the pH, hence, the availability of certain nutrientsnecessary for plants would exist and it would decrease again to normal in 5 years(Iswanto 2005 ). Therefore, if the pH was close to the initial pH, the availability ofcertain nutrients for plants was lower. Additionally, the increase in the soil pH wasconsistent with Chandler cit. in Sugato ( 2005 ) suggesting that the residue of theburning process could increase cation exchange, which tended to increase the soilpH.The results of the analysis of scanning electron microscope with x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) showed that the essential macro nutrients ofthe peatland after the ﬁre were found in various types of soil. The essential macroelement of Sulfur (S) was found only in the secondary forest, meanwhile, it was notfound in the peatland after the moderate and severe ﬁres in 2015. The causal factorof the loss of the sulfur might be the occurrence that took place a couple of years ago.According to Hoskin in De Bano et al. ( 1998 ) when the temperature of soil increasedduring the heating process, the soil chemical components contained in the organicmaterials would result in the loss of the organic materials at the temperature below100 °C. While it would be easy for the elements to evaporate, it would disappearat the temperature of 200 °C. At the temperature of 200–300 °C, about 85% ofthe organic matters of the soil would disappear. At the temperature above 300 °C,the remaining organic matters with carbon content would disappear and the heatingup of the temperature of 450 °C for 2 h or 500 °C, for half hour would cause thedisappearance of 99% of organic matters.Table 1shows that the essential micro nutrients found in the peatland after the ﬁreincluded Cu, Si and Zn. Copper (Cu) was the element found in all of the peatlandafter the ﬁre. The causal factor of the presence of the Cu might be the presence ofthe chelating bonds between organic acid and the metals extant in soil (Stevenson1982 ). Hodgson et al. in Mengel and Kirkby ( 1987 ) suggested that more than 98%of the Cu solution in the soil was stuck by organic matters.The elements of the Zn and the Si represented the essential micro nutrients con-tained only in some areas of the peatland after the ﬁre. The Zn was found only inthe peatland after the severe ﬁre and the land has been covered by vegetation and insecondary forest. Meanwhile, the Si was found only in the peatland after the moder-ate ﬁre and without any vegetation cover. According to Barchia ( 2006 ) the minimumcontent of the essential micro nutrients was common in the peatland. Carbonate andphenol groups in the caution exchange site of the peatland could form complex bonds300 C.

Moreover, the excessivereduction caused the change of the micro elements into their metal forms withoutany load (Andriesse 1988 ).The forest ﬁre that affected the peatland was the one that burned not only forestplants, but also the litters layer and part of the peat materials, especially those inupper layer (Usup et al. 2000 ). This caused the loss of a part of the upper layer ofthe peatland, which in turn caused the change in the environmental condition intomore aerob because of the excessive drainage. Consequently, the peat materials wereexcessively exposed to air ﬂow that resulted in the further change of the peat materialsinto more mature ones.The graph showing the analysis results of the vegetation shows that there was notany secondary forest burned in 2015 with higher diversity index value at the growthlevels of trees pole, stake and seedlings (Fig. 4). This shows that the forest ﬁre causedthe extinction of various species of ﬂora and fauna (Purbowaseso 2004 ). Thus, theforest ﬁre that affected the peatland had direct impact of the decrease in biodiversityalong with its economic values. For example, the forest ﬁre that affected the peat-land in Central Kalimantan in 1997/1998 had burned the trees with high economicvalue such as ramin ( Gonystylus bancanus ) and belangeran ( Shorea blangeran ). Inaddition, it also caused 75% decrease in the density of the trees (D’Arcy and Page2002 ). It was also responsible for the loss of 0.2–0.6 Gt of C and 35–70 cm peat layer(Page et al. 2002 ). The loss of the carbon had extraordinarily signiﬁcant impact onthe emission of the CO2into atmosphere. Meanwhile, the loosing rate of the peatlayer was highly imbalanced with the formation rate and the accumulation of the peatmaterials relatively long time. The peatland grew at the growing rate of 0–3 mm/year.The growing rate of the peatland in Barambai Delta Pulau Petak, South Kalimantanwas about 0.05 mm annually, while it was 0.13 mm/year in Pontianak. It went fasterin Malaysia, which was about 0.22–0.48 mm annually (Noor 2010 ).The Impact of Forest Fire on the Biodiversity and the Soil … 301Conclusion1. The forest ﬁre that affected tropical peatland caused the decrease in the biodiver-sity of the vegetation as indicated by the decrease in Shanon-Whiener’s diversityindex and by the signiﬁcant decrease in the number of the species, the density ofthe individuals of trees.2. The physical and chemical characteristics of the peatland 2 years after the for-est ﬁre changed. It was clearly observed in the volume weight (VW) value, soilorganic carbon, pH, available-N, available-K, and the presence of the essentialmicro elements of Cu, Zn, and Si. At the same time, the decrease in the waterholding capacity (WHC), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and electric conduc-tivity (EC) took place. However, the change in the chemical characteristics of thesoil took place temporarily because of the loss of the nutrients resulting from theleaching, the emission into atmosphere accompanied by other negative impactof the disturbance of hydrological function, the loss of the carbon of the peatlayers, as well as the increase in the temperature.Acknowledgements The authors express their greatest gratitude to SEAMEO BIOTROP , Ministryof Research, Technology and Higher Education RI and UGM Y ogyakarta for their research andpublication funding, and Banjarbaru Environment and Forestry Research and Development Institutefor supports of ﬁeld research materials.

In addition, the newly elected local governments should increasetheir commitment for biodiversity conservation by involving local communities asstewards. To do that Nepal’s rural and urban governments should develop policiesthat align with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11, 13 and 15 formaking cities resilient and sustainable, combat climate change, and protect, restoreand promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss. Toachieve them Nepal needs support from the international community to empowerlocal people to monitor changes, to innovate for the future and adopt sustainabilityin their daily lives.K.

RokaBackgroundClimate change is one of the most important socio-environmental issues today. TheIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) ﬁfth assessment is clear onthe human inﬂuence on the climate system and the widespread impacts it has onhuman and natural systems (IPCC 2014a ,b). IPCC with high conﬁdence claims thefollowing impacts of climate change on the natural system: terrestrial, freshwaterand marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migra-tion patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to climate change.The report further identiﬁes biodiversity conservation as one of the best options tomitigate further changes to the climate. Nepal, which is one of the most vulnerablecountries to climate change, must create policies at the local and national level topromote climate agenda and biodiversity conservation. The policies should integrateadaptation and mitigation as complementary strategies for reducing and managing therisks of climate change (IPCC 2014a ,b). Conservation of biodiversity will continueto provide the much-needed ecosystem services for the people and help to mitigatethe impacts of climate change. Nepal has this unique opportunity to formulate andimplement appropriate policies towards biodiversity conservation at the local levelboth in rural and urban areas. After 20 years of administrative governance, in 2017,Nepali people have elected new representatives for 264 urban municipalities and 480rural municipalities.For over ﬁve decades, Nepal’s conservation programs operated under a top-downbureaucratic structure. The old approach is ill equipped to tackle the problems fromclimate change; therefore, this paper argues for a bottom-up nested approach wherelocal people and their representatives are major actors. This is an opportunity forthe local government to do planning and development activities to conserve existingbiodiversity and promote climate change mitigation and adaptation. Without suchpolicies, Nepal’s vulnerability to climate change will increase from the high to thethreatening level. This paper discusses the impact climate change is having on thebiodiversity in Nepal and why local governments need to conserve biodiversity to acton a climate agenda in the coming years. It recommends ecosystem and landscape-based approaches to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster reduction (Lo2016 ). Large-scale approaches can not only conserve biodiversity but also contributeto the social and economic well-being of local communities.In a communique to the United Nations, Nepal reported an increase in temperatureand decrease in mean rainfall between 1975 and 2005. It also indicated that undervarious climate change scenarios, mean annual temperatures are projected to increaseby 1.3–3.8 °C by 2060 and 1.8–5.8 °CC by 2090. Annual precipitation is projectedto decrease by 10–20% during the same time (GoN 2016 ). Between 1977 and 2010a 29% decrease in ice cover was recorded and the number of glacier lakes increasedby 11%. Out of 75 districts, 29 are highly vulnerable to landslides, 22 to drought, 12to glacier lake outburst ﬂoods (GLOF) and 9 to ﬂooding (MoE 2010 ). Most of theimpact from climate change is felt at the local level and therefore, local governmentis on the front lines of defense.Promoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 307Changes in precipitationAcidificationRising temperaturePeople migrationPhenology and physiologyBiodiversity lossDesertificationRelease of green house gasesAnthropogenic activitiesClimate changeFig. 1 Biodiversity and climate changeThe focus on biodiversity conservation as a mitigation strategy is due to thefact agriculture, forestry, and other land uses account for about 24% of net globalgreenhouse gases (GHGs) (Baccini et al. 2015 ). In addition, the changes in land-useaffect the economic system by adding extra cost towards mitigation and adaptation.The impact on the biodiversity well documented at all ecosystem levels from micro-biomes to large forests, which are experiencing profound changes, and some areeven being pushed to the brink of extinction. Biodiversity conservation will not onlyprotect further loss of species but also serve as a tool to mitigate future damage tothe ecosystem. The inter-play between climate change and biodiversity loss createsa vicious cycle (Fig. 1) where climate change leads to biodiversity loss, which inturn leads to more climate change. Therefore, the only way to break this cycle isto improve biodiversity to create a different path towards sustainability by reducingclimate change. To achieve these ends Nepal needs scientiﬁcally and socially feasiblesolutions. It is very crucial that such solutions operate in concert with local ecosystemand landscape for successful results. In addition, such strategies and policies could bealigned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to whichnational and local governments are committed.The focus of local governments on biodiversity conservation for climate changemitigation has to do with the relationship biodiversity has with many of the SDGs.308 K. RokaHere is one statement of how biodiversity conservation can help meet SDG 1— EndPoverty In All Its Forms Everywhere ,The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, including through sustainable agri-culture based on ecosystem approaches, along with the restoration and safeguarding ofecosystems and the valuable services they provide, can help to prevent men and womenfrom falling into poverty and can help to lift them out of it by increasing their income andreducing their vulnerability to external economic shocks or environmental disasters. (CBD2017 )Indeed, biodiversity conservation is linked positively to all SDGs. Two other SDGsthat relate directly to biodiversity conservation and climate change are SDG 11— TakeUrgent Action To Combat Climate Change And Its Impacts; and SDC 15— Protect,Restore And Promote Sustainable Use Of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Sustainably Man-age Forests, Combat Desertiﬁcation And Halt And Reverse Land Degradation AndHalt Biodiversity Loss . The interdisciplinary focus of the paper will contributetowards a better understanding of the relationship between climate change and bio-diversity, and the rationale for the conservation of the latter. Some of the limitationsof the paper include the lack of data on the impact of climate change on local biodi-versity at the district or regional level, limited access to planning documents of localgovernments, and the lack of primary data on the priorities and perspectives of thenewly elected local government ofﬁcials.Biodiversity in NepalNepal is a land-locked country in south Asia between India in the south and China tothe north. Nepal’s physiography ranges from alluvial plains in the tropical lowlands tothe snow covered Himalayan mountains. It is divided into ﬁve major physiographiczones extending east to west: the high himal, high mountains, middle mountains(middle hills), siwalik ( chure ) and terai (Table 1). IUCN identiﬁed 118 habitat typesin Nepal, which support a rich biodiversity (IUCN 2015).Nepal comprises less than 0.1% of earth’s total land area, but it has signiﬁcantbiodiversity for its size. Nearly 3% of the world’s known ﬂora are found in NepalTable 1 Physiographic and bioclimatic zones of Nepal (GoN 2014 )Physiographic zone Coverage (%) Elevation (m)2Bioclimatic zoneHigh Himal 23 Above 5000 Nival (tundra andarctic)High mountains 19 3000–5000 Subalpine and AlpineMiddle mountains 29 1000–3000 Subtropical andMontane (temperate)Siwalik 15 500–1000 TropicalTerai 14 Below 500 TropicalPromoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 309Table 2 Nepal’s Biodiversity, Government of Nepal (2014)Group Number of observed species percent relative to knownspecies worldwideAngiosperms 6973 3.2Gymnosperms 26 5.1Pteridophytes 534 5.1Bryophytes 1150 8.2Lichens 465 2.3Fungi 1822 2.6Algae 1001 2.5Flora total 11,971 –Mammals 208 5.2Birds 8673 9.5Reptiles 123 1.9Amphibians 117 2.5Fish 230 1.9Butterﬂies 651 3.7Moths 3958 3.6Spiders 175 0.4(Table 2). Nepal has allocated some 23.4% for biodiversity conservation in the formof 12 national parks, 1 wildlife reserve and 6 conservation areas. However, nearly83% of the country’s forest lie outside the protected areas in the form of privateforests and community forests (DFRS 2015 ). In addition, Nepal’s agro-ecosystemsand wetlands are rich in biodiversity that play a crucial role in the conservation andsustainable use of land. Around 550 crop species that have food value are undercultivation (MoFSC 2002 ). On the other hand, wetlands in Nepal support severalthreatened species of ﬂora and fauna. Of the different geographical regions, the mid-hills contain the highest biodiversity where more than one-third of the forests lie(Mendez 2007 ).Nepal’s biological biodiversity is closely linked to the livelihood and economicwell-being of many rural communities (Khatri 2010 ). It touches upon every aspect ofNepalese life, including agricultural productivity, food security, building materials,human health and nutrition, indigenous knowledge, gender equality, culture, climate,water resources and aesthetic value for society (GoN 2014 ). Therefore, any nega-tive changes in the biodiversity will have moderate to severe adverse impact on thelivelihood of these people. The nation’s rich biodiversity is threatened by multipleanthropogenic and natural factors operating at different spatial scales (Bhattachar-jee et al. 2017 ). Major threats include deforestation, biological invasion (invasivespecies), pollution, overexploitation, development of infrastructure, ﬁre, and min-ing. Climate change is predicted to have profound impacts to the biodiversity inthe future, particularly in the mountains. Poaching is responsible for decline of sev-310 K. Rokaeral large animals and some plant species; the high demand for wildlife productsin the international market has put 43 bird species and large mammals like rhino(Rhinoceros unicornis ), tiger ( Panthera tigris tigris ), musk deer ( Moschus chryso-gaster ), pangolin ( Manis sp.) under risk from poaching (GoN 2014 ). In response, thenational government and NGOs are actively involved in managing and preservingthe natural resource heritage.In recent years, conservation efforts by the national government, NGOs, INGOs,and local communities have increased forest cover; however, the gains are not equallydistributed. For example, in 2015 the government reported an increase in forestcover of 40%, up from 29% in 1998 (DFRS 1999 ,2015 ). In the Chitwan-AnnapurnaLandscape (CHAL) of central Nepal the forest area remained unchanged (35.5%)between 1990 and 2010 (WWF 2013 ), whereas forest area declined by 9% in theKailash Sacred Landscape (KSL) from 1990 to 2009 (Uddin et al. 2015 ). Withoutrobust policies and planning, forest loss across the country are projected to intensifyin the future. The role of policymakers and newly elected local leaders has neverbeen so crucial to conserve biodiversity in Nepal.Politics play a large role in Nepal’s natural resource management policies. Forestsare a fertile ground for exploitation by politicians seeking votes; as a result, in pastyears the country lost signiﬁcant area of forests to resettlement and associated activ-ities often with hidden political agendas. Nepal cannot afford to lose more forestresources (Khatri 2010 ). Therefore, it is important to inform and assist policy mak-ers on the environmental and economic beneﬁts of forest conservation. Nepal isa global leader of participatory forest management, which can be a conduit for asuccessful climate change mitigation system.Climate Change and NepalNepal’s unique physiographic and topographic features give rise to its climatic andecological diversity. The climate ranges from subtropical in the south (terai) to arcticin the north (high himal). Around 80% of the precipitation in Nepal occurs duringthe Indian summer monsoon (June–September). The mean precipitation is about1530 mm, with maximum precipitation occurring in the siwalik and middle moun-tains, and the high mountain range receiving less rain. The temperature is highestduring the summer (May–June) in the 36–39 °C range and the winter temperatureminimum averages −3 °C. However, the temperature variability depends on the ele-vation. The terai region is the warmest part of the country, with high temperaturesexceeding 40 °C (Chalise et al. 1996 ).Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change (IPCC 2007 ).Climate change will bring variations in precipitation and increase in temperaturethat will affect glacial and snowpack melting. Both processes will have potentiallysevere socio-environmental consequences as they affect the availability of freshwaterto millions of people and inﬂuence species distribution and survival. WWF Nepalreported in 2017:Promoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 311Climate change has hit Nepal hard, and it has hit fast. It is causing greater variations inweather patterns and more extreme weather events, like the drought that contributed to theexceptional number of wildﬁres that raged across Nepal during 2016’s pre-monsoon season.But the ﬁres are just one small piece of the shifting climate-change picture. The rains,too, have become less predictable, making it more difﬁcult to decide which crops to growand when to plant them. More hailstorms and stronger snows in some areas are affectingagriculture as well. (Seiff 2017 )IPCC’s fourth assessment report projected a temperature rise of 2–4 °C in South Asiaby the end of the century. It also reported an increase in GHGs in the region mostlyfrom anthropogenic activities. This increase in GHGs will cause further warming andlong lasting, possibly, irreversible impacts to the people and the ecosystems. The ﬁfthassessment however projects some reductions in global emissions after 2020 whichwould keep the warming below 2 °C in the region (IPCC 2014a ). Nepal’s high-altituderegions have seen more warming in recent years than the low-lying regions (Thapaet al. 2016 ). According to the government, the average annual warming between 1971and 2014 was 0.056 °C. The biggest change has been recorded in the precipitationlevel. Droughts have become more intense in the central region since the 1980s,and the mean rainfall during the monsoon season has increased from 1981 to 2012(Jeeban et al. 2015 ). In the same time rainfall in other seasons decreased by 1%.Climate Change Impacts on Biodiversity in NepalWorldwide numerous studies have observed the impact of climate change on biodi-versity. Some of the responses from species to climate change include changing theirphenology events like blooming, migration and breeding (Parmesan and Matthews2005 ; Bellard et al. 2012 ). The impact could happen at the species level where itwill affect the synchrony with species’ food and habitat requirement (Bellard et al.2012 ). At the ecosystem level, it could affect vegetation communities and even altertheir composition. At higher altitude, species are expected to expand northwards andshift their tree lines upwards at the expense of low stature tundra and alpine commu-nities (Alo and Wang 2008 ). Because of climate change several species are alteringtheir range, mostly at higher altitudes (Tingley et al. 2012 ), while some harmfulpathogens are causing alarming declines in amphibian populations at lower altitudes(Bosch et al. 2007 ). One of the most extremes outcome of unchecked climate changeis species extinction (Bellard et al. 2012 ).The knowledge on the impacts of climate change on Nepal’s biodiversity is limited.Some of the known consequences listed by the national government are, (i) shiftsin agro-ecological zones, prolonged dry spells, and higher incidences of pests anddiseases, (ii) increased temperature and rainfall variability, (iii) increased emergenceand quickened spread of invasive alien plant species, (iv) increased incidence of forestﬁre in recent years, (v) changes in phenological cycles of tree species, (vi) shifting oftreeline in the Himalaya, and (vii) depletion of wetlands. However, available research312 K. Rokaﬁnding on the impact of climate change on individual plant and animal species ismore pronounced, and indicate the need for immediate actions.Studies on the impact of climate change on forests in Nepal are related to alti-tude variations (Thapa et al. 2016 ). Climate projection show lower and mid-montaneforests are more vulnerable than upper montane and subalpine forests. The low andmid-montane forests are predicted to decrease in size into small patches of microrefu-gia and may act as “climate corridors” for species forced to shift northwards, whilethe subalpine scrub vegetation continues to shift range northwards (Thapa et al.2016 ). Other notable alterations in forests in the Himalayas include early averageonset of the growing season and increased length of the growing season. In westernHimalayas, researchers have found an overall longer growing season, while littlevariation was recorded in central and eastern Himalayas (Shrestha et al. 2012 ). Atthe species level, several alpine plant species exhibited distribution differences undercurrent climate conditions versus future scenarios. Many species are projected to shiftnorthwards and shrink in overall distribution under future climate scenarios (Songet al. 2004 ). Himalayan ﬁr ( Abies spectabilis ) responded negatively to temperaturerise with slow growth rate and its tree line extending northwards in response to cli-mate change (Gaire et al. 2011 ). For some species like the Chinese caterpillar fungus(Ophiocordyceps sinensis ), a potential loss of habitat and possible range extensionare predicted for the future (Shrestha and Bawa 2014 ). As forests support biodiver-sity and ecosystem services to local communities, changes in the forest ecosystemcan prove catastrophic to humans and animals.Negative effects of climate change on several species of animals are also predicted.Most of the impact will be in their distribution and loss of habitat from changingprecipitation and rising temperature. For example, a 30% loss of habitat is predictedfor snow leopard ( Panther uncia ) mainly along the southern distribution range due tothe projected shrinking of the alpine zones (Forrest et al. 2012 ). A population extir-pation risk is predicted for several species of salamanders and frogs with changingprecipitation levels (McCain and Colwell 2011 ). Distribution of invertebrate specieswere found to be signiﬁcantly related to altitude variation in the central Himalayas.Of the 78 species studied, 79% exhibited a negative response to increasing altitude,which is predicted to occur in the future (Shah et al. 2015 ).All future scenarios under the current climate condition predict signiﬁcant impactto Nepal’s biodiversity. In addition to the direct impact to the native species, climatechange could assist in the expansion and distribution of invasive species, which wouldoutcompete with the native ﬂora and fauna.Nearly 75% of Nepal’s population depend on agriculture, which is highly cli-mate sensitive and increasingly at risk from climate change impacts (CDKN 2017 ).Key effects of climate change on agriculture include declining water availability forirrigation, increasing peak ﬂood ﬂows, changing river morphology and decliningcrop yields (at higher altitudes) (Pradhan 2017 ). The projected changes from climatechange will exacerbate the existing harmful impacts in the agriculture sector. It isexpected an increase in dryness in drought-prone areas and wetter conditions in wetareas where plant species may not adapt to the new production conditions. On theother hand, temperature increase means crops like rice and wheat can be grown inPromoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 313higher altitudes (Gautam 2008 ). A 4 °C increase in temperature would lead to increasein rice yield in the terai by 3.4%, in the hills by 17.9% and in the mountains 36.1%. Atthe same time, climate change can delay crop maturity and destroy local species. Cli-mate change will also affect livestock in higher altitudes that are essential to people’slivelihood. Resident of Mustang (a high-altitude district) reported increased preva-lence of new livestock diseases, increase in mortality, decrease in animal breedingbehavior, and decrease in animal productivity (Koirala and Shrestha 2014 ). At higheraltitude, climate change associated temperature changes has resulted in less snow-fall and rapid melting of snow, which in turn caused less water in the upper part ofthe region, lower ground water discharge, less grass production, weaker agriculturalproduction, and a changing ecosystem (Aryal et al. 2014 ).Nepal’s forests are an integral part of what is essentially an agrarian society. Forexample, forest litter and livestock manure are the main source of fertilizer, andfuelwood is the main energy source for 70% of the population. Climate change willnot only affect forest biodiversity but also the livelihood of millions of people whodepend on the biodiversity. According to the government of Nepal, the likely impactof climate change on biodiversity can be categorized into three likely scenarios (GoN2014 ):(a) The climatic range of many species will move upward in elevation from their currentlocations. This will have differential effects on species. Some species will migrate throughfragmented landscapes whilst others may not be able to do so.(b) Many species that are already vulnerable are likely to become extinct. Species withlimited climatic ranges and/or with limited geographical opportunities (e.g., mountain topspecies), species with restricted habitat requirements, and/or small populations are typicallythe most vulnerable.(c) Changes in the frequency, intensity, extent, and locations of climatically and non-climatically induced disturbances will affect how and at what rate the existing ecosystemswill be replaced by new plant and animal assemblages.The High Himal and High Mountain areas are likely to experience the largest transfor-mations. Among the natural habitats, remnant native grasslands are highly vulnerableto the impacts of climate change (Koirala and Shrestha 2014 ). The threats to biodiver-sity are affected by several underlying social, political, economic, technological andcultural variables that also contribute to climate change. According to the nationalgovernment, the growth of population, along with changing density and distributionpatterns, are believed to have contributed to loss and degradation of forest habitats indifferent ways, including increased forest encroachment for agricultural expansionsand increased pressure to meet energy and timber needs (GoN 2014 ). Therefore,policies towards biodiversity conservation under the climate change predictions arekey to prevent further loss of biodiversity in Nepal. These policies should be part ofthe local government’s priority in the coming years.314 K. RokaClimate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation at the LocalLevelAccording to the IPCC, mitigation and adaptation are complementary approachesfor reducing risks of climate change impacts over different time-scales (IPCC 2007 ).Mitigation will reduce climate change impacts in the short and long-term, adaptationwill reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to future changes. Localgovernments can play a signiﬁcant role in planning and implementing mitigationand adaptation strategies in coordination with the national government, as the IPCCstated:National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation throughcoordinating actions and providing frameworks and support. While local government andthe private sector have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly rec-ognized as critical to progress in adaptation given their roles in scaling up adaptation ofcommunities, households, and civil society and in managing risk information and ﬁnancing.(IPCC Fourth Assessment 4.4.2.1, 2007 )At the national level, Nepal has made climate change an important topic and devel-oped adaptation and preparation plans to adapt and mitigate climate change. A high-level Climate Change Council under the Prime Minster was formed in 2009 to guideclimate change adaptation and mitigation. In 2008, the government also created theNational Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to prioritize community basedcoping strategies for climate-induced vulnerability. In addition, Nepal has taken sev-eral initiatives to reduce climate hazards and build resilience. Nepal’s communiqueto the UNFCC includes a detailed list of actions and strategies the government isplanning to implement as agreed under the Paris Agreement of 2015. Such plans oftenappear great on paper but poor on implementation. The ﬁrst step towards biodiversityconservation under the future climate scenario is to close the gaps within the currentconservation system. Nepal became part of the Convention on Biological Diversityin 1994; however, it failed to enact comprehensive legislation for conservation ofbiodiversity and sustainable use.The current policies on environment, development, and local governance lackclear objectives on biodiversity conservation. For example, the Agriculture sector’soveremphasis on commercialization may undermine biodiversity management (GoN2014 ). Many of the laws at various levels are not well connected and coordinated andoften contradict each other. The Forest Act of 1993 and the Local Self-GovernanceAct of 1999 differ on how the revenue from the sale of forest products should bedistributed. The Forest Act states local user groups can manage the revenue inde-pendently; on the other hand, the Self-Governance Act stipulates the revenue shouldgo into the district fund. It is clear Nepal’s well-intentioned policies and strategiesfor biodiversity conservation are marred by implementation and evaluation difﬁcul-ties. Therefore, the newly elected local governments should prioritize biodiversityconservation into all development and planning programs. Some of the agendas mayPromoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 315require improvising the existing management system, like the community forestryprogram, while other frameworks must be implemented or tested to mitigate furtherimpact from climate change.Models of Adaptive ManagementDesigning a climate change strategy for the future is riddled with uncertainty; how-ever, inaction is not an option. Climate change adaptation is a way to modify strategiesto persist and succeed under new and changing climate conditions (Abrahms et al.2017 ). This paper focuses on the ecosystem-based adaptation similar to IPCC’s def-inition, “initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and humansystems against actual or expected climate change effects” (IPCC 2007 ). One way tobuild a strategy is by using local scenario planning, which creates multiple plausiblefutures to evaluate the outcomes and consequences of different decisions (Petersonet al. 2003 ). Several adaptive management frameworks for ecosystems are available;this paper recommends three frameworks (adopted from Abrahms et al. 2017 ) thatare pertinent to Nepal’s biodiversity.(a) Adaptation for conservation targets (ACT) framework—The ACT frameworkoffers a structured approach to speciﬁc adaptation action (species/ecosystem)and has been implemented across North America. It includes six steps to climatechange adaptation: (1) identify the conservation feature of interest and deﬁneconservation objectives, (2) build a conceptual model to assess impacts of pos-sible future scenarios, (3) identify management options, (4) prioritize actions,(5) implement actions, and (6) monitor and evaluate outcomes.(b) Climate-smart conservation (CSC) framework—This offers a structuredapproach to integrate climate-change adaptation into existing planning pro-cesses. The CSC framework consists of seven steps: (1) deﬁne conservationobjectives, (2) identify key climate vulnerabilities, (3) revise objectives as nec-essary, (4) identify management options, (5) prioritize actions, (6) implementactions, and (7) monitor and evaluate outcomes.(c) Portfolio decision analysis (PDA) framework—The PDA framework offers aquantitative approach to selecting a portfolio for management actions wherethere is a trade-off between human activities and biodiversity conservation.Its purpose is to maximize natural assets while minimizing impacts to humanassets. It also includes six steps: (1) identify natural and human assets of interest,(2) determine vulnerabilities of and risks to assets, (3) identify potential man-agement actions, (4) quantify the ‘effectiveness’ value of management actions,(5) determine costs of management actions, and (6) determine an optimal set ofmanagement actions given costs and budget constraints.Nepal has already achieved success in the management and conservation of bio-diversity by integrating social, economic and environmental values in its policies.Nepal’s conservation policies have transformed from ‘people exclusionary’ and316 K. Roka‘species focused’ towards ‘people-centered and community based’ in recent years(DNPWC 2017 ). The government of Nepal amended its National Park and WildlifeConservation Act of 1973 to allocate 30–50% of the total revenue from parks andconservation areas into local community development. Communities, local author-ities, and civil society organizations are now directly involved in various activitiesto promote integrated and long-term conservation management. To manage the pro-tected areas, the government of Nepal has collaborated with international organiza-tions like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the WorldWildlife Fund (WWF). In the global platform, Nepal is a party and or a signatory tointernational treaties like Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), GlobalTiger Fund (GTF), Ramsar, South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN),United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) WorldHeritage Convention (DNPWC 2017 ). The community forestry program has proveneffective in mitigating climate change by sequestrating carbon and in regulatingweather patterns (Pandey et al. 2016 ; Khanal et al. 2017 ). The community forestryprogram’s success suggests that any conservation efforts in Nepal should be inte-grated with the people’s livelihood. Promoting biodiversity conservation in the agri-culture sector can be effective in emulating participatory conservation outside theforestry sector.Since agriculture is the mainstay for majority of the Nepalese, this sector shouldbe protected from the adverse impacts of climate change. To do that the governmentpolicies should integrate agro-biodiversity into its planning and assist farmers withtechnical and ﬁnancial resources to continue producing food for the future. Additionalbeneﬁts of agro-biodiversity and agro-ecosystems will help with climate changemitigation, biodiversity conservation, and water conservation.At the local level, this requires farmers participation in the decision-making pro-cess. Improving current practices of in situ conservation of crop and livestock geneticresources, using local seeds and research and promotion of adaptive traits of localcrops are ways to help farmers. It is crucial to make usable knowledge accessible tofarmers, make policies more sensitive to smallholder farmers, and create incentivesfor private sector to promote climate-smart agriculture (Poudel 2017 ). The climate-smart agriculture approach can be used to increase ecological diversity by helpingfarmers to plant new crops and seeds, build home garden, practice mixed farming,establish community seed banks, and multi-use water systems (Poudel et al. 2017 ).Other local level strategies include planting native grass, constructing water holes,rainwater harvesting and monitoring of distribution and shift of trees (Aryal et al.2014 ). These activities will not only sustain livelihood options but also conservebiodiversity.Managing biodiversity under climate change is challenging for a poor country likeNepal. One of the biggest obstacles to Nepal’s climate agenda is funding. Currently,nearly 55% of the total climate change expenditure comes from donor support (Nepal2012 ). Even though the national government has increased the budget for climatechange, it is only 10.34% of the total budget. Of the different programs, nearly 45% ofPromoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 317the climate change expenses were allocated for forests and biodiversity conservation(Oxfam 2014 ). These programs are already having an impact on climate changeadaptation and mitigation as evident a recent project.Success Story: Hariyo Ban ProjectIn August 2011, WWF Nepal initiated one of the largest, most complex conservation,development and climate change projects in the country (Seiff 2017 ). Hariyo Ban(green forest), a $40 million project funded by the USAID was implemented inpartnership with CARE, the Federation of Community Forest Users Nepal, and theNational Trust for Nature Conservation. It was designed at the landscape-level asa community-driven approach to conserving biodiversity and assisting people toadapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon.It covered two major landscapes: the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) andTerai Arc Landscape (TAL). Initial assessment by WWF found the CHAL was morevulnerable to climate change and people in the area suffered from landslides, cropfailures and changes in rainfall patterns. For ﬁve years, the Hariyo Ban worked withthousands of local people and Nepal’s government to mitigate climate change. Itclaims to have sequestrated an estimated 3.7 million tons of carbon emissions in theforests (Netra Sharma, USAID).The success of the project is visible from the size of the land area conserved,the climate change adaptation activities undertaken, and biodiversity conservationachieved (Table 3). The project’s success offers hope for Nepal to come out frombeing one of the most vulnerable nations to a successful example of mitigationand adaptation to climate change. As one participant in the project said, “beforeHariyo Ban, the forest was very thin, after we started to take care of the forest,conservation improved, and the forest has become denser.” The chief operating ofﬁcerof WWF, Marcia Marsh, summed up the project’s success as being both social andenvironmental.Biodiversity conservation is a multipurpose objective. It can serve as a bufferduring extreme climate and weather events like rainfalls, droughts, storms, and land-slides. Conservation of resilient and disease resistant plants, livestock breeds, andﬁsh will tackle food insecurity and empower local communities. Promoting agro-biodiversity will foster soil microorganisms and maintain soil’s physical and ecolog-ical health, ultimately improving soil fertility. Integrating biodiversity conservationin urban planning will contribute to sustainable human settlements. Even in urbanareas, healthy ecosystems can provide protection and resilience from extreme weatherevents and disasters (CBD 2017 ). Overall, ecosystem-based approaches contributeto all SDGs to achieve social, economic and environmental targets. Speciﬁcally, bio-diversity conservation is key to mitigation and adaptation efforts for countries likeNepal. This will also fulﬁll Nepal’s commitment to climate change at the global level.318 K.

(CBD 2017 )Implementing the climate agenda for biodiversity and INDCs objectives in Nepalfaces many challenges. First, there is a dearth of capacity at all levels of the bureau-cracy that does not understand how potentially detrimental the impacts of climatechange would be on the economy. Second, the heavy dependence on subsistenceagriculture puts many farmers at risks from small changes (both positive and neg-ative) in the environment. Third, the topography presents challenges for potentialadaptation process. The isolation created by the geography affects mobilization ofresources and technology for adaptation and mitigation. Fourth, rapid urbanizationhas pushed the government to the brink to fulﬁll the needs of the people. Furthermore,urban expansion into ecological sites and pressure on the local environment imposenewer challenges to adaptation. Fifth, a history of institutional failures and politicalinstability, both at the national and local level, will hinder effective adaptation andimplementation of policies. This has led to high turnover of government staff, reorga-Promoting Climate Agenda and Biodiversity Conservation … 319nization of public institutions, and ineffective coordination and collaboration amongpolitical parties and interest groups. Sixth, climate change and biodiversity conserva-tion have not been an issue during elections. Only three parties had included climatechange in their manifesto and development associated activities like constructionand production dominated the manifesto of all political parties in the local electionof 2017. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes the local govern-ment play a larger role in creating locally feasible adaptation and mitigation plansfor climate change. Biodiversity conservation should be an integral component ofall plans as it is the cost-effective strategy that is already widely practiced and hasproduced successful results on climate change. Therefore, the paper recommendsthe following to the local governments of Nepal:(1) Address the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by investing on timelyactions to reduce further biodiversity loss;(2) Plan and implement ecosystem-based approaches to tackle current and futureclimate change impacts;(3) Develop education and awareness programs for the public on the importance ofbiodiversity for climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduc-tion;(4) Recognize the role of protected and conservation areas in climate change adap-tation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction;(5) Promote ecosystem-based approaches in rural and urban areas;(6) Use existing tools and techniques to enhance ecosystem-based approaches and,where necessary, reﬁne these tools and techniques; and(7) Ensure climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction activ-ities include indigenous and local knowledge and beneﬁts them.ConclusionThe main objective of this paper was to discuss the relationship between climatechange and biodiversity in Nepal, and how local governments can mitigate someof the impacts by integrating biodiversity conservation in their governance. Underthe current and future scenario, climate change will have immeasurable impactson Nepal’s biodiversity. Ecosystems and communities at higher elevations will bemost affected from environmental change. This gives the newly elected local govern-ments a window of opportunity to develop and implement policies that will promotebiodiversity conservation and tackle climate change. The focus on governance isimportant as past and existing policies to tackle climate change were poorly imple-mented. In addition, good governance is fundamental to make progress in adapting toclimate change and mitigate its impacts. The newly elected local government offersexcellent opportunity to carve a path towards a future where economic, social andenvironmental values are equally considered. The paper focused on one of the manyways to mitigate climate change- promoting biodiversity conservation. Furthermore,320 K. RokaNepal can use its experience with participatory resource governance towards climatechange mitigation and adoption. The paper offers the following prospects for thefuture: capacity building of local governments, integrating relevant SDGs in localplanning, strengthening collaboration between local and national government for bio-diversity conservation, and seeking international support to design and implementconservation programs for climate change mitigation and adaptation.There are ample policies and strategies developed by the government, NGOs andINGOs to address climate change in Nepal. However, translating those policies intotangible actions with funding and skilled human resources is a challenge (Poudel2017 ). Failing to implement a successful mitigation strategy would affect achieve-ment of other objectives related to human health, food security, biodiversity, localenvironmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable devel-opment (IPCC 2014a ,b). Importantly, biodiversity conservation will assist Nepalto achieve its SDGs. Therefore, increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climatechange implies a concerted effort through interactions and connections among humanhealth, water, energy, land use, and biodiversity. To do this the national and localgovernments could collaborate with the many bilateral and multilateral organiza-tions working in Nepal, and connect with the international community. Not actingto mitigate climate change would irreversibly damage the ecosystem of Nepal.Nepal is already a leader in participatory conservation practices. The communityforestry program’s success in restoring forests should be applied towards climatechange mitigation and biodiversity conservation. The diversiﬁcation of participa-tory practices will conserve species and support livelihoods. As the senior climatechange expert with the WWF said, “you can’t do good conservation, without learningfrom the people who live there and helping meet their needs” (Seiff 2017 ). Futureconservation practices need public participation in urban and rural areas. The rapidurbanization in Nepal could result in an increase in GHGs through consumption andland conversion; therefore, the future cities should be sustainable with lots of greenspaces, biodiversity refuges, and powered by renewable energy. Climate change,therefore, offers an opportunity for the local governments to commit to biodiversityconservation and make Nepal an example of successful of climate change mitigationand adaptation in the region or probably in the world.ReferencesAbrahms B, DiPietro D, Grafﬁs A, Hollander A (2017) Managing biodiversity under climate change:challenges, frameworks, and tools for adaptation.

WWF Nepal Hariyo Ban Program, Kathmandu, NepalClimate and Biological Diversity: HowShould the Effects of Climate Changeon Biological Diversity Be LegallyAddressed in Internationaland Comparative Law and Solutions?Sergio Peña-NeiraAbstract International treaties and declarations on climate change have focusedalmost exclusively on sources of climate change neglectfully the consequences onbiodiversity the ultimate foundation for life on Earth. Although extremely appro-priate, such approach neglect to the consequences of climate change on biologicaldiversity and on their components (animals, plants, insects, microorganisms andhabitats) almost condemned to disappear due their impossibility to move or adapt.Therefore, a lack of legal rules in international law has arisen due to lack of inter-national legal framework to address loss biodiversity by conserving it in a mixtureof forms of conservation. An example is reﬂected in “climate change and the law”a report of the Argentine Association of Comparative Law to the XVIII Congressof the International Academy of Comparative Law (author Professor Erkki Hollo).In this report, consequence of climate change on the biological diversity has notbeen addressed due to lack of legal rules (among other reasons). Sustaining agricul-ture and agrobiodiversity to maintain food production for human beings is part ofthe “ecosystem services” of biodiversity that have been completely forgotten whenthe consequences of climate change has not been properly addressed. In order toﬁll scientiﬁc gap grounds from natural science and juridical sciences particularly,international law will be explained in this article arguing for preventive measuresto save biodiversity in danger. It is a conceptual paper as most of our work in sci-ences. First the paper will establish not only the relationship between n the effectsS.

Peña-Neiraof climate change on biodiversity for legal scholars but solutions to the problem willbe discussed. Most of the literature on the subject seems to lack the importance ofinternational law and public policy on facing the aforementioned problem and it isnot possible to “act” without legal rules.IntroductionFocusing on destruction of biodiversity due to consequences of changes in climate bya lack of legal rules is basic because knowing legal solutions against destruction ofbiodiversity by climate change might be a contribution to prevent such annihilation.Reasons for such lack are not clear but maintaining such lack of legal rules mightbe extremely costly due to biodiversity loss including unknown species and their“ecosystem services”.Lambers has depicted in a serial of warrants this problem: “Move, adapt or perish.(…) Species may face extinction if habitat sizes shrink (for example, at the pole or atmountain points) (…), or if immigration barriers (D) or limited dispersal ability (…)prevent them from reaching newly suitable habitat” (Lambers Ris 2015 ). In certaincases, some species are “migrating” to other places. However, such a migration shouldbe under help of law by promoting conservation of species or allowing movement ofmembers of these species (Hurlbert 2015 ; Araújo 2015 ) or encouraging movement ofbiodiversity by human beings to conserve it in different but safer places. A procedureof interpretation of current legal rules or enactment of international legal rules arebasic forms of solving a lack of rules.Certainly, biodiversity plays a key role on giving human beings quality of life.The reasons for prevention and content of effects of climate change on biodiversity isthat a large amount of our needs as specie is intimate related to biodiversity and it ispossible to human beings to adapt to the effects of climate change but is uncertain forbiodiversity itself. Without such adaptation, most probably, biodiversity will perishand as human beings, we will not be able to sustain the needs of food of an ever-increasing population. Further, it is necessary to establish not only the connectionin international legal rules but to deﬁne certain basic possibilities for solving thelegal gap. What it is much more important, connections between climate change andbiodiversity has been addressed since the 1960s (e.g. Rachel Carson’s books silentspring, to mention one of many titles) (Carson 1962 ) but we have not been able toconsider such relationship together. Supposedly this was the basic feature, the basicrationale behind both aforementioned international treaties and considering the bookof Carson this should be the main focus of international research but still there is nottransdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research on climate change. This article mightbe a ﬁrst step not only to discuss the topic but to propose certain solutions, legally, andof course, in public policy aiming to consider further research from natural scientists.Some solutions seems to be impossible, for example: (1) biodiversity corridors(however, they would create international troubles as well as national one relatedto problems of speed of biodiversity and capacity to deﬁne places in which thisClimate and Biological Diversity: How Should the Effects of Climate … 327diversity might have opportunity to survive. The problem is not only at species levelbut at ecosystems, habitats and other levels). (2) Our proposal is a combination onwhat has been the rule of law established in the Convention on Biological Diversity,conservation ex situ and in situ (Articles 7 and 8). In other words, a change of habitats,ecosystems and species from one place to another place considering informationfrom natural science. However, international environmental governance (Galaz et al.2012 ) still has not solved this issue, for example Conventions on Biological Diversityand on Climate Change and even the recent Paris Agreement has not addressed theproblem.(I) ConventionsIn general terms legal norms expresses policy on a subject. As far as biodiversityand climate change are concerned, international policy has been expressed by largegroups of States in international legal rules: conventions on biological diversity andclimate change.The Convention on Biological Diversity (ONU 1992a ) aims conservation ofgenetic resources by establishing conservation or ex situ or in situ in articles 8 and9 of this treaty (ONU 1992a ). On the other hand, the Framework Convention onClimate Change (ONU 1992b ) has not addressed the effects of climate change onbiodiversity. Even recent convention, the Paris Agreement has included internationalrights and obligations on the subject and only a reference has been placed in paragraph14th of the Preamble (ONU 2015 ). However, the Convention on Biological Diversityhas included an article generating a solution based on interpretation of internationallegal rules. Article 22 expressly prevent conﬂicts with rights and obligations statedin other treaties unless exercising them might bring negative consequences for bio-diversity (ONU 1992a ). Negative consequences like disappearance or great damagefor biodiversity would be possible, therefore a common interpretation in which notonly sources for climate change should be addressed but consequences too.(II) Lack of Legal Rules on Conservation Vis a Vis Effects of Change of ClimateAs pointed out already, the Convention on Biological Diversity (ONU 1992a ) andthe Framework Convention on Climate Change (ONU 1992b ) have different aims.We will call them “static”. They rule or conservation, sustainable use or utilization ofgenes’ from individual in species and even conservation of individuals and speciesas well as their technological change (ONU 1992a ) or sources of the effects of thechange of climate. They were not established to address in a proper way consequencesfor biodiversity arising from effects of the change of climate and other sources.In 1992 rules in both conventions were considered sufﬁcient to solve the prob-lem (Conserving genetic resources and biodiversity and diminishing CO2): a clearapplication internationally and nationally of both conventions would diminish nega-tive effects of climate change on biodiversity. Even internationally such combinationof conventions have not been considered properly and it is far from solving suchproblem.The lack of legal rule is based on change of conditions as consequence of climatechange and the need of new sites of individuals or species and even ecosystems.328 S. Peña-NeiraAs already pointed out, one pressing problem is disappearance of natural habitatsof individuals, species or ecosystems due to climate change effects’. Therefore,such change might be developed on individuals’ or species’ own decision based ondetection of negative effects of change of climate and promoting such behaviour.Such movement might be developed with or without help of human beings.“Biodevastation” by illegal trafﬁc of species is another direct threat to animalsand, at the same time, an indirect threat to plants, insects and microorganisms. Directthreat means devastation of one species of animals provoking loss of one part ofthe trophic chain and, at the same, an increasing number of other animals, evenplants and insects due to the loss of this specie (Bellard 2012 ). Illegal trafﬁcking ofcertain species and even illegal trafﬁc of parts or pieces of exemplars of a speciehas increased. As pointed out by a recent report species in the Red List of CITES(International Convention of Trade of Endangered Species) are likely to disappear ifsuch trafﬁc would not detain (ONU 2016 ). This “biodevastation” is a further attackagainst biodiversity making more difﬁcult to safe it against the climate change.(III) Scientiﬁc Elements from a Pure Natural Science Viewpoint (Aspects of Bio-diversity Conservation and Destruction)One author expresses that “anthropogenic climate change can alter interspeciﬁc inter-actions and produce unexpected changes in species distributions, community struc-ture, and diversity.” (Harley 2011 ). The statement makes clear negative consequencesto biodiversity due to Climate change of anthropogenic source (Bateman et al. 2013 ).Although conventions on conservation, international agreements, have beenenacted not much understanding of normative legally binding system has been devel-oped. Clear examples are “effectiveness”, “amount of treaties”, “scope and partici-pation” without including political willingness to deﬁne absence of effectiveness ofthese international treaties. The importance of international treaties is related to aﬁrst step in order to achieve conservation of natural resources.(a) The General Effects on Biodiversity (IPCC)In 2003 the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity addressed effects onbiodiversity of climate change (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity2002 ). As well, in 2002 The Framework Convention on Climate Changes has con-fronted this problem (Gitay et al. 2002 ). Expected and speciﬁc effects on biodiversitywere, among others, poleward or upward movements of climatic range, extinction,replacement or change of existing ecosystems at the ecosystem or landscape scale,change of productivity of certain crops (upward or downward) (Secretariat of theConvention on Biological Diversity 2002 ). Further, the atmosphere is changing dueto concentration of greenhouse gases provoking that temperature has increased in theglobal mean surface, earth and sea (Gitay et al. 2002 ) swelling the temperature onbiological system during the 20th Century, changing “the timing of biological events(phenology), species distribution and streamﬂow, ﬂoods, droughts, water tempera-ture and water quality and high latitude ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere,”and increasing “frequency and intensity of outbreaks of pests and diseases”, affectingClimate and Biological Diversity: How Should the Effects of Climate … 329adversely coral reefs, ecosystems with diseases and toxicity, ﬁsh populations (Gitayet al. 2002 ). Such consequences has been described by some as affection of humanwell-being due to destruction or affection of “ecosystem services” (Watson et al.2005 ).It is possible to ﬁnd as framework of this research a lack of legal rules in conservingbiodiversity (due to negative consequences of climate change on biodiversity) as oneof the reasons for this problem. As well, climate change on marine biodiversity shouldbe addressed due to increasing problems in the subject (Galaz et al. 2012 ). On theother hand, researchers have developed few answers: Acclimation capacity of plantsand animals as well as “topography and ‘microclimatic buffering’” are elementsaltering conclusions of many models on destruction of biodiversity by climate change(Wilis and Bhagwat 2009 ). Topography seems to be the main problem not consideredin earlier models (Wilis and Bhagwat 2009 ). Further, “habitat heterogeneity resultingfrom topographic diversity might be essential” for conservation of biota (Wilis andBhagwat 2009 ). Even high impact of CO2in the atmosphere might create a positiveoutcome in the Amazonas, maintaining main features of the area as explained byHoorn et al. ( 2010 ) because biomes or “remain the same” or might be “substituteby wetter or more productive biomass” but only if dry season is not extended than4 months (Wilis and Bhagwat 2009 ). In this view, the level of extinction diminished(Wilis and Bhagwat 2009 ). Certainly, it is necessary to agree that complexity anduncertainty on the kind of extinction is currently present. However, it seems necessarynot only to research but, more than this, to prevent extinction from more speciﬁcspecies and individuals without the capacity to move from one place to another.Legally speaking some scholars has addressed the subject, most notably Morgera(2011 ,2012 ) and Hodas ( 2005 ). What must be emphasized is that decisions in theConference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity are not legallybinding (ONU 1992a ). Article 23 of the Convention of Biological Diversity has notestablished legally binding decisions of the Conference of the Parties. Certainly,the acceptance of protocols, amendments, annexes and even subsidiary bodies hasbeen included in the competence of the Conference of the Parties. However, a directamendment other orders included in decisions of the conference are far from obliga-tory. “Moratoriums of geoengineering” (Morgera 2011 ,2012 ) are not internationallylegally binding. Certainly, everyone might agree that rules in the Convention on Bio-logical Diversity might be helpful for diminishing negative effects on biodiversity(Morgera 2011 ), however, they were “designed” to achieve the goals of the conventiontherefore their broadness in the area of conservation includes effects of contamina-tion, illegal trade, etc. Further, all the legal rules in the Convention on BiologicalDiversity has established international rights and international obligations. Thinkingcontrary might derived in negative consequences for all treaties of the world. TheVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ( 1969 ) developed international rights andinternational obligations as consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty (article26) and to third parties (articles 35 and 36). Certainly, from a pure governance view,treaties might be considered in a different way, for example, as indications on how tobehave. However, parties are obliged to comply their international obligations, they330 S. Peña-Neirahave to honoured them and use these international obligations as indications. Theyhave to implement them in a narrow sense, apply them.Therefore, it is possible to explain that negative effects on biodiversity from cli-mate change depend on various factors related to features of Earth’s surface. Further,it is necessary, for legal enactment of rules to consider legal quality of Decisions.They are just outcomes of the Conference of the Parties without legally binding rules.(b) The Speciﬁc Effects on BiodiversityIt is possible to ﬁnd examples of negative consequences to biodiversity. Some spe-ciﬁc cases will be explained, brieﬂy however, it has been described earlier start ofbreeding, earlier migration of birds and insects, change of timing of breeding provok-ing a mismatch with food species creating a surplus of certain species and possibledisappearance of others due to lack of hunting and shortage of food (Gitay et al.2002 ).(b.1) Change on Forests and BiodiversityBateman et al. ( 2013 ) has pointed out the negative consequences in biodiversity bythe effects of climate change when a change of the use of land should be made. In theUK National Ecosystem Assessment one of the main outcomes, methodologicallyspeaking, was the consequence of on “optimal land uses” (Bateman et al. 2013 ). All“scenarios”, six, using rule based approach, explain vast changes to land in England(Bateman et al. 2013 ). All scenarios will produce a change more or less negative andthe “best” case scenario is current pattern of use of lands but without an increasein productivity unless the CO2increases (Bateman et al. 2013 ). However, this willprovoke a destruction of biodiversity derived from the extreme agricultural use of theland without a precise improvement in the quality of life of people. This conclusionmight be interesting for the UK’s agricultural sector, North in the Hemisphere, butnot for countries in the Southern part of the Northern Hemisphere or in the Northernpart of the Northern Hemisphere.Boreal forests are almost 30% of the global area of forests and losing them willcreate large gaps on ecosystem services (Gauthier 2015 ). On a regular base they areat high latitude (Northern or Southern Hemispheres). They are accustoming to strongwinters with snow and low temperatures providing wood and shelter against windand other services like conservation of animals, plants and microorganisms as wellas the protection of water ﬂows. They have large biodiversity between the speciesof trees even a “high population-level genetic diversity” (Gauthier 2015 ). Humansare provoking the creation of “extreme weather events” by very low proﬁle events,even unperceived by human beings (Kerr 2007 ). Such events will change the currentenvironment of boreal forests. It is a matter of time facing environmental change anddisappearance of this forest.On the other side of the world, rich biodiversity will disappear as consequence ofeffects of climate change, for example India, Brazil, South Africa (Mehdi 2010 ).Climate and Biological Diversity: How Should the Effects of Climate … 331(IV) Proposals for a Solution of the Destruction of BiodiversitySolutions in Saving BiodiversitySome proposals for solutions in saving biodiversity acknowledged the uncertaintyof the future of biodiversity (Hallegatte 2008 ) and might be explained shortly as ﬁrstknowing what is there and their distribution (Jetz et al. 2007 ) through knowledgeand later deﬁne which species to save and why. The “geography of life on earth” isextremely poor documented (Jetz et al. 2007 ). Therefore, it is needed further work onthis matter for example global tracking of animals, plants and microorganisms. Todayit is possible such tracking using international space stations following small animalsas a project (Pennisi 2013 ). However, the question remains, we do not know everysingle species of biodiversity. Further, we are not able to have even a small amount of“usable knowledge” (“data analysis and forecast”) and explanations (adapted fromKerr 2007 ) to take measures vis a vis conserving biodiversity. Such information mighthelp to tackle speciﬁc ecosystems, animals, plants, insects and microorganisms orgeneral ecosystems but with speciﬁc aims saving those that might be in speciﬁc andnear danger like the one nearby shores in which the sea will be risen.One proposal has been “passages” for biodiversity ﬂows (CONAMA 2003 ). Con-sidering that such passages would be establish from the shore to inland, biodiversity’sshore will ﬂow through those corridors escaping from the rising sea. Certainly, suchidea was helpful in the beginning of the process of change of the climate. However,today is clear that degree and speed of change of species from one habitat to anotherone is low (Loarie 2009 ).Another possibility is conserving species and even individuals of species ex situ,as established by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Unfortunately, it seemsnot enough considering the speed of climate change. Another possibility might beconservation in situ as established by the Convention on Biological Diversity. How-ever, it is clear that the change of the climate would affect all populations in areasunder threat of being changed by the effects of change of climate.Legal or Normative solutions(a) Harmonically Interpreting of TreatiesTreaties are in a legal system which might be considered an “International Ruleof Law”. Treaties do have legal rules establishing international obligations. Theseinternational obligations, in this case, obligation to conserve in situ or ex situ (ONU1992a ) would be complemented in an evolutionary interpretation (International Courtof Justice 2010 ; Peña 2015 ) to conserve biological diversity to be affected or alreadyaffected by the effects of climate change in situ and ex situ.(b) Amendment of International TreatiesInternational treaties do have amendments or might be complemented by new treatiesderived from old one. Clear examples are the Paris Agreement and Nagoya Protocol.It is possible in this point in time to deﬁne an extremely short international agreementto move entire ecosystems from one place to another place in the same country or in332 S. Peña-Neiraa different one preserving rights of the State but promoting the conservation of thespecie or species.(c) A General Treaty on the EnvironmentA treaty on the environment encompassing all aspects of the environment establishingrights and obligations might include the conservation of areas by provoking andpromoting change of species and individuals aiming conserving them, protectingthem from current and future predators and controlling them from increasing interms of population.(d) Conservation Ex Situ and In SituThis research is based on three assumptions, climate change provokes destruction ofbiological diversity, the change of place of biodiversity is a low race speed (extremelylow race due to natural difﬁculties to move from a niche and achieve a different one),and human beings might be able to change biodiversity from the original place toa place in which conditions might be suitable to prevent extinction by conservingthem. International legal rules are in place and it is just necessary to interpret themharmonically considering new problems for our biodiversity. Certainly, interpreta-tion of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention onClimate change should be in good faith. The evolution of the problems related toclimate change and biodiversity create the need to make a teleological approach anda preventive approach based on precaution and creating a positive legal frameworkfor a conservation of biodiversity that need to move from their own natural territoryto a new territory in order to be preserve should be established. Further work on theconcept of conservation ex situ and in situ is needed.A Brief Reﬂection on Lessons LearnedCertainly, it is not enough to deﬁne a lack of international policies and internationaland national legal rules related to destruction of biodiversity and the possibility ofchange of certain representatives of habitats and ecosystems to places in which theymight survive such destruction. Such a lack exists and it is necessary to highlightit and to ﬁnd legal solutions. However, the article has certain limitations; externallypolitical willingness is needed to take policy, legal and practical measures to addressthe problem as exposed, internally, the article cannot deal with all scientiﬁc refer-ences (in a broad scope of the word “scientiﬁc”) explaining the issue or discussingtraditional solutions and possible new problems. However, such large amount ofscientiﬁc knowledge has not come to a point in which political authorities wouldconsider solutions to this problem. A ﬁrst step was more based on counting thebiodiversity than on saving biodiversity. Today counting and saving or saving forcounting is a more reliable concept.Limitations, from a legal standpoint, one of the expression of public policy, cur-rent solutions have not been conceived. However, it is a real problem to be treated inClimate and Biological Diversity: How Should the Effects of Climate … 333a scientiﬁc form and strong enough as the problem of the consequences of climatechange almost 25 years ago. The discussion on the reality of climate change and theexperiences thereof were at the core of the academic and social communities at thattime. Today legal discussions should address more speciﬁc problems on the subjectotherwise we will continue loosing the war against the effects of climate changeon biodiversity (Cordonier-Seggier 2015 ). For example, legal rules permitting themovement of plant, animals, microorganisms, insects to safer areas. The movementby ex situ/in situ conservation to safer places. The deﬁnition of “safer places” byauthorities and scientist. Monitoring of these places and the evolution of the inter-relation of biodiversity in order to create habitats and ecosystems in safer places.Legal rights over land should be considered in order to apply old legal institutionsor to create new legal institutions.The current solution of gene banks and other sources of protection is not enough.These solutions focus on the main elements of plants, animals, insects and microor-ganisms the genes. However, they are not focus on the main problem of interrelationsand even the idea of saving the life of these creatures. Certainly some of their inter-relations have been described but not all of them.From a pure public policy standpoint solutions based on documentation relatedto the aforementioned problem are a good ﬁrst step. However, even the EuropeanUnion has moved more on grassroots or local initiatives and not on national andinternational policies on the subject. Literature, on the other hand has not addressedthis topic mainly to a lack of knowledge or on concentration on other real problems.ConclusionLack of international legal rules preventing or managing effects of climate change onconservation of biological diversity is visible but no international initiative has beendeveloped for negotiations on a treaty on the subject and the current internationaltreaties on climate change or biodiversity were not ﬁrstly enacted to face the problem.Traditional solutions like counting or saving genes from biodiversity are positive butinsufﬁcient.It is clear the current reality of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Itmight be discussed destruction’s degree, time and other important elements. How-ever, measures under the framework of current international legal rules should betaken and re-interpretation of international treaties in a preventive, precautionary andconsistent manner or development of new international legal rules following theseideas would be necessary to reinforce grass roots solutions and scientiﬁc warning.One measure, interpretation or enactment, might be ﬁrst extraction of biodiversity(ex situ conservation) to ﬁnally preserve it in survival places under protection andmonitoring (in situ conservation).334 S.

Science 326:806–807Is Adaptation to Climate ChangeThreatening Forest Biodiversity?A Comparative and InterdisciplinaryStudy Case of Two French ForestsTimothée Fouqueray, Antoine Charpentier, Michel Trommetterand Nathalie Frascaria-LacosteAbstract France is highly covered by forests, upon which rely numerous jobs andnatural habitats. Therefore, the country adopted a strategy of adaptation to climatechange, leaning on a rich silviculture history to offer foresters various means to adapt(rotation shortening, species mixes, …). Still, different adaptations can be interest-ing in a given forest, depending on the trade-off between ecosystem services: timberproduction, biodiversity conservation, water quality preservation, … Hence, how doFrench foresters decide of the adaptation to implement? What are the impacts of theirchoices on biodiversity? The following explores how adaptation in the ﬁeld occurs—acomplementary approach of providing better understanding of the impacts of climatechange on forest biodiversity. It analyses how biodiversity is included in ﬁeld adap-tations, and how this concords with guidelines of sustainable forestry. Results comefrom semi-structured interviews led in two French forests differing in anthropiza-tion, making use of ecology and geographic sciences. The analysis discriminates twonon-exclusive positions on biodiversity: “utilitarists” adapting thanks to biodiversityand “conservationists” adapting for biodiversity. Utilitarists rely on species selectionor introduction of allochtonous species to resist windstorms or biological attacks forinstance, a potential threat for local populations. On the opposite, conservationistsfavor Darwinian adaptation over interventionist strategies. Conservationists wouldT. Fouqueray ( B)·N.

Fouqueray et al.for example prioritize spontaneous evolution, at the risk of tree species running shortof time because of the speed of climate change. These results are integrated in a widerproject including natural parks managers for decision-taking in forest management.Introduction: Adaptation to Climate Changein Multifunctional ForestsFrench forests are Europe’s fourth biggest forests (165,000 km2), most of thembeing deciduous (MAAF 2017 ). Integrating biodiversity conservation in adaptationto climate change (ACC) policies is of highest importance, because of the ecologi-cal interest of forest environments and because of a French customary tradition ofmultifunctionality of public forests. More than just a state of mind, forest multi-functionality is legally embedded and states that public forests must simultaneouslyserve for various ecosystem services such as timber production, recreational activi-tiesand biodiversity conservation (Barthod 2015 ). This very peculiar context goeswith a legacy of systemic public forest management and monitoring inherited fromthe sixteenth century. The necessity to integrate biodiversity conservation along withother forest ecosystem services is one of French characteristics that is of high interestbecause such constraints are commonly shared in a wide variety of situations.Yet, even if the French government launched ACC policies and funded researchprograms, a knowledge gap persists concerning actual measures taken in the ﬁeld.Better documentation of what really occurs in French forests is therefore needed toavoid putative maladaptation for forest biodiversity (Juhola et al. 2016 ). The rationaleof this paper is therefore to explore what foresters actually do in the ﬁeld to adapt,and more precisely how biodiversity is included in ﬁeld adaptations. Maladaptationcould indeed arise from utilitarian adaptations, when adapting thanks to biodiversityremains blind to Darwinian evolution (varietal selection ignoring climatic uncertain-ties, introduction of productive but invasive tree species, …). Additional issues mightalso stem from a conservationist strategy of adapting forbiodiversity, with poten-tial prioritization of spontaneous evolution regardless of the time lag between treeDarwinian evolution and the speed of climate change (Corlett and Westcott 2013 ).Getting insights on how foresters behave when confronted to climate changes is keyto develop accurate incentives in public policies. This paper could be of particularinterest for informing both the 2018 renewal of France 4-years Mitigation Strategyand National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change.In the end, how do French foresters decide of the adaptation to implement? Whatare the impacts of their choices on biodiversity? In order to examine these issues,results from a ﬁeld study depict how foresters consider biodiversity in their adapta-tions to climate change. We analyzed the collected mentions of ACC in the light of afew management principles for a sustainable forestry: avoidance of natural habitatsIs Adaptation to Climate Change Threatening Forest … 339loss, maintenance of ecological connectivity, maintenance of forest heterogeneity(diversity of species, ages and successional stages), focus of management onto thelandscape scale, avoidance of forest-use intensiﬁcation (Noss 2001 ; Lindenmayeret al. 2006 ; Brang et al. 2014 ).Methodology: Framing an Interdisciplinary Study CaseTo evaluate on-the-ground adaptations, we carried out individual semi-structured andopen-ended interviews in France during June and July 2017. Interviewees were pri-vate owners, ofﬁcials from municipalities and central agencies, and forest managers.Ecologists usually base their environmental analyses on the production and valida-tion of logical knowledge (Moon and Blackman 2014 ). Yet, ecological consequencesof ACC practices are due to human reasoning and motivations departing from objec-tive mechanisms. Hence, a constructivist method ﬁts with the objective of exploringhow interviewees relate (or not) biodiversity conservation with ACC in forest man-agement (Kaufmann 2004 ). Each interview consisted of (i) a general description ofthe interviewee’s silvicultural practices, (ii) a description of the temporal evolutionof these practices and (iii) the interviewee’s opinion about brakes and levers to reachdesired silvicultural practices. If not spontaneously mentioned, we also asked whatwere their reactions following last decade’s natural disturbances, for instance Lothar-Martin windstorms in 1999 or 2003 droughts (Ministère de la Transition écologiqueet solidaire 2017 ).Every interview was recorded, fully transcribed and qualitatively analyzed. Audiotracks and written transcriptions were analyzed using Sonal, an encoder-softwareconducting audio-textual synchronization. Sonal allows for thematic and statisticdiscourse studies, such as topic occurrences and/or co-occurrences (e.g. “loggingpractices” and/or “forest uses”) (Nicolas 2013 ). To be considered as an ACC, aninterview sample should mention the expression of a change in forest managementpractices, either explicitly linked with climate change (ex: “ﬁrst thing, forest standmanagement in the context of climate change”), or implicitly linked with at leastone of climate change consequences (ex: mitigation policies and demand for non-fossil energy sources “we used to produce around 35,000 tons of fuelwood”). Oncean interview sample was referenced as mentioning an ACC, it was characterizeddepending on adaptation category, interventionism level, motive, temporality, spa-tial scale of application, adaptation of what, adaptation to what. To avoid arbitraryclassiﬁcations, characterizations were cross-checked by another author after beingcarried out by one author.Adaptation category . Mentions of ACC were classiﬁed under the categories“Forest-use market diversiﬁcation”, “Insurances”, “Land-use change”, “Naturalselection” (e.g. forest stands with spontaneous evolution),“Research and develop-ment”, “Silvicultural changes - forest density”, “Silvicultural changes - pest con-trol”, “Silvicultural changes - physical and chemical environment”, “Silviculturalchanges - quality management”, “Silvicultural changes - rotation length”, “Sil-340 T. Fouqueray et al.vicultural changes - technical itinerary” (e.g. Conversion of a regular woodlandinto an uneven-aged stand), “Silvicultural changes - tree species”, “Social innova-tion” (modiﬁcations of social interactions, e.g. creation of forest tales about climatechange), “Timber market diversiﬁcation” (e.g. selling timber products as fuelwood,lumber, wood for paper ﬁbres, …).Interventionism . Interventionism qualiﬁed whether adaptations could haveoccurred without human intervention. When applicable, assessment of whether theACC ‘would exist without human intervention’, ‘reversibility’ and ‘coercition of eco-logical dynamics” were based on interviews analyses and cited literature. An ACCwas considered ‘existing without human intervention’ when it occurs in the wild (e.g.species mixes), ‘reversible’ when the time needed to return to pre-adaptation condi-tions is lower or as long as the implementation time of the adaptation (e.g. thinning isreversible, because it occurs every decade, long enough for forests to densify again).‘Coercition of ecological dynamics’ qualiﬁed an ACC as going counter-current ofthe ecological dynamics (‘Control and Command’) or as accompanying ecologicaldynamics (‘Monitor and Adapt’). For instance, if a local tree population declinesbecause of rarefying rainfalls or increasing droughts, its maintenance through artiﬁ-cial plantations would correspond to ‘Control and Command’. In this case, a ‘Monitorand Adapt’ envision of ecological dynamics could be funding research and develop-ment for adapting timber transformation machines to the tree species replacing thedeclining one.Motive . Purposes of adaptations were assessed using a ‘adapting for or by biodiver-sity’ and a ‘adapting for forests or for social-economic systems’ criteria. Assessmentsstemmed from interviewees’ expressed opinions.Temporality . Reactive adaptations are “adjustments in ecological, social, or eco-nomic systems in response to observed or expected changes in climatic stimuli andtheir effects” (Adger et al. 2005 ). Hence, an ACC was counted as reactive when aninterviewee implemented it to avoid detrimental impacts of a climatic risk alreadyexperienced (windstorm, ﬁre, …). Proactive adaptations are measures taken to lessenthe perceived negative impacts of future events (Engle 2011 ). An ACC was thereforecounted as anticipative when the interviewee mentioned it as an a priori preparationof predicted climate changes. When the action of ACC was ﬁrst a by-product ofanother action, it was considered as “Side effect of other silvicultural changes” (e.g.resulting from economic strategies, some shortened rotations also have interest forACC).Spatial scale of application . The scale of the ACC was always clearly apparent orexplicit in the interviews. Spatial scales described the spatial extent of the ACC: theindividual (ex: inclusion of silvicultural changes in popular culture), the forest stand,the municipality, the whole forest (massif) or the whole country (ex: observatorynetwork of the effects of climate change on trees).Adaptation of what . Discourse analysis gathered elements highlighting whatecosystem services were preferentially targeted by interviewees’ ACC.Adaptation to what . Discourse analysis gathered elements highlighting what werethe risks against which interviewees mentioned ACC. For instance, shortening rota-Is Adaptation to Climate Change Threatening Forest … 341tion lengths was sometimes displayed as an ACC to drought, sometimes to wind-storms.As any methodology, ours has its own limitations. In several interviews, it wasnot possible to cross-check the interviewees’ statement with ﬁeld visits (interviewswere nevertheless included in the study). Another limitation pertains to samplingbiases: because interviewees are by deﬁnition foresters within reach of researchers,they are also involved in professional networks prone to release informations aboutACC. This was taken into account in the analyses, but as this bias applies to everyinterviewees, it was not considered as questioning our results.The selection of study areas was guided by social-ecological considerations so toretain two very contrasted forests characterizing polar opposites of French forest man-agement (see Table 1). The ﬁrst study area—the man-created forest of the “Landesde Gascogne” (hereafter refered to as “Landes”)—lies in southwestern France and isgrounded on a young and very interventionist history. The draining of former marsh-lands two centuries ago led to a mechanized and monocultural forestry. Soils areplowed to plant selected seedlings ( Pinus pinaster ) that are usually clearcut betweentheir thirtieth and fortieth year. On the opposite, the second study area, known as the“V osges du Nord” (“V osges”), displays a silvicultural history that dates back over400 years (Jéhin 2005 ): an important proportion of forests are composed of uneven-aged and mixed stands. These areas were also chosen on the basis of local naturalparks managers showing interest in ACC studies linked with biodiversity issues. Itmust be kept in mind that our study areas are not representative of the whole Frenchsilvicultural technics range. Hence, our results must not be taken as applicable forthe whole country: they reﬂect two distinct and strong opposites of how forestersdeal with ecological processes in their silvicultures.In that respect, forests can be studied as social-ecological systems (SES), forthey couple Darwinian adaptation with socio-economic adaptations arising in inter-connected demographic, cultural and economic contexts (Anderies et al. 2006 ). Aninterdisciplinary combination of geography and ecological sciences is therefore rel-evant to address the inclusion of biodiversity in foresters’ ACC measures.Results97 mentions of ACC were compiled from a total of 27 interviews (13 in the Landes,14 in the V osges). Only one forester did not explicitly mention any ACC, but heinsisted on his silvicultural practices being ﬂexible to environmental and externalchanges. Interviews were usually 1–2 h long, but could last up to 5 h.Adaptation category . Changing tree species (mixes, replacement, …), acting onthe physical and chemical environment (by subsoiling, fertilization, …) and diver-sifying timber sales are the three most widespread mentions of ACC (Table 2). Onthe contrary, diversifying forest economic uses (tourism), innovating socially (devel-opment of forest tales related to climate changes) are the two least mentioned ACC(Table 2).342 T. Fouqueray et al.Interventionism . Interviewees predominantly mention interventionist ACC. 49 outof 97 ACC would not occur without human interventions (e.g. shortened cutting ageto avoid climate risks artiﬁcially modiﬁes the age pyramid of forest stands) (Table 2).8 out of 14 categories of ACC are not reversible. In terms of coercition of ecologicaldynamics, 63 ACC envision biodiversity in a ‘Control and Command’ way, goingcounter-current of the ecological dynamics occurring (e.g. artiﬁcially maintaining adeclining tree population by plantations).Motive . Where applicable, a vast majority of the ACC consider biodiversity as atool to adapt and not as an adaptation motive (57 ACC among the 97 are ‘by diver-sity’), without exclusivity of the two approaches (11 ACC considered biodiversityboth as a tool and an objective) (Table 2). 5 out 14 ACC categories aim at modifyingforest ecosystems (change in the relative abundance of tree species or in the age andheight structures of forest stands, etc.) and not at modifying social-economic systems(incentive to buy insurances against storms, cultural acceptance of free evolution,etc.) (Table 2).Temporality . An ACC could be counted both as reactive and anticipative, becausea given ACC can arise after a climatic hazard and also in prevention of upcomingclimatic hazards. ACC are slightly more mentioned because of experienced climatichazards than because of forecasted climate changes.

Ex:among the 4 ACC aiming at adapting timber production and biodiversity, 2 were designed at theforest stand level and 2 at the forest massif scaleSpatial scale of application . Adaptations largely apply at the forest stand scale (62mentions out of 97) and at the forest scale (23 mentions). Noticeably, only one ACCconcerned the individual scale: cultural heritage, in other words, the development offorest tales linked with climatic hazards (windstorms) (Table 4).Adaptation of what . ACC ﬁrst aim at adapting timber production (63 mentionsout of the 97 mentioned ACC). There is only one instance of ACC of biodiversityfor itself, while the other ACC aiming at adapting biodiversity are always relatedeither to the adaptation of timber production or of aesthetic landscapes (7 mentions)(Table 4).Adaptation to what . Top-mentioned ACC are mostly in responding to punctual andalready experienced climatic risks: droughts (34 citations), windstorms (32 citations),demand for renewable and non-fossil energy (15 citations), parasitic attacks (12citations) (Table 3).348 T. Fouqueray et al.DiscussionBiodiversity Conservation as an Adaptation by-Productof Utilitarian Timber ProductionContrasting with the often reported lack of ACC implementation (Campbell et al.2008 ), almost all interviewees mentioned ongoing or operational adaptation mea-sures—97 in total (Table 2). This can be attributable to the long-term planning offorest management and to the strong forest cultures of the Landes and the V osges.Following Carpenter et al. ( 2001 ), two main questions can shape the study of howbiodiversity issues are integrated among these 97 ACC. To what climatic risks areforest adapted? What are the forest goods and services targeted?The ﬁrst lesson from the ﬁeld about to what foresters adapt is common: ACC weremostly in reaction to droughts and windstorms, two climatic hazards that occurredin both study areas (Table 3). For instance, Lothar-Martin windstorms in 1999 dev-astated more than 30% of the Landes stands and also hit the V osges, as put simplyby a forestry advisor: “When the wind is strong here, many people can’t sleep any-more…”. Reactive adaptations are rooted in the enhanced perception of risks alreadyexperienced, a cognitive bias found in other environments (Rey-Valette et al. 2012 ).Paradoxically, the third most mentioned ACC is not related to climate hazards butto an indirect consequence of mitigation policies. The mitigation-driven demand forrenewable and non-fossil energy sources leads to increased fuelwood supply throughslash and stump removal, seen as a business opportunity for wood producers.Interviewees also detailed what forest services they try to adapt, and biodiversityconservation was clearly less cited as an adaptation target than timber production(by far the top-ranked one, Table 4). Moreover, biodiversity conservation was nearlysystematically mentioned along with forest scenery or timber production (Table 4).This is not surprising, as timber production is the major source of income and con-centrates adaptation efforts. To quote a forest manager, “Today, forest owners onlyearn money from timber sales, around 90% of their incomes, with lease of huntingbeing the other 10%. The rest of it [biodiversity conservation and carbon seques-tration] is a gift to the society, and we even pay property taxes for that!”. Carefulapplication of payment for ecosystem services could be an interesting way out of thepredominance of timber production in ACC, with a collective share of biodiversityconservation costs (Farley and Costanza 2010 ).This focus on timber production might explain why forest stand is the spatial scalereferred to as the most efﬁcient to achieve ACC (64% of all ACC mentions). Timberproduction is indeed designed and managed at the forest stand level. This raises theissue of spatial integration of biodiversity dynamics, which do not stop at the foreststands limits. The ACC emphasis on forest stands could be a brake for managingecological connectivity, one of the putative safeguards for biodiversity conservationbeing the key role played by natural parks authorities. Supporting this vision, it isalmost only forest ofﬁcials with responsibilities regarding biodiversity conservationwho cited the whole forest as their ACC spatial scale—the second most cited spatialIs Adaptation to Climate Change Threatening Forest … 349scale (Table 4). As an example, V osges park managers underlined the necessityto plan ACC at the forest scale because they must ensure ecological corridors. Torebalance the impacts of shortened rotations, they established a no-managementnetwork composed of old-growth patches. Authorities of deconcentrated servicesof the Ministry of Environment also expressed their full consideration of long-termchanges (e.g. phenological or temperature shifts), even if ACC in anticipation wereless implemented than reactive ACC. Concerns persist because authorities (whetherfrom natural parks or from State services) must comply to national public policiesthat did not prove very pioneering regarding biodiversity conservation. For instance,it is only in 2017 that the national plan for adaptation to climate change incorporatedrecommendations for protected natural areas and biodiversity (Observatoire Nationaldes Effets du Réchauffement Climatique 2017 ).Biodiversity Conservation Overwhelmed by an InterventionistApproach of Adaptation to Climate ChangeInterviewed foresters mostly considered biodiversity as a tool to adapt and not anadaptation goal in itself, as outlined in Table 2. However, a utilitarian approach ofbiodiversity does not necessarily imply an interventionist conception of ACC. Suc-cessful silvicultural attempts exist that balance long-term utilitarian cost-minimizingtimber production with environmental imperatives (Brang et al. 2014 ). In France, theProSilva organization promotes a close-to-nature forestry with mixed forests, hetero-geneous structures, natural regeneration when possible and avoidance of clear cuts(de Turckheim and Bruciamacchie 2005 ; ProSilva 2017 ). Interviewed in the V osges,a prominent member of ProSilva summarized his vision of biodiversity as an ACCtool: “Stability of production is important. So a diversiﬁed system is more stable,more perennial than a house of cards. Any grain of sand and everything collapses,then you’re lost.”Still, most of the 97 collected ACC were interventionist, for instance excludingthe social-economic system as the adaptation target to be modiﬁed in order to ensureACC (Table 2). In other words, human intervention condition most of the reportedACC, such as planting trees according to windstorms tracks to decrease their windsurface areas. Human intervention is not always by essence detrimental to biodiver-sity, when it comes to conservation efforts—even if they are most often designed tooffset anthropogenic forcing. For some forest species, concerns exist about their abil-ity to adapt fast enough (through Darwinian evolution, dispersion, range expansionor phenotypic plasticity) (Campbell et al. 2008 ). More speciﬁcally, trees have longgeneration time and some species have low ability to disperse (Corlett and West-cott 2013 ); issues of time lag between climatic changes and biological responsescould make it relevant to plan human-based adaptation of such organisms (Millaret al. 2007 ). However, virtually none of the interviewees spontaneously came to thatquestion.350 T. Fouqueray et al.Most of the mentioned ACC mentioned are irreversible and therefore very sen-sitive issues when dealing with species mixes and provenances. For instance, theintentional translocation of tree populations to account for climatic risks (assistedmigration) can introduce unwanted genotypes in target environments (Millar et al.2007 ; Lefèvre et al. 2014 ). Great care must be taken not to forget key ecologi-cal mechanisms, such as translocation of tree populations without considering theirextended phenotype—their association with soil fungi or arthropods communitieson source sites (Frascaria-Lacoste and Fernández-Manjarrés 2012 ). Most of species-based ACC mentioned were cautious in implementation, as for instance the migrationof an oak population from southern France into the V osges to address temperatureshifts. Still, even if this pilot experiment did not foster non-native species introduc-tion, careful monitoring is required to evaluate whether introduced trees outperformlocal populations or if they contribute to genetic mixing. French ACC public policiescould be a way to implement precautionary measures with respect to sustainableforestry principles (Sansilvestri et al. 2015 ).Interventionism is also signiﬁcantly rooted in the coercition of ecological dynam-ics, as suggested by the prevalence of ‘Control and command’ ACC (around 65% ofACC). For these ACC, adaptation focuses on a single variable of the environmentwithout integrating potential side-effects, often supported by a technological framingof the response to a climatic hazard. An archetypal example is provided by some Lan-des forest owners, who aim at extending soil root exploration on their forest stands.Before planting, some of them used 250 horse-power subsoilers to break the hardesthorizon of the soil. However, they sometimes reported maladaptation to droughts,for subsoiling increased water draining and lowered water soil retention. Moreover,their stand were less resilient to windstorms, because maritime pines would breakin two instead of falling untouched on the ﬂoor as a consequence of their deeperroot anchorage. This ‘Control and command’ ACC was only focusing on adapta-tion to droughts and hindered access to forest stands and harvest of damaged trees,disregarding forest complexity.In the end, the interviews allow to examine the impacts of ACC choices on bio-diversity through the prism of the sustainable forest principles:–Avoidance of natural habitat loss could suffer from shortened rotations, as fewerold trees hosting cavities would stay in forests after logging (Fan et al. 2004 ;Lindenmayer et al. 2006 ). In the V osges, attention has been focused on the lossof cavity trees, and a compensatory network of old-growth trees has been imple-mented for thirty years.–Maintenance of ecological connectivity and focus on the landscape scale is ofgreater concern, as the most quoted spatial scale was the forest stand.–Maintenance of forest heterogeneity (diversity of species, ages and successionalstages) ﬁrst depends on owners’ silvicultural practices. In public forests, the mul-tifunctionality injunction imposes to take biodiversity into account, but on-the-ground implementation is at the discretion of local managers. In the Landes forests,owners are mainly individuals who pay a tax dedicated to ﬁre prevention, a brakefor ﬁre-based heterogeneity of forests but a prerequisite for timber productionIs Adaptation to Climate Change Threatening Forest … 351(Doustin 1975 ). Forestry goals and local contexts therefore greatly condition theforest heterogeneity management principle, with consideration through ongoingresearch about tree diversity and herbivory by forest insects (Jactel and Brocker-hoff 2007 ).–Avoidance of forest -use intensiﬁcation might be the biggest focus point when itcomes to adaptation to the indirect effects of climate change. Economic adaptationto the rise in fuelwood demand, indirectly due to mitigation policies, could leadto extended harvest of slash and stump, threatening long-term soil equilibrium(Jandl et al. 2007 ; Walmsley and Godbold 2010 ). Inertia of private owners couldnevertheless balance intensiﬁcation of forest-use, as shown by several interviews:numerous forest owners cannot afford investments in forest roads or have toosmall forest holdings to derive beneﬁts from fuelwood sales.ConclusionsIn order to assess potential long-term adverse effects of ACC on biodiversity con-servation, we interviewed foresters, forest authorities and forest owners. Two forestcases contrasting in anthropization were selected: the “Landes de Gascogne” andthe “V osges du Nord”, both study areas complying with France’s forest speciﬁci-ties: vast, multifunctional, and managed (at least public forests). Analyses of thecollected mentions of ACC were conducted in the light of sustainable forestry prin-ciples: avoidance of natural habitats loss, maintenance of ecological connectivity,maintenance of forest heterogeneity, focus onto the landscape scale, avoidance offorest-use intensiﬁcation (Noss 2001 ; Lindenmayer et al. 2006 ; Brang et al. 2014 ).Much of ACC mentioned were utilitarian—considering biodiversity as a toolto adapt and not as a conservation goal. Much of them were also interventionist,designed to adapt forest environments to timber production, most often without ques-tioning the adaptation of human social-economic systems. Based on the interviews,integrating biodiversity conservation within this interventionist context seems highlyrelevant, since timber production should probably persist as one of forest most usedecosystemic services, a consideration found across other research projects (O’Haraand Ramage 2013 ). Still, numerous difﬁculties persist to evaluate the impacts onbiodiversity of ACC of forestry practices. Are interventionist ACC required for bio-diversity conservation, or can forest environments adapt to climate change with-out human interventions? In a few cases, such as shortened rotations or subsoiling,effects on biodiversity of interventionist ACC are quite straightforward to measure.But interventionism is not always so unequivocal, due to numerous ecological andclimatic uncertainties (Campbell et al. 2008 ). An example is assisted migration,where uncertainties are high about the tree real velocity, dispersal, acclimation tophenological shifts or about gene ﬂow from supposed adapted populations, not tomention the variety of ecological processes harsh to evaluate (Frascaria-Lacoste andFernández-Manjarrés 2012 ; Corlett and Westcott 2013 ).352 T. Fouqueray et al.Favoring intervention or spontaneous evolution is of no little importance, butuncertainty renders it difﬁcult to follow accurate guidelines (Hallegatte 2009 ). Whenconsidering the implementation of an ACC, we ﬁrst recommend end-users to basetheir practical decision-making on sustainable forestry principles. When applicable,we also suggest to include uncertainty in their everyday silvicultural practices bysystematically preferring the one option with positive outcomes over a wide rangeof futures, in order to avoid “putting all eggs into one basket” (Dessai et al. 2009 ;O’Hara and Ramage 2013 ).These silvicultural practices impacting forest environments are based on socialand economic decision-making. Thus, interdisciplinary research is critical to long-term successful biodiversity conservation. Understanding adaptation processes isone thing, but basing nature parks management on recent knowledge is another.From a conservationist point of view, ACC forbiodiversity conservation is a chal-lenge that requires maintained and enhanced exchanges between researchers fromdifferent ﬁelds and nature parks managers (Stein et al. 2013 ). Learning from litera-ture study cases and formal and informal professional meetings stays indispensableto encourage capacity-building and adoption of the ‘Monitor and adapt’ manage-ment paradigm. In this logic, reversibility of ACC and ecological threshold uncer-tainties—genetic bottlenecks, effects of thinning or slash removal on ecosystemfunctioning, …—are to be monitored. ‘Monitor and adapt’ could also participate inintegrating laisser-faire measures as a pro-active choice within the ACC range.Considering that forest ofﬁcials are those accounting the most for biodiversity, itwould also be legitimate to question whether their interactions with forest ownersor forest experts leads to better integration of these forest sustainability principles.Methodological constraints do not allow us to go beyond the one-to-one interviews,but another research project is in progress. Based on companion modelling and seri-ous games (Bousquet and Le Page 2004 ; Abbrami et al. 2015 ), it aims at analyzingthe importance of communication between forest stakeholders for incorporating bio-diversity conservation in the players’ ACC strategies.Explicitation of how foresters ﬁrst consider biodiversity as a utilitarian tool tomaintain productive forests could be our main result for biodiversity conservation.This could be a signiﬁcant asset for biodiversity conservation in non-protected forests.Indeed, clarifying the value of biodiversity for ACC is a ﬁrst stage to rise awarenessabout conservation importance—so long as the utilitarian perception of biodiversity isnot the only one. In this light, the emergence of public policies relying on ecosystem-based adaptation and on nature-based solutions is a step in this direction (Balianet al. 2014 ; Eggermont et al. 2015 ). Aiming at turning adaptation with nature intosomething as efﬁcient as adaptation against nature, this promising concept couldbecome in the coming years a useful communication tool reconciling biodiversityconservation with other ecosystemic services in multifunctional environments. In2018, renewal in France of both the national plan for adaptation to climate changeand the national mitigation strategy will be chances to assess the inclusion of nature-based solutions in public policies for biodiversity conservation.Is Adaptation to Climate Change Threatening Forest … 353ReferencesAbbrami G, Allier F, Arrault S, Barnaud C, Barreteau O, Becu N, Bommel P, Bonté B, BousquetF, Daré W’s, Decourtye A, Dionnet M, Dray A, Dumrongrojwatthana P, Étienne M, Gajaseni N,Gourrat M, Page CL, Leteurtre E, Manzano P, Mathevet R, Monteil C, Gurung TR, Rougier J-E,Souchère V , Trébuil G, Venot J-P, Werdenberg F (2015) La modélisation d’accompagnement:partager des représentations, simuler des dynamiques.

Lynch, Bonnie J. E. Myers,Madeleine A. Rubenstein and Laura M. ThompsonAbstract Climate change poses multiple threats to biodiversity, and has alreadycaused demonstrable impacts. We summarize key results from a recent nationalassessment of observed climate change impacts to terrestrial, marine, and freshwaterecosystems in the United States, and place results in the context of commonly articu-lated hypotheses about ecosystem response to climate change for global implications.Speciﬁc impacts we consider include: range shifts; phenological shifts; phenotypicchanges; primary production changes; biological invasions; and novel communities.Signiﬁcant effort has been made recently to incorporate adaptation measures intoland and water management at both national and international scales, but the scale ofimpacts and associated uncertainties pose challenges to existing management insti-tutions. Using commonly articulated hypotheses about climate change, biodiversity,and ecosystem response can provide context for informed decisions at multiple scalesand can help to provide a clearer understanding of the ecological and mechanisticlinkages between climate change and biodiversity.S.

Carter et al.IntroductionContemporary anthropogenic climate change is increasingly impacting biodiversityand associated ecosystem services (IPCC 2013 ). Terrestrial systems are experiencingrising air temperatures, increasing incidences of large forest ﬁres, reduced snow packand earlier spring melt, and an increasing number of extreme precipitation events(Wuebbles et al. 2017 ); freshwater systems are experiencing changing temperatures,ﬂow regimes, and precipitation patterns (Rahel and Olden 2008 ; Jimenez Cisneroset al. 2014 ); and marine systems are additionally affected by sea level rise, acidiﬁ-cation, and altered ocean circulation (Brierley and Kingsford 2009 ). Furthermore,these impacts are expected to increase in frequency or intensity into the future aswarming accelerates (Urban 2015 ).Such changes in climate have signiﬁcant impacts on biodiversity, includingshifts in the relative distribution or abundance of organisms across habitats (rangeshifts); changes in the timing of important life history events (phenological shifts);trait changes that can better cope with new environmental conditions (phenotypicchanges); changes in the production of biomass by photosynthetic organisms (pri-mary production changes); increases in the presence or abundance of alien invasiveorganisms across regions (biological invasions); and changes in species interactions(novel communities). Understanding the rate and magnitude of these changes andconsequences is critical to informing future natural resource management decisionsin the face of climate change. Furthermore, understanding these impacts speciﬁ-cally in the context of scientiﬁc hypotheses can help to clarify important underlyingprocesses and mechanisms, and serve as a framework to inform future research, mod-eling, and assessment efforts. In this paper, we draw upon recent climate assessmentsin the United States for the purpose of illustrating impacts which are already beingobserved and quantiﬁed. In addition, we articulate a series of hypotheses about biodi-versity response to climate change and present an argument for how such a frameworkcan help to inform future research and decision making.Recent assessment activities internationally and in the United States have pro-vided insight into the implications of climate impacts to biodiversity and have high-lighted potential management responses. Internationally, the United Nations’ (UN)2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and associated Sustainable DevelopmentGoals (SDGs), as well as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Bio-logical Diversity (CBD), recognize that improved management and conservation ofbiodiversity is central to achieving international goals for human and environmentalwell-being (Sachs et al. 2009 ; Secades et al. 2014 ; Romanelli et al. 2015 ). In theUnited States, the National Climate Assessment (NCA) is a quadrennial report thatsynthesizes the state of scientiﬁc knowledge about the status and impacts of anthro-pogenic climate change, and analyzes impacts to both human and natural systems.A recurring chapter devoted to Ecosystems, Ecosystem Services, and BiodiversityHypotheses from Recent Assessments of Climate Impacts to … 357(Groffman et al. 2014 ) speciﬁcally reviews observed climate impacts on biodiversityand resulting changes in ecosystem services on national and sub-national scales. The4th NCA, scheduled for release in 2018, brought together experts from 13 Federalagencies, academia, and non-governmental organizations to synthesize literature onobserved climate change impacts in the United States. Such assessments can helpdecision makers better understand risks and manage for the most signiﬁcant impactsof climate change by highlighting how valuable ecosystem services may be affected(Alcamo 2005 ; Jones et al. 2014 ).Here, we provide a hypothesis-driven synthesis of climate change impacts to bio-diversity in the United States, structured around the type of impact (range shifts; phe-nological shifts; invasive species; changes in primary production; novel ecosystems;and phenotypic changes) and ecosystem type (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine)(Table 1) and review implications for potential adaptive management responses(Table 2). While an exhaustive assessment of evidence for and against each hypoth-esis is beyond the scope of this piece, we provide an overview of observed impactsstructured around each type of impact and a framework for a hypothesis-driven impactassessment (Table 1). This effort will assist with anticipating potential impacts ofclimate change in the U.S., clarify how those impacts vary within and across ecosys-tem types, and help to identify science-informed management options that minimizeharm to biodiversity.Synthesis of ImpactsRange ShiftsSpecies are expected to shift their geographic distribution in order to stay withintheir climate niche (Parmesan and Y ohe 2003 ); higher elevations or latitudes forterrestrial and freshwater systems and deeper depths for marine systems (Chen et al.2011 , Urban 2015 ). Species’ capacity for range shifts is limited by their inherentadaptive capacity, as well as by other drivers of spatial distributions (e.g., predatorsand competitors, land use changes, availability of migration corridors). In instanceswhere range shifts cannot accommodate the pace of climate impacts, local extinctionsare expected (Wiens 2016 ). Range shifts have numerous implications for sociallyimportant aspects of biodiversity on an international scale, including ﬁsheries stocksthat no longer align with existing management boundaries (Pinsky and Fogarty 2012 ;Barange et al. 2014 ) and expanding ranges of vector-borne diseases, such as Lymedisease, malaria, and avian ﬂu (V andegrift et al. 2010 ; Caminade et al. 2014 ; Ostfeldand Brunner 2015 ).358 S.

Text in bold describesoverarching hypotheses that are applicable across ecosystem types (terrestrial; freshwater; marine)and taxa. Text in bullet points describes further explanations for the hypotheses, system-speciﬁcdetails, and/or known exceptions to these overarching hypothesesT errestrial EcosystemsTerrestrial species have shifted their geographic distribution, primarily from low tohigh latitudes and elevations (Parmesan and Y ohe 2003 ; Moritz et al. 2008 ; Chen et al.2011 ). Temperature-induced latitudinal shifts have been observed in North Americanbirds (Hitch and Leberg 2007 ) and small mammal communities in the northern GreatL a k e sr e g i o n( M y e r se ta l . 2009 ), while temperature-induced elevational shifts havebeen observed in American pika Ochotona princeps in the Great Basin (Beever et al.2011 ) and foraging ants in the southern Appalachians (Warren and Chick 2013 ).These shifts have principally resulted in contractions at the warm edge of rangesand expansions at the cool edge of ranges (Wiens 2016 ). However, heterogeneityof distribution responses to temperature may be the result of other climate-relatedfactors (e.g., birds in the Sierra Nevada Mountains; Tingley et al. 2012 ).360 S. L.

( 2017 )Select potential management responses to climate change impacts are provided as examples forterrestrial, freshwater, and marine systemsFreshwaterFreshwater organisms have reduced dispersal capabilities due to the relatively closednature of freshwater systems (e.g., barriers to upstream and downstream movement,habitat degradation, stream fragmentation and connectivity) (Comte et al. 2013 ).Depending on physiological thermal limits and preferences, climate change cancause distribution changes of freshwater species to vary in degree and direction (e.g.,expansion or contraction) (Lynch et al. 2016 ). White perch Morone Americana ,f o rexample, expanded its range in the Great Lakes with warmer air and water tempera-tures (Johnson et al. 2011 ), while the range of four Paciﬁc salmon species expandednorthward with warmer ocean and summer river conditions in Canada (Babaluket al. 2000 ). Documentation of freshwater species shifting ranges is increasing asmore freshwater ecosystems are impacted by climate change, having consequencesfor biodiversity, species composition, and richness (Comte et al. 2013 ; Myers et al.2017 ).362 S. L. Carter et al.MarineFor marine ecosystems, extensive and contiguous habitat generally allows for shiftsin distribution and abundance of species at a faster rate than in terrestrial or freshwatersystems in the face of climate change (Nye et al. 2009 ; Kleisner et al. 2017 ). Rangeshifts for marine communities have been observed up to 28 km per decade (comparedwith 6.1 km in terrestrial systems; Burrows et al. 2011 ). Projections suggest thatrange shifts will continue with marine organisms moving to higher latitudes anddeeper depths to maintain optimal habitat (Urban 2015 ). However, ocean currentsand ocean chemistry make projecting the potential for range shifts in marine speciesmore complex than movement driven solely by temperature (Harley et al. 2006 ).Additionally, organisms in stable environments, such as marine tropical systems,often have much narrower niche bounds and may not be able to migrate at a ratecomparable to environmental change (Walther et al. 2002 ).Phenological ShiftsClimate change is expected to alter the phenology of most species across ecosystemtypes. Earlier springs have been well documented (Ault et al. 2013 ), and increasinglystudies have focused on delays in the onset of autumn as well (Gallinat et al. 2015 ).A wide range of organisms have demonstrated phenological shifts in response tothese changes (Thackeray et al. 2010 ), although these responses vary across taxo-nomic and trophic groups (Thackeray et al. 2016 ), as does our ability to detect suchchanges. Generally, species in lower trophic levels are expected to advance theirphenology more than higher trophic consumers (Thackeray et al. 2010 ). These dif-ferences will likely result in altered species interactions and will have implicationsfor species ﬁtness and production, particularly for populations of vulnerable species(Møller et al. 2008 ; Peer and Miller 2014 ) like pollinators (Memmott et al. 2007 )and salmonids (Kovach et al. 2015b ). Phenological shifts, and consequent trophicmismatches, are often difﬁcult to account for in single-species management struc-tures but they are necessary to consider for a comprehensive assessment in informingadaptive management (Lawler 2009 ).T errestrialPhenological shifts and associated mismatches have been well-documented in ter-restrial systems, such as those between plants in the prairie-forest transition areasof the Midwest and their pollinators: the plants are at increased risk of extinctionHypotheses from Recent Assessments of Climate Impacts to … 363because pollinators are arriving after peak bloom, minimizing the likelihood of pol-lination of plants and reducing the diet breadth of pollinators (Memmott et al. 2007 ).Organisms do not universally respond to phenological drivers in the same way; whenphenological shifts manifest differently, they can result in mismatched or insufﬁcientresponses. Broad-tailed hummingbirds in Arizona and Colorado, for example, havenot advanced their arrival date sufﬁciently to track the advancing phenology of theirprimary nectar sources (McKinney et al. 2012 ).FreshwaterPhenological shifts resulting from changes in temperature and ﬂow have been doc-umented for a variety of North American ﬁsh species; because detection is ofteneasier in coldwater habitats, the literatures focuses mainly salmonid species (Kovachet al. 2015b ; Lynch et al. 2016 ; Myers et al. 2017 ). Earlier spawning migrationsare documented in salmon species in Alaska and Washington (Quinn and Adams1996 ; Kovach et al. 2013 ,2015a ) and Rio Grande ﬁsh assemblages in New Mexico(Krabbenhoft et al. 2014 ). These phenological changes have impacts on freshwaterecosystem biodiversity by affecting food web dynamics, organism demographics(e.g., abundance and growth), and species composition (Lynch et al. 2016 ). Thesechanges can result in mismatches in resource availability and impact ecosystemfunctioning and services.MarineAlterations in phenology are perhaps the most evident climate response in rapidlychanging marine systems (Asch 2015 ). Shorter winters, earlier springs, and extendedsummers are occurring in some marine systems (Edwards and Richardson 2004 ;Robinson et al. 2014 ; Henderson et al. 2017 ; Thomas et al. 2017 ), resulting in shiftsin the early life stages of commercially important groundﬁsh (Klein et al. 2017 ),Northern shrimp Pandalus borealis (Richards 2012 ), and highly migratory anadro-mous ﬁshes such as Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and river herring Alosa spp. In thenortheastern United States (Juanes et al. 2004 ; Ellis and V okoun 2009 ; Otero et al.2014 ), mismatches can arise when trophic levels respond to climatic cues differently.For example, larval ﬁsh have evolved synchronized hatching with seasonal marinephytoplankton blooms; if the bloom and hatch are decoupled, the larval ﬁsh maymiss this critical food source (Post 2016 ; Sundby et al. 2016 ).364 S. L. Carter et al.Phenotypic ChangesSpecies may have some ability to cope with climate change by adjusting their traitsthrough plastic or evolutionary mechanisms so they can better tolerate changingenvironmental conditions and reduce risk of population declines or local extinctions.Speciﬁcally, changes in morphology, behavior, or physiology may increase ﬁtness,but those adjustments are more commonly the result of phenotypic plasticity ratherthan evolution (Merilä and Hendry 2014 ), particularly for species with long genera-tion times. Therefore, it is likely that many species will be unable to keep pace withrapid climate changes in situ (Staudinger et al. 2013 ).T errestrialThere is some documentation of plastic and evolutionary responses to climate changein terrestrial species. Snowshoe hares Lepus americanus are plastic in the timing oftheir coat color changes from white to brown in spring in response to early snowmelt, making them less susceptible to predation (Zimova et al. 2014 ). Evolutionarychange has been observed in Brassica rapa L. sampled from southern California,which began ﬂowering earlier to minimize the impact of shorter growing seasons asthe result of increased drought impacts (Franks 2011 ). Numerous other organisms,including the American pika, have demonstrated the capacity to alter their behaviorin order to adapt to changing habitat conditions (Beever et al. 2017 ).FreshwaterDocumented responses of ﬁsh to climate change reveal the ability of freshwaterorganisms to adapt to changes in climate conditions through multiple pathways, off-setting species loss and providing some resilience to freshwater ecosystem function(Elmqvist et al. 2003 ; Kovach et al. 2015b ; Lynch et al. 2016 ). For example, Kovachet al. ( 2012 ) found evidence of an evolutionary response in migration timing ofpink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha into freshwater habitats in response to streamtemperature increases and shifting ocean conditions using long-term genetic data.Although temperature preferences and thresholds are known for some freshwater ﬁshspecies and phenological and range shifts have been observed (Lyons et al. 2009 ;Alofs et al. 2014 ; Krabbenhoft et al. 2014 ), increased temperatures or shifts in ﬂowspast critical temperature or water level thresholds may ultimately exceed plastic orevolutionary responses and result in reduced ability to adapt.Hypotheses from Recent Assessments of Climate Impacts to … 365MarineIn a critical review of the plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change inﬁsh, Crozier and Hutchings ( 2013 ) note numerous examples of phenotypic responsesof ﬁshes to climate change but only two formally include evolutionary mechanismsfor an anadromous species, sockeye salmon O. nerka (Crozier et al. 2011 ; Kovachet al. 2012 ). While the trends were considered adaptive for some life stages, adap-tive capacity was not explicitly examined in these studies. However, if evolutionarychanges are to occur, they may act to reduce animal body size and life span, whichwould reduce their value for ﬁsheries (Sheridan and Bickford 2011 ).Changing Primary ProductivityAs primary production is driven, at least in part, by temperature, climate change isexpected to increase productivity in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Pro-jected increases, however, are not always realized since confounding factors, such assunlight, nutrient loading, and secondary consumer interactions can inﬂuence actualproduction rates in dynamic and non-linear ways (Brown et al. 2010 ; Rykaczewskiand Dunne 2011 ; Zhu et al. 2016 ). An understanding of climate change implicationsfor primary production rates is particularly important for biodiversity managementplanning because primary productivity impacts ecosystem function and structureacross trophic levels (Carpenter and Kitchell 1992 ).T errestrialWhile terrestrial primary production has increased globally with climate change(Campbell et al. 2017 ), factors such as regional climate and land use changes causeprimary production trends to vary across the U.S. (Zhu et al. 2016 ). Worseningdroughts in the Southwest, for example, have decreased primary production in thatregion (Zhang et al. 2013 ) and models suggest that decline will continue in the future(Reeves et al. 2014 ). As a result, those areas may undergo large changes in communitycomposition and species diversity (Polley et al. 2013 ; Fritz et al. 2016 ). Other regionalfactors, such as mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae outbreaks in westernNorth America, have shown to decrease primary productivity of certain tree species.Although the beetle is native to the region, warmer winters have increased survivaland exacerbated outbreaks in some regions, affecting the ability of northern foreststo take up and store carbon (Kurz et al. 2008 ).366 S. L. Carter et al.FreshwaterClimate-induced ﬂoods and changes in ﬂow, temperature, and cloud cover inﬂu-ence freshwater ecosystem plankton, macrophytes, primary production, and nutrientcycling (Carpenter and Kitchell 1992 ). Primary production can increase after extremeprecipitation events due to large amounts of nutrient runoff, leading to eutrophica-tion and hypoxic conditions in lakes. Reduced oxygen levels in turn have negativeimpacts on ﬁsh and other freshwater organisms (Schindler et al. 1990 ). Melack et al.(1997 ) predicted increased glacial runoff from climate change would reduce primaryproduction and ultimately cause decreased growth in salmon in southcentral Alaska.The impacts of climate change on freshwater primary production affects ecosystemfunction on multiple levels (Elser et al. 2007 ).MarineMarine primary production is driven by light and nutrients and is moderated bytemperature. With climate change, there is increased stratiﬁcation between the sur-face and deeper layers which can limit nutrient availability at the surface (Stocker2014 ), as well as projected changes to salinity (Saba et al. 2016 ). Direct evidencefor declines in primary productivity as a result of climate change, however, remainsmixed (Henson et al. 2010 ; McQuatters-Gollop et al. 2011 ; Boyce et al. 2014 ).Modest to moderate declines in ocean primary production are projected for mostlow- to mid-latitude oceans over the next century, but regional patterns of changeare less certain (Rykaczewski and Dunne 2010 ; Bopp et al. 2013 ; Laufkötter et al.2015 ). Most models also project increasing primary productivity in the Arctic due todecreasing ice cover, which is supported by recent observations (Arrigo et al. 2008 ;V ancoppenolle et al. 2013 ; Ardyna et al. 2014 ).Invasive SpeciesClimate change and non-native species are both recognized as signiﬁcant driversof biodiversity loss (Hellmann et al. 2008 ). Novel climate conditions and bioticselection pressures are generally expected to favor invasive species over short evo-lutionary timescales (Moran and Alexander 2014 ), although locally adaptive traitsand competition for resources can also favor native species (Sorte et al. 2013 ). Achanging climate, in conjunction with increased global trade, is generally expectedto favor the establishment and spread of biological invasions, but the condition of thehabitat and ecosystem structure (i.e., species richness and diversity) will also impactestablishment. Direct evidence, however, is still lacking for many taxa (Hulme 2017 ).Hypotheses from Recent Assessments of Climate Impacts to … 367T errestrialExtreme climatic events, such as storms, ﬂoods, or droughts, can facilitate the trans-port, establishment, and spread of terrestrial invasive species, as well as affect themagnitude of their impacts (Diez et al. 2012 ). Many of the same ‘weedy’ traits(e.g., pervasive growth) associated with invasive species put them at an advantagewith respect to climate change tolerance and adaptability. For example, introducedcool-season grasses can respond strongly to extreme precipitation events, whichhas drastically altered the plant community composition in a Colorado mixed-grassprairie (Concilio et al. 2016 ).FreshwaterClimate change coupled with the presence of invasive species in freshwater ecosys-tems has compounding impacts on native diversity (Rahel and Olden 2008 ). Arecent review of aquatic invasive species found that recent invasions are more well-documented for terrestrial systems compared to freshwater (Havel et al. 2015 ).Nonetheless, climate change is thought to have allowed the invasion of two trop-ical, invasive dragonﬂies to freshwater systems in Florida (Paulson 2001 ). Presenceand increased abundance of invasive species resulting in alterations of the food web(see Zanden et al. 1999 ) and more competition for resources impact native freshwaterspecies and biodiversity (Lynch et al. 2016 ).MarineNon-native species are often introduced into marine systems via transportation, com-merce, and other human-assistance pathways, but natural spread is an increasinglycommon pathway due to changing conditions (Molnar et al. 2008 ). The range expan-sion of invasive species due to climate change has been proposed as a mechanism forincreasing successful invasions (Occhipinti-Ambrogi 2007 ). The effect of climatechange and invasive species has been implicated in the expansion of invasive Euro-pean green crab Carcinus maenas from the Gulf of Maine to Nova Scotia (Roman2006 ), as well as in the collapse of marine ecosystems, such as in the Gulf of Maine,where declines in groundﬁsh stocks have been attributed to overﬁshing, introductionof opportunistic benthic species, and a 1–2 °C increase in sea surface temperatures(Harris and Tyrrell 2001 ).368 S. L. Carter et al.Novel CommunitiesNovel communities and ecosystems are predicted to become increasingly commonas native species shift their ranges, new species invade areas outside their histor-ical ranges, and species shift their phenology patterns (Lynch et al. 2016 ). Novelcommunities have been documented in terrestrial (Morgado et al. 2015 ), freshwater(Krabbenhoft et al. 2014 ), and marine ecosystems (Edwards and Richardson 2004 ;Smith et al. 2017 ). Novel communities will present new challenges to biodiversitymanagement efforts and create difﬁcult questions and decisions on how best to man-age these new climate change-induced assemblages.T errestrialNew combinations of terrestrial species are already being observed in many partsof the U.S., particularly where warming is more rapid. Fungal community structureis shifting in the moist tundra regions of Alaska so that warm-adapted species arebecoming more common, potentially affecting nutrient cycling and carbon storage(Morgado et al. 2015 ). Additionally, warming temperatures have reshufﬂed winterbird community structure in the eastern U.S. as a result of increasing abundanceand colonization of smaller-bodied and warm-adapted birds (Princé and Zuckerberg2015 ). Invasive cheatgrass Bromus tectorum in sagebrush-steppe habitats in the west-ern U.S. is creating novel conditions (Bradley et al. 2006 ) that are disrupting trophicinteractions between large mammalian predators (e.g., American badger T axideataxus ) and their prey (e.g., Piute ground squirrel Urocitellus mollis ; Holbrook et al.2016 ).FreshwaterClimate-induced range shifts, invasive species colonization, changes to primary pro-duction, and varying levels of adaptive capacity may result in novel freshwater com-munities and ecosystems with new species functioning differently (Lynch et al. 2016 ).For example, southeastern U.S. freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to cli-mate change effects in high diversity streams and lakes (Mulholland et al. 2008 ).Climate-induced changes in ﬂow result in less diverse macroinvertebrate communi-ties made up of species with shorter life histories, such as mayﬂies, outcompetingspecies with longer life history traits (e.g., mollusks) (Mulholland et al. 2008 ).Hypotheses from Recent Assessments of Climate Impacts to … 369MarineClimate change-driven range shifts and introduction of invasive species can leadto new species interactions and novel communities within marine systems. Often,these new scenarios can have negative implications for native species. Residencetime for tropical species in the temperate estuaries of Narragansett Bay and LongIsland Sound has increased with climate change to the point where some speciesare becoming more established; this has signiﬁcant implications for commercialﬁsheries, as these habitats are nursery grounds for many commercial ﬁsh species andthe tropical species can predate on the fry and also compete for valuable resources(Wood et al. 2009 ).Management Responses and Broader ImplicationsAs climate change increasingly affects biota and ecosystems around the world, evi-dence is accumulating for both anticipated and unanticipated effects. Nevertheless,many knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, particularly at local and regionallevels. The speed of this global, unprecedented change and associated uncertain-ties require rapid, ongoing dialogue between managers and scientists to ensureinformed management of impending risks to valued resources. However, many pro-jected impacts to biodiversity have not yet been tested or are occurring inconsistentlyacross taxa and among ecosystems. Here, we reviewed evidence for climate impactsto biodiversity from recent literature and climate assessments in the U.S. for thepurpose of constructing general working hypotheses.We articulated common hypotheses about expected range shifts, phenologicalshifts, phenotypic responses, changes to primary production, biological invasions,and development of novel communities to climate change (Table 1), and attemptedto provide a basic assessment framework for understanding observed climate changeimpacts to biodiversity. We articulated these hypotheses based on literature reviewswe conducted during recent assessments, and based on our subject matter exper-tise. It is important to note that conducting a systematic literature review for eachhypothesis was outside the scope of this paper, as was articulating hypotheses ona regional- or system-speciﬁc scale. Ultimately, this set of hypotheses can be mostuseful as a generalized framework, within which the research community can iter-atively assess impacts and reﬁne hypotheses in light of new evidence. Repeatedevaluation of observed impacts through modelling and assessment are essential todescribing the underlying processes driving climate change impacts within globalecosystems. Flexible, adaptive management approaches can use this information toprepare for projected impacts of climate change while accounting for signiﬁcantuncertainty (Table 2). Moving forward, this effort will beneﬁt from a formal, quan-titative assessment of evidence for each hypothesis through a systematic literaturereview and expert elicitation, particularly to examine impacts at regional scales. In370 S. L. Carter et al.addition, work connecting the observed and projected impacts of climate change, asunderstood through these hypotheses, to effects on ecosystem goods and services andassociated co-beneﬁts would provide valuable information to decision makers andmanagers. By using a hypothesis-driven framework to understand climate impacts tobiodiversity, the scientiﬁc community can better inform climate adaptation actionsand associated management strategies.ReferencesAlcamo J (2005) Ecosystems and human wellbeing: a framework for assessment/MillenniumEcosystem Assessment.

Heikkinen, Saija Kuusela, Niko Leikolaand Juha PöyryAbstract Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity, causing species to moveto new climatically suitable areas, and thus increasing the extinction probability ofspecies inhabiting fragmented landscapes. This highlights the need for climate-wiseconservation strategies. With such strategies, a well-connected network of protectedareas (PAs) is one of the most important means to support species survival. Anextensive and representative PA network can enhance the resilience of regional pop-ulations of species, resulting in slower species loss in landscapes with a signiﬁcantproportion of area of habitat being protected. This paper presents analyses of boththe observed (1974–2010) and the predicted changes (by 2051–2080) in boreal birdpopulations in Finland. Firstly, the results show some general patterns of climatechange on bird species: (1) species are shifting their ranges towards north, (2) rangesizes of many species are declining, and (3) these changes are different in northernand southern species and in species occupying different habitats. Secondly, the paperlooks more into the role of protected area (PA) network in securing birds in a chang-ing climate and concludes that at least in Finland, open habitats, such as open miresand mountain heaths, change more rapidly in their species composition in protectedareas than for example old-growth forests. However, generally, species decline lesswithin than outside PAs showing that protected areas alleviate climate change effectson bird species of conservation concern. This ﬁnding, further supported by resultsfrom elsewhere in Europe, provides evidence for the resilience of PA networks inpreserving species under climate change.

Thirdly,the paper discusses several aspects of climate change studies and avian biodiversitythat have been hitherto understudied especially in the northern biomes. The papersuggests that future studies should concentrate on (1) abundance-based models andprioritisations, (2) species’ adaptive capacity (ability to avoid the impacts of climatechange through dispersal and/or evolutionary change) and sensitivity (limited poten-tial to persist in situ under changing climate) to climate change, (3) the role of thelandscape matrix around the PAs and (4) the effects of the biogeophysical features ofthe PAs themselves. In conclusion, we envision that improved assessments regardingthe ability of PA networks to maintain biodiversity in northern biomes are needed toenhance our ability to perform climate-wise conservation planning.IntroductionGlobal climate change is one of the most important threats to biodiversity (Bellardet al. 2012 ; Thomas et al. 2004 ), creating accelerating pressures on species pop-ulations and communities (Parmesan 2006 ; Paciﬁci et al. 2017 ). Future changesin climate are projected to cause large changes in the distribution of species invarious taxa (Thomas et al. 2004 ; Thuiller et al. 2005 ). For example, bird speciesdistributions have been projected to change considerably in Europe during the 21stcentury (Huntley et al. 2007 ,2008 ). Climate change also causes a notable turnoverin species and alters the functional structure of species assemblages (Thuiller et al.2014 ; Virkkala and Lehikoinen 2017 ).One of the main instruments alleviating the impacts of climate change on biodiver-sity are regional and national networks of protected areas (PAs). However, speciesranges are moving poleward following the effects of changing climate (Parmesan2006 ; Huntley et al. 2007 ,2008 ; Brommer et al. 2012 ), which poses challenges forthe PA networks, possibly decreasing their efﬁciency at preserving biota (Araújoet al. 2004 ; Hannah et al. 2007 ). Under shifting species distributions, PAs may ceaseto provide protection to those species for which they were originally established(Coetzee et al. 2009 ;H o l ee ta l . 2009 ; Araújo et al. 2011 ).The future efﬁciency of the PA network in preserving biodiversity under a chang-ing climate has been studied using modelled projections of species range shifts, andby comparing climatically suitable areas for the species at present and in the future(Hannah et al. 2007 ;H o l ee ta l . 2009 ; Araújo et al. 2011 ). Such studies, employingso-called bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs), have provided important insightsinto potential species losses, turnover and gains in conservation areas, as well asgaps in the PA network (Heikkinen et al. 2006 ; Araújo and Peterson 2012 ).Climate change-driven range shifts are expected to be the most pronounced atnorthern latitudes because of the greater temperature increase projected for theseregions (Jetz et al. 2007 ). For example, in Finland, according to the strongest climatechange scenario, the mean annual temperature will increase by as much as 7 °C bySigniﬁcance of Protected Area Network in Preserving … 3792080 in comparison with the baseline period, 1961–1990 (Jylhä et al. 2004 ). Loarieet al. ( 2009 ) compared the world’s 14 main biomes and their PAs, demonstratingthat the so-called climate residence time will be among the lowest for PAs situatedin boreal forests by the year 2100. This would mean that the PAs of boreal forestsare likely to face the greatest climatic changes on a global scale. Moreover, speciesand communities in northern boreal and Arctic regions are at particular risk becausethe Arctic Ocean represents an effective natural barrier to northward range shifts.Virkkala et al. ( 2008 ) showed that bird species particularly susceptible to the effectsof climate warming are indeed those with distributions concentrated in the northernboreal or Arctic zones.Given these forecasts, the magnitude of species turnover in the PAs of a borealbiome may be extensive following the large local and regional changes in climaticsuitability for the species, i.e. northern species retreating northwards will be replacedby new species from the south. The need for assessments of the impacts of climatechange on boreal biota is urgent due to the fact that landscapes and environmentsin northern Europe are also affected by diverse land use causing the degradation ofhabitats, such as intensive forest management, drainage of mires and wetlands, andultimately, fragmentation of a previously continuous forest landscape.In this paper we ﬁrst (Sections “ General Patterns of Climate Change Effects onBird Species in Finland ”t o“ Range Shifts of Birds in Relation to Dispersal Pat-terns ”) summarise ﬁndings from recent studies on bird species distributional anddensity pattern changes with respect to PA network in northern Europe, and then(Section “ Directions for Future Research ”) discuss a number of insufﬁciently stud-ied research questions with respect to the conservation of birds in the changingnorthern environments. In the ﬁrst sections, key ﬁndings come from our analyses ofboth the observed (1974–2010) and predicted changes (by 2051–2080) in boreal birdpopulations in Finland. Here, we will ﬁrst assess whether the distributional changesof species are in line with the predictions of the climate change and secondly, if thechanges are more pronounced in unprotected than in protected areas, i.e. whether aPA network can be resilient in relation to climate change in preserving species of con-servation concern. In other words, the paper sheds light on the question of how wellwill the current PA network maintain bird species populations in the future givena rapidly changing northern European climate. In Section “ Directions for FutureResearch ” we discuss future prospects of species and PA vulnerability assessmentswhich can be used in developing climate-wise protected area networks. Conclusionsare presented in Section “ Conclusions ”. The paper focuses on birds and studies per-formed in northern Europe. Thus, the conclusions may not hold in other speciesgroups with different life histories and dispersal abilities, or in birds living in otherlocations with possibly less severe climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures.380 R. Virkkala et al.General Patterns of Climate Change Effects on Bird Speciesin FinlandFinland stretches 1100 km across the boreal biome of northern Europe and is lat-itudinally divided in the hemiboreal, southern boreal, middle boreal and northernboreal zone, with the northernmost parts of northern boreal being at the border ofthe subarctic zone (Fig. 1). PA network is largely concentrated in the northern borealzone and is mostly covered with coniferous (dominated by Scots pine Pinus sylvestrisor Norway spruce Picea abies ), mixed and deciduous (dominated mainly by birchBetula spp) forests, open mires (treeless peatlands), marshlands, and Arctic mountainheaths.In Finland, the mean weighted latitude of the observed population density of the 94most common land bird species has moved northwards, on average by 1.3 km year−1from the 1970s to the 2010s (Virkkala and Lehikoinen 2014 ). The shift was more pro-nounced in northern species than in southern ones, but range shift based on presence-absence atlas data was more rapid in southern than in northern species (Brommeret al. 2012 ; Virkkala and Lehikoinen 2014 ). The difference can be explained by themethodology that was used: in the atlas data the extinction from a given grid cell atthe species’ southern range margin can be a slow process with a small bird popula-tion surviving for some time. Similarly, in Sweden the composition of boreal birdassemblage has been shown to respond to temperature changes with a time lag of1–3 year(s) (Lindström et al. 2013 ).Studies based on BEMs using presence-absence bird atlas data from 1974 to1989 have suggested that northern-boreal bird species may face range contractionsof 74–82% by 2080 depending on the climate scenario for northern Europe (Virkkalaet al. 2008 ). Observed range shifts provide support for these predictions: the rangesof northern-boreal bird species that were predicted to contract by 2080 had alreadydeclined by 27% from 1974–89 to 2006–10 (Virkkala et al. 2014a )Based on the Finnish national bird atlases compiled in 1974–1989 and 2006–2010,the recent range shifts in forest, mire, marshland and Arctic mountain heath birdspecies of conservation concern [including e.g. red-listed species, EU Bird Directivespecies (Annex I), species of European conservation concern; see Virkkala et al.(2013a ) for details], as well as the changes in their species richness in protected versusunprotected areas were compared (Virkkala et al. 2014b ). The trends emerging fromthe atlas data comparisons were also related to the projected distributional changesof these species for the time slice of 2051–2080 (Virkkala et al. 2013a ,b). The resultssuggest that the observed changes in bird distributions are in the same direction asthe BEM-based predictions, resulting in a decrease in species richness of (northern)mire and Arctic mountain heath species and an increase in (southern) marshlandspecies.Signiﬁcance of Protected Area Network in Preserving … 381Fig. 1 Location of protected areas (red) in Finland. Light grey /equal1southern boreal zone, middlegrey/equal1middle boreal zone and dark grey /equal1northern boreal zone. Hemiboreal zone in the south-western coast is included in the southern boreal zone382 R. Virkkala et al.The Role of Protected Areas in Preserving Bird SpeciesPopulationsVirkkala and Rajasärkkä ( 2011a ) examined changes in bird populations in a setof 96 Finnish PAs based on transect count observations. Their results showed thatpopulations of southern species had increased by 29% while those of northern specieshad declined by 21% between 1981–1999 and 2000–2009. These changes were mostpronounced near the species range boundaries: southern birds increased most innorthern PAs and northern species decreased most notably in southern PAs (Virkkalaand Rajasärkkä 2011b ). In particular, species breeding on open mires and in Arcticmountain heaths in northern Finland have decreased. It appears that species inhabitingPAs where the focal habitats may change rapidly because of climate change (e.g. openmires and mountain heaths) have more difﬁculties in maintaining their populationsthan species occupying PAs where the time lags in climate change-induced habitatalterations are longer (as in old-growth forests) (Virkkala and Rajasärkkä 2012 ).The observed changes in species richness between the two time slices (1974–1989and 2006–2010) were in general parallel in protected and unprotected areas. However,protected areas maintained a higher level of species richness than unprotected areas(Virkkala et al. 2014b ). Moreover, when examining the population density changesof bird species, it appears that northern cold-adapted species have declined much lesswithin than outside PAs (Santangeli et al. 2017 ). These ﬁndings provide support forthe signiﬁcance and resilience of PA networks in preserving species diversity underclimate change. Similar results were also presented in France, demonstrating thatthe more a bird species beneﬁted from PAs, the less vulnerable it was to temperaturechanges (Gaüzère et al. 2016 ).Within the boreal zone, the ranges of species of conservation concern are predictedto shift dramatically during the 21st century. For example, the ranges of forest species(measured as probability of occurrence) currently situated in the southern borealzone are predicted to move towards the middle and northern boreal zones (Virkkalaet al. 2013a ). The ranges of all species groups occurring in different habitats (exceptmarshland birds) are predicted to decrease by 2051–2080, with the decline beinggreatest in southern boreal and smallest in northern boreal zone. This is becausespecies presently occurring in the southern boreal zone are predicted to move to thenorthern boreal zone partly compensating for the predicted decline of the northernboreal species. In contrast, southern Finland is projected to face a general decline insouthern boreal birds. This is because species found e.g. in the Baltic countries willapparently not be able to compensate for the projected losses in southern Finland.Thus, the ranges of the species are predicted to shift northwards, but the potential gainof expanding southern species of conservation concern (occurring presently south ofFinland) will apparently not compensate for the loss of the present boreal species.Overall, a high bird species turnover is predicted to occur in the 21st century and wasalready observed in Finland between 1974 and 2010 (Virkkala and Lehikoinen 2017 ).For species living in forests, mires and mountain habitats, the changes are predictedSigniﬁcance of Protected Area Network in Preserving … 383to be slightly greater in unprotected than in protected areas. Thus, a representative PAnetwork that includes high cover for key habitats is needed in all latitudinal zones.Virkkala et al. ( 2013b ) expanded on the ﬁnding of earlier studies by relating birdspecies occurrences to the amount of habitat preferred in the PAs in the differentboreal zones. Here, a novel integrated habitat suitability index was employed toaccount jointly for the projected species’ probability of occurrence and the avail-ability of suitable habitat (Virkkala et al. 2013b ). Based on this suitability index, thedistribution of suitability hotspots (topmost 5%) were determined for birds living inforests, open mires, marshlands and Arctic mountain heaths in 1971–2000 and underthree climate change scenarios (IPCC SRES scenario: B1, A1B, A2). The locationsof the suitability hotspots were compared with the locations of reserves with thegreatest amounts of the four habitats to assess the efﬁciency of the PA network. Forspecies inhabiting mires, marshlands and Arctic mountain heaths, a high proportionof protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots in the scenarios for 2051–2080,showing a good match between current PAs and suitability hotspots in 2051–2080. Incontrast, in forests in the southern and middle boreal zones, only a small proportionof the protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots, indicating that the efﬁciencyof the current PA network will be insufﬁcient for forest birds in the future (Virkkalaet al. 2013b ). This is because only 2.3% in the southern boreal zone and only 3.7%in the middle boreal zone are included in the protected areas whereas 23% of forestsin the northern boreal zone are protected (Virkkala et al. 2013a ).In the northern boreal zone, the predicted efﬁciency of the reserve network inforests was highly dependent on the forcefulness of projected climate change. In thenorthern boreal zone the extent of PAs is much higher than in the south (see Fig. 1), butdue to the concentrated location of the areas, the signiﬁcance of PAs for maintainingforest bird species (of conservation concern) emerges particularly under the strongestscenario: A2 (Virkkala et al. 2013b ). The concentrated level of forest protection inthe northernmost part of the northern boreal zone raises an interesting dilemma: ina mild climate change scenario, the PA network is clearly inefﬁcient, while in astrong climate change scenario it preserves, on average, species occurrences muchmore effectively precisely because southern forest species are expected to move moretowards the north as a result of climate change (Virkkala et al. 2013b ). However, theextinction of northern species should be the most profound according to the strongestclimate change scenario (Virkkala et al. 2008 ). Thus, there is no single solution forpreserving biodiversity in a changing climate, but several future pathways should beconsidered.Range Shifts of Birds in Relation to Dispersal PatternsPAs have been observed to facilitate the species’ range expansions of various species(Thomas et al. 2012 ), which is a key issue when analysing the future signiﬁcance ofPA networks for biodiversity given a changing northern European climate. IndividualPAs can act as stepping stones for creating a suitable breeding habitat (Thomas and384 R. Virkkala et al.Gillingham 2015 ). In Finland, certain habitats, such as old-growth forests and manymire and wetland types, can nowadays only be found in PAs due to intensive forestryand other land use practices outside PAs. For species specialised to these habitats,the PA network is indispensable.The dispersal ability of bird species is, in general, fairly good in relation to manyother species groups, although certain resident forest species can be quite poor dis-persers [e.g. Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus (Griesser et al. 2014 )]. Good dispersalability of individual birds enables shifts in a species range, but intensive land useleading to the degradation and fragmentation of habitats may restrict bird speciesrange shifts following the effects of climate change (see Virkkala and Lehikoinen2017 ). In addition to northern species (such as the Siberian jay), some southern birdspecies have also declined and their ranges have retreated. This may suggest that notall southern species may track climate change due to the scarcity of suitable habitatnorth of their present range. In general, species richness is predicted to increase inthe northern latitudes as more southern species expand their ranges northwards (seeHuntley et al. 2007 ). However, in Finland the total amount of bird species richnessdid not change in 10 km grid cells in a clearly warming period from 1974–1989to 2006–2010. Thus, southern species have not expanded as quickly as might beexpected as a result of climate change (Virkkala and Lehikoinen 2017 ; for the futurepredictions of southern species, see Section “ The Role of Protected Areas in Preserv-ing Bird Species Populations ”). Moreover, in Finland 128 land bird species shiftedtheir mean weighted densities between 1970–1989 and 2000–2012 by 37 km to thenorth north-east while the mean annual temperature shifted on average 186 km inthe same direction. Thus, the speed of climate change is occurring almost ﬁve timesmore quickly than the speed of density shifts (Lehikoinen and Virkkala 2016 ).Directions for Future ResearchAbundance and Vulnerability StudiesThe studies discussed above have mainly examined the recent range shifts inbird species, or forecasted future distributions using bioclimatic envelope models(BEMs). Studying the magnitude of projected changes in remaining, new and over-lapping (present-future) suitable areas allows to asses species’ exposure to the effectsof climate change (Foden et al. 2013 ; Reside et al. 2016 ). However, while BEMsprovide useful estimates of potential changes, forecasts for the relative suitabilityof different regions and individual PAs for a species may be improved by includingmeasures of abundance in the models (Howard et al. 2014 ). Importantly, abundance-based models assist in the identiﬁcation of PAs, which can harbour sufﬁciently largepopulations, thus lowering the local extinction risk. Such models have been applied tobirds in the UK, revealing vital insights into the projected future population declinesof species and the long-term representativeness of PAs (Johnston et al. 2013 ). InSigniﬁcance of Protected Area Network in Preserving … 385northern biomes, abundance-based data prioritisations of current and future impor-tant areas for bird conservation are still lacking, constituting one obvious knowledgegap. Data permitting, the inclusion of breeding success in the bird species modelswould also make it easier to identify PAs with the highest potential for long-term pop-ulation persistence (Suárez-Seoane et al. 2017 ). However, the collection of breedingsuccess data may need to be targeted to particular species of conservation concerndue to the considerably high resource demands.It is increasingly acknowledged that climate change exposure assessments forspecies should be complemented with an examination of two other vulnerabilitymeasures: species’ adaptive capacity (ability to avoid the impacts of climate changethrough dispersal and/or evolutionary change) and sensitivity (limited potential topersist in situ under changing climate) to climate change. In a case-in-point study,Foden et al. ( 2013 ) developed vulnerability assessments for the world’s 9856 birdspecies. In their work, sensitivity was determined based on characteristics such ashabitat specialisation, narrow environmental tolerance and rarity, low adaptive capac-ity based on, e.g. poor dispersal potential, and limited evolutionary potential due to,e.g. low genetic diversity or low reproductive output. Bird studies focusing on certainbiomes (Reside et al. 2016 ) or regions (Case et al. 2015 ) have largely employed sim-ilar vulnerability criteria, along with some other criteria, such as dietary breadth andspecies’ physiological sensitivity. Corresponding studies from northern biomes arelargely lacking. Clearly, new studies on this topic could help in assessing which birdspecies are among the most vulnerable in boreal environments and which life historytraits make them sensitive in the face of climate change. For example, although birdsare more mobile than many other species groups, there are between-species differ-ences in their dispersal ability, potentially affecting their range expansion capacityand colonisation of isolated PAs (Huntley et al. 2008 ; Reside et al. 2016 ).Two take-home messages emerge from the vulnerability studies. First, a speciesmay be vulnerable due to its limited adaptive capacity or high degree of sensitivity,even if it is only slightly exposed to climate change, and also due to other combi-nations of vulnerability criteria. Most importantly, sole exposure-based assessmentsmay either overestimate or underestimate climate change impacts, and different per-spectives are required to reveal hidden vulnerabilities (Reside et al. 2016 ). Second,the combined use of three criteria makes it possible to identify the species mostat risk, i.e. species that are highly sensitive, that are highly exposed and that havelowest adaptive capacity (Foden et al. 2013 ). Such information facilitates targetingconservation interventions not only for the most vulnerable species, but also for theareas and PAs harbouring the largest concentrations of those particular species. Trait-based analysis can also be linked to observed changes in species distributions (Paciﬁciet al. 2017 ). Thomas and Gillingham ( 2015 ) reviewed the numerous positive casesof species being able to colonise new PAs; such information could also be linkedwith species’ life histories to determine traits that either support the colonisation ofnew areas or severely obstruct it.Habitat preferences of bird species may limit their ability to adapt to climatechange not only because of their ﬁdelity to a speciﬁc habitat but also due to differ-ences in the rate of projected habitat changes relevant for the species. For example,386 R. Virkkala et al.forest dwelling species are not generally subjected to rapid environmental changesin protected forests, but, on the other hand, the colonisation of old-growth forestmay be delayed in currently sparsely wooded PAs due to the slow succession rateof forests. In contrast, the overgrowth of open alpine areas and grasslands is a rapidprocess which has been considered as one key threat to open habitat bird species(Chamberlain et al. 2013 ) (see also Virkkala and Rajasärkkä 2012 and Section “ TheRole of Protected Areas in Preserving Bird Species Populations ” above).Importance of Matrix and Protected Areas’ CharacteristicsAssessing the representativeness of PA networks in a changing climate requiresresearch also on two other topics: the landscape matrix around the PAs and thebiogeophysical features of the PAs themselves. Häkkilä et al. ( 2017 ) examined theeffects of land use intensity in the surrounding matrix on the diversity of bird speciesin boreal PAs. They showed that low intensity forest management in the matrixsupported the well-being of a wide range of specialised bird species in the PAs,indicating the challenges for boreal forest reserves to maintain the full range of birddiversity in degraded landscapes. Similar studies could also be conducted for othernorthern ecosystems, including peatland, wetland and alpine communities in the PAnetwork. Equally important would be more in-depth examinations of the impactson the quality of a dynamically changing matrix and its interactions with climaticchange, as these two drivers may jointly have ampliﬁed effects on the efﬁcacy of PAs(Sieck et al. 2011 ). Indeed, Beale et al. ( 2013 ) have shown that while recent spatialchanges in climatically suitable areas have driven the broad patterns of distributionalchanges, colonisation preferentially occurs in less degraded areas with a higherproportion of PAs. Land use scenarios indicate that many PAs are likely to losenatural vegetation in their surroundings due accelerating human impacts (Gimonaet al. 2012 ; Martinuzzi et al. 2015 ). These prospects highlight the importance ofbuffering PAs (Sieck et al. 2011 ) but they also identify the PAs which are projectedto be hardest hit by the joint impacts of matrix and climate change.Intensiﬁed land use in the matrix may also have negative impacts on species’ abil-ity to move to the new PAs as suitable habitats become more fragmented and isolatedin the intervening landscape (Sieck et al. 2011 ) and the overall ecological connectiv-ity of the network deteriorates (Gimona et al. 2012 ). A key target for climate-wisespecies conservation is the planning of a network of readily reachable, biodiversity-friendly managed sites that can serve as stepping stones in the process (Huntley et al.2008 ). The importance of such a stepping stone or metapopulation network dependson species’ dispersal ability, which is more critical for resident birds and species withlow gap-crossing propensity than for migratory birds (see also Section “ Range Shiftsof Birds in Relation to Dispersal Patterns ”). However, further research is requiredon how dispersal ability, in association with other important traits, such as habi-tat specialisation and sensitivity to temporal weather perturbations, affect species’range shifting and colonisation processes across the dynamically altering matrix andSigniﬁcance of Protected Area Network in Preserving … 387under varying climatic conditions. Such studies would make it possible to determineareas where the landscape matrix severely hampers many species from tracking thespatial changes in their climate space, which potentially would require interventionssupporting species dispersal.The characteristics of the PAs themselves also affect species persistence. Onebasic principle is that smaller PAs are able to support smaller populations of species.Additionally, climate change may affect the strength of the density dependence regu-lating a population, and this can inﬂuence local populations in smaller PAs differentlythan in larger ones. Thus, the highly variable climate projected for future years mayimpede in a temporally varying population from returning to former population lev-els most strongly small PAs (Crick 2004 ), causing increased risk of local extinctions.However, new research is required to better understand the links between extremeweather events and population ﬂuctuations and crashes, and particularly how wellspecies with different traits are buffered against the environment-driven ﬂuctuations.Increased topographic and habitat heterogeneity within PAs will supposedly sup-port higher species richness and also provide increased chances for local popula-tions to survive due to the wider availability of different microclimates buffering theimpacts of climatic variations (Thomas and Gillingham 2015 ). Moreover, topograph-ically heterogeneous PAs may help species to avoid misusing phenological triggersand the associated temporal mismatches between trophic levels (Crick 2004 ). How-ever, studies of this sort are in short supply for northern biomes. There is also a needto link such studies with the life histories of species to be able to recognise whattypes of bird species the environmentally variable PAs beneﬁt the most. In addition,little is known about the extent of which environmentally diverse PAs offer sufﬁcientlong-term protection to bird species because the local temperature variations, even intopographically variable PAs, will usually not compensate for the projected increasesin regional temperatures towards the end of this century (Ackerly et al. 2010 ). Thisagain highlights the importance of the ability of species to migrate to new areas andPAs.ConclusionsThis paper shows evidence of climate change effects on northern European birds,underpinning the facts that species are shifting their ranges towards north with rangesizes of many species declining and that these changes are different in northern andsouthern species and in species occupying different habitats. Importantly, speciesdecline less within than outside PAs showing that protected areas alleviate climatechange effects on bird species of conservation concern. This ﬁnding, further sup-ported by results from elsewhere in Europe, provides evidence for the resilience ofPA networks in preserving species under climate change. Representative PA networkthat includes high cover for key habitats is hence needed in all latitudinal zones. Theprojected efﬁciency of the PA network in maintaining biodiversity was partly depen-dent on the strength of climate change varying with respect to future scenarios. This388 R. Virkkala et al.suggests that a ﬂexibly adaptive climate-wise conservation planning is required to bebetter prepared for preserving biodiversity in the face of uncertain climatic change.The paper discusses several aspects of climate change studies and avian biodi-versity that have been hitherto understudied especially in the northern biomes. Wesuggest that future studies should concentrate on (1) abundance-based models andprioritisations, (2) species’ adaptive capacity (ability to avoid the impacts of climatechange through dispersal and/or evolutionary change) and sensitivity (limited poten-tial to persist in situ under changing climate) to climate change, (3) the role of thelandscape matrix around the PAs and (4) the effects of the biogeophysical featuresof the PAs.In conclusion, we envision that improved assessments regarding the ability ofPA networks to maintain biodiversity in northern biomes, as well as the climate-wise conservation planning under climate change in general, require more in-depthexaminations of the different risk sources, ranging from species exposure to climatechange and their traits to the impacts of the biogeophysical features of PAs andland use on the matrix. Such cross-cutting analyses will help researchers distinguishbetween areas where the different climate change-based risks are low or moderateand areas where many climatically vulnerable species coincide with PAs with alowered buffering potential and severely degraded matrix. Such maximal risk areasmay require major restoration measures to increase their value in the PA network.Acknowledgements Our work was ﬁnancially supported by the Finnish Ministry of the Environ-ment through the SUMI project (Protected area network in the changing climate).ReferencesAckerly DD, Loarie SR, Cornwell WK, Weiss SB, Hamilton H, Branciforte R, Kraft NJB (2010)The geography of climate change: implications for conservation biogeography.

Ecol Evol 4(15):2991–3003Wild Power, Biodiversity and SolarFarms: A Business Model to EncourageClimate Change Mitigationand Adaptation at ScaleDavid Gazdag and Guy ParkerAbstract The UK is facing a sustained decline in biodiversity while struggling tomeet its targets for renewable energy production. Wild Power is a new approachto renewable energy supply that requires native biodiversity to be restored on itsgenerating sites as a core component of the business model. A customer pays a smallpremium which is used to encourage biodiversity, and in return receives a guaranteeof renewable energy supply and biodiversity beneﬁt. Solar farms are the ideal vehiclefor delivering biodiversity beneﬁts as the panels oversail the land, most of which isavailable for ecological enhancement. Furthermore, solar farms are spread acrossthe landscape and collectively cover a signiﬁcant land area. Core to Wild Power’sapproach is engaging local communities with solar farms to raise awareness of themultiple beneﬁts of this technology, but also as a means of reconnecting people withnature. The Wild Power approach has been designed for UK solar farms, with aimto expand to wider renewable technologies, and countries in time. It is believed thatthis approach is novel and has global implications for biodiversity and sustainabledevelopment. This chapter presents the Wild Power model and describes its intent toencourage renewable energy as a means of mitigating climate change and promoteadaptation through the creation of biodiversity-rich sites that should also enhanceecosystem services delivery.D.

ParkerThe UK’s Biodiversity DeclineRecent studies indicate that the UK’s biodiversity decline is even greater than theglobal average (Hayhow et al. 2016 ). Between 2002 and 2013, it is estimated that 53%of UK species declined (Hayhow et al. 2016 ). This decline is attributed to agriculturalpractices as well as pressures from climate change. Habitat fragmentation throughagricultural development appears to exacerbate biodiversity loss (Fahrig 2003 ). Newevidence suggests climate change effects may be accelerated with the slowing ofthe Gulf Stream (Caesar et al. 2018 ). Clearly there is need for urgent mitigation ofclimate change and biodiversity loss.Solar Farms and Climate Change MitigationSolar power has the ability to mitigate the effects of climate change. Solar photo-voltaics are among the best ways to decarbonise the electricity production, beingscalable and relatively easy to develop. A single 5 MW site saves around 2150 tonsof CO2(STA 2018 ) as compared to UK baseline electricity generation per annum,which over the 25-years lifespan of a solar farm equates to a saving of around 54,000tons.Solar power has rapidly expanded in the UK since 2010, with large scale groundmounted solar being responsible for around 8.6 GW of energy generation today.There are more than 1200 utility scale solar farms spread across the UK (Fig. 1),covering an estimated 19,000 ha (Scurlock, NFU; pers. comm.). In combination,they signiﬁcantly contribute to the UK’s targets to reduce CO 2generation by 80%in 2050.Many solar farms were built on former arable land. When land is converted fromarable production to permanent grassland (the typical land cover for a solar farmin the UK), it has the potential to switch from being a net producer of carbon (acarbon ‘source’) to a net receiver of carbon (a carbon ‘sink’). Arable ﬁelds producecarbon through all the intensive inputs required to grow a crop, including chemicalfertilisers, pesticides and machinery time. By contrast, permanent grassland requiresfew inputs and produces a thick mat of vegetation which is effective at storing carbon.While the overall reduction in CO2may be small (around 1 ton/ha or less than 1%of the reduction due to renewable energy production (POST 2015 ;F A O 2010 )t h i seffect can be signiﬁcant at the national and global level and should contribute to thelong-term Paris goals for negative emissions.Wild Power, Biodiversity and Solar Farms: A Business Model … 393Fig. 1 Map of large scale solar deployment (planned and constructed) in the UK from April 2017(Source BEIS Renewable Energy Planning Database, 2017 )Solar Farms and Climate Change AdaptationSolar farms also have the ability to contribute to climate change adaptation, to coun-teract the changes to the environment caused by climate change. The likely effectsof climate change upon the UK include increases in temperature, changes in theseasonality of rainfall, and an increased frequency of extreme events such as ﬂoods,with knock-on effects for the distribution and density of native biodiversity.Where solar farms were constructed on former arable land, converting the landcover to permanent grassland should reduce the risk of ﬂooding and erosion eventsby creating a stable, permanent and well-vegetated ground surface.If traditional grasses or wild ﬂowers (e.g. ﬁne grasses and herbs) have been estab-lished, this form of vegetation tends to be more drought resistant than agriculturalcrops or pasture grasses, since wild ﬂowers and ﬁne grasses tend to have deeper394 D. Gazdag and G. Parkerroots. Such areas are more likely to resist single severe drought events or multiplesmall drought events.Where solar farms are managed to encourage wildlife, they should provide refugefor a variety of native plants, invertebrates, reptiles and birds (Montag et al. 2015 ).A network of solar farms managed for wildlife spread across the landscape shouldsupport adaptation of wildlife to climate change which requires space and a varietyof habitats in order to adapt to shifts in range.Finally, sites that are rich in biodiversity are likely to provide a range of ecosystemservices for the beneﬁt of society. These services are likely to support agriculturalproduction, as discussed later in this chapter.Solar Farms and BiodiversityThe relationship between solar farms, land management and biodiversity has beenthe focus of recent studies and there exists a small but growing evidence base aswell as a large body of independent research into parallel agri-environment schemes.Recent evidence suggests solar farms can provide positive beneﬁts for biodiversitywhere creation of native habitats, including species rich grasslands, hedgerows andwetlands has been undertaken (Montag et al. 2015 ).Biodiversity gains from such management approaches can include a higher diver-sity of botanical species, a higher abundance of common species of butterﬂy andbumblebee, and a higher diversity of breeding birds, including greater abundance ofspecies of conservation concern (Montag et al. 2015 ).The solar industry, in developing its approach to biodiversity, has borrowed landmanagement options from the UK’s agri-environment schemes (BRE 2014 ). Optionssuch as grassland ﬁeld margins and native species-rich hedgerows can ﬁt well aroundsolar infrastructure and have been recognised as priority habitats for the UK Bio-diversity Action Plan (JNCC 2012 ). Field margins can harbour arable wild ﬂowerssuch as shepherd’s needle, corncockle, broadleaved spurge, cornﬂower, corn butter-cup and pheasant’s-eye which are rare in the wild. In turn, wild ﬂowers are importantsources of nectar and pollen for bumblebees, wasps and butterﬂies. Grasshoppersand beetles take cover in the grasses, along with many beneﬁcial predators, such asspiders and ladybirds, which feed on crop pests like aphids (Wildlife Trusts 2018 ).Such invertebrate rich habitats provide foraging for birds and small mammals.Adoption of biodiversity-focused land management is fairly limited within thesolar industry at present. Wild Power’s approach is to promote the adoption of agri-environment style options for land management, but also to encourage the creationof rare habitat types such as species rich limestone or acid grassland, which havedeclined greatly in the past century and which have resulted in associated specieslike the Adonis blue butterﬂy having been virtually extirpated from the UK.Wild Power, Biodiversity and Solar Farms: A Business Model … 395Ecosystem ServicesSociety beneﬁts from nature in a multitude of ways in the form of food production,the provisioning of clean drinking water, the decomposition of wastes, and the pol-lination of crops amongst many others. These beneﬁts, termed ‘ecosystem services’contribute to human wellbeing and economic wealth (Millenium Ecosystem Assess-ment 2005 ). Ecosystem services are all underpinned by biodiversity, which can be,depending on the deﬁnition, a regulator of ESs, a ﬁnal ESs or a good (Mace et al.2012 )Solar farms that encourage biodiversity have the potential to supply a range ofecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water cycling, crop pest preda-tion and pollination. Research on solar farms and ecosystem services is currentlylimited, but it is possible to draw upon wider research undertaken on UK agriculture.The SPIES project—Solar Park Impacts on Ecosystem Services (Armstrong andWhite 2018 ) has collated evidence on ecosystem service beneﬁts from a range ofdifferent land management options. Land managers can use this decision-support toolto assess the impacts of different management approaches on ecosystem services.The evidence is sourced from a database of scientiﬁc papers, mainly concerned withagri-environment schemes, including the habitat options already mentioned above.The SPIES tool is being used by Wild Power as a mean of assessing the valueof different land management options for ecosystem service provision. To give anexample, SPIES determines that creating ﬁeld margins should positively impact thefollowing ecosystem services: climate regulation, pollination regulation, water qual-ity and ﬂood regulation—along with maintaining habitats and biodiversity. Plantingand maintaining hedges should positively impact habitats for biodiversity, pollinationregulation and pest and disease regulation.SPIES also considers cultural ecosystem service values such as recreational andaesthetic interactions, which for Wild Power, and for the solar industry more gener-ally, can be an important component of public acceptance of a project.It is likely that ecosystem services generated on a solar farm would not onlybeneﬁt the solar farm itself, but should also support agricultural production in thesurrounding landscape. It is not currently possible to say to what degree birds andinsects associated with a biodiverse solar farm may have a positive beneﬁt as crop pestpredators upon surrounding arable land. In addition, it is not possible to determinethe inﬂuence of pollinators with increasing distance from a source habitat. However,independent research is under way to address these knowledge gaps. For example,a study launched in 2017 is investigating the potential for strips of wild ﬂowersplanted within arable crops to encourage crop pest predators and so reduce pesticideuse (Guardian 2018 ).396 D. Gazdag and G. ParkerPollinationPollination is among the best studied ecosystem service in the UK and is affordedmore speciﬁc attention here. The majority of global, and European, biodiversityis made up of insects, but still relatively little is known about the distribution andabundance of most species, and even less about their dynamics and the threats theyface (Potts et al. 2015 ). This lack of knowledge on the status and trends of the majorityof Europe’s species is of concern and is particularly important for species that playimportant functional roles, such as pollinators.Wild pollinators in Europe are dominated by 2000 species, including bumblebeesand solitary bees, hoverﬂies, butterﬂy, beetle and other ﬂy species. Declines in wildbees and hoverﬂies have been clearly documented in the Netherlands and the UKwhere monitoring has taken place (Potts et al. 2015 ).According to SPIES, maintaining wild ﬂower/nectar seed meadows andhedgerows, connecting habitats, creating buffer zones/ﬁled margins, ceasing pes-ticide/fertilizer use and grazing later in the year are all management steps that shouldenhance pollinators, and would be expected on a Wild Power solar farm.Data gathered from systematic surveys of selected pollinators on a Wild Powerpilot solar farm in the UK present an interesting case study (Parker, unpublished data).Bumblebee abundance in the 3 years following baseline (when the solar farm wasconstructed and wild ﬂower habitats were introduced) is seen to increase signiﬁcantly,with moderate increases in species richness too. Butterﬂies on the other hand exhibitlarge ﬂuctuations, with an initial spike in abundance, followed by a decline to belowbaseline levels. Species richness of butterﬂies declines through the survey period(Fig. 3).The graphics of bumblebees and butterﬂies raise some interesting questions on theinteraction between pollinators, and what services can a Wild Power farm provide.According to Potts et al. ( 2015 ), bumblebees have more stable population in UK andEurope, while butterﬂies are more volatile and continue to decline. This backgroundvolatility in butterﬂies may contribute to the ﬂuctuations displayed in Fig. 2.Honeybees are encouraged on Wild Power solar farms, as community involve-ment is central to the proposal, and honey is a useful means of demonstrating theconnection between solar energy and food production. However, recent studies sug-gest honey bees can potentially compete with wild pollinators (Barbir et al. 2015 ,2016 ). Based on this evidence, and until further research is available, Wild Powerwill set conservative guidance for the number of hives per hectare that a solar farmcan support. This is an example of how Wild Power is committed to using the bestavailable evidence to inform its management decisions.Wild Power, Biodiversity and Solar Farms: A Business Model … 397 - 10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80  Baseline (2014) 2015 2016 2017 BumblebeesSpecies Individuals  - 5   10   15   20   25   30   35  Baseline (2014) 2015 2016 2017 Butterflies Species Individuals Fig. 2 Results of 4 years of invertebrate surveys at a single solar farm in the UK managed forbiodiversity. Species richness is shown in blue and abundance is shown in orange ( Source GP a r k e r ,unpublished data)Scaling upIf all solar farms in the UK were managed for biodiversity, then their potential todeliver biodiversity and ecosystem service beneﬁts could be signiﬁcant at the nationalscale. However, only a small sub-set of solar farms currently adopt this approach.The question remains how to scale up these beneﬁts across the solar industry. WildPower aims to use market forces to ensure uptake at a meaningful scale for climatechange resilience and adaptation, and UK’s biodiversity and ecosystem services.A New Way of Selling ElectricityWhile green electricity has growing demand, both in the corporate and domestic mar-ket segments, no supplier currently offers veriﬁed biodiversity beneﬁts. Wild Powerwill sell renewable energy to domestic customers from sites that have been enhancedfor biodiversity according to strict standards—and directly connects customers totheir local sites. Market research indicates that a signiﬁcant portion of buyers whoare already committed to renewable energy will be willing to pay for this additionalbeneﬁt. A scalable model has been designed to bring private ﬁnancing for large scalebiodiversity enhancement and climate change mitigation (Fig. 3).Working with local ecologists, the rewilding plan is developed, based on theneeds of the sites and in alignment with the rigorous Wild Power guidelines. Thebiodiversity outcomes are monitored annually using systematic methods and aresubject to independent veriﬁcation. Wild Power enters a contractual agreement withsolar farms to purchase their future energy and provides them with the full packageof re-wilding.398 D. Gazdag and G. ParkerFig. 3 The Wild Power processAs an integral part of the business model, Wild Power aims to engage customersand neighbouring communities in the solar farm’s land management.Wild Power Community EngagementWild Power aims to support climate change mitigation by encouraging acceptance ofrenewable energy production through its community programmes. Some communitymembers may be concerned about visual impact on the landscape, or that the solarfarm takes land out of agricultural production. By engaging community members inthe activities of the solar farm itself (e.g. through site visits and monitoring activities)and by offering the opportunity to purchase power and thus contribute to wildlifemanagement at their local site, it is hoped attitudes will be positively inﬂuenced.European children fascinated by gadgets tend to spend less time playing outside.This results not only in the loss of connectivity with nature, but also with directhealth problems (Moss 2012 ). Wild Power aims to use its unique offer to engage kidsin a dynamic programme of education (both formal and informal) to demonstratehow a solar farm contributes to their life. For example, how their smart phones arecharged, how a power plant works, how solar energy is transformed into the grid,how photosynthesis captures sunlight and how it is transformed through the foodchain to the well-deserved lunch (Fig. 4).Wild Power’s approach to community engagement has been developed with thehelp of Lorna Lyle, Director of Solar Power Education . An example of activities isgiven in Table 1below.Wild Power, Biodiversity and Solar Farms: A Business Model … 399Fig. 4 Wild Power engaging with childrenTable 1 Examples of Wild Power community and training programsActivity DescriptionEcology Team Building and Bug Hotel TeamBuildingCommunity participants and customers workwith ecologists to study and improve thebiodiversity at a wild power site.

Theseactivities are designed to ﬁt into the NationalCurriculumTeacher’s Day Teachers are invited to tour a Wild Power site,learn how energy is generated, complete a bughunt and build a bug hotel, return to a localschool to share ﬁndings and explore ways touse the site in the classroomWild Power is committed to sharing the results of its work both to raise awarenessof biodiversity loss and climate change and to support practitioners in achieving bestpractice land management on solar farms. This will be achieved through educationprograms, collaboration with NGOs and universities, case studies published onlinesharing results through papers and symposia.400 D. Gazdag and G. ParkerSustainabilitySustainable development is at the core of Wild Power’s business model. The 17Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel-opment recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies thatbuild economic growth and addresses a range of social needs including education,health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change andenvironmental protection (UN 2016 ).Wild Power contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG 15 (Life on land), SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy)and is planning to expand to SDG 14 (Life Below water). Wild Power also aims tocontribute to SDG 1 (No poverty) SDG 2 (Zero hunger) SDG 4 (Quality education)SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation)—and in line with SDG 17 Wild Power seekspartnerships to reach our goals.To scale up successful project cases to programmes or sustainable market level,it is important to adopt a holistic approach to private sector engagement on climatechange and green growth (OECD 2018 ). As Wild Power extends its program to otherrenewable energy sources (e.g. wind, off-shore wind, hydro) and other countries andregions, the approach will be able to support multiple SDGs at a meaningful scale.ConclusionsWild Power encourages native biodiversity on solar farms as a core component of itsbusiness model. Wild Power sites have the potential to supply multiple beneﬁts fromthe land, including the generation of renewable solar energy, improved biodiversity,and the supply of a range of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, andwater/air/soil quality, pollination, ﬂood and soil erosion regulation, among many oth-ers. These beneﬁts not only contribute to climate change mitigation, they also supportadaptation both of native biodiversity and agricultural production. Such beneﬁts arevitally important in the UK where land resources are limited and biodiversity is indecline, and are relevant to many situations globally.Constraints of This ResearchThe Wild Power approach is constrained by the following knowledge gaps:1.

It also suggestssome measures which may be helpful in reaching different groups, so as to betterengage them in adaptation efforts.IntroductionClimate change and a whole and global warming in particular, are known to havea negative impact on biodiversity in three main ways. Firstly, climate change leadsto increases in temperatures, which are known to be detrimental to a number oforganisms, especially those in sensitive habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests.Secondly, the pressures posed by a changing climate may lead to sets of responsesin areas as varied as phenology, range and physiology of living organisms, oftenleading to changes in life cycles (especially but not only in reproduction), losses inproductivity or even death. On occasions, the very survival of some very sensitivespecies may be endangered. Thirdly, the impacts of climate change on biodiversityare estimated to be felt in the short term in respect of some species and ecosystems,but also in the medium and long term in many biomes. Indeed, if left unattended,some of these impacts may be irreversible.The Convention on Biodiversity acknowledges the fact that biodiversity is affectedby climate change, and that biodiversity, through the ecosystem services it supports,also makes an important contribution to both climate-change mitigation and adap-tation. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has, inconnection with its 5th Assessment Report (AR5), recognized the fact that withouteffective mitigation strategies, further changes in climate, atmospheric carbon diox-W.

These are projected to havesubstantial impacts on water resources, coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, health,agriculture, and biodiversity (IPCC 2014 ).The current rates of biodiversity depletion which may be traced back to humanactivities are a reason for concern. Even though human activities have historicallybeen seen as leading to losses of biodiversity, the intensity with which climate changeas a whole and global warming in particular is taking place, means that a growth in thedamages to natural assets and to the ecosystems services provided- some of which arecrucial for human well-being- are expected. In particular, increased greenhouse gasesemissions may be combined with other drivers such as extreme events (especiallydroughts) and accelerate biodiversity depletion. As outlined by Chapin et al. ( 1998 )The ecosystem consequences of a changing biodiversity are signiﬁcant and needto be avoided. But despite this reality, Leadley et al. ( 2014 ) outlined the fact thatthe degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services over the twenty-ﬁrst centurycould be far greater than was previously predicted.The impacts of climate change on biodiversity may be seen at three levels: theenvironmental impacts, the social impacts and the economic impacts. Table 1sum-marises them and offers an overview of their dimensions.The list provided in Table 1is by no means exhaustive. It serves the purpose ofillustrating the variety of impacts seen, which indicate the need to adopt a preventiveapproach when trying to handle them.One concrete case study can be seen at Lake Victoria, which is divided amongUganda, Kenya and Tanzania. With a surface area close to 27,000 mile2,i ti st h ebiggest lake in Africa, and the second largest freshwater lake in the world, offeringa basis for the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people who depend on it forHandling the Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity 405Fig. 1 Inﬂuences of climatechange on biodiversity in theAmazon rainforests.

As a result of climate change andthe increased temperatures, levels of evaporation have increased. This is combinedwith the concentration of nutrients from agriculture on the water which, in turn,may provide good conditions for the excessive growth of algae or macrophytes,which seriously affect the water quality. These changes favour the most robust algaland animal species whilst the more sensitive ones may disappear, and the changesinterfere with various beneﬁcial uses of water (Gikuma-Njuru et al. 2015 ). Theimpacts of climate change to the biodiversity of Lake Victoria ersoty are well beyondthe environmental ones: a reduction in the levels of ﬁsh production could lead to aimbalance in food availability. This could, in turn, aggravate poverty and possiblycatalyse political instability in the affected areas.A second concrete case study can be seen from the Amazon rainforests: climatechange is believed to be inﬂuencing the dynamics of rivers in the region in a signiﬁcantway. It may also inﬂuence their role as carbon stocks (Jantz et al. 2014 ) and thebiodiversity elements it is associated with (Fig. 1).In addition, increased temperatures and reduced rainfall in some areas may alsoreduce suitable habitat during dry, warm months and potentially lead to an increasein invasive, exotic species, which then can out-compete native ones. According toBrodie et al. ( 2012 ), there are many key concerns, among which is the fact thataridiﬁcation could increase the accessibility of previously non-arable or remote lands,elevate ﬁre impacts and exacerbate ecological effects of habitat disturbance.As these two examples illustrate, the problem is serious and deserves promptattention, despite the fact that there are some challenges which need to be overcome.406 W. Leal FilhoChallenges in Biodiversity Conservation Under a ChangingClimateThere are various challenges which make the handling of the impacts of climatechange to biodiversity a difﬁcult task. Some of them are as follows:i. climate impacts may affect ecosystems completely or in part, leading to changesin physio-chemical conditions and altering the structure of habitats;ii. these impacts may also be felt as the species´ level, meaning that the mostsensitive ones either considerably suffer or may even perish;iii. damages to biodiversity are difﬁcult to be reversed, especially when they are atadvanced stages;iv. apart from damages to fauna and ﬂora, impacts on biodiversity often reﬂect onnegative consequences to the livelihoods of some populations, especially thepoorer ones which depend on natural resources as sources of income.There are also many factors which exarcerbate the negative inﬂuences of climatechange to biodiversity conservation. Firstly, the pressures caused by physio-chemicalstructures of some ecosystems, combined with a heavy reliance on them -and oftentheir excessive use-, may lead to a decrease in their availability to provide theirecosystem services. This is the case of oceans at the macro level, which are shownto be inﬂuenced by climate change (especially, but not only by acidiﬁcation), withvarious negative effects to the fauna and ﬂora they host, or to lakes (which alongwith evaporation also are put under pressure by euthrophication) at the micro level.Secondly, climate change affects biodiversity in the sense that it causes disruptionsin food chains. The reductions in the population of some species—or the completedisappearance of particular species as the literature documents—may lead to changesin the food supply. For instance, reductions im plankton due to high temperaturesmay affect the many water based organisms which feed on them.Thirdly, changes in temperature and weather conditions may trigger other phe-nomena which may seriously undermine biodiversity. The Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that ﬂooding associated with sea-level rise islikely to have substantial impacts on lowland areas such as the Amazon River delta(IPCC 2014 ). Another example is seen in respect of forest ﬁres, as those observedin California or parts of Portugal and Spain in 2017. Long dry spells can providesuitable conditions for forest ﬁres, which can spread over large distances and wipeout entire populations of animals and plants, over a short period of time.There is also a perceived need to better communicate the connections betweenclimate change and biodiversity (Leal Filho 2009 ; Leal Filho et al. 2018 ), since thismay support attempts to catalyse real action.At the macro level, the “Lima Declaration on Climate Change and Biodiversity”issued in 2014 lists a variety of measures which need to be pursued, to reducethe impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Since then, there have been calls formutually supportive implementation of the nationally determined contributions underthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the national biodiversity strategies andHandling the Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity 407action plans under the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Strategic Plan forBiodiversity 2011–2020 (CBD 2017 ). It is important that coordinated efforts betweenthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Conventionon Biological Diversity are implemented, in a way which is consistent with the actionneeded at the national and local levels.Conclusions: Moving T owards Mitigating the Impactsof Climate Change on BiodiversityAt present, many individual governments, ﬁnancial institutes and internationaldonors are currently spending billions of dollars in projects around climate changeand biodiversity, but with little coordination. Quite often, the emphasis is on adap-tation efforts, with little emphasis on the connections between physio-ecologicalchanges and the life cycles and metabolisms of fauna and ﬂora, or the inﬂuence ofpoor governance on biodiversity.There is therefore a perceived need to not only better understand the impacts ofclimate change on biodiversity, but also to engage on an action pyramid which entailsa set of measures aimed at managing the many risks climate change poses to fauna,ﬂora and micro organisms (Fig. 2). These are:identify the procedures which may be deployed to reduce the impacts of climatechange to biodiversitytest them with a view to checking their feasibility and efﬁciencyimplement them in a wider scale, with a replication and upscaling which may gowell beyond the areas originally tested.ImplementTestIdentifyFig. 2 Action pyramid to handle the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Source Author408 W. Leal FilhoIn particular, the question as to how better restore and protect ecosystems from theimpact of climate change also has to be urgently addressed.A second course of action needed, is a greater emphasis to the protection and/orrestauration of the ecosystems most affected by climate change. Here, the list is quitelong: from forests to lakes, from mountains to valleys and mangroves.Ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation should therefore beone of the top priorities, both in respect of government policies, but also in termsof development assistance. An investment in ecosystems protection is likely to yieldbeneﬁts 10 times or more greater than the focus on a particular species. Efforts toprotect and recover damaged ecosystems may potentially represent a signiﬁcant stepforward, since they automatically beneﬁt the many plant and animal species, as wellas microorganisms, which inhabit these ecosystems.Furthermore, in trying to address the problems climate change poses to biodiver-sity, it is important to consider a set of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially:SDG 1 (No Hunger),SDG 2 (No Poverty),SDG 13 (Climate Action),SDG 14 (Life Below Water) andSDG 15 (Life on Land).Since biodiversity issues permeate all these themes, an integrated approach is needed,as opposed to the many disconnected approaches which tend to prevail today.ReferencesBrodie J, Post E, Laurance WF (2012) Climate change and tropical biodiversity: a new focus.
