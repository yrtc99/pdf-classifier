This review describes what is known to date onM./C2giganteus from extensive research in Europe and more recently in the US. Researchtrials have shown that M./C2giganteus productivity is among the highest recorded withintemperate climates. The crop’s high productivity results from greater levels of seasonalcarbon ﬁxation than other C 4crops during the growing season. Genetic sequencing ofM./C2giganteus has identiﬁed close homology with related crop species such as sorghum(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sugarcane ( Saccharum ofﬁcinarum L.), and breedingof new varieties is underway. Miscanthus /C2giganteus has high water use efﬁciency;however, its exceptional productivity causes higher water use than other arable crops,potentially causing changes in hydrology in agricultural areas. Nitrogen use patterns areinconsistent and may indicate association with N ﬁxing microorganisms. Miscanthus /C2giganteus has great promise as an economically and ecologically viable biomass crop;however, there are still challenges to widespread commercial development.I. INTRODUCTIONA. A ROLE FOR BIOMASS CROPSIncreasing the share of world energy that comes from renewable sources iscritical to stabilizing the global climate (IPCC, 2007). Among renewable energysources, only biomass can provide fuel and electricity in a form and scale that iscompatible with existing transportation and power generation infrastructure(DOE, 2006 ). Unlike wind and solar energy, biomass can be converted directly76 E. A. HEATON ET AL .into liquid fuel by a variety of conversion routes, as is current practice withpetroleum, or it can be stored to generate electricity on-demand, asis the currentpractice with coal. It also provides raw material for renewable alternatives tofossil-based products. Biomass is also the only available source of renewablecarbon for products currently made from fossil carbon sources.How much biomass is needed? Of the 105 exajoules (EJ, 1018J) of energyconsumed in the US in 2008, only 4% or 4.1 EJ came from biomass sources,mainly from combustion of wood residues for heat and power by papermanufacturers ( DOE, 2009 ). Energy consumption is expected to increaseby 14% by 2034, to 120.8 EJ ( DOE, 2010 ). Multiple acts of legislationcurrently under consideration in the US could further increase renewableenergy demand 10–40%, leading it to comprise 14% of the total US energydemand, or 17 EJ y/C01, by 2035 ( DOE, 2010 ).Over 900 million Mg of biomass per year is needed to produce 17 EJ y/C01,assuming biomass to contain 18 MJ kg/C01(Jenkins et al. , 1998 ) and energyconversion to be 100% efﬁcient. Of course, conversion of biomass energy intouseful forms like liquid fuels or electricity is not 100% efﬁcient, and typicalefﬁciencies range between 30% and 70%, depending on methods andaccounting ( Brown, 2003; Jenkins et al., 1998; Mohan et al., 2006 ). Assumingan average conversion efﬁciency of 50%, the US will require more than1.8 billion Mg of biomass per year to meet renewable energy demandsthrough bioenergy, or a little more than 50% of the entire US maize crop in2009 ( NASS, 2010 ).Even if only a portion of US renewable energy comes from biomass, it willstill have a major impact on cultivated and natural lands. The feasibility andimpact of large-scale biomass production have been intensely debated andinvestigated in recent years ( Dohleman et al. , 2010; Dornburg et al. , 2010;Fargione et al. , 2008; Hertel et al. , 2010; Hill et al. , 2009; Kim et al. , 2009;Levasseur et al. , 2010; Reijnders, 2010; Smeets and Faaij, 2010; Solomon,2010; Taheripour et al. , 2010 ). Despite a wide range of conclusions, it isgenerally agreed that (1) resources are limited and (2) future agriculturalsystems must be sustainable.B. FOOD VERSUS FUEL AND THE CASE FOR HIGH-YIELDING CROPSIt is reasonable to propose that crops that produce high biomass yields perunit land area be used to meet bioenergy demand, since they will require lessland than low-yielding crops, and this is a key principle of biomass cropdevelopment ( Heaton et al., 2008b ). For example, the high-yielding perennialMiscanthus /C2giganteus could require 87% less land to produce the sameamount of biomass as a low-input, high-diversity mixture of prairie species,MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 77because the yield of the M./C2giganteus monoculture is nearly eightfoldgreater ( Heaton et al. , 2008a ). However, while yield might be a drivingselection criterion, it is not the only one, and future crop systems must beevaluated on their environmental and social functions, in addition to tradi-tionally valued economic functions ( Boody et al., 2005; Schulte et al., 2006 ).Diverse cropping systems that ﬁll all available environmental niches canprovide more ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, water retention andﬁltration and biodiversity than annual monocultures, but they are inherentlymore difﬁcult to manage for biomass production because each species prefersdifferent conditions in a given year ( Russelle et al., 2007; Tilman et al., 2006 ).High-yielding perennials that are on the ﬁeld for most of the year can offer acompromise by simplifying crop management over diverse mixtures whilestill providing ecosystem services ( Heaton et al., 2004b; Schmer et al., 2008 ).1. Sustainability‘Sustainable’ has many deﬁnitions, most of them contentious with referenceto agriculture. A useful metaphor to discuss sustainability is the ‘sustain-ability stool’. The legs of the stool are environmental, economic and socialsustainability; if an agricultural system has inadequate performance in any ofthe three areas, the system will eventually collapse ( Douglass, 1984 ).Perennial energy crops potentially can provide a solid foundation for sus-tainability with performance that is equal to or improved over that of annualarable crops.a. Economic sustainability. Of the three legs of the sustainability stool,economic sustainability of agriculture receives the most attention. Globally,there has been a trend away from diverse crop rotation to simpliﬁed annualcrop systems that has been accompanied by increases in yield and farmlabour productivity, made possible through increased reliance on syntheticfertilizer, pesticides and subsidy payments for crops in surplus ( Bullock,1992; Malezieux et al. , 2009; Schulte et al. , 2006; Tegtmeier and Duffy,2004). Beginning with the Soil Conservation Act of 1935, the US governmenthas, like many developed countries, paid farmers to set aside land fromarable cropping, and instead plant it to perennials as a soil conservationtool. As demand grows for highly productive land to produce food, feed, ﬁbreand now fuel, however, the value of these government programmes fadesin comparison to what a farmer can earn by producing a subsidy-protectedgrain crop.Traditionally, it has been difﬁcult and nebulous to value the ecosystemservices provided by perennial agriculture ( Farber et al. , 2002; Liu et al. ,2010; Porter et al. , 2009 ), and without a harvested product for sale,78E. A. HEATON ET AL .perennials usually lose against annual crops in the marketplace. With theadvent of a clear demand for energy from perennial biomass, farmers andconservationists may have their cake and eat it too, as the crops grown can beharvested and sold for a proﬁt while still providing ecosystem services similarto those from set-aside land.How does the economic return of biomass crops compare to that oftraditional arable crops in the US? James et al. (2010) calculated the break-even price for a farmer in the Midwestern US to switch to a range ofperennial energy crops and found that currently, none was economicallyviable against continuous maize production on highly fertile land. However,they evaluated M./C2giganteus using current prices for rhizomes ($1.80 ea)and a future price anticipating improved production practices ($0.05 ea) andfound that of all the crops evaluated, future M./C2giganteus is more proﬁtablethan continuous maize, with a break-even price of only $45 Mg/C01(Jameset al., 2010 ). In on-farm trials with co-operators in Nebraska, South Dakotaand North Dakota, Perrin et al. (2008) found that switchgrass could begrown at a commercial scale for about $50 Mg/C01. By comparison, the costsfor continuous maize production on prime farmland in Iowa are about$150 Mg/C01in 2010 ( Duffy, 2010 ), suggesting that perennial crops are proﬁt-able and will be economically sustainable even on prime farmland in the US.b. Environmental sustainability. Perennial plants have long been associatedwith good environmental performance and improved ecosystem health.Without the disturbance of annual soil tillage above- and below-groundbiomass accumulates, perennials protect and hold the soil against wind andwater erosion while increasing soil quality and organic matter ( Blanco-Canqui, 2010; Luo et al. , 2010 ). An increased proportion of perennials inthe landscape are also associated with an increase in biodiversity, as peren-nials provide habitat for animals and insects ( Malezieux et al., 2009; Schulteet al. , 2006 ). Additionally, perennial crops can increase the quantity anddiversity of mineral nutrients available in the rhizosphere by establishingcomplex and often long-term relationships with the microbial community(Davis et al. , 2010; Nehls et al. , 2010 ).The larger and active root system of perennial grasses is particularlyeffective at scavenging available nutrients and preventing them from leachingwith draining water where they may act as pollutants ( Allan, 2004; Randallet al. , 1997 ). In the US Environmental Protection Agency’s recent ScienceAdvisory Board report on hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, the high losses ofnitrate from current corn–soybean production systems on tile-drained land-scapes in the Mississippi River Basin were clearly identiﬁed as a major sourceof the nutrients causing hypoxia ( EPA, 2008 ). These losses occurred evenMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 79when best management practices were applied. In that report, it was sug-gested that perennials were the best option to substantially reduce nitratelosses, but such a shift was unlikely, given current agricultural policies.In a more speciﬁc example of how nitrate losses from current productionsystems could be reduced using perennials, Hatﬁeld et al. (2009) evaluated awatershed in central Iowa. They observed that mean annual NO 3–N con-centrations in water have been increasing since 1970 in spite of no signiﬁcantchange in N fertilizer use for the past 15 years, and a decrease in cattle andhog production in the watershed. Upon evaluation of regional crop yields,land-use change and precipitation, they found that an increase in landplanted to maize and soybean, at the expense of perennial pasture, werehighly correlated with the increase in NO3–N concentrations. The authorsconcluded that the narrow window of nutrient uptake in maize–soy systemsallowed more nutrients to leave the system, even though the amount offertilizer applied was steady and crop yields were increasing. One suggestedsolution to reduce nutrient loading in the watershed was to plant moreperennials with water use patterns that complement those of maize–soy(Hatﬁeld et al. ,2 0 0 9 ).c. Social sustainability. Biomass energy may help revitalize languishingrural economies ( Solomon, 2010 ). Even as industrial agriculture has deliv-ered record crop yields and gross revenue in the past 50 years, farmeremployment and proﬁt have deteriorated ( Fig. 1 ). The US Department ofAgriculture (USDA) reports that a rural society that used to be characterizedby small farms supported by farm sales has changed to large, concentratedfarms, and over 40% of documented farms are in the ‘residential/lifestyle’category. While the majority of US farms are still small farms, over 50% oftheir operators are retired or rely on another job as their principal occupation(NASS, 2007 ). Conversely, large farms, that is, those with revenue over$100,000 per year, comprise only 15% of all US farms, yet account for 88%of sales. In short, only a fraction of farmers can still make a living fromfarming ( Duffy, 2008 ), and this is reﬂected in the steady decline of ruralpopulations ( US Census Bureau, 1990 ).Job creation in the renewable energy economy supports the social sustain-ability of biomass cropping systems. A review of clean energy ﬁnance by thePew Charitable Trust found global investment up by 230% since 2005,despite the largest economic downturn in at least 50 years, and clean energyinvestments are expected to grow to $200 billion by 2010 ( The PewCharitable Trusts, 2010 ). ‘Green jobs’ have been touted as the solution tothe economic and environmental woes of many countries, and have receivedpriority in economic recovery spending. Despite inconsistent government80 E. A. HEATON ET AL .support, there are already more green jobs than biotechnology-related jobs,though biotech has seen steady government support ( Fig. 2 )(The PewCharitable Trusts, 2009 ).The low bulk density of biomass makes it inherently inefﬁcient to trans-port ( Fales et al., 2007; Rentizelas et al., 2009; Shinners and Binversie, 2007 ),necessitating local processing and handling, thus ensuring distributed jobswithin regions irrespective of the fuel produced. In an analysis of case studiesin Brazil and the Ukraine, Smeets and Faaij (2010) found that instilling a‘strict’ set of sustainability criteria, for example, restriction of child labour,education of the workforce and mandatory healthcare, had positive commu-nity impacts with only a limited effect on the cost of bioenergy productionfrom perennials. This was largely attributed to the reduced costs of perennialagriculture compared to annual row cropping systems.C. A ROLE FOR MISCANTHUS /C2GIGANTEUS1. Origins and usesMiscanthus is a genus comprising 14–20 species of perennial, C 4grassesnative to eastern Asia, N. India and Africa ( Clayton et al. , 2008;Hodkinson et al. , 2002a; Scally et al. , 2001 ).

(2009) ,Miscanthus species have long been used for grazing andstructural materials in China and Japan and have only recently become ofinterest for energy. Long recognized for their ornamental value, and as agermplasm source of stress tolerance in sugarcane breeding, Miscanthusspecies are now found and commonly naturalized in North and SouthAmerica as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia and Europe ( Clayton et al. ,2008; Scally et al. , 2001 ).In 1935, Aksel Olsen brought a sterile Miscanthus hybrid that was ofhorticultural interest back from Yokohama, Japan to Denmark, where itwas cultivated by Karl Foerster and observed to have vigorous growth(Lewandowski et al. , 2000; Linde-Laursen, 1993; Scally et al. , 2001 ). Origi-nally named Miscanthus sinensis ‘Giganteus’ hort. ( Greef and Deuter, 1993 ),it has gone by many names, including M. giganteus ,M. sinensis Anderss.‘Giganteus’ and M. ogiformis Honda ( Hodkinson et al. , 2002c ). By usingDNA sequencing, AFLP and ﬂuorescent in situ DNA hybridization,Hodkinson et al. (2002c) conﬁrmed suspicions that it was an allotriploid(2n¼3x¼57) hybrid of M. sinensis andMiscanthus sacchariﬂorus and sub-sequently formally classiﬁed it with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in theUK as M./C2giganteus (Greef & Deuter ex Hodkinson & Renvoize)(Hodkinson et al. , 2002b ).Following concern over fossil fuel dependence beginning in the 1970s,M./C2giganteus was evaluated along with several other species for potentialas a bioenergy crop.

HEATON ET AL .spread across Europe, and included in both public and private trials(Jorgensen and Schwarz, 2000; Lewandowski et al. , 2000 ).2. Overview of Miscanthus research historyMiscanthus /C2giganteus has been studied across Europe since 1983 under amultitude of national and EU programmes ( Jones and Walsh, 2001a;Lewandowski et al. , 2000 ). Two EU-wide projects, the Miscanthus Produc-tivity Network (MPN) and the European Miscanthus Improvement (EMI),have been particularly inﬂuential on the availability of Miscanthus datatoday ( Fig. 3 ).In 1992, the 3-year MPN began as part of the European Agro-IndustryResearch programme (contract no. AIR1-CT92-0294). With 17 partners in10 countries, the MPN aimed to ‘ ...generate information on the potential ofMiscanthus as a non-food crop in Europe’, ( Jones and Walsh, 2001b ). Mosttrials used similar methods to assess potential productivity associated withwater, nitrogen and low temperature limitation across different environ-ments. Harvest, storage and utilization of biomass were also studied, alongwith genotype screening of other Miscanthus species. Generally, the MPNfound M./C2giganteus to be broadly adapted to a wide range of growingM. xgiganteusimported to EuropeM. xgiganteusevaluatedin Hornum,DenmarkEU fundednetworkDK, UK andIRL (Joule)1935 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010German breedingprogramme attinplant beginsDEFRAinvestment inUK beginsDEFRA fundsbreedingprogramme atIBERS, UK;BP funds EnergyBiosciencesInstitute in Illinoisand CaliforniaActivity = people x resourcesGermanmiscanthusbiomassprogrammestarts withVeba ÖIEU fundednetworkEMN network18 sitesEMI projecttests 15genotypesat 5 sitesPrivatesectorinvestmentBical Ltd.starts inUKFirst US fieldtrial resultsin Illinois Field trialsstartacross USFig. 3.

Clifton-Brown.MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 83conditions, but was not the optimal choice in all locations tested ( McCarthy,1992). For a complete description of MPN results, see Jones andWalsh (2001a) .Following on from the MPN, the EMI project began in 1997 to address thelimitations imposed by a narrow genetic base within M./C2giganteus clonesand better match genotypes with environments ( Lewandowski and Clifton-Brown, 1997 ). Similar in structure to the MPN, EMI focused on cropimprovement by developing breeding methods and assessing the genotype /C2environment interaction of 15 selected Miscanthus genotypes in ﬁve countries(Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001a ). The EMI project successfully identiﬁedgenotypic variation in environmental performance among Miscanthusgenotypes and has paved the way for current private and public breedingprogrammes in the US and Europe ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2008 ).In contrast to Europe, Miscanthus species were not included in initialscreening of potential biomass crops in the US. There, research, supportedprimarily by the US Department of Energy (DOE), focused on switchgrass(Panicum virgatum L.) as a model herbaceous species beginning in the 1980s(McLaughlin, 1992; Parrish and Fike, 2005; Sanderson et al., 1996 ). In fact, itwas not until 2004 that Heaton et al. (2004b) used the model MISCAN-MOD, developed by Clifton-Brown et al. (2000) in Ireland, to project poten-tialM./C2giganteus productivity in the US. Following promising modelledproductivity, Heaton et al. (2004a) Heaton et al. went on to show thatM./C2giganteus was likely to produce more biomass per unit input ofwater, nitrogen or heat, than would switchgrass under the same conditions,and thus ﬁeld research in the US was warranted. Superior yield ofM./C2giganteus over switchgrass was later conﬁrmed in the ﬁrst replicatedtrials of M./C2giganteus in the US, at three sites in Illinois where measuredyields of M./C2giganteus were two- to fourfold higher than those ofswitchgrass, var. Cave-In-Rock ( Heaton et al. , 2008a ).D. STRUCTURE OF THIS REVIEWFollowing promising initial results, a Strategic Research Initiative (SRI) wasinitiated at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to further inves-tigate M./C2giganteus in Illinois. Initial work by 14 investigators focused on aclone of M./C2giganteus collected by the Chicago Botanic Garden andbrought to the Urbana, Illinois campus in 1988 where it had thrived in ademonstration planting ( Heaton et al. , 2008a ). This review will highlightresearch areas addressed by the SRI through support from the IllinoisCouncil on Food and Agriculture Research from 2004 to 2009 (award04-SRI-036) ( Long, 2005 ). Research in Illinois has expanded exponentially84 E. A. HEATON ET AL .in recent years, and has been the provenance of work on Miscanthus in theUS, which has grown from non-existence 10 years ago to being underway innearly every state today.Focusing on M./C2giganteus , this review will address modelled andobserved productivity ( Section II ), the physiological basis for that produc-tivity ( Section III ), breeding and genetic engineering efforts ( Section IV ), theenvironmental impacts of production ( Section V ) and the technicalchallenges to commercial production ( Section VI ).II. PRODUCTIVITYA. EUROPEAN AND US TRIALSHere, we review the biomass production of M./C2giganteus reported fromtrials over a wide geographic range, with emphasis on how yield varies withprecipitation, temperature and soil conditions. While other reviews of Mis-canthus productivity and suitability can be a good source of data that mightbe otherwise difﬁcult to ﬁnd ( Jones and Walsh, 2001a; Lewandowski et al. ,2000; Miguez et al. , 2008; Smeets et al. , 2009; Zub and Brancourt-Hulmel,2010), our goal here is to provide an overview of M./C2giganteus productivity,key factors that inﬂuence it and how it may be modelled and predicted.Productivity of M./C2giganteus has been tested in ﬁeld trials across Europesince 1983 under a multitude of national and EU programmes ( Lewandowskiet al. , 2003b ). Only a portion of the numerous academic and industrial ﬁeldtrials that have been conducted is reported in English and published in easilyaccessed, peer-reviewed publications. Most studies cover a 2–5-year growthperiod, even though the lifetime of a M./C2giganteus stand can range from 15to 30 years ( Hastings et al. , 2009a; Heaton et al. , 2004b ), and only a fewstudies have followed M./C2giganteus growth over a longer term, forexample, 10 or more years ( Christian et al., 2008; Clifton-Brown et al., 2007 ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus is not typically harvested in the year, it is plantedbecause of low yields and possible negative impacts on survival during thecrop’s critical ﬁrst winter. Generally, winter kill is only a problem in the ﬁrstseason; if a plant makes it through the ﬁrst winter, it will nearly alwayssurvive subsequent winters, even if they are much harsher ( Clifton-Brownet al. , 2001b; Heaton et al. , 2008a; Lewandowski et al. , 2000 ). A typicalgrowing season for a mature stand of M./C2giganteus is shown in Fig. 4 .Shoots emerge from the rhizomes in early spring when soil temperatures arebetween 6 and 10 8C. Though leaves can extend at lower temperatures, 10 8Cis considered the standard for consistent leaf extension ( Clifton-Brown andMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 85Jones, 1997; Hastings et al. , 2009a; Zub and Brancourt-Hulmel, 2010 ).Biomass rapidly accumulates through summer, peaking around September(Beale and Long, 1997; Heaton et al. , 2008a ). Though biomass yields arehighest in late summer, so are moisture contents and nutrient take-off rates.The crop is typically harvested after senescence and associated nutrientremobilization and crop drying have occurred, that is, in the period after akilling frost but prior to spring growth. For example, the harvest window inIllinois is between November and March, depending on the demand forfeedstock and ability to access the ﬁeld under snowy winter conditions.During senescence, 30–50% of harvestable dry matter can be lost as leavesdrop ( Clifton-Brown et al., 2007; Heaton et al., 2008a ) and nutrient reservesare translocated to the perennating rhizomes ( Section III )(Beale and Long,1997; Dohleman, 2009 ). Efﬁcient translocation not only helps to ensureadequate nutrient supply for growth in the following season, thus reducingthe need for additional fertiliser ( Himken et al. , 1997; Lewandowski andKicherer, 1997 ), it also minimises the inorganic compounds in the harvestedfeedstock that could become pollutants in fuel ( Jenkins et al. , 1998 ).1. Productivity overviewOverall, studies show that the range of harvestable M./C2giganteus yields tobe between 5 and 55 Mg ha/C01(Fig. 5 ), making it one of, if not the most,productive land plants in temperate climates. The underlying physiologicbasis of this exceptional productivity is discussed in the next section ( SectionIII); here, we outline the results of geographically diverse yield trials.AprilApril MayMay NovemberNovember DecemberDecember FebruaryFebruary August/SeptemberAugust/SeptemberEmergenceEmergence CanopyclosureCanopyclosureSenescenceSenescence Dry downDry down Over winterOver winter MaximumbiomassMaximumbiomassFig. 4.

Map of M./C2giganteus trials and the range of biomass yields reported in the peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature.Numerous studies have evaluated M./C2giganteus in England and Ireland.Beale and Long (1997) measured above- and below-ground productivity of3–4-year-old stands of M./C2giganteus and another C4 perennial grass,Spartina cynosuroides in England at 51 8N latitude. The above-ground bio-mass of M./C2giganteus peaked at 30 Mg ha/C01in mid-September, thendeclined to about 20 Mg ha/C01by February, while S. cynosuroides reachedpeak production in August ( /C2420 Mg ha/C01) but maintained that level through-out the fall and early winter as leaves were retained in the aerial biomass insteadof dropping as in M./C2giganteus. Below the ground, the biomass of rhizomesand roots extracted from a 20-cm depth was found to vary over the course of theyear in a pattern suggestive of nutrient mobilization, with depletion of biomassin the late spring and early summer, followed by increases that peaked aroundthe end of the growing season in early November ( Beale and Long, 1997 ). Thispattern has also been observed in M./C2giganteus in Germany ( Himken et al.,1997)a n dt h eU S( Dohleman, 2009 ).Two of the rare longer-term trials of M./C2giganteus productivity wereconducted in England at the Rothamsted Research Farm (51 8480N) and inCashel Co., Ireland (52 8390N). In the cool climates at both locations, har-vestable biomass continued to increase during the ﬁrst 5 years of growth(Christian et al. , 2008; Clifton-Brown et al. , 2007 ). This is in contrast towarmer locations where ceiling yields were achieved in 2–3 years ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001a; Heaton et al. , 2008a ). Changes in harvestable biomassfollowing achievement of plateau yields were attributed to annual weatherconditions, namely moisture availability, and possibly to K deﬁciencies, as Ktake-off rates were high in both fertilized and unfertilized treatments. InIreland, soil and tissue analysis indicated K to contribute more to observedyield increases than N or P fertilizer ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2007 ), whichshowed no signiﬁcant impact at either location.Germany was the home to some of the largest plantations of M./C2giganteus in the 1990s, though losses of micropropagated plants during theﬁrst winter ( Jorgensen and Schwarz, 2000 ) tempered enthusiasm and slowedM./C2giganteus adoption across the country. Multiple trials in Germany haveshown good potential for M./C2giganteus as well as M. sinensis varieties forbiomass production ( Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2002; Clifton-Brownet al. , 1998; Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001a ) with efﬁciencies of nutrient andenergy use that are comparable to or better than willow ( Salix spp.), switch-grass, reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinacea ) and maize ( Boehmel et al. ,2008; Lewandowski and Schmidt, 2006 ).In the warmer, drier climates of Italy, Greece, Portugal and Turkey, M./C2giganteus has produced >35 Mg ha/C01under irrigation and N fertilization.Such locations present the best documentation of M./C2giganteus yield88 E. A. HEATON ET AL .response to N fertilizer ( Acaroglu and Aksoy, 2005; Ercoli et al. , 1999 ),though the response is still not consistent ( Danalatos et al. , 2007; Mantineoet al. , 2009 ), as reviewed by Miguez et al. (2008) . Without irrigation, M./C2giganteus is not likely to be viable in dry Mediterranean climates, thoughsome types of M. sinensis are promising ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001a;Danalatos et al. , 2007 ).Yield trials of M./C2giganteus started much later in the US, where the focuswas on switchgrass instead of M./C2giganteus as a model herbaceous energycrop ( Heaton et al. , 2004b ). The ﬁrst replicated trials were conducted in theMidwestern US where trials at three locations in Illinois (37 8450N–41 8850N)demonstrated some of the highest productivity on record, with averageharvestable yields of 30 Mg ha/C01without irrigation and only 25 kg ha/C01ofN fertilizer applied in one season ( Heaton et al., 2008a ). Such high yields, 2–4times those of the regionally adapted Cave-In-Rock switchgrass, even undera low-input management scheme, stimulated considerable interest in M./C2giganteus in the US. Furthermore, the sterile nature of this clone is consideredparticularly advantageous in of light invasion potential from new biomasscrops ( Barney and Ditomaso, 2008; Jakob et al. , 2009 ).Dohleman and Long (2009) demonstrated that M./C2giganteus is 60%more productive than maize, even in the heart of the US ‘Corn Belt’. How isthis possible? Even though maize had higher light-saturated photosyntheticrates as well as higher rates of primary carboxylation and substrate regener-ation, M./C2giganteus had more leaf area and a longer canopy duration,allowing it to assimilate more carbon into biomass over the entire growingseason ( Dohleman and Long, 2009 ). A similar result has been observed inKansas, where M./C2giganteus has yielded more than maize (12.8 Mg ha/C01vs. 10.1 Mg ha/C01), though yields of both crops were half of those realized bythe photoperiod-sensitive S. bicolor (Propheter et al. , 2010 ).Why has such large variation been observed in such genetically similarmaterial? In the following sections, we explore the relationship of biomassyield to environmental factors that might limit it.2. WaterAs a C 4crop, M./C2giganteus has a high efﬁciency of water use, typicallyrequiring between 100 and 300 l of water to produce 1 kg of biomass ( Bealeet al., 1999; Lewandowski et al., 2000; Mantineo et al., 2009 ) For comparison,typical values for an annual maize or sorghum crop are near the upper end ofthis range, around 300 l kg/C01(Hanson and Hitz, 1983; Howell et al. , 1998 ).At high yields, efﬁcient use of water does not necessarily confer lowwater use overall, and there is some concern that water availabilitywill limit the use of M./C2giganteus (Richter et al. , 2008 ). For instance, anMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 89M./C2giganteus crop of 25 Mg ha/C01at an average water use efﬁciency wouldrequire 200 l kg/C01/C225,000 kg ¼5,000,000 l or the equivalent of 500 mm ofrainfall during the growing season. More information on water use by M./C2giganteus can be found in Section V .While M./C2giganteus has been shown to have a root–shoot ratio ofapproximately 1 to 1 ( Dohleman, 2009 ) and roots that extend down atleast 2 m ( Neukirchen et al. , 1999 ), it does not appear that M./C2giganteusdraws water from this entire depth. Studies of soil water depletion in Englandand Italy show that M./C2giganteus obtains most of its water from the top1.5 m of the soil proﬁle, leading Finch and Riche (2008) to suggest that 1.7 mshould be considered the ‘effective maximum rooting depth’ concerning soilmoisture ( Beale et al., 1999; Finch and Riche, 2008; Monti and Zatta, 2009 ).Beale et al. (1999) found that M./C2giganteus grown in southern Englandextracted most of its water from the ﬁrst 0.8 m of the soil proﬁle and 90% ofthe root biomass was found in the ﬁrst 0.5 m of the soil proﬁle. In this study,the water use efﬁciency of M./C2giganteus was higher than another C 4grass,S. cynosuroides , but the higher productivity of M./C2giganteus was mainlydue to its extended growing period, since the ﬂowering of S. cynosuroidescommenced in early July and M./C2giganteus remained vegetative untilSeptember, reaching 29 Mg ha/C01of dry biomass in an irrigated ﬁeld. In acontainer experiment, Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski (2000b) foundM. sacchariﬂorus to have the highest water use efﬁciency (4.1 g DM kg/C01H2O) when compared to M. sinensis andM./C2giganteus . They concludedthatM. sinensis would be more suitable to drier environments than the othertwo genotypes since it responded early to drought stress by reducing stomatalconductance and leaf growth ( Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000b ).Quantiﬁcation of the impact of soil moisture deﬁcit on biomass yieldhas been attempted within single experiments, but is perhaps best summar-ized by the inputs into MISCANFOR, a crop growth model developed forM./C2giganteus and a stress-tolerant M. sinensis variety ( Hastings et al. ,2009a,b ).MISCANFOR calculates the actual evapotranspiration (ET) a simulatedcrop would experience using a three-step process and available meteorologi-cal data. First, it considers evaporation of rainfall intercepted by the canopy,then leaf transpiration, which is in turn related to the leaf area index of thecanopy and the limitation of available soil moisture, and ﬁnally, evaporationfrom the soil through diffusion from soil pores ( Hastings et al., 2009a ). Thisprocess is more holistic than other approaches in that it considers the soilmoisture holding capacity of soils in addition to precipitation/irrigation andET, and has been used to estimate the likely growing range and productivityofM./C2giganteus in Europe ( Hastings et al. , 2009b ).90E. A. HEATON ET AL .3. Temperaturea. Seasonal growth. Typically, M./C2giganteus begins to grow from dor-mant rhizomes when soil temperatures reach 10–12 8C, while leaves beginexpanding after air temperatures average 5–10 8C(Clifton-Brown and Jones,1997; Farrell et al. , 2006; Lewandowski et al. , 2000 ). Though chilling tem-peratures (below 12 8C) frequently limit productivity of C 4crops ( Long,1999),M./C2giganteus has proved an exception to this trend by remainingproductive and with high quantum efﬁciencies of CO 2assimilation, even atcool temperatures in the ﬁeld ( Beale and Long, 1995; Beale et al. , 1996;Dohleman et al., 2009 ). When evaluating growth rates of different genotypesunder low temperature in a controlled environment, Clifton-Brown andJones (1997) found that M./C2giganteus was also able to expand leavesmore rapidly between 10 and 20 8C, allowing it to close canopy faster andyield more biomass, while Farrell et al. found genetic variation in tempera-ture thresholds for emergence that should allow some genotypes to begingrowing earlier in the season.b. Overwinter survival. One of the major limitations to the production ofM./C2giganteus in temperate climates is consistent overwinter survival,particularly in the establishment year ( Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski,2000a; Farrell et al. , 2006; Heaton et al. , 2004b; Lewandowski et al. ,2000, 2003b ). Currently, it is generally accepted that temperatures lessthan/C03.4 8C are lethal to M./C2giganteus , thus, this is the lower limitused to determine its potential distribution and productivity ( Hastingset al. , 2009a,b ).Although Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski (2000a) identiﬁed /C03.4 8Ca ssufﬁcient to kill rhizomes removed from the ﬁeld in an artiﬁcial freezing test,this temperature is not consistent with the observations in the US, whereestablished M./C2giganteus has regularly survived soil temperatures below/C068C at a 10-cm depth (E. Heaton, unpublished data). Little work has yetto be done on the importance of cold acclimation to overwinter survival inMiscanthus species, but it is likely to be as important as it is in othercool-season perennial grasses, where a distinction is made between coldacclimation and freezing tolerance (e.g. Hulke et al. , 2008; Stier et al. , 2003;Zhou and Zhao, 2004 ).4. Soil conditionsGenerally, M./C2giganteus performs well over a range of soil conditions whenwater is not limiting. Under water-limited conditions, it has performed bestwhen planted in clay soils and worse when planted in sandy soils, likely to dowith the higher water holding capacity of clay soils. Christian and HaaseMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 91(2001) report on Austrian trials aimed at testing the inﬂuence of soil type onthe yield and stem number of M./C2giganteus , where it was found that a goodsoil aggregate structure, as indicated by pore volume and size distribution,was more important than the soil type or pH. The authors concluded that themost suitable soils for M./C2giganteus have an intermediate texture thatallows good air movement, a high water holding capacity and high organicmatter content ( Christian and Haase, 2001 ). While they also assert thatshallow soils reduce potential productivity, Clifton-Brown et al. (2007)found that M./C2giganteus still produced 15–20 Mg ha/C01y/C01even whengrown on marginal soil that had an effective rooting depth of 40 cm. Over aperiod of 15 years, productivity declined at this site, but was attributed topotassium deﬁciency and thus considered manageable. Heavy, waterloggedsoils have also been shown to reduce plant height and delay achievement ofplateau yields from 2 to 5 years in M./C2giganteus (Christian and Haase, 2001 ).In Germany, M./C2giganteus was grown on two sandy soils, asilt-dominated soil and a clay-dominated soil. Above- and below-groundbiomass was highest at the site with the silt soil, and M./C2giganteus croppingwas found to inﬂuence the soil organic matter (SOM) composition at alllocations ( Kahle et al., 2001 ). Pre-harvest losses and harvest residues supplied2.2–5 Mg C per year to the soil and lead to an increase of 0.5–1.2 g kg/C01SOMper year, with higher contributions on the sandier soils. Further, it was foundthatM./C2giganteus disproportionately enriched lipids, sterols and fatty acidsin SOM that are less available for decomposition by soil microorganisms, thusincreasing the hydrophobic components of SOM that are important for soilaggregation and stability and improving soil quality ( Kahle et al., 2001 ).B. CROP MODELLING1. Productivity modellingThe potential of M./C2giganteus as a dedicated bioenergy crop, as evidencedfrom the extensive network of European ﬁeld trials (e.g. MPN), has beenextended throughout the rest of Europe using semi-mechanistic crop models(Clifton-Brown et al., 2000, 2004; Hastings et al., 2009a; Miguez et al., 2009;Price, 2004 ).Initially, Clifton-Brown et al. (2000) , using a simple model based onradiation use efﬁciency (RUE), simulated potential productivity of M./C2giganteus for Ireland with yields ranging from 16 Mg ha/C01in northernIreland to 26 Mg ha/C01in southern Ireland, where the total annual solarradiation and the length of the growing season are longer ( Clifton-Brownet al. , 2000, 2001b ). These predictions, however, were only based on radia-tion and temperature and ignored limitations due to water and nutrient92 E. A. HEATON ET AL .stress. Price (2004) , using a similar approach that included effects due to waterstress, estimated yields in the range 7–24 Mg ha/C01for England and Wales. Animportant consideration that can be explored using crop models is the year-to-year variability in yields, which Price (2004) estimated to be 10–25%. Thisvariability, which is typically poorly estimated from short-duration ﬁeldtrials, is a crucial component in planning for feedstock availability for abioreﬁnery.Incorporating site-speciﬁc information about soil water availability andimproving upon the previous version of the model, Clifton-Brown et al.(2004) showed that the water-limited potential for M./C2giganteus biomassproduction in Europe ranged from 17 Mg ha/C01in Sweden to 41 Mg ha/C01inPortugal. Under non-limiting conditions, the highest estimated peak yieldwas of 60 Mg ha/C01, which reﬂects the maximum potential of M./C2giganteus ,and it is close to the highest values measured in Italy and Greece (50 and54 Mg ha/C01, respectively). However, another important consideration inM./C2giganteus productivity is the inevitable reduction in harvestablebiomass between the peak biomass in the fall to that of late winter.Clifton-Brown et al. (2004) estimated this to be 0.36% loss per day and anaverage total of 33% by the late winter harvest.Simple models, such as MISCANMOD, are valuable for assessing thepotential of M./C2giganteus productivity outside the range where it hasbeen cultivated. However, there are limitations in its ability to extrapolateto other regions since the model strongly depends on a parameter thatdescribes the efﬁciency of the crop in converting radiation to biomass(RUE, g MJ/C01). Although in this model, RUE has been treated as aconstant, Clifton-Brown et al. (2000, 2004) reported that the value of ecforM./C2giganteus ranged from 2.4 to 4.2 g MJ/C01PAR in different environ-ments. These authors recognized that the model depends strongly on RUEand that a more mechanistic model would be more appropriate ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001b ). Empirical models are appealing due to simplicity, butby their design, they cannot provide insights into the physiological basis ofRUE variation, or growth and the physiology of water use.The model MISCANMOD has been further reﬁned and renamedMISCANFOR ( Hastings et al. , 2009a ), with improved descriptions of therelationship between potential and actual ET, which impacts calculation ofwater stress; variable RUE which depends on temperature, nutrient andwater stress; and additional modiﬁcations that reﬂect recent ﬁndings inM./C2giganteus physiology such as photoperiod sensitivity. Their resultssuggest that although M./C2giganteus can be highly productive in southernEurope, a 20% variability in biomass productivity should be expected due toyear-to-year ﬂuctuations in weather patterns ( Hastings et al. , 2009a ).MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 93To make more detailed predictions of M./C2giganteus physiology andgrowth, a different type of model with a higher degree of mechanism isneeded. WIMOVAC (Windows Intuitive Model of Vegetation response toAtmospheric and Climate Change) is a more suitable model as a guide tofuture experiments and breeding ( Humphries and Long, 1995 ). It was shownthat theoretically, M./C2giganteus can increase its productivity by 4 Mg ha/C01if the threshold temperature for growth could be lowered by 2 8C and degree-day requirements were increased so that ﬂowering occurred uniformly(Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001b ).Miguez et al. (2009) also showed that inaddition to peak productivity, WIMOVAC was able to accurately simulateplant CO 2uptake, leaf area index and biomass partitioning among leaf, stem,root and rhizome; this last part being limited by available data.Although results from models are useful for evaluating the biomass poten-tial of M./C2giganteus in different regions, it is also important for crop modelsto integrate new information on plant growth and physiology generated inrecent laboratory and ﬁeld experiments. In addition, crop models can be usedas an aid in breeding programmes if appropriate connections can be madebetween relevant traits that can be quickly phenotyped, included in cropmodels and evaluated for productivity ( Boote et al., 1996 ). Crop models arealso the only tool available to produce estimates of M./C2giganteus perfor-mance under future projected climate change scenarios or to evaluate theimpact of increasing the land use devoted to bioenergy crops on carbonsequestration and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ( Clifton-Brownet al. , 2007; Davis et al. , 2010; Tuck et al. , 2006 ).2. Modelling for crop improvementCrop models can also be used as a guide for breeding programmes or as ameans to envision a crop ideotype ( Boote et al. , 1996 ). While simulationmodels can be used to predict appropriate trait phenotypes and selectionprotocols in breeding programmes to achieve ideotypes ( Boote et al. , 1996 ),for a true integration of crop models and breeding, the inheritance of modelparameters is required ( Yinet al., 2003 ). One objective that can be pursued ina breeding programme is to optimize plant carbon allocation among plantcomponents (i.e. leaf, stem, rhizome and root), which requires at least (1)phenotypic and genotypic data, and (2) a crop model that can capture theimpact of different carbon allocation schemes on growth and biomassproduction.This approach can be used to study the effects of genotypes with differentbiomass partitioning schemes. However, there is clearly a balance betweenthe support and nutrient acquisition provided by rhizomes and roots and thebeneﬁt of partitioning more biomass to above-ground organs that can be94 E. A. HEATON ET AL .harvested. One factor that is likely to have a major impact on carbonallocation is the manipulation of ﬂowering time ( Sticklen, 2007 ). By reducingthe energy invested in reproductive structures, the proportion of biomassavailable for harvest can be increased ( Ragauskas et al., 2006 ) and optimizedto develop cultivars adapted to particular regions. For example, an improvedcarbon allocation scheme can result in reduced leaf area by increasing thenumber of stems and/or their thickness. In addition, maintaining leaf areaindex at optimum values ( Hay and Porter, 2006 ) also has the potential ofreducing crop transpiration and thus improve water use efﬁciency which canbe especially important for biomass production in dry environments(Richards et al., 2002 ). This reduction in leaf area index will be most beneﬁ-cial if it does not impact on the timing of canopy closure and maximum lightinterception.It should also be considered that ﬂowering is an important component intriggering senescence processes which, in perennial crops, initiate transloca-tion of nutrients and carbohydrates to below-ground storage ( Heaton et al.,2009). If delayed ﬂowering prevents this from happening, the nutrient useefﬁciency will decrease, impacting the sustainability of the cropping system,since synthetic fertilizers need to be added and the excess N in the exportedbiomass needs to removed or treated ( Beale and Long, 1997 ).III. PHYSIOLOGYAs reviewed in the previous section, M./C2giganteus has proved to be one ofthe most, if not the most, productive terrestrial plants in mid-latitude north-ern climates (35–60 8N). The ﬁrst replicated trials of this crop in the USshowed yields of 30–40 Mg ha/C01y/C01across three sites in Illinois ( Heatonet al., 2008a ). In central Illinois, where some of the highest yields of maize inthe world are recorded, M./C2giganteus yielded 60% more shoot biomass,even though the maize crop was heavily fertilized and no fertilizer added toM./C2giganteus during the comparison ( Dohleman and Long, 2009 ). In E.England at 52 8N, dry matter yield in similar replicated trials was 20 Mg ha/C01with a peak biomass of 30 Mg ha/C01. These are the highest annual dry matteryields for any crop in the UK ( Beale and Long, 1995, 1997 ). Taking accountof the large amount of root and rhizome simultaneously produced, theefﬁciency of conversion of visible sunlight energy intercepted by the leavesinto total biomass energy was 7.8%, again one of the highest conversionefﬁciencies recorded and equal to that obtained by the Amazonian grassEchinochola polystachya which holds the record annual dry matter yield forany terrestrial vegetation ( Beale and Long, 1995; Piedade et al. , 1991 ). ThisMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 95represents 65% of the theoretical maximum efﬁciency of C 4photosynthesis,that is, 12% of visible sunlight ( Zhuet al., 2008 ). The potentially higher waterand nitrogen use efﬁciencies associated with C 4photosynthesis are alsorealized ( Beale and Long, 1997; Beale et al. , 1999 ). This section analysesthe possible physiological basis of this exceptional productivity and resourceuse efﬁciency.A. PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR M./C2GIGANTEUS PRODUCTIVITYWhy is M./C2giganteus so high yielding? Crop yield is determined by theproduct of total incident solar radiation ( Qtot), the efﬁciency of radiationinterception ( Ei), the efﬁciency of conversion of intercepted radiation toabove-ground biomass ( Eca) and the efﬁciency of partitioning biomass toharvested material ( /C17; e.g. the grain in most crop plants). In biomass crops,all above-ground biomass is harvested, making /C17close to unity, therefore Eiand Ecaare crucial to the ﬁnal yield.Miscanthus /C2giganteus is an inter-speciﬁc hybrid, so one hypothesis wouldbe that its exceptional yield is a result of hybrid vigour. However, side-by-side trials in Europe have shown that cultivars of one of the parent species,M. sinensis , achieve similarly high yields ( Clifton-Brown et al., 2001a, 2004 ).A second factor is that its parent species, in their native habitat, are primarycolonizers ( Stewart et al., 2009 ). Many primary colonizers have proved to behighly productive; this may be a feature selected in evolution, since tocolonize sites where other plants have not previously grown, high productiv-ity may be crucial to gaining a foothold, as shown by the highly productivespecies E. polystachya (100 Mg ha/C01y/C01;Piedade et al., 1991 ) and Spartinaalterniﬂora (64 Mg ha/C01y/C01;Long and Mason, 1983 ). Thirdly, M./C2giganteus uses C 4photosynthesis, as apparently do all genera of the grasstribe Andropogoneae which includes Sorghum ,Zea,Saccharum andAndro-pogon (Kellogg, 1998 ).C4photosynthesis has an inherently higher efﬁciency of conversion ofsunlight energy into carbohydrate because it avoids photorespiration. Pho-torespiration occurs in other plants (C 3) because the primary carboxylase(Rubisco) catalyses both a carboxylation and an oxygenation reaction. Theoxygenation reaction catabolizes recently formed carbohydrate back to CO 2,and so imposes an average 30% yield penalty on C 3crops, a penalty thatincreases with temperature ( Long, 1991 ). C 4photosynthesis has evolvedindependently from the more ancient and ubiquitous C 3photosynthesis atleast 45 times ( Sage et al. , 1999 ). The elimination of photorespiration in C 4species does come at a cost. More energy is required for each CO 2assimi-lated, although it is less than the energy lost to photorespiration when96 E. A. HEATON ET AL .temperature exceeds 25 8C. In high light environments where photosynthesisis light-saturated, additional energy requirements are, by deﬁnition, irrele-vant. Because of the higher efﬁciency of carboxylation in C 4plants, intercel-lular CO 2concentration is lower and typically only about 60% of that in C 3leaves. As a result, a C 4leaf in the same environment as a C 3leaf will loseonly 60% of the water lost by a C 3leaf in assimilating a given amount of CO 2.Because of the advantages that C 4photosynthesis has under high tempera-ture, high light and low moisture conditions, it evolved mostly in low-latitudeand relatively arid regions ( Sage et al. , 1999 ). It has been hypothesized thatthe process of C 4photosynthesis is intrinsically limited to warm climates, andthat its efﬁciency of light use will be intrinsically less efﬁcient at low tem-peratures ( Sage and Kubien, 2007 ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus is proof that this is not the case. It is able to formand maintain leaves with high photosynthetic rates at temperatures about68C cooler than maize cultivars bred for cool temperate climates. Evencompared to other C 4plants native to cool climates, M./C2giganteus appearsexceptional ( Long, 1999 ). How does M./C2giganteus differ? Gene sequencesof Rubisco and the enzymes of the C 4dicarboxylate cycle show 99% homol-ogy with its very close relative sugarcane ( S. ofﬁcinarum ), and the few singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) give no clue of any changes that wouldmake these enzymes more cold-tolerant. This is supported by the observationthat there appear to be no differences in the temperature dependence ofthe kinetics of the recombinant enzymes from these two species in vitro(Wang et al. , 2008a,b ).Metabolic control analysis suggests that two enzymes limit the rateof photosynthesis in C 4plants: Rubisco and PPDK. When maize and M./C2giganteus are transferred from a growth temperature of 25 to 14 8C, photo-synthetic rates in both species decline over the ﬁrst 2 days, but in M./C2giganteus , it then recovers while continuing to decline without recovery inmaize. What underlies this difference? In maize, amounts of Rubisco andPPDK decline continuously, while in M./C2giganteus , the amount of Rubiscois unchanged and the amount of PPDK more than doubles. This correspondsto a large increase in the amount of mRNA coding for PPDK, suggesting anup-regulation of gene expression. In vitro , PPDK is cold-labile, dissociatinginto its monomers at 10–12 8C. Concentration of the enzyme in vitro , however,suppresses this dissociation, which might explain the ability of C 4photosyn-thesis to continue functioning at much lower temperatures in M./C2giganteus(Wang et al., 2008b ).C4plants are also strongly affected by photoinhibition at low tempera-tures. Decreased ability to use absorbed light energy in carbon metabolismleads to oxidative inhibition and damage to the photosynthetic apparatus.MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 97Even compared to the UK native C 4plant, Cyperus longus ,M./C2giganteushas a signiﬁcant advantage here. While the efﬁciency of use of electronsutilized in CO 2assimilation declines signiﬁcantly with decrease in tempera-ture from 25 to 17 8Ci n C. longus , this efﬁciency did not decline inM./C2giganteus until 10 8C(Farage et al. , 2006 ). How is this achieved?First, M./C2giganteus maintains high rates of photosynthetic carbon metab-olism down to 10 8C, allowing it to utilize more of the absorbed light energy.Secondly, the xanthophylls Zeaxanthin, which facilitates heat dissipation ofexcess absorbed light energy in the photosynthetic apparatus, increased some20-fold from 0.8 /C22mol m/C02inM./C2giganteus grown at 25 8C to 16.8 /C22mol m/C02when grown at 10 8C(Farage et al. , 2006 ).How do these biochemical advantages lead to increases in yield in the ﬁeld?In trials in the Corn Belt of the Midwestern US, M./C2giganteus has anannual Eithat is 60% higher than maize, the major factor accounting for itshigher productivity. This is due to the perenniality of M./C2giganteus and alsoits ability to produce photosynthetically viable leaves during the coolerperiods at the ends of the growing season within the temperate environment(Dohleman and Long, 2009 ). Estimates of canopy photosynthesis show thatM./C2giganteus is able to produce active leaves early in the spring, allowingfor a great deal of net canopy photosynthesis near the summer solstice, whenthe maximum amount of solar radiation is available. Furthermore, a greatdeal of CO2assimilation occurs in the autumn, after the maize crop hascompletely senesced ( Fig. 6 ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus is exceptionally productive when compared toother perennials as well, with the advantage compared to those species drivenby a greater Eca.Miscanthus /C2giganteus was able to produce a closed canopywithin one month and maintain it for 5 months even at the high latitude of528N, and also have a 60% higher Ecathan S. cynosuroides (Beale and Long,1995).Miscanthus /C2giganteus has been shown to have a substantially higherEcathan the regionally adapted perennial switchgrass. When integrated overtwo full growing seasons, the leaf-level photosynthesis of M./C2giganteus was33% higher than that of switchgrass ( Dohleman et al. , 2009 ). This increasedcarbon assimilation came at a price, however, as stomatal conductance wasalso 25% higher in M./C2giganteus and could explain why switchgrass tendsto remain more productive under dry conditions ( Heaton et al. , 2004a ).High productivity in cool environments is not simply a function of capaci-ty to maintain high leaf photosynthetic efﬁciency at low temperature, butalso the ability of the perennating organ, the rhizome, to survive sub-zerowinter temperatures. Established stands of M./C2giganteus and the parentspecies have survived for decades in botanical gardens where wintertemperatures can drop below /C025 8C. For example, the clone planted in98E. A. HEATON ET AL .the Illinois trials has survived without any evidence of winter loss in Urbanasince 1988 and Chicago Botanical Gardens since 1970. This includes survivalthrough the coldest winter temperature ever recorded in Chicago, /C033 8Ci nJanuary 1985 ( Heaton et al. , 2008a ). However, Miscanthus appears morevulnerable to low temperature during the ﬁrst year after planting.Artiﬁcial freezing tests with rhizomes removed from the ﬁeld showed thatthe lethal temperature at which 50% were killed (LT50) for M./C2giganteusandM. sacchariﬂorus genotypes was only /C03.4 8C(Clifton-Brown andLewandowski, 2000a ). This represents a high risk for losses after plantingof rhizomes or in the establishment of stands from seed. However, LT50 inone of the M. sinensis genotypes tested was /C06.5 8C, showing signiﬁcantpotential for selection of improved tolerance. Interestingly, among the geno-types, increased tolerance to freezing temperatures was not related to earli-ness in autumn shoot senescence or associated with size. This last point maybe critical, since while M./C2giganteus partitioned 35–40% of its biomass inrhizomes, the most cold-tolerant genotype partitioned only about 20% of itsbiomass into rhizomes ( Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000a ). This isJan012Daily canopy level CO2 assimilation(mol CO2 m−2 ground area day−1)34Estimates of canopy-level carbon assimilation forM. x giganteus and Z. maysFeb Mar Apr May Jun JulMonthAug Sep Oct Nov DecM.x giganteusZ.maysFig. 6.

While Z. mays is able to assimilate more carbon in themiddle portion of the growing season, the extended growing season allows for 60%greater biomass accumulation in M./C2giganteus (modiﬁed from Dohleman andLong, 2009 ).MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 99important, since if there is no over-wintering penalty for investing less inrhizomes, then it indicates the potential to select for lines which partition ahigher proportion of photosynthate into stems. This will have the doublebeneﬁt of accelerating shoot growth and harvestable biomass.The clone(s) of M./C2giganteus that have so far been examined in Europeand the US are thought to have been collected from Honshu island of Japan(Stewart et al. ,2 0 0 9 ). The parent species, M. sinensis andM. sacchariﬂorus ,range from the tropics to southern Siberia, so it is unlikely that results for thisclone represent the limits to cold temperature tolerance, and there should bebreeding resources available to improve the cold-tolerance of Miscanthusrhizomes.B. NUTRIENT CYCLING IN M./C2GIGANTEUSOne of the touted advantages of perennial grasses in general and M./C2giganteus in particular is the ability to internally cycle or remobilize nutrientsbetween above- and below-ground tissues. Himken et al. (1997) in GermanyandBeale and Long (1997) in England independently documented a seasonalpattern in biomass and nutrient accumulation in shoots and rhizomes ofM./C2giganteus , with rhizome biomass peaking after 80% of above-grounddry matter had accumulated in the late summer/early autumn, then stayingconstant or decreasing slightly over the winter. Rhizome biomass thendeclined dramatically during shoot emergence in the spring, presumably asmobile carbohydrates and nutrients were translocated to the activelygrowing shoot tissue.The concentrations of N and P in plant tissues generally mirrored theseasonal trends in biomass allocation, but K showed less ﬂuctuation inbelow-ground tissues, possibly because more of the monovalent anion lea-ched from senescing shoots before it could be remobilized to the rhizome(Beale and Long, 1997; Clifton-Brown et al. , 2007 ). Further, crop removalrates of K were higher and tissue and soil concentrations lower in long -termtrials of M./C2giganteus in England and Ireland ( Christian et al. , 2008;Clifton-Brown et al., 2007 ), suggesting that K is not translocated as efﬁcient-ly as N and P and thus K may limit growth before other macronutrients do.It is important to be aware that the addition of K fertilizer is frequentlyachieved through application of KCl fertilizer, leading to complementaryuptake of Cl ( Lewandowski and Kicherer, 1997; Lewandowski et al., 2003a )which leads to production of HCl during combustion of the feedstock. HClcan have negative environmental and economic consequences for energyproducers, leading to emission of the poison dioxin, as well as corrodingsteam boilers ( Lewandowski and Heinz, 2003 ). Mineral nutrients are100E. A. HEATON ET AL .undesirable in biomass feedstock because they can ultimately becomeatmospheric pollutants that must be mitigated irrespective of the type offuel that is produced.Crop senescence and harvest time can dramatically impact the amount ofnutrients removed from the ﬁeld with short-term impacts on fuel quality andlong-term impacts on environmental and economic sustainability. Green M./C2giganteus shoot tissue typically has N, P and K concentrations of about 20,2 and 20 mg g/C01, respectively ( Beale and Long, 1997; Heaton et al. , 2009;Himken et al., 1997 ). Concentrations are highest during shoot emergence andbecome diluted as biomass rapidly accumulates in the ﬁrst few months ofgrowth. By winter, the concentrations of N, P and K have dropped by anorder of magnitude, to 1–5 mg g/C01. Nutrient budgets have shown that theshoots obtain some of their nutrients from the soil, and not all of thenutrients are taken off by the harvested crop or put back in the rhizome,and therefore, some are lost back to the soil every year ( Beale and Long,1997), though the impact of nutrient movement among plant, soil anddetritus pools has not been thoroughly evaluated.The N demands of a high-yielding M./C2giganteus crop seem impossible tosatisfy without external fertilizer or serious depletion of soil reserves: Heatonet al. (2009) found that M./C2giganteus was capable of removing nearly300 kg ha/C01of N, despite only a single application of 25 kg ha/C01N duringthe preceding 3 years. What is the source of this N? Even in fertile soils withhigh mineralization rates, balancing the N budget in Illinois was only possi-ble when N ﬁxation was included in the analysis ( Davis et al. , 2010 ).N ﬁxation may be a plausible explanation given that nitrogenase activitywas found via acetylene reduction in rhizomes and in bacteria isolated fromthe rhizosphere.Agricultural producers are faced with a difﬁcult decision when it comes tochoosing the best time to harvest M./C2giganteus : harvest in the late summerwhen yields are highest, or wait until the ﬁrst frost and lose 30–50% ofbiomass to leaf drop and weather? Multiple studies have examined thisquestion ( Heaton et al. , 2009; Huisman et al. , 1997; Lewandowski andHeinz, 2003; Lewandowski et al. , 2003a ) and generally conclude that it isbetter to wait and harvest after nutrient concentrations have decreased thanto harvest feedstock of reduced quality and be forced to apply costly andgreenhouse gas-intensive fertilizer. Further, the biomass ‘lost’ due to leafdrop actually contributes to the SOM pool and could be valued in a carboncredit market. Because N is remobilized to the rhizome, the C:N ratio ofstanding biomass increases dramatically ( Heaton et al. , 2009 ), making theremaining litter recalcitrant to microbial decomposition ( Kahle et al. , 2001 )and contributing to soil organic carbon ( Kahle et al. , 2002 ).MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 101IV. BREEDING, GENOMICS AND GENETICSA. TAXONOMY AND ORIGINSThe tribe Andropogoneae within the family Poaceae includes several speciesof natural and agricultural value, including the C 4grasses sorghum(S. bicolor L. Moench), maize ( Zea mays L.) and sugarcane ( S. ofﬁcinarumL.). The subtribe Saccharinae includes the genera Saccharum L. andMiscanthus Anderss., species of which are currently under consideration aspotential biomass crops for renewable energy production ( Hodkinson et al.,2002a ). These two genera are closely related with evidence suggesting occa-sional inter-generic hybridization ( Sobral et al. , 1994 ). Morphologically,Miscanthus species differ from Saccharum by their tough inﬂorescence rachis,with both spikelets of a pair being pedicellate ( Hodkinson et al., 2002a ). Thetaxonomic status of the genus Miscanthus is in a state of ﬂux, with relativelylittle information available about identity and inter-relationships of its spe-cies. According to Clayton and Renvoize (1986) , the genus consists of ap-proximately 20 species, most of which are endemic to eastern or southeasternAsia (China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and south), with two species found in theHimalayas and four in sub-Saharan Africa.Of particular relevance to this review are the species of Miscanthusendemic to southeastern Asia touted as potential dedicated bioenergy cropsincluding Miscanthus ﬂoridulus ,Miscanthus lutarioriparium ,M. sacchariﬂorus ,M. sinensis and the triploid inter-speciﬁc hybrid M./C2giganteus . The basicchromosome number of these species is 19 ( Adati and Shiotani, 1962 ), withmost accessions being diploids, although some of the strongly rhizomatousspecies ( M. sacchariﬂorus andM. lutarioriparium ) include accessions that aretriploid or tetraploid ( Hirayoshi et al. , 1955; Hodkinson et al. ,2 0 0 1 ).Mis-canthus sinensis is endemic to East Asia ranging from New Guinea throughIndonesia, north through Southeast Asia into China, Taiwan, Japan, Koreaand Russia. The native distribution of M. sacchariﬂorus is limited to NorthernChina, Korea, Russia and Japan ( Hodkinson et al. ,2 0 0 2 c ). These species,particularly M. sinensis , have populations that have evolved to adapt to abroad range of environments and show substantial genetic diversity(Hodkinson et al.,2 0 0 2 a ). All of these species are perennial rhizomatous grasseswith obligate out-crossing due to self-incompatibility and with the possibleexception that M. ﬂoridulus can survive winters in temperate climates.DNA evidence suggests that M./C2giganteus (3n¼57) is an allotriploidhybrid generated from a rare natural cross between diploid M. sinensis(2n¼38) and a tetraploid M. sacchariﬂorus (4n¼76) ( Hirayoshi et al. ,1960; Lafferty and Lelley, 1994; Rayburn et al. , 2009 ) that occurred in102 E. A. HEATON ET AL .Japan and via clonal propagation transported in 1935 to Europe andlater to North America by commercial nurserymen ( Linde-Laursen, 1993 ).The University of Illinois clone was originally procured from the ChicagoBotanic Garden, which in turn acquired their specimen from Europe. Thisclone shares genetic identity with the widely propagated M./C2giganteusgenotype grown throughout Great Britain (J. Clifton-Brown, personal com-munication). Miscanthus /C2giganteus is a sterile allotriploid and so does notproduce viable seed, reducing its potential as an invasive species ( Hodkinsonet al. , 2002a ). Much of the evidence as to the putative parents of M./C2giganteus is based on morphological observations. Data obtained byHodkinson et al. (2002b) using variation in the internal transcribed spacer(ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) supported the hypothesisthatM. sinensis andM. sacchariﬂorus were the parents of M./C2giganteus andthat one species contributed two genomes while the other species contributedonly one. The study was unable to elucidate which species contributed twogenomes. Calculation of the nuclear genome size using ﬂow cytometry sug-gests that the M./C2giganteus accession at the University of Illinois comprisestwo genomes of M. sinensis and one of M. sacchariﬂorus (Rayburn et al. ,2009).B.MISCANTHUS SPECIES GENETIC IMPROVEMENT1. RationaleAllMiscanthus species are presently genetically unimproved so one wouldexpect that improvement in a number of key traits could be made usingbreeding and genetic engineering tools. The use of transformation technolo-gy is especially important in the case of M./C2giganteus , which is sterile, thusseed is not produced and crosses cannot be made to generate variability.There also appear to be very few independently derived lines, again indicat-ing little variation. Initial reports indicated that M./C2giganteus had few pestsand diseases, but more recent work has shown that indeed insects, nematodesand pathogens do attack the plants (see Section VI ). Thus, it is likely thatlarge plantings of genetically uniform unimproved clones will be subjected tothe usual pests and diseases that can affect most crops.2. Traits to improveOverall yield is one of the most important traits for biomass crops and this iscontrolled by many factors, including growth rate and duration, and envi-ronmental limitations such as water, heat, cold, nutrient, pests and disease.One would expect photosynthetic efﬁciency to be very important for yield,butMiscanthus species already have the C 4pathway and very efﬁcientMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 103photosynthesis ( Section III ). Populations of M. sacchariﬂorus endemic toEastern Asia are found as far north as the Amur River Valley in WesternRussia. Accessions from these species in Russia and Northern China haveadapted to severe winter conditions and represent sources of cold-tolerantgermplasm. If ﬂowering is prevented, the active growth period can beincreased, so delaying or preventing ﬂowering by decreasing expression ofthe indeterminate gametophyte gene might be useful ( Colasanti et al., 1998 ).The growth rate might also be increased by increasing gibberillin levels(Eriksson et al., 2000 ). There are also known genes that have shown promisefor alleviating many biotic and abiotic stresses that affect plant performance(Allen, 2010; Datta, 2002 ).Another trait that is most important to alter is composition of the cellwalls. The bulk of mature plant biomass represents secondary cell wallsconsisting mainly of a complex polysaccharide framework, several types ofhighly glycosylated proteins and complex polymers of phenylpropanoidunits, that is, lignin, the hydrophobic ﬁller that provides physical strengthto the cell wall. Various structural and chemical characteristics of plant cellwalls that act as the ﬁrst barrier between plant and environment have evolvedin order to resist external stresses from pathogen attack, wounding or me-chanical stimuli. These cell wall properties make it difﬁcult to disassemblebiomass when it is used for liquid biofuel production; however, high lignincan be advantageous for burning since it has a higher energy content thancarbohydrate.Miscanthus species, as all gramineous plants, have type II cell walls with ahigh content of arabinoxylans and 1,3:1,4- /C12-glucans (b-glucans) and a lowcontent of pectic polymers and xyloglucans, which predominate in the matrixof type I cell walls found in dicotyledons and other monocotyledons(Carpita, 1996 ). Another feature of gramineous cell walls is a high contentof hydroxycinnamic acids, such as ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, whichare ester-linked to structural polysaccharides such as different arabinoxylans(Smith and Hartley, 1983 ). Glucuronoarabinoxylan, arabinoxylans andother xylan-rich hemicelluloses are the dominant hemicelluloses in the cellwalls of different tissues of grasses, including their ligniﬁed supportingtissues. The amounts of lignin and cell wall-bound ferulic and diferulicacids as well as the composition of wall polysaccharides determine thegramineous plant cell wall rigidity, extensibility and digestibility ( Grabberet al. , 2004 ).Information on Miscanthus biomass composition is very limited at present,and the contents of main biomass constituents greatly vary in differentpublications. Thus, it was reported that dried biomass contains 18.30–104E. A. HEATON ET AL .20.99% lignin and 69.78–78.63% holocellulose in M. sacchariﬂorus (Visserand Pignatelli, 2001 ), 38% cellulose, 24% hemicellulose and 25% Klasonlignin in M./C2giganteus (de Vrije et al. , 2002 ) and 41.9% cellulose, 26.6%hemicellulose and only 13.3% lignin determined as acid lignin ﬁbre inM. ogiformis (analogous species to M./C2giganteus )(Magid et al. , 2004 ).The reported different estimates of lignin concentrations could result fromthe application of various analytical procedures which do not give consistentresults. We tested the biomass characteristics of several Miscanthus acces-sions from the germplasm collection grown on the University of Illinoisexperimental farm that were harvested at the end of the growing seasonapplying the acetyl bromide method which was recommended for the predic-tion of biomass digestibility based on lignin levels ( Fukushima and Hatﬁeld,2004). The results showed large variations across genotypes selected in majorcell wall constituents which can have an inﬂuence on biomass biodegradabil-ity, with about 26% lignin, 40% cellulose and 20% xylan being typical(Fig. 7 ). There was a negative correlation between the lignin and ether-bound phenolic contents and sugar released by both enzymatic hydrolysisalone and that after acid pre-treatment ( Fig. 8 ; A.V. Lygin, unpublisheddata) when sacchariﬁcation of selected plant biomass and composition wascarried out, as described by Chen and Dixon (2007) .For biochemical conversion to fuel, cost-effective pre-treatment (mechan-ical, physical, chemical or most promising enzymatic) of biomass is usuallyrequired. Pre-treatment can modify or remove unwanted by-products,such as lignin, to reduce cellulose crystallinity, and increase the porosity,thus improving hydrolysis ( McMillan, 1994 ). As a consequence of thesepre-treatments, cellulose is made accessible for hydrolysis to glucose andfermentation to alcohols. Using genetic engineering for the expression ofglycosyl hydrolases that cleave only side chains in branched polysaccharideswill give the possibility for ﬁne modiﬁcation of these polysaccharides, with-out complete breakdown, that can increase polysaccharide accessibility toenzymatic treatment during biomass conversion. Transgenic expression ofglycosyl hydrolases with a well-characterized speciﬁcity provides a directapproach for post-synthetic modiﬁcation of speciﬁc polymeric constituentsin plant cell walls ( Sticklen, 2007 ). On account of rapid advancements inthe characterization of microbial hydrolases, the currently available numberof these enzymes is sufﬁcient to deconstruct cell wall polysaccharidescompletely.Thus, generating transgenic plants with decreased cross-linking levels incell walls and less lignin should result in higher efﬁciency of biochemicalbiomass conversion to fuel, while genotypes with high lignin would be idealfor burning.MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 10560ABC50403020100Mxg AlegroCell wall (CW) componentsAdagio GracilliusnanaGrossefontaine% of CW202530354045Mxg AlegroEnzymatic saccharification w/o pretreatmentAdagio GracilliusnanaGrossefontaineSugar released, mg/100mg CW2030405060Mxg AlegroEnzymatic saccharification with acid pretreatmentAdagio GracilliusnanaGrossefontaineSugar released, mg/100mg CWLigninCelluloseXylanFig. 7.

Introductions of Miscanthus accessions into Europe and NorthAmerica from Southeast Asia were made in the late nineteenth and through-out the twentieth century. Until recently Kew Gardens in England had one ofthe most extensive collections. These collections represent much of the cur-rently available germplasm for Miscanthus crop improvement. Increasedinterest and use of ornamental grasses in urban landscapes in the 1970s and1980s lead to the propagation and commercial sale of Miscanthus accessions(primarily M. sinensis ) by nurseries in Europe and North America.

This leads to the creation of the EU’s MPN and theEMI programmes described earlier and ultimately to the formation of Tin-plant Biotechnik und Pﬂanzenvermehrung GmbH in 1992, a commercialcompany partially dedicated to Miscanthus breeding in Germany. For 15years, Tinplant conducted hybridizations and selection for improved acces-sions of M. sinensis ,M. sacchariﬂorus andM./C2giganteus for sale to theornamental nursery industry and for enhanced biomass. Tinplant was ac-quired in 2007 by Mendel Biotechnology, Inc. of California, who has ex-panded the Miscanthus breeding programme. In addition, in 2004, theUnited Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsinitiated support for a Miscanthus breeding programme in Aberystwyth,Wales where they have acquired the Kew Garden collections and somematerials from Tinplant and Southeast Asia ( Clifton-Brown et al. , 2008 ).Miscanthus breeding efforts have recently been initiated at several otherinstitutions, including the University of Illinois’ Energy Biosciences Institute.Current efforts by both private and public programmes are focused on thecollection of Miscanthus genetic resources primarily from countries inSoutheast Asia. Collection of germplasm from foreign countries requirescompliance with the Convention on Biological Diversity ( United NationsEnvironment Programme, 1993 ), which gives sovereignty to each countryover its genetic resources and requires arrangement of formal partnershipsbefore collection and export of germplasm to another country. Anotherfactor that inﬂuences collection involves compliance with issues of plantquarantine where Miscanthus germplasm (seeds or propagules) mustbe tested and inspected by a government-approved plant pathologist beforerelease.The collection and use of diverse germplasm is a crucial factorinMiscanthus crop improvement programmes. While signiﬁcant geneticvariability has been found among the parental species ( M. sinensis andM. sacchariﬂorus )(Jorgensen and Muhs, 2001 ), the few (3 or 4) existingtriploid M./C2giganteus accessions generated from inter-speciﬁc hybridiza-tion display very low levels ( Greef et al. , 1997; Hodkinson et al. , 2002a ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus displays remarkable heterosis for vegetative growthwhen compared to its putative parental species, although in competitiveEuropean trials, some accessions of M. sinensis produced up to 70% of thebiomass of M./C2giganteus (Clifton-Brown et al. , 2001a ). Breeding effortswith M./C2giganteus are hindered by difﬁculties in re-synthesizing new108E. A. HEATON ET AL .accessions of triploid M./C2giganteus due to incompatibility between theparents and the sterility associated with the triploid genome.The requirement of labour-intensive and costly vegetative propagation forpotential commercial production of triploid M./C2giganteus germplasmfavours the development of improved vegetative propagation techniquesthat result in higher multiplication rates and hardy propagules. The inher-ently high cost of vegetative propagation, however, also favours the develop-ment of Miscanthus genotypes that are fertile and bear seeds to facilitateplanting and production. The recent creation of hexaploid M./C2giganteusplants ( Yuet al., 2009 ) presents potential opportunities for the developmentof fertile germplasm and new breeding opportunities by conducting hybridi-zations between hexaploids or between hexaploids and diploid M. sinensisand M. sacchariﬂorus accessions that could generate viable seed. Earlyemphasis in public and private breeding programmes is on creationand selection within diploid M. sinensis ,M. sacchariﬂorus and hybridM. sinensis /C2M. sacchariﬂorus populations. These populations will be usedto generate linkage maps for diploid M. sinensis andM. sacchariﬂorus andfor associating the genome with beneﬁcial phenotypic traits. DNA marker-saturated linkage maps of the Miscanthus genome will allow for associationmapping and marker-assisted breeding. It must be cautioned that thoughseeded Miscanthus is highly favourable from an economic perspective, athorough investigation about the invasive potential of fertile Miscanthus iscritical prior to mass plantation of these species.D. GENOMICSOne aim of the current Feedstocks Genomics Programme within the EnergyBiosciences Institute at the University of Illinois is to generate resources thatwill enable genomics-directed improvement of Miscanthus germplasm. Thegenome of M./C2giganteus is very large, estimated to be /C247.0 Gbp by ﬂowcytometry ( Rayburn et al. , 2009 ). Using new generation genomic tools, 1 /C2skim sequencing of M./C2giganteus DNA revealed that much of the genomeconsists of major repeated sequences with only 2% or about 165 Mbp as‘genespace’, and the recently sequenced S. bicolor is a useful referencegenome ( Swaminathan et al. , 2010 ). Deep sequencing of the M. sinensis ,M. sacchariﬂorus andM./C2giganteus transcriptome found that contigsmatched /C2429,000 of the estimated 36,000 Sorghum genes.This sequence information will be used to generate SNPs, single sequencerepeats (SSRs) and PCR-based markers that will be made available to thepublic for linkage studies, association mapping and marker-assisted breed-ing. We are in the process of identifying the most informative SNPs acrossMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 109the transcriptome of these species to generate a Goldengate SNP array toapply to M. sinensis andM. sinensis /C2M. sacchariﬂorus hybrid segregatingpopulations. This will provide genetic linkage maps for these species and beused to identify QTL and genes associated with desired phenotypes. TheseSNP arrays will be made available to the public, while the transcript andgenomic sequences the programme generates will be available to onlinebrowsers by 2011.E. MICROPROPAGATION, GENETIC ENGINEERING ANDCHROMOSOME DOUBLING1. MicropropagationMethods have been developed using several tissues of the M./C2giganteusplant, most efﬁciently immature inﬂorescences, to initiate cultures that thencan be multiplied and regenerated into whole plants ( Holmes and Petersen,1996; Kim et al., 2010 ). These methods can be used for micropropagation forlarge-scale planting and also would be important for genetic transformation,since the genes are, in most cases, inserted into cultured cells.2. Genetic engineeringWhile breeding may be able to manipulate a number of traits for Miscanthusspecies, there is very little presently known about what traits are available inthe germplasm, and breeding systems are just being developed. Because M./C2giganteus is sterile and breeding cannot be readily accomplished, being ableto directly insert genes appears to have some real importance.Most plant transformation utilizes tissue culture, and methods have beenpublished for culture initiation, maintenance and plant regeneration as statedearlier ( Holmes and Petersen, 1996; Kim et al. , 2010 ). Usually, the gene ofinterest and selectable marker gene are inserted into cells by particlebombardment or A grobacterium tumefaciens co-cultivation. The trans-formed cells are selected using a selective agent that kills untransformedcells, but not those expressing the selectable marker gene, such as antibioticresistance. Plants are then regenerated.To date, the only published report of Miscanthus transformation is withM. sinensis using tissue cultures initiated from immature spiklets orgerminating seeds and A. tumefaciens (Engler and Chen, 2009 ). Selectionwas carried out using the antibiotic G-418 with the nptII selectable markergene and plants were generated from the selected callus.110 E. A. HEATON ET AL .3. Chromosome doublingIt is possible that doubling the chromosome number of the sterile triploidM./C2giganteus could generate fertile hexaploids that could enable seedproduction and breeding. Since the cell size would also increase, it is possiblethat biomass production could increase and the cell wall composition change.We have applied methods that were used to double the chromosome numberin maize callus ( Wan et al. , 1991 ) to regenerable M./C2giganteus callus anddid produce chromosome-doubled plants ( Yuet al. , 2009 ). Preliminaryresults indicate that the pollen is more viable, as shown by triphenyltetrazo-lium chloride staining, than that produced by the triploid (W.B. Chae,unpublished data). No seed was produced, but there may be a problem ofself-incompatibility as seen with Miscanthus species.V. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSCompared to annually cultivated crops, perennial grasses are often consid-ered environmentally favourable because the more dense and continuousvegetative cover provides protection to the soil against erosion, may reducerunoff and nutrient loss and sequester carbon in the soil ( Blanco-Canqui,2010). Because perennials begin growth earlier in the year than annuals,perennial grasses are thought to be more synchronous with soil nutrientavailability (mineralization) and plant uptake throughout the growingseason, which may limit nutrient losses. The degree to which these beneﬁtsare realized in practice depends on the speciﬁc management practicesemployed, in addition to past management and the environmental context.Reduced runoff may be beneﬁcial in settings where erosion or downstreamﬂooding is problematic. However, in some settings, runoff and drainage fromagricultural cropland are important sources of water for human communitiesand aquatic ecosystems. In these situations, reduced runoff or drainage maybe considered detrimental, especially during droughts. Thus, understandingand assessing the environmental impacts of M./C2giganteus require someattention to speciﬁc management practices and the likely impacts inthe various places it will be grown. Unfortunately, there has been relativelylittle research on the environmental impacts of M./C2giganteus to date acrossthe range of environmental conditions where it might be grown. Severalbiofuel crops have been reviewed for possible impacts on water use andnutrient loss ( Powlson et al., 2005 ), but more recent studies are now availableonM./C2giganteus.MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 111A. WATERAlthough M./C2giganteus is considered an efﬁcient crop in terms of water useper unit of biomass produced ( Beale et al. , 1999 ), its high productivity maylead to high water use compared to other crops. Empirical evidence from theUS and Germany ( Boelcke et al. , 1998 ) is consistent with this view, but asimulation study of the southern UK ( Finch et al., 2004 ) suggested less wateruse from M./C2giganteus than from the existing land cover, which was largelya mixture of annual crops and perennial grasses.At two locations in Germany, Boelcke et al. (1998) measured soil moisturein mature (4–6 years old) stands of M./C2giganteus for a 4-year period. Theyconcluded that soil moisture supply was limiting the biomass yield.They used soil moisture data to calibrate the model LEACHW, and usedthe model to estimate ET and drainage. The model simulations indicated thatM./C2giganteus provided signiﬁcantly less groundwater recharge comparedto a rotation of winter rye-phacelia-potato.Finch et al. (2004) used a mechanistic model to predict long-term changesin ET resulting from increased plantings of M./C2giganteus , switchgrass andshort rotation willow coppice in the UK. Their modelling predicted thatM./C2giganteus and switchgrass would reduce ET by approximately50 mm y/C01compared to the existing mixture of cereal crops (e.g. wheat)and C 3grasses, largely because the existing vegetation had a lower tempera-ture threshold for photosynthesis which results in a longer growing season.Model parameterization was partly based on measured characteristics ofthe plants. The cultivar of switchgrass and the age of the stands werenot mentioned, but they measured greater leaf area index in switchgrassthan M./C2giganteus , which is opposite of the results reported by Heatonet al. (2008a) who compared M./C2giganteus to Cave-in-Rock switchgrass.Finch et al. (2004) also reported that soil moisture under M./C2giganteustended to be lower than soil moisture under switchgrass during the laterstages of the growing season. The soil moisture comparison was made at twosites over 2 years using replicate plots, but no statistical analysis of thedifferences was presented. The soil moisture measurements were used tocalibrate the model they used to predict the hydrologic impact of the grasses.Finch et al. (2004) acknowledged a need for more data collection on energygrasses to conﬁrm their results. Richter et al. (2008) reafﬁrmed this need formore data collection to verify the results of Finch et al. (2004) .Richter et al. (2008) presented an analysis of existing biomass yields ofM./C2giganteus in the UK, and concluded that soil water availabilityappeared to be the single most important factor in limiting biomass yield.Finch and Riche (2008) reported that the depth of soil water depletion under112E. A. HEATON ET AL .M./C2giganteus (1.7 m) was greater than under most crops grown in the UK,even though they estimated that stomatal conductance was lower than mostcrops. Finch and Riche (2010) also reported that approximately 20% of theprecipitation falling on M./C2giganteus from September till harvest wasevaporated from the leaves and stem. This quantity of interception in thefall during winter is more typical of a forest than an agricultural crop, andmay partly explain the greater depletion of soil moisture.In the US, McIsaac et al. (in press) measured soil moisture to a depth of90 cm under M./C2giganteus , switchgrass (Cave-In-Rock cultivar) and amaize–soybean rotation (the predominant land use in the region) over fourgrowing seasons (2005–2008) in central Illinois. At the end of the growingseason, soil moisture under M./C2giganteus was statistically less thanunder either switchgrass or maize–soybean. Based on simple water budgetcalculations, they estimated that the ET of M./C2giganteus was on average104 mm y/C01greater than maize–soybean and 140 mm y/C01greater thanswitchgrass ( McIsaac et al. , in press ). An increase of 104 mm y/C01in ETcould reduce surface water ﬂows by 32% in the central Illinois region.Both switchgrass and the M./C2giganteus were harvested in winter andneither received N fertilizer in this experiment. Cave-In-Rock is not the mostproductive variety of switchgrass. Higher yielding varieties of switchgrass,treated with appropriate quantities of N fertilizer, would likely be moreproductive and consequently may use more water than reported in thisstudy ( Kiniry et al., 2008; Vogel, 2004 ).Hickman et al. (2010) used a micrometeorological residual energy budgetmethod to estimate ET from M./C2giganteus , switchgrass and maize in onegrowing season (2007). According to their estimates, ET from switchgrassand maize was similar (764 mm) over the 166-day growing season, whilewater use by M./C2giganteus was about 190 mm greater. This study wasconducted in a subset of the plots used by McIsaac et al. (in press) , whoestimated M/C2giganteus used 109 mm more water than maize and 69 mmmore than switchgrass during this growing season. Although both studiesindicate substantially greater ET from M./C2giganteus compared to the othertwo crops, differences in magnitude may reﬂect limitations of the measure-ment approaches used, as well as somewhat different time periods ofobservation during the growing season. If the results of Hickman et al.(2010) are more accurate and representative, the impact of M./C2giganteuscould reduce surface water ﬂows in the region by 58%.In a modelling study of the Raccoon River watershed in Iowa, US,Schilling et al. (2008) estimated that converting corn–soybeans to perennialgrasses would increase ET by 47 or 58 mm y/C01, depending on whether warm-season or cool-season grasses were planted, and this would reduce annualMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 113water yields (annual stream ﬂow per ha) by 46 and 54 mm y/C01, respectively.Compared to a baseline water yield of 193 mm y/C01, these values representreductions in water yield of 24% and 28%, respectively. Modelling of warm-season grasses was based on characteristics of switchgrass, while cool-seasongrasses were modelled on the basis of fescue. M./C2giganteus was notmodelled because of lack of information about its physiological character-istics ( Schilling et al., 2008 ). Given the higher productivity of M./C2giganteusand the greater soil moisture depletion, as demonstrated by McIsaac et al.(in press) , it seems reasonable to expect that conversion to M./C2giganteuscould lead to greater reductions in water yield in Iowa than modelled bySchilling et al. (2008) .B. NITRATE LEACHINGChristian (1994) and Christian and Riche (1998) reported that nitrate leach-ing losses from plots of M./C2giganteus grown in silty clay loam soil atRothamstead Farm in the UK. Fertilizer treatments were 0, 60 and120 kg N ha/C01y/C01applied in the spring. They measured soil water nitrateconcentrations in water extracted using porous ceramic cups and estimatedleaching from the drainage measured from separate soil monoliths during thedormant season. During the establishment year, they reported 154, 187 and228 kg N ha/C01leached, respectively, from the 0, 60 and 120 kg N ha/C01fertilizer treatments ( Christian, 1994; Christian and Riche, 1998 ). These highvalues were partly attributed to the prior cropping system, and to precipita-tion being 200 mm above average. In the second and third years of theexperiment, precipitation was 37 mm above and 37 mm below normal,respectively, and the average nitrate leached in those 2 years was 5.5, 17.5and 58.5 kg N ha/C01y/C01.Christian and Riche (1998) reported that there wereno biomass yield differences among the N fertilizer treatments. Thus, underoptimal N management in that setting (0 N fertilizer), nitrate leachingappears to be relatively low. Christian and Riche (1998) used porous cuplysimeters to obtain soil solution nitrate concentrations and then estimatedleaching ﬂux by combining these concentration data with a separate mea-surement of drainage ﬂux. Tension lysimeter data may not always reﬂectdrainage water concentration, which adds uncertainty to the overall ﬂuxestimate; see Fares et al. (2009) for review.Curley et al . (2009) also used suction lysimeters to monitor nitrateconcentrations in the soil under second and third year M./C2giganteus inIreland that had been treated with cattle manure slurry with N rates of 0, 60and 120 kg N ha/C01y/C01. In the ﬁrst year of their observations, they reportedan increase in soil water nitrate with increasing N application rate, although114 E. A. HEATON ET AL .mean concentrations were relatively low, ranging from 3.1 to 4.5 mg N l/C01.During the second year of observations, concentrations were lower than inthe ﬁrst year and there was no statistical difference among the three originaltreatments. However, a fourth treatment was added (180 kg N ha/C01) and themean concentration in this treatment was statistically greater than the others(4.8 mg N l/C01)(Curley et al., 2009 ).Curley et al. (2009) did not report onactual leaching losses or whether biomass yields were inﬂuenced by thedifferent N treatments, nor did they indicate the portion of the manure Nthat was in an inorganic form when applied. If the quantity of drainage waterwas not affected by the treatments, then the quantity of nitrate leached wouldbe proportional to the soil water nitrate concentrations.C. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH NEEDSEmpirical evidence from the central US, Germany and the UK indicates thatET from M./C2giganteus is greater than from typical annual crops and thushas the potential to reduce surface water ﬂows and groundwater rechargewhere it replaces these annual crops on a large scale. A simulation study ofthe southern UK suggests that large-scale plantings of M./C2giganteus mayresult in a reduction of ET (and thus more groundwater recharge and surfaceﬂows) if it were to replace C 3grasses and annual crops. More work needs tobe done to quantify water use of M./C2giganteus under a wide variety ofconditions in order to establish relationships that will be useful for modellingthe impacts in areas where production appears most economically feasible. Itwould also be useful to monitor the hydrology of small watersheds withsubstantial M./C2giganteus plantings, to verify the scaling up of modelsbased on plot and ﬁeld observations.Where M./C2giganteus can be grown with little or no N fertilizer, nitrateleaching losses will likely be low compared to crops such as maize that have ahigh N requirement. However, because M. /C2giganteus is slow to establish,large losses of nitrate to leaching are possible during the establishment year,although the quantity will likely depend on weather and prior land use. Moreresearch is needed to quantify the N leaching and N 2O emissions for a varietyof N fertilizer rates and timings in settings where M./C2giganteus responds toN fertilizer application. Additionally, the possibility of using cover crops inthe establishment year to minimize N losses without inhibiting M./C2giganteusestablishment deserves investigation ( Fig. 9 ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus is also likely to sequester carbon, alterwildlife habitats and have other environmental consequences. AlthoughM./C2giganteus provides an economic advantage by producing high biomassper unit area and per unit of water transpired, the environmental costs andMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 115beneﬁts of large-scale plantings will depend on local conditions and thefraction of the landscape planted to M./C2giganteus . The relative costs andbeneﬁts of reduced surface water ﬂows or nitrate leaching, or other effects willvary in different contexts. Landowners, policy makers and citizens needreliable and locally relevant information about these impacts in order tomake informed decisions about land management and policy alternatives.Since these consequences may occur over decades, mechanistic models basedon empirical research are needed to provide reasonable projections of theimpacts in a wide range of settings.VI. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO COMMERCIALPRODUCTIONEven though European researchers have studied M./C2giganteus as a biomassfeedstock since the early 1980s, and Illinois researchers have studied its usesince the early 2000s, barriers remain to the commercial production ofthe grass. Given that the biomass potential of M./C2giganteus is great forCorn (2006) Corn (2008)Corn/Soybean (2009)Switchgrass (2006) Switchgrass (2007) Switchgrass (2008) Switchgrass (2009) Miscanthus (2007) Miscanthus (2008) Miscanthus (2009)Soybean (2007)01020Nitrogen leaching (kg N ha−1 yr−1)3040NitrateAmmonium 5060Fig. 9.

Adapted from McIsaac et al. (in press).116 E. A. HEATON ET AL .some temperate areas in North America, it is important that these hurdles beovercome in a timely fashion in order to avoid being unprepared should anenergy crisis occur. These challenges occur in the grass’ propagation andestablishment, agronomy, pest and pest controls, and genetics.A. PROPAGATION, RHIZOME STORAGE AND ESTABLISHMENT1. PropagationBecause it is sterile, asexual propagation, such as rhizome divisions ormicropropagation, must be used to multiply M./C2giganteus into commercialquantities. Overall, propagating this grass is a relatively simple horticulturalexercise; conversely, propagating large commercial quantities is less so.Propagating M./C2giganteus using rhizome divisions entails separating arhizome mass into small pieces for replanting. This can be done with pottedplants growing in greenhouses and can also be conducted using ﬁeld-grownplants. University of Illinois experience has determined that the potted M./C2giganteus can often be divided every 4–8 weeks ( Pyter et al., 2009 ) whengrown in greenhouses under 12 h per day artiﬁcial light during winter using10 cm square pots and an artiﬁcial, soil-less potting mix.Small rhizome segments can also be used to produce plantlets or plugs bydividing rhizomes into very small, two-to-three node segments, potting thesegments and growing these rhizome segments into small plants. Thistechnique is being used commercially with success to produce large numbersof plants using relatively small amounts of rhizomes. This is a likely methodfor planting commercial acreages where irrigation or reliable naturalprecipitation is available to ensure that the small plants will becomeestablished ( Fig. 10 ).Miscanthus /C2giganteus rhizomes can also be ﬁeld-planted, grown intoestablished plants and harvested after one or two growing seasons. Mechan-ical rhizome lifters are available (e.g. Tomax, Ltd., Waterford, Ireland)which can be used to improve harvest efﬁciency and yields. By observation,most of the mechanically harvested rhizomes pieces are 10–25 g. Pyter et al.(in press) found that 20–25 g rhizome pieces produced statistically similarend-of-season biomass as rhizomes pieces of 40 g. Pyter et al. (2009) reportedhand-harvested yields of 7–10 rhizome pieces from 1-year clumps and 25–30rhizome pieces from 2-year clumps. Mechanical harvesting likely yieldsgreater numbers of the smaller rhizome pieces. In 2010, a mechanicallyharvested 0.4 ha ﬁeld of 1-year plants yielded enough rhizomes to replantapproximately 3.6 ha, representing a ninefold multiplication factor(Pyter et al. , in press ).MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 117Micropropagated M./C2giganteus plants are commercially available inthe US, but are expensive. In addition, in Denmark and Clifton-Brownet al. (2007) in Ireland found that rhizome-produced M./C2giganteus plantssurvived the ﬁrst winter, while plants directly regenerated using micropropa-gation died the ﬁrst winter after planting ( Clifton-Brown, 1997 ).2. Rhizome storageCurrently, research is being conducted in Illinois in an attempt to identify thephysiological condition of rhizomes necessary for survival. In one Illinoisstudy, Pyter et al. (in press) found that rhizomes can be successfully stored at48C for up to 4 months in moist sand. In an ongoing 2010 study, rhizomeshave been shown to require a moisture content of at least 50% to regrow afterplanting. When improperly stored, rhizomes can dry below this level and notsurvive planting. Additional work is being conducted to measure carbohy-drate levels within rhizomes harvested at different times of the year toidentify conditions that can limit establishment success.3. Planting and establishmentMechanical nursery or vegetable transplanters have been successfully used toplant M./C2giganteus rhizomes and plugs. Rhizomes planted to 10 cm pro-duced the greatest amount of biomass at the end of the ﬁrst season’s growthA BFig. 10. (A) Greenhouse grown ‘‘plug’’ of M./C2giganteus . (B) Field dug M./C2giganteus rhizome. Photo credits N. Boersma and E. Heaton, respectively.118 E. A. HEATON ET AL .in Illinois ( Pyter et al., in press ). Planting densities have varied, with success-ful plantings occurring at densities of 10,000–12,000 ha/C01(Pyter et al., 2009 ).As small rhizome segments and plugs are used, planting densities mayincrease to 20,000–25,000 ha/C01to reduce gaps in plantings due to lowrhizome emergence rates. Emergence rates have ranged from as low as 50%to 98% depending on rhizome size and storage conditions ( Huisman andKortleve, 1994 ) in Europe. Pyter et al. (2009) reported 60–70% of the rhi-zomes sprouting in an Illinois planting.Plugs comprising small plants, growing in a small amount of horticulturalpotting mix can be produced using micropropagated plantlets, rhizomepieces or rooted stem cuttings and can be an outstanding substitute forplanting rhizomes ( Atkinson, 2009 ). The main limitation to planting plugsis the probable need for irrigation during establishment. Plugs can be wellestablished and relatively drought-tolerant in less than a growing season, butduring the establishment period, a prolonged period of droughty weather cancompromise plug survival without the availability of water to supplementnatural precipitation.While established M./C2giganteus have survived winter air temperatures aslow as /C0208C in Illinois ( Pyter et al., 2009 ), there have been situations whereﬁrst year M./C2giganteus crops have been damaged or killed during the ﬁrstwinter after planting. Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski (2000a) and Clifton-Brown et al. (2001a) reported that M./C2giganteus , especially ﬁrst year plant-ings, is at risk when soil temperatures at 5 cm drop below /C038C. During the2008–2009 winter, 2008 plantings in portions of the US Midwest were severelydamaged; 6.5 ha in Illinois were thinned during that winter to the degree thatthe replanting was necessary. Concerns over ﬁrst year winter damage canobviously limit where M./C2giganteus can be commercially produced.In December 2009, in a Decatur, Illinois, US demonstration planting, dailysoil temperatures at a 5-cm depth were as much as 4 8C colder under ﬁrst yearplants than under third year plants. A small, little-developed rhizome mass,along with virtually no insulating leaf litter on the soil surface may combineto explain the susceptibility of winter damage in ﬁrst year plants. Also,Lewandowski (1998) speculated that M./C2giganteus is more tolerant ofcold when the temperature decline is slow and steady, rather than sudden.She also indicated that cold damage may occur when temperatures varyabove and below freezing, writing that M./C2giganteus may sprout duringwarm stretches, only to be damaged when temperatures drop, because it issusceptible to cold damage ( Lewandowski, 1998 ). These hypotheses requirefurther study for conﬁrmation.Commercial barriers caused by a lack of propagation and planting infor-mation or by inconsistent research ﬁndings require that additional work beMISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 119completed prior to successful large-scale planting. Research that identiﬁesefﬁcient methods and equipment designed for low-cost propagation andplanting with guaranteed establishment are necessary prior to commercialacceptance of M./C2giganteus as a biomass feedstock.B. AGRONOMY1. FertilityIt is not clear whether fertilizer applications will increase the harvestableyields of M./C2giganteus (Heaton et al. , 2010; Miguez et al. , 2008 ). Experi-ments in Europe have shown contrasting responses of M./C2giganteus to Nfertilizer. For example, in Austria, Schwarz et al. (1994) reported an increaseof only 1 Mg ha/C01in dry biomass (from 20.6 to 21.6 Mg ha/C01)w i t ha nincrease in N level from 0 to 180 kg N ha/C01in a 3-year-old crop. However,the authors hypothesize that because the soil had a high capacity for nutrientdelivery, the lack of N response can be attributed, at least in this case, to thecombined effect of optimal initial nutrient supply and the fact that only thesecond and third growing seasons were reported ( Schwarz et al. , 1994 ).Similarly, in Germany, Himken et al. (1997) did not observe a signiﬁcant Nfertilization effect on above-ground or rhizome dry biomass, possibly be-cause the soil supplied the N needed for the yield levels at this location.Moreover, this study measured above-ground biomass as well as below-ground biomass and showed that the rhizome biomass can exceed15 Mg ha/C01for a crop that achieved a peak dry biomass of 30 Mg ha/C01inSeptember ( Himken et al., 1997 ). Finally, at Rothamsted Research Farm, inEngland, biomass yields from a 14-year planting of M./C2giganteus did notrespond to N application ( Christian et al., 2008 ). The authors wrote that thiswas likely the result of the soil type at the research site, the management ofthe previous crop produced on the research site and the efﬁcient resourceutilization of the C 4grass including the natural recycling of N and otherminerals within the plant.Conversely, increasing levels of nitrogen increased yields in an Italian study(Ercoli et al. , 1999 ). These authors found an interaction between irrigationand N fertilization. With 100 kg N ha/C01of fertilizer, irrigation increased drybiomass by 3.7 Mg ha/C01, and with 200 kg N ha/C01, irrigation increased drybiomass by 9.8 Mg ha/C01. Other minerals may play a role in M./C2giganteusbiomass yields. In a 15-year M./C2giganteus study in Ireland, Clifton-Brownet al. (2007) showed an increased yield with nitrogen in some years, but not inothers. This study also showed a yield increase with an application of K,indicating the need to study fertilization regimes beyond nitrogen.120 E. A. HEATON ET AL .Given the inconsistent results of these studies, a simplistic explanation ofM./C2giganteus response to fertilizer remains difﬁcult. It is likely that theresponse of M./C2giganteus to fertilization is due to the interactions ofweather conditions, soil type and agronomic management. Thus, yieldresponse to fertilization may change from ﬁeld to ﬁeld or even change withinthe same ﬁeld from year to year. Moreover, predicting an exact response ofM./C2giganteus to fertilization is also difﬁcult, making it problematical foragronomists to make accurate fertilization recommendations whenmanaging M./C2giganteus.2. Weeds, insects and diseases in M./C2giganteusa. Weed control. Weed control during the ﬁrst year, and sometimes thesecond year, is necessary to produce a successful M./C2giganteus crop(Christian and Haase, 2001; Lewandowski et al. , 1995, 2000 ). Severalresearchers have evaluated post-planting tillage and cover crops as weedcontrols with varying success ( Buhler et al. , 1998; Bullard et al. , 1995;Schwarz et al. , 1994; Venturi et al. , 1999 ). More consistent weed control,however, is likely to be accomplished through the use of herbicides.Unfortunately, the herbicides registered for M./C2giganteus are limited toapplications to landscape ornamentals.Both pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides have been used inEurope; researchers generally found that herbicides that are safe for applica-tion to corn can be safely applied to M./C2giganteus (Bullard et al. , 1995 ;Seraﬁn and Ammon 1995, as cited in Lewandowski et al., 2000 ).Buhler et al.(1998) reported that metolachlor appeared to be safe on various warm-seasonperennial grasses, and Huisman et al. (1997) recommended applications ofatrazine to control weeds. In Illinois experiments that applied herbicides attypical corn rates, Pyter et al. (2009) reported that M./C2giganteus was tolerantof pre-emergence applications of pendimethalin, pendimethalin þatrazine,S-metolachlor and S-metolachlor þatrazine, and post-emergence applica-tions of 2,4- Dester and dicamba. More recently, Anderson et al. (in press)found in ﬁeld studies that herbicides, in general, that are applied to controlweeds in maize were safe to apply to M./C2giganteus and included atrazine,pendimethalin and S-metolachlor applied as pre-emergence herbicides, andbromoxynil, dicamba and mesotrione þatrazine applied as post-emergenceherbicides.b. Insect and disease control. Huggett et al. (1999) found that the corn leafaphid ( Rhopalosiphum maidis ) survived, was highly fecund and able totransmit barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) which is a concern becauseMiscanthus spp. can carry the virus with or without showing symptoms.MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 121In the US, Bradshaw et al. (2010) also reported corn leaf aphid and yellowsugarcane aphid ( Sipha ﬂava) on ﬁeld-grown M./C2giganteus in four states.Christian et al. (1997) observed larvae of the common rustic moth ( Mesapa-mea secalis ) feeding on M./C2giganteus tissues in the spring, but harvestablestem density did not appear to be affected. In Illinois, Spencer and Raghu(2009) reported M./C2giganteus to be a site of oviposition and emergence ofthe Western Corn Rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ), a major pest ofmaize. Finally, Prasifka et al. (2009) noted that fall armyworm ( Spodopterafrugiperda ) infested ﬁeld plots of M./C2giganteus and fed on its leaves inlaboratory studies.While Christian and Haase (2001) report that no diseases greatly affectM./C2giganteus production, several pathogens have been found on the grass.Fusarium spp. (Thinggaard 1997, as cited in Lewandowski et al. , 2000 ),BYDV ( Bullard et al. , 1995; Christian et al. , 1994 )a n d Miscanthus blight(Leptosphaeria spp.) ( O’Neill and Farr, 1996 ) can affect M./C2giganteus .A tseveral Midwestern US sites, nematodes, including two species of X iphinemaand one species of Longidorus (Longidorus breviannulatus ), were found insoils surrounding M./C2giganteus roots ( Mekete et al. , 2009 ). They alsoreported that great numbers of L. breviannulatus appeared to destroy ﬁbrousroots and stunt lateral roots ( Mekete et al. , 2009 ).Ahonsi et al. (2010)reported occurrences of the leaf blight, Pithomyces chartarum , in Kentucky.3. Harvesting technologyAt the conclusion of the growing season, M./C2giganteus usually drops mostof its leaves as it senesces, and the senesced stems are typically harvestedduring the winter, from November through the end of March in temperateareas, depending on snow cover and access to ﬁelds. US companies areevaluating different equipment for cutting, conditioning, windrowing andbaling the stems to determine efﬁcient and effective methods. Traditional hayequipment works, but it is a slow process given the toughness and largenumber of harvestable stems. The harvest goal is to cut at 5–10 cm, but inpast evaluations, some ill-suited equipment left M./C2giganteus stems of morethan 30 cm. Leaving biomass in the ﬁeld unharvested is a concern thatequipment manufacturers must consider; more than 2 t ha/C01of biomassremained in an Illinois ﬁeld following a 2010 harvest.Baling machines have successfully produced variously sized round andrectangular bales of M./C2giganteus in the past. Moisture levels of thebiomass tend to vary with harvest time. Heaton (2006) reports moisturelevels from 50% in an October harvest down to less than 10% in a Februaryharvest. Under cover, the stored bales have remained intact and in good122 E. A. HEATON ET AL .condition for at least 3 years without excessive breakdown or attractingrodent or insect pests.Existing technology allows M./C2giganteus to be cut, baled and stored forlater use. At present, however, the challenges to commercial production arethe inefﬁciencies of equipment designed for hay and straw crops, not forheavier-stemmed biomass crops. It is very likely that technology thatcombines woody plant harvest with hay and straw crop harvest will besuitable for biomass crops.4. Eradicating M./C2GiganteusEradicating M./C2giganteus in order to convert a planting to another biomassfeedstock or to a row crop has also been studied. Anderson (2010) found thattillage combined with glyphosate applications can control mature M./C2giganteus , but treatments will likely need to be repeated in a second growingseason for complete eradication. In another experiment, Anderson et al.(2010) examined planting glyphosate-resistant soybeans directly into a ma-ture stand of M./C2giganteus and found that soybean yield was not reducedwhen either one or two sequential glyphosate applications were made in-cropcompared with a weed-free control. The following year, this ﬁeld was rotatedinto glyphosate-resistant corn, and corn yields were similar to the weed-freecontrol following one or two sequential applications of glyphosate. Whileglyphosate applications kept the M./C2giganteus from reducing yields,Anderson (2010) speculated that it will likely take more than two growingseasons to completely eradicate the biomass grass.Overcoming agronomic challenges are paramount to successful commer-cial production of M./C2giganteus . Some of this research will be, by necessity,local and continuous, given the probability of local responses to fertility andpest problems, along with the evolution of pests and Miscanthus genetics.Improved harvesting technologies, however, are likely to be useful through-out the entire geographic area where M./C2giganteus is commercially grown .C. NEW VARIETIESTheM./C2giganteus clone used in University of Illinois feedstock researchoriginated from rhizomes obtained from the Chicago Botanic Gardens(Glencoe, Illinois) in 1988 ( Pyter et al. , 2009 ) and has been part of a land-scape demonstration planting at the University since that time. In addition tothis common landscape clone, there are other M./C2giganteus types beingdeveloped and marketed speciﬁcally for biomass production. For example,‘Freedom’ Giant Miscanthus was developed at Mississippi State Universityand is being produced for commercial planting by SunBelt Biofuels ( http://MISCANTHUS: A PROMISING BIOMASS CROP 123www.extension.org/p ages/‘‘Freedom’’_Giant_Mi scanthus_is_Viable_Biofuel_Feedstock ;http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id¼3536). New Energy Farms of Canada ( http://www.newenergyfarms.net/pricing.aspx ) lists ‘Amuri’ and ‘Nagara’ as very cold-tolerant, high-yieldingMiscanthus . Biotechnology ﬁrms such as Ceres, Inc. and Mendel BioenergySeeds are evaluating additional forms of Miscanthus to determine biomasspotential.Additional M./C2giganteus genotypes present growers with options whenproducing this crop that will allow for selection from a pallet of grasses fordifferent locations and environments in order to produce the most produc-tive and least input-dependent grass for an area. Moreover, it is likely thatadditional genotypes will be developed in the future, which offers additionalopportunities to ﬁne-tune planting choices such as disease and/or insectresistance. The barrier to commercial production of these new genotypes isthe need to conduct research so that agronomists can direct growers to makethe best choices for a biomass production scheme.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was primarily supported by the Illinois Council on Food andAgriculture Research (Award 04-SRI-036).
