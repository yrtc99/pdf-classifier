SarmahBiochar application in soil has been proposed as a promising method for carbon sequestration. While factors af-fecting its carbon sequestration potential have been widely investigated, the number of studies on the effect ofsoil pH is limited. To investigate the carbon sequestration potential of biochar across a series of soil pH levels,the total carbon emission, CO 2release from inorganic carbon, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of six soilswith various pH levels were compared after the addition of straw biochar produced at different pyrolysis temper-atures. The results show that the acidic soils released more CO 2(1.5 –3.5 times higher than the control) after theapplication of biochar compared with neutral and alkaline soils. The degradation of both native soil organic car-bon (SOC) and biochar were accelerated. More inorganic CO2release in acidic soil contributed to the increaseddegradation of biochar. Higher proportion of gram-positive bacteria in acidic soil (25% –36%) was responsiblefor the enhanced biochar degradation and simultaneously co-metabolism of SOC. In addition, lower substratelimitation for bacteria, indicated by higher C-O stretching after the biochar application in the acidic soil, alsocaused more CO2release. In addition to the soil pH, other factors such as clay contents and experimental durationalso affected the phsico-chemical and biotic processes of SOC dynamics. Gram-negative/gram-positive bacteriaratio was found to be negatively related to priming effects, and suggested to serve as an indicator for priming ef-fect. In general, the carbon sequestration potential of rice-straw biochar in soil reduced along with the decrease ofsoil pH especially in a short-term. Given wide spread of acidic soils in China, carbon sequestration potential of bio-char may be overestimated without taking into account the impact of soil pH.© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

China, where the topsoilsoil organic carbon (SOC) density is generally lower than the global av-erage ( Batjes, 2014; Song et al., 2005 ), is expected to have a higher soilcarbon sequestration potential. The carbon sequestration potential ofbiochar is related to the properties of biochar and soil (e.g., pH, SOC,and clay content). Naturally acidic soil covers approximately 27% ofthe total cultivated land of China ( Wilson et al., 2004 ) and 30% of theworld's ice free land area ( Vonuexkull and Mutert, 1995 ). Topsoil evensuffers from signi ﬁcant acidi ﬁcation by a pH decline of 0.13 –0.80 dueto long-term overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and intensive acid deposi-tion in China ( Guo et al., 2010 ). Therefore, estimating the carbon se-questration potential of biochar across pH especially in acidic soils isessential for possible large-scale application of biochar.Biochar's climate-mitigation potential primarily stems from its high-ly recalcitrant nature towards chemical and microbial oxidation(Keiluweit et al., 2010 ). The decomposition rate of biochar varies signif-icantly with experimental durations, feedstocks, pyrolysis tempera-tures, soil pH and clay contents ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Biocharsproduced at lower temperatures were reported to mineralize fasterthan those produced at higher temperature with increased aromaticityand degree of aromatic condensation ( Fang et al., 2014; Zimmerman,2010 ). Previous studies also indicated that more carbonates wereformed in higher pyrolysis temperatures. In addition, biochars, whichwere made from crop residues such as tomato and corn, tend to havehigher ash contents and carbonates ( Murray et al., 2015; Yuan et al.,2011 ). Once biochar is applied into soil, acid-base neutralization willreact and tend to be more intensive for acidic soil. In contrast, neutralor alkaline soil adsorbs CO2from the atmosphere and leads to anunder-estimation of the CO 2evolution from soil ( Blagodatskaya andKuzyakov, 2008 ). Despite higher CO 2emission from carbonates in acidicsoils, the abiotic process may be easily obscured by microbial minerali-zation ( Bruun et al., 2014 ). More biochar C mineralized in the high pHsoil was observed than in the low pH soil, largely due to the higher mi-crobial biomass ( Fang et al., 2014; Keith et al., 2011 ) and smaller ex-tractable Al and Mn concentrations ( Luo et al., 2011 ). Therefore,determining physico-chemical and biotic processes on biochar degrada-tion across pH needs more research effort.Generally, change in the mineralization rates of soil organic carbon(SOC) induced by additional substrates is termed as priming effect(Zimmerman et al., 2011 ). Both positive and negative priming effects,i.e., accelerating and retardation of SOC mineralization, respectively(Kuzyakov et al., 2000 ), caused by biochar have been observed ( Basset al., 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2011 ). After addition of biochar, variouspolar compounds (included lactic acid, acetic acid) contained in dis-solved biochar, micronutrients and habitats favoring microbial hetero-trophic activity ( Castaldi et al., 2011; El-Naggar et al., 2015; Fernandezet al., 2014 ) through biochar amendments may result in the co-metabolism and positive priming of SOC ( Mukherjee et al., 2014 ). Be-sides, soil-derived DOC sorption and encapsulation by biochar forma-tion of organo-mineral fractions and protection from predation inporous structure ( Fang et al., 2014; Joseph et al., 2010; Li et al., 2014;Lin et al., 2012 ) would cause suppression of native SOC decomposition(Lu et al., 2014 ). In recent years, meta-analyses have indicated thatCO2ﬂuxes with biochar amendment were negatively related to the bio-char application rate, pyrolysis temperatures, and C/N ratio of the bio-chars ( Liu et al., 2016 ). Biochar characterized by a low C contentinduced a higher positive priming effect (PE) on native soil organic car-bon ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Besides, duration of the incubation would alsoaffect the PE, as biochar might induce a negative PE by promoting phys-ical protection mechanisms, and C saturation of microbial communitiesin a long-term ( Hernandez-Soriano et al., 2016; Maestrini et al., 2015 ).In acidic soils, the water holding capacity, nutrients, pH, and EC metsigniﬁcant increases after biochar addition ( Molnar et al., 2016 ). As thestabilization of SOC can be affected by soil pH, the preferential substrateutilization and priming effect would change after biochar application.Research indicated complexation of SOC on mineral surfaces via ligandexchange increases with decreasing pH ( Gu et al., 1994 ). Due to the de-crease in adsorption sites on the oxide surfaces, the adsorption of SOCdecreased with the increase of pH ( von Lutzow et al., 2006 ). By groupingthe soils presented in the recent literatures into acid, moderately acid,neutral, and alkaline soils, increased soil microbial biomass carbon andsigniﬁcant positive priming effects were observed for acid soils ( Liu etal., 2016 ). On the contrary, biochar amendments to neutral or alkalinesoils caused inhibition of soil C mineralization with increased soil pH(Liu et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, the biochar-induced change of substratelimitation, performed as DOC concentration and bioavailability, and si-multaneous priming effects ( Streit et al., 2014 ) across soil pH are stillnot available.Changes of physicochemical properties and substrate utilization bybiochar would therefore greatly affect the soil microbial communities.Bacterial PLFAs would considerably increase with rising pH ( Hogberget al., 2007 ), whereas fungi showed parabola trend with the highest bio-mass across pH of 6 –7(Pietri and Brookes, 2009; Rousk et al., 2009 ). De-creases ratio of fungi/bacteria (F/B) and gram-negative/gram-positivebacteria (G−/G+) suggested a microbial community shift in favor ofgram-positive bacteria in acidic forest soil ( Mitchell et al., 2015 ). In con-trast, increased G−/G+ratio were observed in neutral and alkaline soils(Ameloot et al., 2014; Gomez et al., 2014 ). In recent years, in light of thebarcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, biochar-induced shift for bacteria occurred at the genus and phylum levels, forfungi at the genus level ( Hu et al., 2014 ). Relative abundance of bacteriawithin the phyla Actinobacteria ,Gemmatimonadetes and Flavobacteriumin biochar-treated soils was identi ﬁed (Jenkins et al., 2016; Khodadad etal., 2011; Kolton et al., 2011 ). In contrast, an overall loss of microbial di-versity in all soils treated with oak and grass-derived biochar have alsobeen detected ( Khodadad et al., 2011 ), such as the abundance ofMethylophilaceae and of Hydrogenophilaceae (Chen et al., 2013 ). Yet,soil microbial community composition related to soil properties andthe relationship between greenhouse gas emissions is still ambiguousand need to be further explored.Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of soil pH on thecarbon sequestration potential of biochar. The biochar degradationand SOC mineralization in six typical soils were studied to reveal the ef-fects of pH on the following processes: (1) the contribution of CO 2re-lease from inorganic carbonates to the total CO 2emission; (2) the roleof soil microbial community composition in the dynamic of SOC miner-alization; and (3) the change in surface functional groups of soil and theconsequent substrate limitation to SOC mineralization. In this study, thetotal CO 2emission, δ13C analysis, and related CO 2release from inorganiccarbon were investigated. Microbial community changes of soils afterbiochar application were revealed by phospholipid-derived fatty acids(PLFA) analysis. Change of soil carbon structure and dissolved organiccarbon concentration were analyzed by the Fourier Transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR) and total organic carbon analyzer. The results ofthis study are expected to calibrate the carbon sequestration potentialof biochar in acidic soil on a regional or global scale.2. Materials and methods2.1. Soils and biocharSix typical soils were collected from farmlands. Soil S1 was collectedfrom Shangrao, Jiangxi province (29.2°N, 117.8°E), soil S2 was collectedfrom Hangzhou, Zhejiang province (30.2°N, 120.1°E), soil S3 was col-lected from Huangshan, Anhui province (29.6°N, 117.7°E), soil S4 wascollected from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province (30.3°N, 120.2°E), soil S5was collected from Harbin, Heilongjiang province (45.7°N, 126.6°E),and soil S6 was collected from Chongqing, Sichuan province (30.3°N,105.9°E). Soil samples were hand-picked to remove obvious plant de-bris and roots, air-dried, sieved through a 2 mm sieve, and analyzed130 Y. Sheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 572 (2016) 129 –137for basic properties including pH, carbon content, and particle size. Forseparating C mineralization sources, soils S1, S2, S4, and S5 were culti-vated with typical C4 plant (corn) for years.Rice straw was selected as the biochar feedstock given its abundancein China. It was ground, passed through a 0.154 mm sieve, and then wasoven-dried overnight at 70 °C. The powder was compacted in a quartzboat and pyrolyzed for 2 h at various temperatures (300 °C, 500 °C,and 700 °C, annotated as 300BC, 500BC, and 700BC, respectively) inthe tube furnace which was ﬁlled with N2and programmed at a heatingrate of 5 °C min−1. The produced biochar was then sieved to b0.154 mmfor subsequent analysis.The WHC was determined using a method adapted from Case et al.(2012) . 150 g dried soil or soil-biochar mixture (2% w/w) was addedto plastic cylinders (inner diameter 5 cm, height 7 cm), with the bottomend covered in a ﬁne mesh. Each cylinder was submerged in a watertank for 8 h. The cylinders were covered with plastic ﬁlm to limit evap-oration. The samples were then removed, permitting drainage by grav-ity for 3 h, weighed after three hours, heated to 105 °C for 12 h and re-weighed. The WHC of soil and soil-biochar mixture are shown in TableS1. Dissolved organic matter (DOC) was extracted from the mixture ofbiochar and soil with distilled water (1:1 w/v) for 30 min. The mixturewas then centrifuged with a rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 15 min andthe supernatant was collected and ﬁltrated through a 0.2 mm mem-brane. DOC content was measured with a Shimadzu TOC-V CPHanalyzer.Compositional changes of surface functional groups in control and bio-char-amended soils were observed by Fourier Transform infrared spec-troscopy (FTIR, Thermo scienti ﬁc, Nicolet 6700). Chemical and physicalproperties of the soils are shown in Table 1 . Other properties of biochara r es h o w ni nT a b l eS 1 .2.2. Incubation experimentIn this experiment 24 treatments were set with ﬁve replicates,consisting of 6 controls with soils only and 18 treatments with permu-tations of 6 soils and 3 kinds of biochar. For controls, 5 g soil was incu-bated in 40 ml sample vials. For the 18 treatments, 5 g soil and100 mg biochar were thoroughly mixed in 40 ml sample vials. As in-creased moisture content reduces oxygen availability to soilmicroorganisms,the change of water holding capacity would directly af-fect the generation of CO2(Baronti et al., 2014; Case et al., 2012; Zong etal., 2016 ). To ensure the same soil moisture and aeration for biochar-treated soils, deionized water of 80% soil or soil-biochar mixture waterholding capacity was added to the vials, which were sealed and incubat-ed in the dark at 25 °C. Three empty vials were set to measure the con-centration of CO 2of surrounding atmosphere.To determine the CO 2release, 100 μl gas samples were withdrawnfrom the vials and measured with a gas-tight glass syringe (Agilent)through injecting the headspace CO 2into the gas chromatograph(Fuli 9790). Flame Ionization Detector (FID) was used to detect CO 2at250 °C. Porapak Q column was used to separate CO 2with a column tem-perature of 80 °C. Limits of detection (LOD) of CO 2measurement was2 ppm, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were lower than 5%.After the measurement, the vials caps were kept open for 20 min,leaving the vials re ﬁlled with the atmosphere air for re-incubation.The incubation experiments was carried over a period of 100 days,and CO 2evolution was measured periodically at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 30,40, 50, 60, 70, 85, 100 days of incubation. For treatments of soils S1,S2, S4, and S5, another 100 μl samples from the vials were carried outsimultaneously for δ13C analysis to determine the carbon mineralizationsource.2.3. CO 2release from mineralization of organic carbon and inorganiccarbonatesIn this experiment 24 treatments were set with three replicates,consisting of 6 controls with soils only and 18 treatments with permu-tations of 6 soils and 3 biochars. For the controls, 5 g soil was incubatedin 40 ml sample vials. For the treatments, 5 g soil and 100 mg biocharwere thoroughly mixed in 40 ml sample vials. These treatments wereheat-treated at 160 °C for 2 h. Deionized water of 80% water holding ca-pacity with excessive concentration of NaN 3or HgCl 2in a mass ratio of0.5% was added to maintain the sterile state. For soils S1, S2, and S3(pHb7.0), HgCl 2was added to sterilize. For the other soils (pH N7.0),NaN 3was used to sterilize. The headspace CO 2was measured as cumu-lative CO 2release by using the method described in Section 2.3 .The CO 2release from mineralization of organic carbon was calculat-ed by subtracting abiotic from the total CO 2emission. The effect of bio-char application on the total CO 2emission and CO 2release frommineralization of organic carbon was calculated as: ( CT−CS)/CS× 100%, where CTis the total C mineralized from the biochar-amended soil, CSis the amount of CO 2-C evolved from the control soil.The effect was calculated as percentage (%) of non-biochar treatment.Furthermore, CO 2release from inorganic carbon/total CO 2emission(IC/TC) ratio was used to calculate the contribution of abiotic processfor soils.2.4. Carbon mineralization source and priming effects100 μl gas samples were withdrawn from the incubated soils andsoil-biochar mixture vials to the sample bridge for δ13C analysis usingPrecon-IRMS (Delta V Thermo Finnigan). The amount of biochar miner-alized ( CB) from biochar-amended soil was calculated as:CB¼CTδT13CO2−δS13CO2/C16/C17δB13CO2−δS13CO2/C16/C17 ð1Þwhere CTis the total C mineralized from the biochar-amended soil,δT13CO2is the δT13C value of the CO 2-C evolved from the biochar-amendedsoils, δS13CO2is the δT13C value of CO 2-C evolved from the control soil, andδS13CO2is the initial δT13C value of the biochar. The amount of the soil-Cmineralized ( CS,B) from the biochar-amended soil and the priming ef-fects (PE) induced by the biochar on mineralization of the native organiccarbon in the soils were calculated as:CS;B¼CT−CB ð2ÞPE¼CS;B−CS ð3Þwhere CSis the amount of CO 2-C evolved from the control soil, CTis thetotal C mineralized from the biochar-amended soil, CBis the amount of Cmineralized from biochar. The positive priming effect means accelerat-ing of SOC mineralization by biochar. In contrast, negative priming effectmeans the suppression of SOC mineralization by biochar.Cumulative biochar degradation was calculated. Furthermore, toeliminate the impact of soil SOC content on biochar degradation, themineralization rate of biochar as per unit native SOC were used todescribe the degradation of biochar in different soils.Table 1Selected soil properties.Soil pH SOCa(mg/g)SICb(mg/g)WHCc(%)Sand(%)Silt(%)Clay(%)Soil typeS1 4.34 2.15 0.0120 35.3 19.2 23.6 57.2 FerralsolsS2 5.19 12.7 0.0361 41.8 18.5 21.1 60.4 FerralsolsS3 5.88 26.2 0.0739 37.5 59.7 29.3 11.0 AnthrosolsS4 7.74 12.3 0.127 32.3 68.1 22.6 9.3 LuvisolsS5 7.81 35.7 2.32 40.5 25.2 47.1 27.7 PhaeozemsS6 7.91 14.4 1.37 41.2 36.2 40.2 23.6 CambisolsaSOC: Soil organic carbon.bSIC: Soil inorganic carbon.cWHC: Water holding capacity.131 Y. Sheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 572 (2016) 129 –1372.5. Phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) analysisThe PLFA analysis was used as a rapid and sensitive method to detectthe change in the soil microbial community. The main microbial taxa,including bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes were indicated by speci ﬁcPLFA biomarkers. Soil PLFA extraction and puri ﬁcation was performedaccording to a previous study ( He et al., 2013 ). The fatty acids were ex-tracted from 3 g freeze-dried soil samples by the extraction mixturecontaining phosphate buffer, chloroform and methanol after 100 days'incubation. The lipid extractions were then puri ﬁed by a solid phase ex-traction column (500 mg; 3 ml; Agilent Technologies Inc., UK). The neu-tral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids were eluted with chloroform,acetone and methanol, respectively, after being dried with N 2. PLFAswere subsequently derivatized through mild alkaline methanolysis re-action. The following PLFA analyses were performed by using theAgilent 6890 N gas chromatograph (Agilent, Wilmington, DE) ﬁttedwith a MIDI Sherlock microbial identi ﬁcation system (Version 4.5,MIDI, Newark, NJ).The PLFAs used as markers of each of the speci ﬁc groups were de-scribed in Table S3. The microbial community composition was alsoassessed by the ratios of gram-negative bacteria/gram-positive bacteria(G−/G+) and fungal/bacterial (F/B), thus to better analyze the microbialcommunity change and dominated population.2.6. Statistical analysesStatistical evaluation of the data sets was performed on SPSS version20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Signi ﬁcant differences between treat-ments at different times of incubation were tested using the one-wayanalysis of variance (ANOVA). The principle component analysis (PCA)was performed to evaluate the difference in microbial communitychange of soil PLFAs. The statistically signi ﬁcant level was set to 0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Effect of soil pH on the CO 2release from carbonates and mineralizationof organic carbonBiochar signi ﬁcantly increased the total CO 2emission in acidic soils(pb0.05). In contrast, the total CO 2emission was suppressed for the500BC and 700BC treatments in neural and alkaline soils ( Fig. 1 a).300BC-amended soils released much more CO 2than 500BC and700BC-amended soils ( Fig. 1 a, Fig. S1). Since lower-temperature-pyro-lyzed biochar have higher amount of aliphatic and volatile components(Zimmerman, 2010 ), more labile fraction would be oxidized duringincubation.The CO 2release from the carbonates of biochar was responsible forthe short-term increase of the observed CO 2emission in acidic soils. Anegative relationship between the IC/TC and the soil pH values was ob-served ( Fig. 1 b). All biochar-amended soils showed higher IC/TC ratioscompared to the control in the acidic soils (with the highest IC/TCratio 61.5%, 32.5%, and 11.9% for S1, S2, and S3, respectively at earlystage of the incubation). In addition, the highest mineralization rate ofbiochar appeared on the ﬁrst day for soils S1 and S2, following anorder of 700BC N500BC N300BC. Moreover, the mineralization of700BC on the ﬁrst day in soils S1 and S2 were almost the same, occupy-ing 65% and 59% of the total CO 2emission. The transient peak of degra-dation rate from biochar in soils S1 and S2 on the ﬁrst day with 500BCand 700BC followed by a sharp decline indicated that a faster abiotic re-lease of carbonates from biochar with lower pH (Fig. S2). The effect ofabiotic release of carbonates in biochar for acid soils only occurs sharplyin the early stage of incubation, based on the content of carbonates inbiochar. Although more carbonates in the biochar generated at highertemperature, CO 2release from inorganic carbon was observed to behigher in 500BC than 700BC in acidic soils, mainly due to the highersoil pH induced by 700BC.Higher-temperature-pyrolyzed biochar-amended neutral or alka-line soils adsorbed much more CO 2from the atmosphere. In S4-S6(pHN7.0), the highest IC/TC ratio was observed in 300BC-amendedsoil, CO 2release from inorganic carbon signi ﬁcantly decreasedfor 500BC and 700BC treatments ( pb0.05). Since H 2CO3wasthe unique form that dissociated immediately into CO 2and H 2Oa tpHb4. When the pH was higher, the equilibrium between CO 2and car-bonates promoted the formation of carbonates ( Maestrini et al., 2015 ),thus to adsorb more CO 2from the atmosphere and might lead to anunder-estimation of the CO 2evolution ( Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov,2008 ).In general, the promotion or suppression of abiotic CO 2release was ashort-term effect and determined by the amount of carbonates of bio-char, where pH took effect through interaction between biochar andsoil.Murray et al. (2015) compared the stability of low- and high-ashbiochars, and found more CO 2released from Ferralsol (acidic soil) intheﬁrst day after applying tomato-biochar and blue-mallee-biochar.The results suggested a higher abiotic release and less stable structureof low-ash tomato-biochar in acidic soils ( Murray et al., 2015 ). In thisstudy, biochar was made rice straw and had a relative lower ash contentand less stable carbon structure, which tended to promote more CO 2than biochar made from other feedstocks. The IC/TC ratio decreasedduring the incubation, accompanied with the equilibrium of pH in thesoil-biochar mixture. Furthermore, after subtracting the abiotic CO 2re-lease, the CO 2release from organic carbon mineralization still showedthe same trend as the total carbon release. Therefore, dissociation of car-bonates was not the only way responsible for the increase of the ob-served CO 2emission. Other mechanism such as organic carbonmineralization by microbial communities also contributed to thephenomenon.S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6050100150200250300(CT - CS)/CS (%) Total -300BC Organic -300BC Total -500BC Organic -500BC Total -700BC Organic -700BC(a)SoilsS1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6020406080Soils(b)Control-7 Control-100 300BC-7 300BC-100 500BC-7 500BC-100 700BC-7 700BC-100IC/TCFig. 1.

Sheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 572 (2016) 129 –1373.2. Biochar degradation and induced priming effect of SOC across differentsoil pHThe degradation rate of biochar was negatively correlated with thesoil pH ( Fig. 2 ). Despite of lower abiotic release for biochar pyrolysis atlower temperature (300 °C), faster degradation during the incubationwas shown (Fig. S3), which was in accordance with a previous study(Singh et al., 2012 ). Biochar pyrolyzed at higher temperature has great-er chemical recalcitrance and stability. Furthermore, surface covering bysilicates derived from ashed tissues could also protect biochar pyrolyzedat higher temperature from decomposition ( Bertrand et al., 2007; Xiaoet al., 2014 ). Despite the rapid dissolution of carbonates in acidic soilon the ﬁrst day, more biochar C was mineralized in the high-pH soilthan in the low-pH soil (Fig. S2). Higher microbial biomass was attribut-ed to higher biochar mineralization in the high-pH soil, which was relat-ed to the content of SOC by offering more available substrates formicrobial growth. Nevertheless when expressed as the mineralizationof biochar per unit native SOC in different soils, the revised degradationof biochar had a negative relationship with the soil pH.Apart from the soil pH, other factors might also affect the biocharstability, such as feedstocks, pyrolysis temperatures, SOC and clay con-tents. The long-term stability of biochars was in the order of manurebiochar bleaf biochar bwood biochar. Besides, a greater degree of min-eralization was found for low-temperature biochars from the samefeedstock ( Singh and Cowie, 2014 ). It was resulted from a more aromat-ic structure with higher aryl C content ( Luo et al., 2011 ), which is consis-tent with the results of this study. The large amount of native SOC alsosupport greater microbial activity and biomass for biotic mineralizationof biochar-C ( Fang et al., 2014; Keith et al., 2011 ); (Kimetu andLehmann, 2010 ). The stability of biochar in soils might also attributeto its reduced accessibility via organo-mineral associations ( Fang et al.,2014 ). The soil with abundant Fe and Al oxides provided greater stabili-zation to biochar C compared to the soil with abundant phyllosilicatesdominated soil ( Murray et al., 2015 ). The organo-mineral associationscould also explain the slightly decreased biochar degradation rate insoils S1and S2 at the end of the incubation. Further studies on the mech-anism and contribution on those factors in ﬂuencing biochar stabilityshould be conducted.In acidic soils, biochar addition initially ( ﬁrst 7 days) accelerated theSOC mineralization. The application of the low-temperature-pyrolyzedbiochar induced more drastically positive priming effect than thehigh-temperature-pyrolyzed biochar ( Fig. 3 a). Co-metabolism and lim-ing effect were considered to be the main reasons for the priming effectsin acidic soils. Since biochar C pyrolyzed at lower temperaturecontained higher volatile matter, which was more easily mineralizedand resulted in increased microbial biomass and the simultaneous in-crease in enzyme production ( Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov, 2008;Keith et al., 2011; Kuzyakov et al., 2009 ). The lag phase and lower prim-ing effect of 300BC amended soils within 7 days introduced anothermechanism such as liming effect. As soils amended with higher-temper-ature-pyrolyzed biochar had higher pH and higher respiratory quotient(Bruun et al., 2014 ), the mineralization of SOC would be more drastical-ly stimulated. However, the positive priming effect of 500BC-amendedsoil S2 shifted from positive (11.9 μg C on the 4th day) to negative(13.07 μg C on the 100th day) across time. As the labile C componentsof biochar were depleted quickly, the effect of co-metabolism would de-crease, accompanied with other mechanisms such as microbial adaptionthough the incubation, the stabilization of biochar adsorption and morestable organo-mineral interactions ( Gu et al., 1994; Yang et al., 2016 ).Compared with the acidic soils, the neutral and alkaline soils showednegative priming effect in the early stage of incubation. Biochar initiallyexhibited a suppression of SOC mineralization (30.92, 44.86, 68.65 μgCof 300BC, 500BC, 700BC amended soil S5 on the 7th day of the incuba-tion, respectively). The neural and alkaline soils amended with higher-temperature-pyrolyzed biochar resulted in a higher negative primingeffect. Adsorption of DOC to biochar was introduced to explain this neg-ative priming effect. The concentration of DOC in biochar-amended soilsigniﬁcantly decreased (Fig. S6), suggesting the protection SOC from mi-crobial degradation and offset the excess CO2release by co-metabolism.Besides, as the smaller adsorption capacity and less stable structure of300BC, negative priming effect switched to positive priming effectover time ( Fig. 3 b).The results showed a negative relationship between the priming ef-fect and the soil pH. Similarly, other studies suggested a more pro-nounced positive priming effect caused by liming effect of biochar inlow-pH soil ( Luo et al., 2011 ). On the contrary, a meta-analysis on pyro-genic organic matter induced priming effect of previous researches didnot observe a signi ﬁcant relationship between the priming effect andthe soil/biochar pH ( Maestrini et al., 2015 ). The meta-analysis wastaken by a time scale of over a year and the priming effect would switchfrom positive to negative priming or in the opposite across time, whichwould obscure the effect of pH. Other factors such as SOC, biochar appli-cation rates, temperatures, experimental duration and moisture con-tents might also in ﬂuence the results. Therefore, more factors shouldbe taken into account for evaluating the carbon sequestration potentialof biochar.3.3. Biochar induced microbial structure change across different soil pHThe predominant group of microorganisms was gram-positive bac-teria which comprised 25.1% and 38.6% of the total microbial PLFAs insoils S1 and S2, respectively. The PLFA concentrations suggested a pref-erential community for gram-negative bacteria in the other four soilswhich comprised 37.8% to 53.2% of the total microbial biomass (TableS4). As stronger ligand exchange existed between carboxyl/hydroxylfunctional groups in natural organic matter and iron oxide surfaces, es-pecially under acidic or slightly acidic pH conditions ( Gu et al., 1994 ).The distribution of soil microbial communities by pH was attributed tomore stable organo-mineral structure, as well as the lower nutrient con-tent in acidic soils. Gram-positive bacteria which had the ability to formspores ( Moche et al., 2015 ), dominated in severe environmental condi-tions as presented here in acidic soils. Since gram-positive bacteria wasknown for their importance in the decomposition of aromatic C ( Santoset al., 2012 ), the presented higher gram-positive bacteria in acidic soilswould favor the degradation of biochar which was rich in aromatic C, inconsistence with higher degradation for biochar. On the contrary, amore gram-negative bacteria-dominated community in neural and al-kaline soils favored easily degradable carbon substrates ( Feng et al.,2010 ) and was weak in degradation of biochar.The addition of biochar signi ﬁcantly increased total PLFA-C abun-dance ( pb0.05), especially at the early stage of the incubation (TableS4, Fig. S3). The increased amount of PLFAs in the 300BC-amended soilwas observed to be signi ﬁcantly higher than that of 500BC and 700BC.In accord with the other study using PCR-DGGE, signi ﬁcantly and great-ly increased bacterial gene abundance, as well as the small increase inS1 S2 S4 S50102030405060CO2 release from biochar (µg/g SOC)300BC 500BC 700BCSoilsFig. 2. CO2release from biochar per unit of soil organic carbon ( μg/g SOC) under differentpH values over 100 days of incubation.133 Y. Sheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 572 (2016) 129 –137fungal gene abundance were observed under biochar application(Lu et al., 2015 ). Despite the increase of PLFAs, total CO 2emission de-creased for neural and alkaline soils in 500BC and 700BC, suggestingother mechanisms such as the distribution of microbial communities(G−/G+ratio and F/B ratio) would also affect the mineralization of soilcarbon. As indicated in Fig. S4, the PLFA change was mainly related tosoil types rather than the kinds and application of biochar, and the ef-fects of soil types became more drastic as time goes on. The resultsalso suggest that the site effects are greater than biochar treatment, em-phasizing the importance of soil properties in the carbon sequestrationby biochar.The G−/G+ratio exhibited a positive correlation with the soil pH(pb0.05). Increased soil pH and change of substrates bioavailabilityby biochar induce the higher G−/G+ratio. Higher G−/G+ratio were ob-served in higher-temperature-pyrolyzed biochar amended acidic soilsexcept soil S1 ( Fig.4a). The easy bioavailable materials in biochar suchas hemicelluloses might be responsible for the increase G−/G+ratioespecially at the early stage of incubation. The increased G−/G+ratio was supported by previous study which also showed the declineof gram-positive Acidbacteria and abundance of gram-negativeAlphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Kolton et al., 2011; Xu et al.,2016 ). Other suggested a shift from acid to alkaline phosphomonoester-ase activity may suggest an ecological and functional shift towards amore copiotrophic ecology ( Jenkins et al., 2016 ). As the gram-negativebacteria had not been detected in control for soil S1 at the end of the in-cubation, higher aromatic structure in 500BC and 700BC stimulated thegrowth of gram-positive bacteria.The G−/G+ratio showed a higher positive relationship with soil pHin the end of the incubation ( pb0.05, R2= 0.52) than in the early stageof the incubation ( pb0.05, R2= 0.39). This was largely due to the deple-tion of labile C in biochar. At the end of the incubation, due to strongeradsorption capacity for DOC and enzyme in higher-temperature- pyro-lyzed biochar, lower G−/G+ratio was observed in neural and alkalinesoils. Furthermore, decreasing ratios of G−/G+bacterial PLFAs in theend of the incubation suggest a possible microbial community shift to-wards Gram-positive bacteria over time, resulting from the exhaustingof labile organic carbon in the treatment.Fungi accounted for a higher proportion in lower-pH soils (Table S5),and F/B ratio increased with the decrease of the soil pH ( Fig. 4 ). Whilethe F/B ratio exhibited a signi ﬁcant increase for soils S1 and S2 at theearly stage of incubation ( pb0.05) after the biochar application, no sig-niﬁcant change of the F/B ratio was observed for the neural and alkalinesoils. The F/B ratio showed a higher negative relationship with soil pH inthe end of the incubation ( pb0.05, R2= 0.47) than in the early stage ofthe incubation ( pb0.05, R2= 0.24). Fungi could be the consumer of ar-omatic biochar and lignin, accelerating the degradation of biochar(Watzinger et al., 2014 ). However, despite the higher F/B ratio in acidicsoils, it did not show obvious relationship between the biochar degrada-tion and the priming effect of SOC. It was because fungal ﬂora was moreefﬁcient in assimilating substrate C than bacterial ﬂora. Generally, fun-galﬂora assimilated 30 –40% of C into its new mycelium while bacterialﬂora only assimilated 5 –10% of substrate C into its new cells ( Sakamotoand Oba, 1994 ). As a result, the metabolic quotient decreased with anincrease in the F/B ratio ( Sakamoto and Oba, 1994 ), thus to dissimilateless C substrate and caused less CO 2release ( Fig. 5 ).Soils with lower G−/G+ratios tended to have positive priming ef-fect, and the extent depended on the pyrolysis temperature of biochar(Fig. 5 ). Stronger biochar degradation by gram-positive bacteria mightbe accompanied by co-metabolism of SOC, which would thereforecause the positive priming effect for SOC in acidic soils. Rapid degrada-tion rate of biochar at lower G−/G+ratios also indicated the change ofpreferential substrate utilization. It was suggested that soil with lowbiodegradability SOC and nutrient-poor soils were more likely affectedby priming effects ( Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov, 2008 ). Since thesessoils were more limited by the availability of energy substrates, theadded substrates would act as an important energy source for microbialmetabolism.

As the heterogeneousstructure of carbon in SOC, biochar and the resulting diversity of micro-bial communities, the G−/G+ratio was suggested be a promising indi-cator for the prediction of priming effect. Further researches on therelationship between G−/G+ratio and other factors (SOC, water con-tents, and incubation duration) is needed, as well as for the changes attaxonomic level determined by 16 s rRNA.3.4. Carbon structure change of biochar-amended soil and consequent sub-strates limitationMore stable organ-mineral structure and lower nutrients in acidicsoils resulted in higher substrate limitation. As indicated by FTIR, thepeak at 913 cm−1attributed to the deformation of Al-Al-OH stretchingvibration, and higher proportion of aromatic C _C groups (1637 cm−1),conﬁrmed the existing of organo-mineral interaction ( Fig. 6 a).Previous research also showed the presence of signi ﬁcant char likearyl and O-aryl C of SOC in the aridic arenosol ( Farrell et al., 2013 ). Asthe more stable nature of SOC in acid soils, the energy sustaining activemicrobial populations and production of enzymes was limited, thuscontributed to higher substrate limitation and G−/G+ratio. On the con-trary, higher aliphatic C \\H stretching vibration (1406 cm−1)a n d“amide-II ”N\\H (1550 cm−1) were detected in alkaline soils, indicatingmore easily available substrates and micronutrients, contributed tohigher proportion of gram-negative bacteria.The change of surface functional groups induced by biochar resultedin increased substrate bioavailability in acid soils. After biochar amend-ment, aromatic C _Ca n dC_O groups strongly increased in DOC, indi-cating the existing of dissolved aromatic compound ( Qian and Chen,2014 ) by biochar. Furthermore, Due to labile fraction as carbon sourcein dissolved biochar, stronger resolved band of C \\O at 1168 cm−1and peaks centered around 1040 cm−1as indicative of cellulosic mate-rial ( Li et al., 2014 ) were also observed after biochar amendment inacidic soils ( Fig. 6 b, Fig. S6a).Consistent with surface functional groups change, a negativerelationship between the bacteria substrate limitation and the pH(R2=0 . 4 4 , pb0.05) was observed.

Sheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 572 (2016) 129 –137content was also observed ( R2= 0.22, pb0.05). Despite of the de-creased DOC ( Fig. 7 b), biochar addition increased polysaccharides(increase in intensity of infrared absorption at 1050 –1000 cm−1) andresulted in drastically decreased substrate limitation in acidic soils. Onthe contrary, substrate limitation only met a slightly increase for alka-line soils, largely due to adsorption of DOC by biochar. The DOC contentof soil S6 amended with 700BC just accounted for 60.47% of the DOC ofthe control soil, indicating strong sorption of SOC by biochar. The higherstretching vibration of aromatic material also contributed to the sub-strate limitation, thus to explain why higher microbial biomass existedin neural soils after biochar addition generated lower carbonmineralization.4. ConclusionsBiochar carbon sequestration potential in acidic soil was limitedwhere the degradation of both SOC and biochar was accelerated. In acid-ic soil, more carbonates in biochar were released due to the more acidicenvironment. Higher proportion of gram-positive bacteria and fungi inacidic soils favored the degradation of biochar and stimulated the SOCmineralization. Biochar amendment could relieve the substrate limita-tion in acidic soil, thus promoted the degradation of SOC and biochar.Although the priming effect of SOC differ in various soils and changedover time, the G−/G+ratio was introduced as an promising indicativefor prediction of carbon sequestration, as lower G−/G+ratios tendedto have positive priming effect. Given a considerable percent of agricul-ture soil in China is red soil, the carbonates and priming effect of SOCshould be taken into account in evaluating the carbon sequestration po-tential of biochar. As the higher ash content and low carbon content inrice-straw biochar, further research is required to explore the micro-mechanism, especially the biological process and long-time-scale ex-periments of soil pH on carbon sequestration potential of variousbiochar.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (21477111) and the National Key Technology Researchand Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technologyof China (2015BAC02B00).Appendix A.
