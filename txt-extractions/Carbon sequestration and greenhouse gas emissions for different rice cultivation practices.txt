Adopting alternative rice farming practices could reduce greenhouse gas emissionsand increase carbon (C) sequestration. In this study, an on-site ﬁeld experiment was conducted to assess the con-tribution of carbon by farm operations involved in the three types of rice cultivation practices: conventional(CVN), the system of rice intensi ﬁcation (SRI), and zero-tillage (ZTL). The study was aimed to examine the carbonindices under three different rice cultivation methods to assess the ecosystem services and disservices associatedwith carbon sequestration and emission. Results showed that fertilizer application signi ﬁcantly contributed toGWP among the three cultivations. In the CVN and ZTL plots, the GWP was higher for CH4and N 2O. However,all three cultivation strategies acted as carbon sinks, with SRI cultivation yielding the highest sequestrationvalues. The lower CF, higher CS, and higher CER values were obtained for SRI ﬁeld plots than the other two cul-tivation practices. The ratio between ecosystem services and disservices in terms of US$ was highest for SRI,followed by ZTL and CVN cultivations. In summary, sustainable agriculture could promote by applying organicmanure in the context of SRI cultivation in the water-scarce zones and ZTL cultivation in the tropical uplandzones, where such cultivation is not yet practised. Not only will this increase net carbon sequestration, but itwill also bene ﬁt farmers soon in terms of yield.© 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

IntroductionRice ( Oryza sativa ) cultivation worldwide is a probable greenhousegas (GHG) emission source. About 10 –12 % of global anthropogenicemissions come from methane (52 %) and nitrous oxide (84 %) ( IPCC,2014 ;Smith et al., 2007 ). Total GHG emissions from ﬁelds are the sumof direct emissions from cropland soils and indirect emissions from fer-tilizers, pesticides, the operation of machines and irrigation ( IPCC,2014 ). The production, formulation, storage, transportation and use ofagricultural equipment result in the burning of fossil fuels and the useof alternative energy sources, which entail the production of carbondioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, with negative impacts onthe environment ( Lal, 2004 ). CO 2emission is seen as the linchpin,as its atmospheric concentration has risen by an alarming 41 % over164 years. It corresponds to the increase in global mean temperature(Etheridge et al., 1996 ;Tans and Keeling, 2014 ). One of the promisingapproaches to mitigating the unforeseen risks caused by theatmospheric abundance of CO 2and other greenhouse gases is tosequester carbon in the permanent pools of soil layers ( Kerr, 2007 ).Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –104Abbreviations: AL, Amount of individual agricultural input (kg−1ha−1crop season−1orkWh−1ha−1crop season−1); B c,T o t a l ﬁx e dCi nb i o m a s s( k gC O 2-eq ha−1crop season−1);BD, Bulk density; B grain, Grain yield, kg ha−1crop season−1;Broot,R o o tb i o m a s s ,k gh a−1crop season−1;Bshoot, Shoot biomass, kg ha−1crop season−1;Btotal, Total carbon in biomassof rice (Grain + straw + root biomass); CER,C a r b o ne f ﬁciency ratio; CF, Carbon footprint;Cf, Average cost of afforestation in India (US $t−1CO2); C ndcf, Net direct CO 2ﬁxed (kg CO 2-eq ha−1crop season−1); C o, Carbon output; CS, Carbon sustainability index; C t, Indian Ctax; E CO2, Direct CO 2emissions from paddy soils and plant respiration (kg CO 2-eq ha−1crop season−1).; E DIS,M o n e t a r yv a l u eo fd i s s e r v i c e( U S$h a−1); EF, GHG emission factor ofindividual agricultural input (kg CO 2eq−1kg or kg CO 2eq−1kWh).; EGHG, Total amount ofequivalent CO 2emission (kg CO 2eq ha−1);Einput, Total C-eq emissions induced by agricul-tural inputs (kg CO 2-eq ha−1crop season−1).;EM CH4, On-site seasonal farm emission ofCH4(kg ha−1);EM N2O, Sum total of on-site seasonal farm emission of N 2O( k gh a−1)a n dthe indirect N 2O emission; EN-indirect , Amount of nitrogen lost due to leaching andvolatization process (kg N ha−1).;ENL, IPCC emission factor for leached nitrogen (kg N 2O-Nha−1);ENV, IPCC emission factor for volatilization (kg N 2O-N kg−1NH3-N); E SER, Ecosystemservice values of C sequestration (US $ ha−1);Etot, Total emission is the sum of EinputandEGHG.;GY, Rice grain yield (kg ha−1);GYC, Grain yield of rice (in terms of C); NL,A m o u n to fnitrogen lost through the process of leaching (kg N ha−1);NV, Amount of ammoniaemitted from fertilizer application (kg N ha−1); SD, Soil depth; SOC, Soil organic carbon;SOCS, SOC stock (kg ha−1).⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address: smandal@envsc.buruniv.ac.in (S.

Carbon sequestration is considered one of the primaryecosystem services obtained from agroecosystems ( Costanza et al.,1997 ). The mode of carbon sequestration in agroecosystems occursthrough soil- ﬁxed carbon through crop residues and soil organic carbongains (SOC) ( Palm et al., 2014 ).Therefore, carbon ﬂuxes in agroecosystems involve carbon emis-sions and carbon sequestration. A holistic approach to understandingcarbon ﬂuxes was made through the joint assessment of carbon analysisindices and ecosystem services of carbon sequestration. Direct emissionof greenhouse gases, especially CH 4and N 2O, from agro-ecosystems haslong been used as a traditional indicator of environmental impact. Re-cently, however, researchers have broken new ground to determinethe ef ﬁciency and sustainability of different rice-growing techniques.The carbon budget and the sustainability of other cultivation techniquesare monitored using the Carbon Footprint (CF) as the leading indicator(Farag et al., 2018 ). The sum of the total GHG emissions (both directand indirect) of a production system forms the carbon footprint (CF),measured in CO 2equivalents (CO 2-eq) ( ISO, 2018 ). The CarbonSustainability Index (CS) and the Carbon Ef ﬁciency Ratio (CER) havebecome ideal tools for assessing the impact of agricultural activitieson the environment ( Weinheimer et al., 2010 ). It tries to develop aclimate-friendly consumption policy and measures to reduce GHGemissions from the farming sector ( Ponsioen and Blonk, 2012 ;Yanet al., 2015 ). Minimizing carbon costs and maximizing ecosystemservices of carbon sequestration of farm products are the researchgaps in the current scenario ( Williams and Wikström, 2011 ).The system of Rice Intensi ﬁcation (SRI) and Zero-Tillage (ZTL) are con-sidered advanced rice cultivation techniques over conventional (CVN)due to their multiple advantages ( Batuwitage, 2002 ). Previous researchon SRI farming techniques addressed water use ef ﬁciency; socio-economic structure of farmers ( Sinha and Talati, 2007 ), nutrient use ef ﬁ-ciency, crop rotation effect ( Kumar et al., 2020 ), water productivity andmitigation of global warming ( Alam et al., 2020 ), transplant at differentphyllochron stages ( Biswas et al., 2021 ), energy ef ﬁciency ( Nirmalaet al., 2021 ), tillage effect ( Kar et al., 2021 ), farm activities in SRI(Meesala and Rasala, 2022 ), weed management ( Nazir et al., 2022 ). Thelatest research on carbon sequestration and emission concerning ZTL in-clude residue management practice ( Kumar et al., 2022 ) and fertigationtechniques in the rice ﬁeld (Juhi et al., 2022 ). The three cultivation tech-niques (CVN, SRI, ZTL) differ in several factors (viz., fertilizer application,tillage operation, irrigation managem ent, seedbed preparation, transplan-tation of seedlings etc.). CVN, or conventional cultivation technique, isIndia's most widely used rice cultivation technique. Here, seedbed andmain plots are treated with inorganic fertilizers (N, P, K at recommendeddosage). The main ﬁelds are thoroughly tilled, and rice culms (5 –6s e e d -lings) of 25 –30 days old are transplanted randomly per hill in the mainplot. The SRI and ZTL practices are alternate wetting and drying technique.The soils are not ﬂooded continuously and drained at regular intervals.The seedbed and the main plot are both treated with organic fertilizersunder SRI. The main ﬁelds are tilled, and a 10 –15 days old seedling(single) or 2 to 3 phyllochron stage seedlings are transplanted singlyper hill at 25 × 25 cm square grid pattern. In the ZTL, there is no seed-bed, main ﬁeld plots are not tilled, and direct seeding of germinated riceseeds is sown with the help of a rice grain planter machine ( Thakuret al., 2010 ). The carbon indices such as carbon footprint, carbonsustainability index and carbon ef ﬁciency ratio, as well as carbon seques-tration, are some of the lesser explored areas of research. They couldbe considered metrics to understand the carbon balance of the agricul-tural system. It could be hypothesized that improved conservation andsustainable agriculture would minimize carbon costs and enhance eco-nomic viability. To validate the hypothesis, the present research aimedto analyze the carbon indices among three different rice cultivation tech-niques and assess the ecosystem servi ces and disservices associated withcarbon sequestration.2. Literature reviewSinha and Talati (2007) investigated the impact of SRI on farmers inWest Bengal, India. They discovered that SRI had higher net returnsthan the traditional system. Alam et al. (2020) used a variety of newerand improved rice growing tactics to try to reduce the limits of rice ag-riculture, such as dwindling ground water and shrinking land area. Theycompared the diverse impacts of different strategies on soil health, ag-ricultural and water productivity, and the ability to mitigate globalwarming. They noted that no single cultivation approach could beproven to be superior. Instead, efforts should be made to identify themost appropriate technique for each agro-climate, local population,soil structure, and farm type. Later, Biswas et al. (2021) used the Agri-cultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Oryza crop model toassess the effects of alternative transplanting dates on rice water con-sumption under SRI agriculture. They used the model to simulate con-sumption water footprints (CWFs), a metric that measures how muchwater rice uses. They demonstrated the advantages of early rice trans-plantation and higher yields in SRI with minimal farm operations.Meesala and Rasala (2022) provide a modern view of the potential ofSRI cultivation for policy-making from an Indian perspective. SRI ap-proaches have been evaluated in terms of their impact on farm inputcosts, plant growth characteristics, as well as social and economic ef-fects on farmers. They noted that farmers using SRI techniques duringcultivation experienced higher yields and net returns relative to theirtotal expenditure. Nazir et al. (2022) tested weed managementmethods using SRI, conventional, and direct-seeding cultivation tech-niques. They used a variety of herbicides to improve the applicationrates to increase rice grain yields while reducing the potential ofweeds to remove nutrients.West and Marland (2002) studied rice cultivation management prac-tices, such as pesticide use, irrigation, and farm machinery, to determinethe carbon sequestration capacity of rice ﬁelds and net CO 2emissions.Field plots without any form of tillage activity had lower CO 2emissionsand higher carbon sequestration than plots with conventional tillage.Juhi et al. (2022) used fertigation strategies to boost soil organic carbonpools and yields in ZTL rice cultivation. Kumar et al. (2022) conducted along-term ﬁeld experiment in East India to reduce the carbon footprintof rice cultivation. They compared traditionally transplanted rice todirect-seeded rice with two distinct tillage operations (ploughed andno-till) and residue management. They discovered that residue manage-ment with pulse-based crops was the most energy ef ﬁcient, had thesmallest carbon footprint, and had the highest economic returns.Das and Adhya (2014) investigated how different mixtures of chemi-cal and organic manure affected GHG emissions in rice ﬁelds. They con-cluded that an optimum management technique could mitigate CH 4and N 2O emissions from rice ﬁelds. Biochar treatment in Chinese riceﬁelds was employed by Liu et al. (2016) as a means of preventing globalwarming. According to the researchers, the patch made from corn strawand modi ﬁed with biochar had the lowest GWP. Xu et al. (2019a, b)conducted another experiment using biochar, and their ﬁndings wereconsistent with the previous one, lowering carbon footprint withbiochar application in study sites. Jiang et al. (2019) improvednitrogen fertilizer rates in Chinese rice ﬁelds. They discovered thatecosystem service values changed from positive to negative,showing that rice ﬁelds served as a net carbon sink at low nitrogenrates and a net carbon source at higher nitrogen rates. Yan et al.(2022) showed that the use of cattle manure along with properwater management could lead to the accumulation of soil organiccarbon in agricultural soils. Rob et al. (2022) noted yield increase inaddition to carbon sequestration with the application of organicmanure in the rye ﬁelds of Germany.S. Gangopadhyay, R. Banerjee, S. Batabyal et al.

Avail-able phosphorus and available potassium (kg ha−1)w e r ee s t i m a t e dusing the Olsen method ( Olsen, 1954 ) and the ﬂame photometermethod ( Black et al., 1965 ), respectively. The available phosphorusand potassium concentration in the trial plots was 52.4 kg ha−1and429.75 kg ha−1, respectively. DTPA-extractable micronutrients such asavailable zinc, boron, sulfur and copper are important for rice growth.Their average concentrations were 5.25 ppm, 0.56 ppm, 16.27 ppmand 3.29 ppm, respectively.3.2. Experimental design and cultivation practicesFour widely used varieties of rice, viz. var. MTU 1010, var. IET 4786,var. IET 17430 and var. IET 9947 were cultivated under SRI, CVN and ZTLmethods of cultivation. In this region, SRI and CVN rice cultivation arepractised in Rabi (sowing: January –February; harvest: March –April)and Kharif (sowing: July –August; harvest: October –November) sea-sons. ZTL is only practised in the Kharif season as soil temperature,and moisture do not support the germination of directly-seeded riceseeds. All four types of rice have a limited lifespan of 110 to 120 days.They were either semi-dwarf or dwarf grains. Sheath rot, brown spot,bacterial leaf blight, sheath blight, panicle, and leaf blast were amongthe diseases to which all four kinds were relatively resistant. Addition-ally, they resisted pest attacks from species, including the shoot borerand brown plant hopper ( Gangopadhyay et al., 2022 ).The water regime is an essential factor concerning three types ofcultivation. Continuous ﬂooding irrigation was used to manage conven-tional farming (CVN). The rice culms were planted under CVN cultiva-tion in a ﬂooded ﬁeld with 5 –7 cm of standing water. For the durationof the vegetative stage (S2), a water depth of 5 –6 cm was maintained.Plots were maintained ﬂooded with a thin layer of 1 –2c mo fw a t e rafter the panicle commencement stage (S3). The ﬁelds were drainedten to ﬁfteen days before the harvest stage (S4).In contrast, intermittent irrigation management was practisedfor both the System of Rice Intensi ﬁcation (SRI) and Zero tillage (ZTL).In the SRI plots, water was applied to the main ﬁeld plots 5 days beforetransplant, and the water used was suf ﬁcient to moisten withoutﬂooding the plots thoroughly. The alternate Wetting and Drying(AWD) cycle was employed with shallow standing water (1 –2c mwater depth) during irrigation, altered with the dry period. The waterwas drained 7 days after ponded water's disappearance throughoutthe vegetative growth period (S2). After panicle initiation (S3), plotswere ﬂooded with a thin layer of 1 –2c mw a t e r .T h e ﬁelds were drained15 days before harvest (S4).The direct seeding of rice in the ZTL plots depends upon the rainfallthe main plots receive (S1 stage). The average rainfall at the time oftransplant of seeds was 3.07 mm day−1in the Kharif seasons of thethree-year study period. The period corresponds to the sowing ofseeds in the seed-beds of CVN and SRI cultivations. Later, the entireprocess of water regime management was maintained following theSRI cultivation.The Randomized Complete Block Design (RBD) was used to arrangefour replicates (6 m × 3 m) of rice varieties for the three cultivationpractices ( Sekhar et al., 2019 ). The rice seeds of the four types weresoaked in water for 1 day. Seeds were sown separately in SRI seedbedsand conventional seedbeds. The seedbed preparation was done withorganic manure and inorganic fertilizers for the SRI and CVN, respec-tively. The Rice Grain Planter machine was used for no-till rice cultiva-tion or ZTL. A brief comparison of the three cultivation techniques isshown in Table 1 . Rice samples and rhizosphere soil were collectedevery 10 days throughout the growing season. Rice straw, root, andshoot were oven dried (at 60 °C to constant weight) and the agronomicparameters such as plant height, tiller count, root length, root biomassand aboveground dry weight at successive phenological stages werecalculated using weighing balance. After completion of the last harvest,yield attributes such as panicle number, spikelet count per panicle, per-centage of ﬁlled spikelets, 1000 grain weight and grain yield were alsoanalyzed ( Ao et al., 2010 ;Garnett et al., 2009 ;Han et al., 2015 ).3.3. Data collection and analysis3.3.1. Direct measurement of GHG emissionsWeekly measurements of greenhouse gases were taken throughoutthe study using a greenhouse gas analyzer (HORIBA JAPAN, VA-5000-VS-5000) and the static glass chamber method. On the soil's surface,45 × 45 × 150 cm glass chambers were positioned. At intervals of30 min, sampling was carried out in triplicate. The mean daily ﬂuxrate of GHGs (CO2,C H 4,a n dN 2O) corresponds to the emission fromthe static chambers at 9:00 –11:00, 15:00 –17:00, and 21:00 –23:00.The greenhouse gas ﬂuxes were measured based on the rates of gasconcentration change per time unit and headspace volume of theTable 1Comparison of the three cultivation techniques (CVN-conventional, SRI-System of Rice Intensi ﬁcation, and ZTL-Zero-tillage) adopted for the experiment in the Crop Research and SeedMultiplication Farm.CultivationtechniquesCVN ZTL SRISeed application rate in seedbed 50 kg ha−130 kg ha−15k gh a−1Tillage in main plot Tilled No-Tilled TilledSeedbed preparation Present Absent PresentSeedling age transplantation 25 –30 days old seedling Direct-seeding. 10 –15-days old seedling (single) or 2 to 3phyllochron stage seedlingsPlanting space and density 5 –6 seedling per hill in random manner Freshly germinated seedswere planted using Ricegrain Planter machine.1 seedling per hill was transplanted in asquare pattern of 25 × 25 cmWater management The rice culms were transplanted in completely ﬂooded ﬁeld with5–7 cm of standing water. A water depth of 5 –6 cm wasmaintained throughout the vegetative stage. After panicleinitiation, plots were kept ﬂooded with a thin layer of 1 –2c mo fwater. The plots were drained 10 –15 days before harvest.In case of SRI and ZTL plots, water was applied to the ﬁeld plots 5 days priorto transplant. The amount of water applied was just suf ﬁcient to completelymoisten without ﬂooding the plots. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)cycle was employed with shallow stand ing water during wet periods alteredwith dry period. The plots were irrigated (1 –2 cm water depth) and waterwas drained at a 7 days interval after the disappearance of ponded waterthroughout the vegetative growth period. After panicle initiation, plots werekeptﬂooded with a thin layer of 1 –2 cm of water. The plots were drained15 days before harvest.Nutrient management Chemical fertilizers (N, P and K) at a rate of 60:30:30 kg ha−1were applied in the CVN and ZTLplots by three separate applications at the basal, active tillering and panicle initiation stages.Organic fertilizer (cow dung manure:vermicompost:1:1) was applied to the SRIplots in an amount of 5 t ha−1.S.

In thepresent study, the unit of GHGs was converted to mg m−2h−1.3.3.2. GHG emissions associated with farm operationsThe carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2-eq) emissions related to farminputs were estimated using the following equation (Eq. (2)):Einput¼∑AL/C2EF ð2Þwhere, Einputis the sum of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions inducedby agricultural inputs (kg CO 2-eq ha−1crop season−1).ALis thequantity of individual agricultural input (kg−1ha−1crop season−1orkWh−1ha−1crop season−1),EFis the speci ﬁc GHG emission factor ofindividual agricultural input when it was manufactured and/or applied(kg CO 2-eq−1kg or kg CO 2-eq−1kWh). The CO 2-eq coef ﬁcient factorsfor GHG emissions from agricultural inputs are shown in Table 2 .Some nitrogen is lost through leaching and volatilization from thenitrogen-based inorganic fertilizers in CVN and ZTL and organic manurein SRI. Fields under CVN and ZTL cultivation with inorganic N treatmentleached a higher proportion of applied N (0.78 %) than ﬁelds under SRIcultivation with organic manure (0.46 %) ( Meng et al., 2014 ). The frac-tion of N lost through the volatilization process was assumed to be 10 %of the applied inorganic and organic amendments ( IPCC, 2006 ). To esti-mate the contribution of N 2O, the proportion of leached and volatilizedN was multiplied by their respective emission factors ( IPCC, 2006 )(Eq.(3)).EN−indirect ¼NL/C2ENLþNV/C2ENV ðÞ /C24428ð3Þwhere, NL= Amount of nitrogen lost through the process of leaching(kg N/ha), ENL= IPCC emission factor for leached nitrogen (0.0075 kgN2O-N/ha), NV= Amount of ammonia emitted from fertilizerapplication, ENV= IPCC emission factor for volatilization (0.01 kg N 2O-N/kg NH 3-N).3.3.3. Carbon budgetIn carbon budget analysis, the ﬁrst step is to estimate the carbonfootprint (CF). For this estimation, a protocol was designed to setthe system boundaries ( Chen et al., 2020 ). In the current research,the system boundary included all agricultural activities throughoutt h er i c eg r o w i n gs e a s o nf r o ms e e dt oh a r v e s t .T h eC Fo fr i c ep r o d u c -tion was assessed by having total GHG emissions from farm inputsand non-CO2emissions (CH 4and N 2O) from paddy ﬁelds. Itincludes the direct emissions of greenhouse gases throughout thelife cycle of crop production as well as the indirect greenhouse gasemissions caused by the high hi dden carbon costs from variousinputs of agricultural material pr oduction, packaging and transportof the inputs ( Gan et al., 2012 ). CO 2emissions emitted directlyfrom rice soils were not included in the CF calculation because thecarbon sequestered by plant biomass is higher than their emission(IPCC, 2014 ).The carbon budget under different farming practices was estimatedby indices such as CF, Carbon Sustainability Index (CS), Carbon Ef ﬁciencyRatio (CER). The activities within the system boundary have beengrouped into agricultural inputs and outputs. Agricultural resources in-clude raw materials or fertilizers, seeds, diesel, pesticides and electricity.Farm outputs include GH G emissions from paddy ﬁelds (CH 4andN2O) and rice biomass (grain yield, aboveground and belowgroundbiomass).3.3.3.1. Carbon footprint (CF). The carbon footprint is the aggregationof the total emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from differentsources and reactions of a given product or system from its manufac-ture to its ﬁnal destination. CO 2equivalent (CO 2-eq) is used torepresent CH 4and N 2O.IPCC (2014) proposed values for individualgreenhouse gases' global warming p otential (GWP). It is expressedin carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2eq). The IPCC (2014) deﬁnesCO2eq as the concentration of CO 2that would produce the sameradiative forcing as a given mixture of CO 2and other forcingcomponents over 100 years. CO 2has a global warming potential of1, N 2O has a global warming potential of 298, while CH 4has aglobal warming potential of 34 ( Oo et al., 2018 ).In the present study, the CF estimation was performed in two tiers:Tier 1 is the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in kg CO 2equivalent h−1of all on-site direct non-CO 2emissions from rice ﬁeld soils (Eq. (4)). Tier2 consists of indirect emissions resulting from farm inputs and iscalculated (Eq. (2)).EGHG¼EM CH4/C234þEM N2O/C2298 ð4Þwhere, EM CH4is the on-site seasonal farm emission of CH 4(kg ha−1).EM N2Ois the sum total of on-site seasonal farm emission of N 2O(kg ha−1), and the indirect N 2O emission calculated by Eq. 2.34 and298 are the GWPs for CH 4and N 2O, respectively, with respect to CO 2over a 100-yr time horizon.Table 2Farm input categories and emission factors of GHG emissions under Conventional (CVN), System of Rice Intensi ﬁcation (SRI) and Zero-Tillage (ZTL)used in the study.Farm inputcategoriesItems Units EmissionfactorsReferences Agricultural inputsUnit Application rateCVN SRI ZTLSeedbed Main ﬁeld Seedbed Main ﬁeld Seedbed Main ﬁeldFertilizers Urea kg CO2-eq kg−1N 7.48 Chen et al., 2015 kg ha−150 60 –– 60Superphosphate kg CO 2-eq kg−1P2O50.72 Chen et al., 2015 kg ha−150 30 –– 30Potassium chloride kg CO 2-eq kg−1K2O 0.62 Chen et al., 2015 kg ha−150 30 –– 30Organic fertilizer kg CO 2-eq kg−10.22 Guo and Gifford, 2002 kg ha−1– 2500 5000 –Seeds kg CO 2-eq kg−11.84 Xue et al., 2014 kg ha−150 5 30Diesel kg CO 2-eq kg−13.21 Zhang et al., 2013 kg ha−13.5 3.5 2Herbicide kg CO 2-eq kg−16.3 Lal, 2004 kg ha−14.5 4.5 4.5Electricity kg CO 2-eq kWh−11.12 Zhang et al., 2013 kWh ha−11894 1003 1003S.

If the value of the ecosys-tem service is positive, there is an economic gain ( Heimann andReichstein, 2008 ). The total GHG emissions from paddy ﬁelds (both di-rect emissions on site and indirect emissions from farm inputs) multi-plied by the carbon tax (Ct) gave the Monetary Value of Disservice(EDIS), Eq.

Statistical analysisThe effects of treatment factors (cultivation practice and rice culti-vars) on CF, CS, CER, SOC, C seqof paddy ﬁelds were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS statistical software. Treat-ment mean comparisons were performed with a probability of 5 % usingthe post-hoc test-Duncans Multiple Range Test (DMRT).4. Results and discussion4.1. Emissions due to farm operationsThe cumulative carbon dioxide-equivalent emission (t CO2–eqha−1) for all farm categories was highest for conventional cultivation( C V N )f o l l o w e db yS y s t e mo fR i c eI n t e n s i ﬁcation (SRI) and Zero-tillage cultivation (ZTL). Emissions from different types of farmoperations were 4.78 t CO 2–eq ha−1, 3.23 t CO 2–eq ha−1and 2.53 tCO2–eq ha−1under CVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively. The contributionof farm inputs to total carbon equivalent emissions (t CO 2-eq ha−1)was 56.82 %, 55.08 % and 55.34 % under CVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively.The current study is in accord with the results of Chen et al. (2020) ,where a 24.6 –122.2 % increase in the GHG emissions was observed asS. Gangopadhyay, R. Banerjee, S. Batabyal et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –10495a result of nitrogen fertilization treatment (corresponding to the CVNcultivation of the present study)compared to no nitrogen fertilizationtreatment(corresponding in part to SRI plots of the present study).Moreover, the general pattern of these farm input components in all cul-tivations was in descending order across all growing seasons, such asfertilizer application followed by irrigation, fuel consumption, seedsand herbicide. The percentage share of the individual farm activities(fertilizer application, seeds, crop protection, fuel consumption, and ir-rigation) in the total CO2-eq emission varied greatly depending on thecultivation method. The CO 2-eq emission caused by fertilizer applica-tion was 47.1 %, 51.7 % and 45.5 % under CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation.Seed application contributed around 1.9 %, 0.3 % and 2.2 % underCVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation, respectively. The herbicide applicationcontributed nearly 0.6 %, 0.9 %, 1.1 % under CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation,respectively. Fuel economy contributed about 10.9 %, 16.1 % and 11.7 %to CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation, respectively. For irrigation, the carbon-equivalent emission was relatively high, contributing about 39.6 %,31.0 % and 39.5 % under CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation, respectively(Fig. 2 ).4.2. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emission (CO 2-eq emission)The contribution of CO 2-eq GHG emissions arising directly from theﬁeld as a result of cultivation to the net CO 2-eq emissions from paddyﬁelds varied widely. Under CVN, the contribution of CH 4and N 2Oemissions was about 37.26 % and 5.92 %, respectively. In the SRI cultiva-tion, CH 4and N 2O contributed approximately 34.48 % and 10.38 %,respectively. In the case of ZTL cultivation, the CH 4and N 2O emissionsreleased into the atmosphere were about 30.63 % and 14.02 %,respectively. In addition, it was found that the GWP for CH 4washighest among CVN, followed by SRI and ZTL ( p< 0.05). Over the entireinvestigation period, the GWP for CH 4was 3.23 t CO 2-eq ha−1, 2.05 tCO2-eq ha−1and 1.41 tCO 2-eq ha−1for CVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively.In contrast, the GWP for N 2O was highest among ZTL, followed by SRIand CVN (p < 0.05). Over the entire study period, the GWP for N 2Owas 0.46 t CO 2-eq ha−1,0 . 5 8tC O 2-eq ha−1and 0.61 t CO 2-eq ha−1for CVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively. The total carbon equivalent emissionsfrom rice ﬁelds ranged between 7.36 and 11.0 t CO 2-eq ha−1, between5.15 and 7.16 t CO 2-eq ha−1and between 4.15 and 4.92 t CO 2-eq ha−1under CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation respectively. A signi ﬁcant differencewas observed in the total carbon equivalent emissions among cultiva-tions and varieties and are represented in Fig. 3 . The seasonal averagerate of GHG ﬂux rate (mg m−2h−1)o fC H 4,C O 2and N 2O in Rabi andKharif rice growing seasons during the study period are shown inTable S1 and Table S2.It was inferred from Table S3 and S4 that cumulative emission ofGHG showed the same pattern as the GHG ﬂux of CH 4,C O 2and N 2O,respectively. Seasonal cumulative emission of CH 4was higher in CVNt h a nS R Ii nR a b is e a s o n( p<0 . 0 5 ) .I nt h eK h a r i fs e a s o n ,t h eh i g h e remission was observed in CVN followed by SRI and ZTL. Higher cu-mulative emission of N 2O was observed in ZTL followed by SRIand CVN. It was observed that there was a signi ﬁcant difference incumulative emission of GHGs (CH 4,C O 2and N 2O) among the threecultivation practices (CVN, SRI, ZTL). Moreover, a signi ﬁcant differencein cumulative emissions among varieties was observed throughoutthe three-year study period (2018 –2020) in cumulative CH 4and CO 2emissions. However, no such difference was observed in the case ofcumulative N 2O emission among varieties. The total carbon dioxideequivalent emission (t CO 2-eq ha−1) and total carbon sequestration(t CO 2-eq ha−1) under different rice cultivation practices (CVN, SRI,ZTL) during Rabi and Kharif seasons are shown in Tables S5 andS6 respectively.During Rabi season, only var. IET 17430 showed the lowest total car-bon dioxide equivalent emission in 2018; other cultivars showed almostsimilar carbon dioxide equivalent emission patterns in the successiveyears in the CVN cultivation. However, the total carbon sequestrationwas higher in both IET 17430 and IET 9947 in the CVN cultivation. Inthe SRI, all the varieties showed no signi ﬁcant difference in carbon diox-ide equivalent emission. However, the var. IET 9947 showed the highestsequestration ability among the varieties and IET 17430.During the Kharif season, in the CVN cultivation, IET 4786 showedthe lowest carbon dioxide equivalent emission among all the varietiesduring the study period. In the SRI, both IET 17430 and IET 9947 showedthe lowest carbon dioxide equivalent emission. The same varieties againdominated the CO 2sequestration ability in the same cultivation system.In the ZTL cultivation, the carbon dioxide equivalent emission andcarbon dioxide sequestration showed no signi ﬁcant difference amongvarieties. Hence it could be inferred that during the Kharif season, var.Fig. 2. Percentage contribution of different categories of farm operations (viz. fertilizer application, seed requirement, crop protection, fuel consum ption, and irrigation) to the total carbon-equivalent emission (t CO 2–eq ha−1). CVN- Conventional cultivation, SRI –System of rice intensi ﬁcation, ZTL –Zero tillage.S. Gangopadhyay, R. Banerjee, S. Batabyal et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –10496IET 17430 could be the preferred rice variety in SRI cultivation. IET 4786could be the preferred variety in the CVN cultivation, and the farmerscould select any combinations for ZTL cultivation.The present results re ﬂect that in the CVN cultivation, the percent-age contribution of CH 4towards the total emission was higher thanthat of SRI followed by ZTL. In contrast, the percentage contribution ofN2O towards the total emission was higher in ZTL followed by SRI andCVN. The observations con ﬁrmed that CH 4contributed more to thetotal carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from rice ﬁelds than N 2O,which immensely contributed immensely to the CF calculation. Thepresent results are in accord with the interpretation provided bythe DeNitri ﬁcation –DeComposition (DNDC) model in combinationwith the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) by Chenet al. (2020) . They found that CH 4was the main contributor to CF(43.9 –58.3 % of total CF) over a 35 year prediction period from2015 to 2050. It could be interpreted that the water regime, fertilizerapplication type, and tillage played a role in de ﬁning the pattern ofmethane production and emission from rice ﬁelds. The organic fertil-izer under SRI ﬁeld plots was applied at the rate of 5 t ha−1at thetime of main plot preparation.The water regime of SRI ﬁelds was different from CVN ﬁelds.Throughout the vegetative stage (S2), the ﬁeld plots were intermit-tently irrigated with wet, ﬂooded, and drained periods. For an average110- day variety rice, the panicle initiation starts approximately50–55 days after transplant. Accordingly, 6 –7 AWD cycles wereperformed within the entire vegetative stage under SRI dependingupon the rainfall pattern of that year. In contrast, CVN plots had nosuch AWD cycles and were continuously ﬂooded throughout thevegetative phase. Redox potential (Eh) of the soil is an essential factorfor the production of CH 4in agricultural ﬁelds. Flooding reducesthe Eh of the soils of rice ﬁelds. The redox potential of the soil for thegeneration of CH 4emission in the rice ﬁelds is between −100 and−200 mV ( Yagi and Minami, 1990 ). In the present study, the Eh of theCVNﬁeld plots submerged under water was around −150 mV, whichis optimum for the initiation of CH 4production. In addition, the soilof the present study site was between 6.4 and 7.8 that helps in theemission process of CH 4from the rice ﬁeld under CVN. Frequentdrainage under SRI cultivation exposed the upper surface of SRI ﬁeldplots, and minimized the optimum soil conditions for CH 4production.The penetration of oxygen to the soil facilitates the decomposition oforganic matter with subsequent oxidation of CH 4(Zhang et al., 2012 ;Kim et al., 2014 ). Hence, reduced CH 4production was observed in theSRI and ZTL ﬁeld plots. After panicle initiation to harvest, all cultivationpractices had the same irrigation management (1 –2c m ,w a t e rd e p t h ) .The data gathered from GHG analyzer placed in the ﬁeld showed apeak in CH 4production during S3 stage in all cultivation practices.However, the peaks for SRI and ZTL cultivations did not surpass thepeak showed by CVN cultivation. In addition, ZTL is a conservation farm-ing approach without tillage. The soil was left undisturbed, resulting in amuch higher bulk density. Increasing bulk density decreases the volumeFig. 3. Carbon-equivalent emissions (t CO 2–eq ha−1) from rice ﬁelds under three methods of cultivation (CVN- Conventional cultivation, SRI –System of rice intensi ﬁcation, ZTL –Zerotillage) for four rice varieties (viz. var. MTU 1010, var. IET 4786, var. IET 17430, var. IET 9947) during Rabi rice growth season ( Fig. 3 a-CVN and Fig. 3 b-SRI) and Kharif rice growth season(Fig. 3 c-CVN, Fig. 3 d-SRI, Fig. 3 e-ZTL. Each box plot shows the data distribution, mean and median value, data distribution curve, standard error, and box range.S. Gangopadhyay, R. Banerjee, S. Batabyal et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –10497fraction of large pores ( Kim et al., 2014 ). The above observations areconsistent with various other studies ( Cai et al., 1997 ;Bronson et al.,1997 ;Oo et al., 2018 ).In paddy ﬁelds, there is always a trade-off between CH 4production and N 2Op r o d u c t i o n( Liu et al., 2010 ;Zschornack et al.,2016 ;Zhou et al., 2018 ). N 2Oi sap r o d u c to fd e n i t r i ﬁcation inanaerobic environments, while nitri ﬁcation occurs in aerobic soils(Ball et al., 1999 ). Drainage converts soil conditions to aerobic, whichpromotes N 2O production ( Granli and Bockman, 1994 ;Zheng et al.,2000 ). Flooded plots are reported to encourage nitri ﬁcation anddenitri ﬁcation ( Abao et al., 2000 ). Therefore, in the CVN plots, the com-bination of the two mechanisms (denitri ﬁcation and nitri ﬁcation) led toa reduced N 2O emission. In the present study, ZTL shows the highestN2O emission among the three cultivation methods. This is consistentwith the observation of Ball et al. (1999) andVinten et al. (2002) . TheGWPs for CH 4and N 2O calculated by Oo et al. (2018) concerning anIndian scenario were consistent with the available results of this study.4.3. Carbon sequestrationTotal carbon sequestration (t CO 2-eq ha−1) was highest under SRI,followed by ZTL and CVN cultivation. The total carbon sequestrationby rice ﬁelds ranged between 12.58 and 49.51 t CO 2-eq ha−1,b e t w e e n27.46 and 96.19 t CO 2-eq ha−1, and between 38.84 and 62.02 t CO 2-eqha−1under CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivation respectively. A signi ﬁcantdifference was found for the total carbon equivalent sequestration(t CO 2-eq ha−1) in all three cultivation practices throughout the studyperiod, regardless of rice growing season and rice varieties (p < 0.05),Fig. 4 . During the study period, all three rice cultivation practices, viz.SRI, CVN, ZTL acted as a pool for greenhouse gases (i.e., sequestration> emission), although the size of the pool varied with different cultiva-tion techniques (p < 0.05).Carbon sequestration is in ﬂuenced by the number of componentssuch as above and below-ground biomass, carbon content, carbon diox-ide emission, and grain yield (Eqs. (10) –(13)). Sequestration ability ofthe selected varieties involves a signi ﬁcant variation of the componentsdescribed above. In Rabi season, no variation was observed in shootbiomass among the varieties in the CVN cultivation, whereas in SRI,higher shoot biomass was observed in the var. IET 9947 in 2018.However, the shoot biomass was almost the same for all the varietiesin 2019 and 2020. In CVN cultivation, the root biomass showed no sig-niﬁcant difference among the varieties throughout the period of study.However, in the SRI cultivation, the var. IET 9947showed higher rootbiomass in each year among other types. In the Kharif season, the higherroot biomass was observed in var. IET 9947 in 2018 only. Later, for2019 –2020, higher shoot biomass was observed in IET 17430 in theCVN cultivation. In the SRI cultivation, no such variation was observedamong the varieties. In the ZTL cultivation, higher shoot biomass wasobserved in IET 17430 in 2018. However, the shoot biomass was thesame for all the varieties in 2019 –2020. The root biomass was thesame and higher in IET 17430 and IET 9947 in all the study periods. InSRI cultivation, IET 9947 showed higher root biomass throughout thestudy. In ZTL cultivation, IET 17430 showed higher root biomass in2018 only. No such variation was observed in 2019 –2020.Therefore, it could be said that the SRI dominates over CVN con-cerning root and shoot biomass. It was observed that var. IET 9947,var., and IET 17430 dominated SRI cultivation during Rabi and Kharifseasons, respectively.There is strong evidence that the carbon density in rice soils is higherthan in upland soils. This implies that rice ﬁelds have signi ﬁcant carbonsequestration potential ( Xie et al., 2007a, b ). Under the anaerobic soilconditions of CVN paddy ﬁelds, organic matter degradation andremineralization of native SOC activity were lower than in aerobic soilconditions of SRI and ZTL soils ( Witt et al., 2000 ;Liping and Erda,2001 ). Therefore, the carbon removal process rate was low in the CVNplots. The formation of humus constituent passive pools of SOC ismaximized under partially oxidizing conditions ( Post et al., 2004 ).Abundant oxygen promotes mineralization, and the process slowswith reduced oxygen conditions. AWD management under SRI andZTL practices provides optimal soil conditions that are neither toooxidized nor too reduced. Such conditions favour the occurrence of anoxidative polymerization reaction that stabilizes carbon ( Post et al.,2004 ). The results of the present study showed that the SRI had thehighest carbon sequestration potential throughout the study period.The increase in the carbon sequestration in the SRI ﬁeld plots was in-ferred at the time of the harvest (S4 stage) of the third-year study(0.76 ± 0.07 %), when compared to the baseline study at the start ofthe experiment at ﬁrst year (0.52 ± 0.05 %), (p < 0.05). The increasewas not signi ﬁcant enough for CVN and ZTL (p > 0.05). Hence, it couldbe said that if SRI practice is continued long-term, the organic carbonpool increase could be expected. Rajkishore (2013) advocated that thesoil of the SRI cultivation practices retains more signi ﬁcant proportionsof passive pools of soil carbon such as humic acid, and fulvic acid .Theaddition of vermicompost and cow dung manure to the SRI ﬁeld plotsresulted in an increase in organic car bon stock and increased soil carbonsequestration. This slight increase in the soil organic carbon (SOC) stockprovided reduced atmospheric carbon concentration conditions.Additionally, incompletely decomposed organic compounds build up inpaddy soils, increasing the amount of carbon with organic amendments(Sahrawat, 2010 ). According to Urmi et al. (2022) , animal manure ismore successful in constructing SOC because it contains more humi ﬁedand resistant carbon forms and is less susceptible to microbial degrada-tion. However, the conditions in the CVN and ZTL ﬁeld plots were differ-ent. The addition of NPK fertilizers did not show such an increase incarbon content in the ﬁelds. The estimation of carbon sequestration in-volved several factors such as carbon content in aboveground and below-ground biomass, gain yield, etc. These factors were superior under SRIthan under CVN and ZTL cultivation. Rahman et al. (2022) treated ricesoils with organic manures such as cow dung, vermicompost, and poultrymanure and showed enhanced carbon sequestration potential and carboncontent in the soil. The present study is in accord with the above ﬁndings.4.4. Carbon indicesThere was a signi ﬁcant difference in CF, CS, and CER between the cul-tivation methods and the four rice varieties (p < 0.05). During the Rabiseason, the CF was 2.30 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ± 0.02 for CVN and SRI, respec-tively. The was 3.96 ± 0.24 and 14.88 ± 0.86, and CER was 0.45 ± 0.02and1.73 ± 0.16 in the CVN and SRI cultivations, respectively ( Fig. 5 ).Likewise, the values did not differ much in the Kharif season. The CFwas 2.02 ± 0.04, 0.62 ± 0.01 and 1.45 ± 0.04 for CVN, SRI and ZTL,respectively. The CS and CER values were 5.77 ± 0.28, 11.89 ± 0.37and 10.63 ± 0.68; and 0.54 ± 0.05, 1.67 ± 0.13 and 0.85 ± 0.09 inthe CVN, SRI and ZTL cultivations respectively ( Fig. 6 ). The resultswere following the works of other authors ( Pathak et al., 2010 ;Faraget al., 2013 ;Yan et al., 2015 ). Experiments conducted on ﬂooded riceﬁelds in China showed different average values of CF, such as 0.37(Cheng et al., 2015 ), 1.60 ( Zhang et al., 2017 ) and 0.80 ( Yan et al.,2015 ).Farag et al. (2013) reported a value 1.90 in the rice ﬁelds ofEgypt, which is relatively closer to the present research.The carbon footprint is essentially the ratio of total agricultural emis-sions and rice grain yields. SRI showed the highest grain yields amongthe three rice cultivation methods, followed by CVN and ZTL. CVN culti-vation contributed to maximum CF throughout the study period,followed by CTL and SRI. The lower CF cultivation would be the morepromising and cost-effective crop technique for rice. Thus, SRI cultiva-tion could be the better candidate among all cultivation types. Thiscould be explained through the total emission from the SRI and thegrain yield by dint of the active tillers in the SRI ﬁeld plots. Comparedto CVN and ZTL, the GHG emission was less in the SRI ﬁeld plots. Theaboveground biomass was more due to more plant-plant spacing andefﬁcient procurement of nutrients by the rice plant of SRI ﬁeld plots,S. Gangopadhyay, R. Banerjee, S. Batabyal et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –10498resulting in more active tillers and yield. The nutrient competition wasmore in CVN and ZTL plots due to less plant-plant spacing and, thus,caused the lesser number of active tillers and grain yield.SRI showed the highest CS score, followed by ZTL and CVN through-out the study. Emissions from farms were highest for CVN, moderate forSRI and lowest for ZTL. Since there was a more signi ﬁcant difference be-tween the carbon output values and the carbon input values in the SRIﬁeld plots, it can be said that the SRI might be the more sustainablerice cultivation practice. The present study observed that both SRI andZTL cultivation had higher CER values due to their higher grain yieldin terms of carbon dioxide equivalent emission (CO 2equivalent). Thiscondition was reversed in the case of CVN cultivation. Therefore, theSRI and the ZTL could be effective alternatives to reduce CH 4and N 2Oemissions. It was observed that the var. IET 17430 showed the lowestCF and highest CER values among CVN and SRI cultivation. And thevar. IET 9947 showed the highest CS values. Hence var. IET 17430 wasthe most suitable variety in terms of lower carbon emissions and riceproduction per unit in this region, but not as sustainable as the var.IET 9947. The var. IET 17430 with the lowest CF values and highest CSshowed lower carbon emission and highest sustainability, but the var.IET 9947, with the highest CER values, showed better grain productionper unit. The CF, CS and CER under different rice cultivation practices(CVN, SRI, and ZTL) during Rabi and Kharif season are presented in theTable S7 and S8.4.5. Rice grain yield, aboveground and belowground biomassThere was a signi ﬁcant difference in grain yield (t ha−1) among thecultivation practices for all the crop cycles throughout the study period(p < 0.05). SRI showed superior grain yield (t ha−1) than CVN cultiva-tion under the Rabi season. The average grain yield during the Rabiseason ranged from 4.57 to 18.52 t ha−1and from 3.01 to 8.95 t ha−1for SRI and CVN, respectively. During the Kharif season, SRI showedthe highest grain yield, followed by CVN and ZTL. The average grainyield during the Kharif season ranged from 6.75 to 19.06 t ha−1, from3.00 to 12.43 t ha−1and from 1.81 to 12.25 t ha−1for SRI, CVN andZTL, respectively. During the Rabi season, there was a signi ﬁcant differ-ence in grain yield among four rice cultivars that are considered in thepresent study (p < 0.05) (Table S9).Fig. 4.

Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –10499It was observed from Table S10 and Table S11, that there was a sig-niﬁcant difference in both root and shoot biomass (t ha−1) among thecultivation practices during the Rabi and Kharif seasons. A general pat-tern was observed where both shoot and root biomass remained higherunder SRI cultivation than CVN during Rabi and CVN and ZTL during theKharif season. The average shoot biomass during the study periodranges from 3.95 to 14.88 t ha−1, from 8.52 to 19.46 t ha−1and from5.10 to 14.50 t ha−1under CVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively. Similarly,the root biomass ranges between 1.20 and 9.20 t ha−1,b e t w e e n2.83 and 13.05 t ha−1and between 0.90 and 8.60 t ha−1underCVN, SRI and ZTL, respectively. A signi ﬁcant difference among varieties(p < 0.05) was observed during the major part of the study period.

Batabyal et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 34 (2022) 90 –1041004.6. The carbon balance between ecosystem service and disserviceCarbon sequestration, an exceptional ecosystem service rendered bythe rice ﬁelds, was observed to be highest under SRI, followed by ZTLand CVN cultivation (p < 0.05). However, in terms of money, whenthe balance between carbon sequestration (service) and total GHGemission from rice ﬁelds (disservice) was analyzed, it was found thatthe values were higher for CVN followed by SRI and ZTL cultivation(p < 0.05), ( Table 3 ). There was no statistically signi ﬁcant differencebetween SRI and ZTL, but both cultivations showed a substantial dif-ference with CVN (p < 0.05).The production cost of rice under three cultivations in the presentstudy included all the farm operations per hectare of lands, such as fer-tilizer requirement, seed requirement, herbicide application, fuel con-sumption, irrigation and farm labour (men or women) involved in thefarm operations. And the yield of rice and straw through marketing(price per hectare) was considered a pro ﬁt by the farmers (Table S13).The results of the three-year study showed that in the CVN cultivation,either there was 2 % loss or gain throughout the study during Rabi andKharif seasons. However, the average gain throughout the study wasaround 42 % in the SRI cultivation. In the ZTL cultivation, the averagegain was four times compared to the cost of expenditure. Hence, itcould be concluded that the highest return (in terms of money) by thefarmer could be achieved if they adopt the ZTL cultivation. The remark-able difference between ZTL and CVN happened due to the process ofcultivation through zero-tillage machines which involved no labourinput and irrigation management. The two cost prices were extremelylow for ZTL cultivation. However, in terms of soil health, it could be det-rimental as chemical fertilizer was used during the cultivation. More-over, SRI cultivation also showed a pro ﬁt in terms of economy. Hence,the SRI could be a promising solution to promote sustainable agricultureand mitigation of GHGs.The Swedish carbon tax is an internationally recognized measure incalculating the ecosystem service values of carbon sequestration of thericeﬁeld ecosystems ( Jiang et al., 2019 ;Chen et al., 2020 ). In the presentcontext, the Indian carbon tax is considered more appropriate whenestimating ecosystem services and disservices ( Table 3 ).Arunrat et al.(2022) e m p l o y e dt h eS w e d i s hc a r b o nt a xt oe s t i m a t et h ev a l u eo fe c o s y s -tem service provided by carbon sequestration in rice ﬁelds. Theyobserved that the value of carbon sequestration ecosystem services in or-ganic farming was twofold higher than in conventional rice farming prac-tice. Evaluation of ecosystem disservice from an Indian perspective usingthe Indian carbon tax was made by Rasheed et al. (2021) . The resultsshowed the economic value of the penalty rendered due to GHG emissionwas 16 US$ ha−1yr−1. This is in line with the results of the present study.In ZTL techniques, the rice varieties var. IET 17430 > var. IET 9947 >var. IET 4786 > var. MTU 1010 was observed in decreasing order ofreturns per unit cost. In contrast, following the SRI technique, the ricevarieties were var. IET 9947 > var. IET 17430 > var. IET 4786 > var.MTU 1010 in decreasing order of returns per unit cost. As a result,among the four rice varieties studied in this study, IET 17430 and IET9947 are the only rice types cultivated under SRI and CVN.4.7. Limitations and implicationsIn this study, GHG emissions were measured three times a day, andaverage emissions per day were presented throughout the study period.However, the GHG emissions at midnight were not included in thestudy, leading to uncertainties in estimating GHG emissions from thericeﬁelds. In addition, the three cropping styles in the RCBD patternwere practised in the experimental ﬁeld plots with similar soil typesand textures. If the ZTL practice is done in the water-de ﬁcient regionsof other parts of India, the results may differ from the present results.The rice varieties selected in the present study are widely accepted byfarmers and have a good market value in this region. However, GHGemissions from other varieties (from other areas) are not tested andmay produce different results. The data on transporting the raw mate-rials to the rice mills and the post-harvest work were not included inthe present study. It is expected that such a post-harvest operationwould somewhat affect the total GHG emissions from operations ofthe procedures. This, in turn, underestimates the impact of the entireproduction and marketing chain on the carbon footprint and ecosystemservices of C sequestration. On the other hand, agricultural inputs can bedetermined by future technical innovations, policy improvements andeconomic developments, which could lead to signi ﬁcant uncertaintiesin the estimated GHG emissions.Carbon emissions and carbon sequestration affect the net carbonbalance of agroecosystems. Farming operations were identi ﬁed in thisstudy as the primary regulator of carbon balance in ﬁeld plots. Theintroduction of appropriate rice varieties and cultivation practices canbalance increasing net carbon ﬁxation in rice biomass and reducingcarbon emissions. Using organic manure in SRI cultivation can increasecarbon input from rice biomass and SOC sequestration. Using fertilizersin conjunction with proper irrigation management techniques in ZTLcultivation can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions from riceﬁelds. This supports the conclusion that improved water management,tillage, and fertilizer application are critical strategies to achieve atrade-off between lowering carbon emissions and increasing net carbonsinks in rice agro-ecosystems.5. ConclusionsThe present study compares the contribution of different farm oper-ations to net carbon equivalent emissions under CVN, SRI and ZTL culti-vation practices. The highest contributor to GWP among all threecultivation was fertilizer application. The GWP for CH4and N 2Ow a sfound to be higher in the CVN and ZTL plots, respectively. However,the present showed gains in all the crop cycles examined for all the cul-tivation practices as well as the varieties, and higher sequestrationlevels were achieved for the SRI cultivation. Hence, it could be saidthat the ecosystem service rendered by total carbon sequestration inthe rice ﬁeld soils was always more signi ﬁcant than the total carbonemission due to rice cultivation. In the tropical climate, rice cultivationis practised in both the upland areas and the lowland areas. Hence, sus-tainable agriculture could be promoted by applying organic manure inthe context of SRI cultivation in the water-de ﬁcient zones and ZTL culti-vation in the tropical upland zones, where such cultivation has not yetstarted. These cultivation techniques should be encouraged amongfarmers as they are cheaper, have low carbon costs and are cleaner interms of GHG emissions. The var. IET 4786 and var. IET17430 could bepromoted under CVN and ZTL cultivation practices, respectively. IET9947 and var. IET 17430 could be announced as part of SRI cultivationin this region.Table 3Evaluation of carbon sequestration (service) and carbon emission (disservice) of farm emissions under Conventional (CVN), System of Rice Intensi ﬁcation (SRI) and Zero-Tillage (ZTL)cultivations during Rabi (sowing: January –February; harvest: March –April) and Kharif (sowing: July –August; harvest: October –November) seasons.Rabi season Kharif seasonCVN SRI CVN SRI ZTLEcosystem service (US$ ha−1) 468.66 ± 21.41 1500.04 ± 101.75 853.62 ± 49.91 1502.24 ± 51.28 1173.40 ± 28.09Ecosystem disservice (US$ ha−1) 43.54 ± 0.47 31.95 ± 0.34 46.68 ± 1.23 30.59 ± 0.56 24.35 ± 0.23S.
