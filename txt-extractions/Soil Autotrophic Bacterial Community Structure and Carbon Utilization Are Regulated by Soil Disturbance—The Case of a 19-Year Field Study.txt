Carbon dioxide (CO 2) Ô¨Åxation byautotrophic bacteria is a principal factor in soil carbon cycles. However, the information is limited tohow conservation tillage practices alter soil physiochemical properties, autotrophic bacterial com-munities, and microbial catabolic diversity. In this study, we determined the changes in autotrophicbacterial communities and carbon substrate utilization in response to different soil managementpractices. A replicated Ô¨Åeld study was established in 2001, with the following soil treatments arrangedin a randomized complete block: conventional tillage with crop residue removed (T), conventionaltillage with residue incorporated into the soil (TS), no tillage with crop residue removed (NT), and notillage with residue remaining on the soil surface (NTS). Soils were sampled in 2019 and microbialDNA was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. After the 19-year (2001‚Äì2019) treatments,the soils with conservation tillage (NTS and NT) increased the soil‚Äôs microbial biomass carbon by13%, organic carbon by 5%, and total nitrogen by 16% compared to conventional tillage (T and TS).The NTS treatment increased the abundance of the cbbL gene by 53% in the soil compared with theother soil treatments. The cbbL -carrying bacterial community was mainly afÔ¨Åliated with the phylumProteobacteria and Actinobacteria , accounting for 56‚Äì85% of the community. Retaining crop residuein the Ô¨Åeld (NTS and TS) enhanced community-level physiological proÔ¨Åles by 31% and carbonsubstrate utilization by 32% compared to those without residue retention (T and NT). The 19 years ofsoil management lead to the conclusion that minimal soil disturbance, coupled with crop residueretention, shaped autotrophic bacterial phylogenetics, modiÔ¨Åed soil physicochemical properties, andcreated a microenvironment that favored CO 2-Ô¨Åxing activity and increased soil productivity.Keywords: carbon Ô¨Åxation; cbbL gene abundance; cbbL -harboring bacteria; carbon substrateutilization; soil management1. IntroductionSoil microbial communities serve as the reservoir of biological processes and playa critical role in converting organic carbon into plant nutrients [ 1,2]. It is estimated thatapproximately 80 to 90% of the soil biogeochemical processes are mediated by microbialactivities, including organic carbon degradation [ 3]. An essential biosynthetic processin soil is carbon dioxide (CO 2) Ô¨Åxation by autotrophic bacteria, a key process of carboncycling [ 4] which is responsible for the sequestration of atmospheric CO 2into the soil [ 5].In agroecosystems, autotrophic CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacteria are present in various types, includ-ing distinct physiological groups, such as cyanobacteria and purple photosynthetic andchemoautotrophic bacteria [ 6]. The groups of bacteria can incorporate14C into their mi-crobial biomass through a series of biochemical reactions [ 7,8]. Those reactions are relatedAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12091415 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agricultureAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 2 of 18to the community composition of autotrophic bacteria [ 9], inÔ¨Çuencing the intensity ofCO 2Ô¨Åxation.The Calvin‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham cycle (i.e., the CBB cycle) is the most important au-totrophic CO 2Ô¨Åxation pathway [ 10,11] which inÔ¨Çuences the primary carbon source in anecosystem [ 12]. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (known as RubisCO), akey enzyme in the CBB cycle, regulates the process of CO 2reduction and the oxygenolysisof ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate [ 10,11]. RubisCO exists in four forms (referred as I, II, III, andIV) with different structures, catalytic activities, and O 2sensitivities, of which form I‚ÄôsRubisCO mainly occurs in plant and photo- and chemo-autotrophic bacteria [ 13,14]. In theplant‚Äìsoil‚Äìmicrobiome environment, autotrophic microbial diversity can be reÔ¨Çected bythe functional biomarkers (i.e., the cbbL genes). These genes encode the large subunit ofRubisCO form I that has a large scale of sequences for phylogenetic analysis [15,16].Many anthropogenic activities, such as tillage and crop rotation, affect the compositionand diversity of the microbial community in soil [ 17,18]. Soil tillage affects soil waterconservation [ 19], fertility enrichment [ 20], and carbon sequestration [ 21,22]. Reduced orzero tillage (i.e., minimal to no disturbance to the soil proÔ¨Åle) coupled with crop residueretention can increase the nutrient supply potential [ 23] and enhance carbon cycling [ 24]while decreasing the carbon footprint [ 25,26], which helps alleviate the challenge of globalclimate change [ 27]. DiversiÔ¨Åed crop rotation increases soil carbon [ 28,29], improvesmicrobial diversity [ 30], and enhances the system‚Äôs productivity and resiliency. However,little is known about the long-term impact of multiple years of soil tillage and cereal‚Äìlegume alternate rotation on the function of autotrophic CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacteria. It is unclearhow the nexus of autotrophic bacterial community composition‚ÄîCO 2Ô¨Åxation‚Äîtillagepractices impact soil microenvironments.To elucidate those effects, we established the Ô¨Åeld experiment in 2001 on the westernLoess Plateau of China. Different tillage treatments have since been applied to soil that has acereal‚Äìlegume crop rotation system. After the 19-year treatments (in 2019), soil was sampledfrom each plot in three replicates and analyzed for its biophysiochemical properties. Theabundance and community composition of autotrophic CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacterial communitieswere analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Soilcarbon substrate utilization and its relation to autotrophic bacterial community were alsodetermined. In a previous paper [ 31], we reported the diversity of bacterial communitiesand the characterization of the phylogenic composition in relation to soil management.In the present paper, we present the Ô¨Åndings on (1) the changes in soil physicochemicalparameters, autotrophic bacterial community composition, and soil catabolic diversity inresponse to the 19-year tillage treatments, and (2) the possible mechanisms responsible forshifts in the soil‚Äôs autotrophic bacterial communities in relation to tillage. These Ô¨Åndingsfrom the long-term Ô¨Åeld study bring us to a new level of understanding of the interactionamong autotrophic bacterial community, carbon Ô¨Åxation, and soil management practices.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Site DescriptionA Ô¨Åeld experiment was started in 2001 at the Rainfed Agricultural Education Center(35280N, 104440E; 1971 m a.s.l.) of Gansu Agricultural University in China. The site is onthe western Loess Plateau and has a temperate, semiarid, continental monsoon climate [ 32].Its solar radiation is 5.68 KJ m 2and sunshine duration is 2476 h annually [ 33]. Themean temperature is 6.5C and the 10C-based accumulative temperature is 2339C. Theaverage precipitation was 392 mm per year, with 54% occurring from June to Septemberin most years. The experimental plots were on level terrain with dark loessal CalcaricCambisol soil (FAO/UNESCO soil classiÔ¨Åcation system, 1990). Prior to the start of theexperiment in 2001, the site had a long history of the continuous cropping of Ô¨Çax ( Linumusitatissimum L.) under conventional tillage practices [34].Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 3 of 182.2. Experimental DesignA randomized complete block design was used to accommodate the four soil man-agement treatments in each of the three replicates. The description of the treatments andthe implementation of the tillage practices and crop residue retention are summarized inTable 1. More details on the tillage and Ô¨Åeld operations of the treatments can be viewedin a previous publication [ 34]. In brief, all the treatments were implemented in both thewheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and Ô¨Åeld pea ( Pisum arvense L.) phases of the rotation eachyear. For the TS and T treatments, the soil was plowed to a depth of 0.20 m in the fall andharrowed in the following spring‚Äôs seeding time. The experiment included four tillageand crop residue management treatments per spring. In each of the three replicates, thefollowing treatments were arranged in plot sizes of 80 m2(4 m wide20 m long). Thecrops were managed according to the recommended agronomic practices. The crops wereplanted in late March to early April, varying slightly from one year to the other due toweather conditions. The seeding rate was 187.5 kg ha 1for wheat and 180 kg ha 1forpea, on average, varying slightly each year due to seed size and percent germination. Theseeding rates were aimed to achieve a plant population of 250 plants per m 2for wheatand 80 plants per m 2for Ô¨Åeld pea. The wheat was fertilized with urea nitrogen (46% N) at105 kg N ha 1and the pea at 20 kg N ha 1. Both crops received a phosphorus fertilizer(Ca(H 2PO4)2.2H 2O, with 16% P 2O5) at 46 kg P 2O5ha 1. The fertilizers were broadcastat sowing. No potassium (K) was applied as the soil contained exchangeable K greaterthan 300 mg kg 1. No herbicides were applied to any crop because of the dry weather andlittle weed pressure. No irrigation was applied. At maturity (usually in mid-July to earlyAugust), the entire plot was harvested using a plot harvester and the biomass and yieldswere recorded.Table 1.

Soil Sampling and Physicochemical Property MeasurementBulk soils were sampled in June 2019 when pea plants were at the mid-Ô¨Çowering stageand wheat plants were at the late stage of Ô¨Çowering. During Ô¨Çowering, crop plants aremost active, with roots interacting with soil microbes under semiarid environments [35,36] .Sampling at this stage can provide researchers with invaluable information about rhizo-spheres and their interactions with environmental factors [ 37]. From each plot, Ô¨Åve soilsamples were randomly taken from a 0 to 0.2 m depth using a 50 mm diameter iron soilcorer, and the Ô¨Åve samples were bulked for each plot. After passing through a 2 mm meshsieve, two subsamples were taken from each plot: one was for DNA extraction and carbonsubstrate utilization assessment and the other was for soil property analysis.The soil pH was determined with a pH meter (Mettler Toledo FE20, Shanghai, China)using a deionized suspension with 1:2.5 soil: water ratio (mass: volume). Soil organiccarbon (SOC) was analyzed using the Walkley‚ÄìBlack wet oxidation method and total N(TN) was measured with the Kjeldahl method. Olsen phosphorus was examined usingthe colorimetric method with 0.5 M NaHCO 3. A UV-1800 spectrophotometer (MapadaAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 4 of 18Instruments, Shanghai, China) was used to determine soil NH 4+-N and NO 3 -N. Soilmicrobial biomass carbon and nitrogen (SMBC and SMBN, respectively) were measuredusing the Chloroform method. In each plot, soil moisture was measured gravimetricallyand converted into volumetric water content using soil bulk density, which was measuredby sampling the intact core of the soil using known-volume metal rings, drying the soil,and weighing the dried soil.2.4. Soil Microbial Catabolic DiversityFor each soil sample from each plot (i.e., three replicates), community-level physiolog-ical proÔ¨Åles (CLPP) were determined using Biolog Eco-PlatesTM (Biolog Inc., Hayward,CA, USA) which contained 31 widely used Csubstrates along with a control well. The 31 Csources included nine carboxylic acids, seven carbohydrates, three other substrates, sixamino acids, and two amines/amides [ 38]. Each well of the Eco-plates was inoculated with150L of soil suspensions before being incubated at 25C. The carbon substrate utilizationbased on well color development was measured with optical density (OD) values at awavelength of 590 nm (color development plus turbidity) and 750 nm (turbidity only) every24 h for 7 d using the Biolog method (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). Average well-colordevelopment (AWCD) was used to assess the microbial metabolic activity, as follows [39]:AWCD =√•C R31,where Cis the OD value of each well and Ris the absorbance reading of the controlwell. Substrate richness and evenness, deÔ¨Åned as the Shannon‚ÄìWeaver index ( H‚Äô), werecalculated as follows:H0= √•i=npi(lnp i),where pirepresents the ratio of color development of a certain well to the sum of the colordevelopment of all wells in a micro-plate.2.5. DNA Extraction and QuantiÔ¨Åcation of cbbL Gene AbundanceSoil microbial DNA was extracted from each approximately 0.5 g of fresh soil sample,in triplicate, using a DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Hilden, Germany ) following themanufacturer‚Äôs protocol. The concentrations of the extracted DNA were determined witha NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc, Waltham, MA, USA)and the quality of the extracted DNA was determined using agarose gel electrophoresis.The cbbL gene copy number was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) ona LightCycler 480 II real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). ThecbbL genes were ampliÔ¨Åed with the forward primer K2f (50-ACCAYCAAGCCSAAGCTSGG-30) and the reverse primer V2r (50-GCCTTCSAGCTTGCCSACCRC-30) (reference). Thereaction mixture contained 1 L of DNA template, 5 L of 2LightCycler¬Æ480 SYBRGreen I Master, 0.2 L of forward primer, 0.2 L of reverse primer, and 3.6 L of nuclease-free water, and it made up a Ô¨Ånal volume of 10 L. The thermal protocol was 10 min ofincubation at 95C, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95C and 30 s at 60C. Melting curveanalysis was performed to validate the speciÔ¨Åcity of the ampliÔ¨Åed PCR products. Thestandard curves were produced using triplicate 10-fold dilutions of plasmid DNA withinserted cbbL gene. PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation efÔ¨Åciencies were 94% with an R2value of 0.99.2.6. High-Throughput Sequencing of the cbbL GeneThe primer set (K2f-V2r) for cbbL gene real-time qPCR was used for the cbbL geneampliÔ¨Åcation for each sample, respectively. The PCR components contained 5 L ofQ5 reaction buffer (5 ), 5L of Q5 High-Fidelity GC buffer (5 ), 0.25 L of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (5 U/ L), 2 L (2.5 mM) of dNTPs, 1 L (10 uM) of eachforward and reverse primer, 2 L of DNA template, and 8.75 L of ddH 2O. The PCRs wereperformed with the following procedures: 2 min of initial denaturation at 98C, followedby 25 cycles of 15 s at 98C, 30 s for annealing at 55C, 30 s for elongation at 72C, andAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 5 of 18a Ô¨Ånal extension at 72C for 5 min. PCR amplicons were extracted from 1% agarose gelsand puriÔ¨Åed with Agencourt AMpure beads (Beckham Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA)and quantiÔ¨Åed using the PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).High-throughput sequencing data were obtained through commercial laboratory services(Personal Biotechnology Co., Shanghai, China) and deposited in the NCBI database withaccession PRJNA689959.2.7. Data Processing and Bioinformatics AnalysisRaw fastq Ô¨Åles were quality-Ô¨Åltered and merged using VSEARCH pipeline (version2.13.4) on the platform of QIIME 2. The sequences with a quality score <20, having am-biguous bases, or those containing mononucleotides repeats of >8 bp were removed. Theoperational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered with a 97% sequence similarity cut-offusing VSEARCH pipeline (v. 2.13.4). All representative reads in the OTUs were taxo-nomically classiÔ¨Åed and annotated based on the GenBank¬Ænucleotide sequence database(http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; accessed on 15 March 2020).2.8. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). SigniÔ¨Åcantdifferences between treatments in soil properties, cbbL gene abundance, and catabolicdiversity were determined at the probability of <0.05.The QIIME2 package was employed to determine alpha diversity, and the communityevenness and richness were expressed using the Shannon and Simpson indexes. Thevariation of cbbL -harboring bacterial community composition across the samples wasdetermined using principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the genus-level com-positional proÔ¨Åles. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed with the unweightedpair-group method of arithmetic means (UPGMA) based on Bray‚ÄìCurtis distance matrices.The differences in the taxonomic and phylogenetic communities were compared by cluster-ing them using the R ‚Äú vegan ‚Äù package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,Austria). The signiÔ¨Åcant differences in microbial structure among treatments was deter-mined by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and analysis ofsimilarities (ANOSIM).Network analysis was performed to investigate the co-occurrence patterns among thecbbL -harboring bacterial communities. The OTUs with a relative abundance of higher than0.01% were retained and the ‚Äú psych ‚Äù package of R version 4.0.2 was used to analyze thepreprocessed data and calculate the spearman correlation coefÔ¨Åcient matrix. Statistical cor-relations with a cut-off at an absolute rvalue of higher than 0.6 and a pvalue of lower than0.05 were retained for further analysis. The software Gephi (version 0.9.2) was employedfor network visualization and network properties measurement. To identify the keystonebacterial taxa driving community turnover under different treatments, the abundanceof bacterial taxonomic OTUs was regressed against the four Ô¨Åeld treatments based onrandom forest classiÔ¨Åcation analysis using the ‚Äú randomForest ‚Äù package of R version 4.0.2.Lists of biomarkers taxa were ranked to compare the importance of OTUs using 10-foldcross-validation, implemented using R ‚Äò rfcv‚Äô function. The top 15 bacterial biomarkers werechosen according to the stabilized cross-validation error curve. The relative abundance ofbiomarker taxa was illustrated using the ‚Äú heatmap ‚Äù package of R version 4.0.2. The Spear-man‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcients and the Mantel test with 999 permutations in the ‚Äú vegan ‚Äùpackage of R were used to assess the correlations of soil properties and the distribution ofthe dominant genera of cbbL -harboring bacteria based on the distance matrix.3. Results3.1. Soil Physiochemical and Biological PropertiesThe soil‚Äôs biophysiochemical properties signiÔ¨Åcantly differed between treatments(Table 2). The contents of SOC, TN, TK, SMBC, and SMBN were signiÔ¨Åcantly greater forthe NT and NTS treatments compared to the T and TS treatments ( p< 0.05). Soil organicAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 6 of 18carbon was 3.2%, 13.4%, and 6.1% greater for the NT, NTS, and TS treatments, respectively,compared with the T treatment. The highest soil TN concentration ( 1.07 g kg 1) wasobtained in the NTS soil. The TK for the NTS treatment was 10.9% ( p< 0.05) greater thanthat for the NT, TS, and T treatments. The soil‚Äôs bulk density was 4.6%, 9.2%, and 6.1%lower for the NT, NTS, and TS treatments, respectively, compared with the T treatment.The NT, NTS, and TS treatments increased SMBC by 12.6%, 31.8%, and 17.0%, respectively,compared to the T treatment. In addition, SMBN for the NTS treatment was greater(p< 0.05 ) than that for the T treatment ( p< 0.05), with no difference among NT, TS, and T.There was no difference in soil pH, TP , NO 3 -N, NH 4+‚ÄìN, soil temperature, and moistureamong the treatments ( p> 0.05).Table 2.

Autotrophic Bacterial Community Diversity and OTUs RichnessAfter quality control, a total of 468,535 Ô¨Åltered sequences with 32,250 to 43,646 se-quences per sample remained (Table S2). The rarefaction curves were close to the saturationphase with the increase in sample size. There was sufÔ¨Åcient sequencing depth and the OTUsAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 7 of 18were representative of the overall bacterial community libraries. To compare soil carbon Ô¨Åx-ation and microbial community diversity, the same survey effort level of 30,637 sequenceswas randomly selected from each soil sample (95% of the smallest number of reads). Intotal, 4988 OTUs were observed across all samples, with the number of OTUs rangingfrom 503 to 1692, varying with the soil samples (Table S2). The four tillage and cropresidue management treatments shared 451 OTUs, accounting for 9.04% of the core OTUs(Figure 1a). There were differences in the OTU-sharing between treatments: the NTS andNT treatments shared the highest number of OTUs (1107 OTUs, 22.19%), whereas the TSand T treatments shared the least number of OTUs (683 OTUs, 13.69%) and the NTS and Ttreatments shared 18.04% of the OTUs (900 OTUs). Moreover, the NTS treatment harboredthe highest number of unique OTUs (1458 OTUs, 29.23%) and the T treatment harbored thelowest number of unique OTUs (308 OTUs, 6.17%).Agriculture 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 19    Figure 1.

Composition and Networks of Soil Autotrophic Bacteria Communities The composition of the bacterial communities was determined for soils from each of the three field replicates (e.g.,  T1, T2, and T3 for the T trea tments in Figure 2 and Table S4). At the phylum level, the bacterial communities were dominated primarily by the phyla Proteobacteria  (38.52‚Äì80.94%) and Actinobacteria  (5.72‚Äì22.65%), both accounting for an average of 56‚Äì85% of the relative abunda nce of the bacterial communities (Figure 2a; Table S4). The phyla Euryarchaeota  and Cyanobacteria  had low relative abundances. The tillage treatment had a significant ( p < 0.05) impact on the relative abundance of a bacterial community. The relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria  was 34.2, 41.6, and 33.5% lower in the soil under NT, NTS, and TS, respectively, while the relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria  was 158.4, 245.7, and 142.5% higher, respectively, than that meas-ured in the soil under the T treatment.  At the class level, alpha-Proteobacteria  and beta-Proteobacteria  dominated the bacterial communities, containing 14.89‚Äì30.71% and 5.71‚Äì22.65% of the total cbbL  gene sequences, respectively (Figure 2b; Table S4). The class Rubrobacteria  was the most dominant within the phylum Actinobacteria , which accounted for 0.57‚Äì4.00% of  the total relative abundance. At the genus level, the cbbL -carrying bacteria were mainly affiliated with Bradyrhizobium , Variovorax , Gaiella , and Steroidobacter , accounting for 20‚Äì35% of the identified communities (Figure 2c; Table S4). The tillage treatments had an impact on the community composition, as shown in the top 10 genera; compared to the T treatment, the NTS treatment increased Figure 1.

The treatment descriptions are summarized in Table 1. Thenumbers following the treatment name denote the sampling replications. For example, NT1, NT2,and NT3 mean the soil sampling, respectively, from replicate 1, 2, and 3 of the NT plots.The alpha diversity of bacterial populations differed signiÔ¨Åcantly among soil treat-ments, as shown by the Chao1, Simpson, Shannon, and observed OTUs indexes ( p< 0.05;Figure 1b). The Shannon index for the NTS treatment was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher comparedto the T treatment and the diversity was ranked NTS > NT > TS > T. No differences in theChao1 and observed OTUs indexes were observed among the four treatments ( p> 0.05;Figure 1b). The PCoA results showed similarities and differences in CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacterialcommunity structure across the different treatments (Figure 1c), where total variance ex-Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 8 of 18plained by PCoA1 and PCoA2 was 35.5 and 13.6%, respectively. The bacterial communitiesof the soil under the NT and TS treatments were clustered closely, whereas the communitycompositions in the soil under the NTS and T treatments differed from those of the NTand TS treatments. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) andanalysis of similarities (ANOSIM) conÔ¨Årmed the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the compositionsof the soil cbbL -carrying bacterial communities under different tillage practices and cropresidue managements ( p< 0.05; Table S3).3.4. Composition and Networks of Soil Autotrophic Bacteria CommunitiesThe composition of the bacterial communities was determined for soils from eachof the three Ô¨Åeld replicates (e.g., T1, T2, and T3 for the T treatments in Figure 2 andTable S4). At the phylum level, the bacterial communities were dominated primarily by thephyla Proteobacteria (38.52‚Äì80.94%) and Actinobacteria (5.72‚Äì22.65%), both accounting foran average of 56‚Äì85% of the relative abundance of the bacterial communities (Figure 2a;Table S4). The phyla Euryarchaeota and Cyanobacteria had low relative abundances. Thetillage treatment had a signiÔ¨Åcant ( p< 0.05) impact on the relative abundance of a bacterialcommunity. The relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria was 34.2, 41.6, and 33.5%lower in the soil under NT, NTS, and TS, respectively, while the relative abundance of thephylum Actinobacteria was 158.4, 245.7, and 142.5% higher, respectively, than that measuredin the soil under the T treatment.At the class level, alpha-Proteobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria dominated the bacterialcommunities, containing 14.89‚Äì30.71% and 5.71‚Äì22.65% of the total cbbL gene sequences,respectively (Figure 2b; Table S4). The class Rubrobacteria was the most dominant withinthe phylum Actinobacteria , which accounted for 0.57‚Äì4.00% of the total relative abundance.At the genus level, the cbbL -carrying bacteria were mainly afÔ¨Åliated with Bradyrhizobium ,Variovorax ,Gaiella , and Steroidobacter , accounting for 20‚Äì35% of the identiÔ¨Åed communities(Figure 2c; Table S4). The tillage treatments had an impact on the community composition,as shown in the top 10 genera; compared to the T treatment, the NTS treatment increasedthe relative abundance of genus Bradyrhizobium by 59.3% and reduced the relative abun-dance of genus Variovorax by 60.7%. However, no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the taxonomiccomposition were observed among the NT, TS, and T treatments. The hierarchical clusteranalysis (Figure 2c) had results similar to those obtained from PERMANOVA and ANOSIM(Table S4), where the bacterial communities formed two main clusters (T and TS vs. NTand NTS), and the largest differences were between the NTS and T treatments.Co-occurrence network analyses were conducted to evaluate the different co-occurrencepatterns of the cbbL -harboring bacterial communities under the different treatments(Figure 3). In total, there were 35 nodes and 71 links, with an average degree of 4.057and a graph density of 0.119 in the autotrophic bacterial network (Table S5). The ratio ofpositive edges was higher than the ratio of negative edges in the cbbL -harboring bacterialcommunities, with the ratio of positive edges accounting for 85.92%. The genera Methylo-cella and Advenella were the most connected keystone genera in the cbbL-harboring bacterialcommunities, and both were from the phylum Proteobacteria , with signiÔ¨Åcant correlationswith other genera (Figure 3; Table S5).Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 9 of 18Agriculture 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19   the relative abundance of genus Bradyrhizobium  by 59.3% and reduced the relative abun-dance of genus Variovorax  by 60.7%.

Biomarkers in the Autotrophic Bacterial CommunitiesTo determine the key biomarkers discriminating the cbbL -harboring bacterial commu-nities under different treatments, we performed a regression of the abundances of bacterialOTUs against the tillage treatments based on the random forests machine learning algo-rithm. The top 15 keystone OTUs were chosen as the respective bio-marker taxa becausethe cross-validation error curve was stabilized when using these OTUs for both bacterialcommunities (Figure 4). The biomarker taxa were mainly afÔ¨Åliated with the classes of alpha-Proteobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria in the cbbL -harboring bacterial communities (Table S6).The heatmaps in Figure 4 further illustrate the scaled abundances of these biomarker taxain response to soil tillage management. It was found that the phylum Proteobacteria playedmore crucial roles than the other phyla across soil samples for the soil‚Äôs cbbL -harboringbacterial communities.Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 10 of 18Agriculture 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 19   communities, and both were from the phylum Proteobacteria , with significant correlations with other genera (F igure 3; Table S5)  Figure 3.

Soil Microbial Catabolic Diversity and Carbon Utilization Pattern The soil‚Äôs microbial metabolic activity wa s expressed as the average well-color de-velopment (AWCD), an indicative measurement of the physiological profiles at the com-munity level. The AWCD differed significan tly between the treatments (Table S7). The NTS and TS treatments increased the AWCD in dex by 21.6 and 19.1%, respectively, while the NT treatment reduced the AWCD index by 15.4% in comparison with the T treatment. However, no significant differences for the H‚Äô (Shannon‚ÄìWiener) index were observed among the four treatments.  The soil‚Äôs microbial carbon utilization patterns based on six fundamental groups dif-fered among the treatments (Figure 5a). Compar ed to the T treatment, NT and TS reduced carbon resource utilization based on amines/amides by 63.6 and 35.2%, respectively, while NTS and TS increased carboxylic acid utiliz ation by 37.1 and 44.9%, respectively. The overall carbon utilization capabilities differed significantly among the six carbon substrate groups (Figure 5b). The carbon utilization fo r carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids were significantly higher than that for the polymers, miscellaneous, and amines/am-ides groups. The highest carbon utilization was obtained in the carbohydrates group, with a mean value of 8.808, while the lowest carbon utilization was found in the amines/amides group, with a mean value of 0.815. The carbon utilization capability of soil microbiomes, based on seven specifical sub-strates (L-Arginine, L-Phenylalanine, Œ±-D-Lactose, N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine, D-Manni-tol, D-Malic Acid, and Œ±-Cyclodextrin), differed significantly among the tillage treatments (Figure 5c). The utilization of L-Arginine su bstrate in the TS trea tment was 73.9% higher (p < 0.05) than that in the T treatment. The NTS treatment increased the utilization of L-Phenylalanine substrate by 85.5%, compared with the T treatment ( p < 0.05). The NT treat-ment reduced the utilization of Œ±-D-Lactose and N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine substrates by 28.9 and 34.4%, respectively, compared with the T treatment ( p < 0.05). The NT treatment increased the utilization of D-Mannitol substrate by 18.67% ( p < 0.05) compared with the NTS, TS, and T treatments, with the latter three having a similar utilization. For the utili-zation of D-Malic Acid substrate, the NTS an d TS treatments respectively had 38.8 and 45.6% greater ( p < 0.05) utilization than the T treatment.

Soil Microbial Catabolic Diversity and Carbon Utilization PatternThe soil‚Äôs microbial metabolic activity was expressed as the average well-color devel-opment (AWCD), an indicative measurement of the physiological proÔ¨Åles at the communitylevel. The AWCD differed signiÔ¨Åcantly between the treatments (Table S7). The NTS and TSAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 11 of 18treatments increased the AWCD index by 21.6 and 19.1%, respectively, while the NT treat-ment reduced the AWCD index by 15.4% in comparison with the T treatment.

Across the four tillage treatments, the mean carbon utilization capabilities of the soil microbiomes differed significantly among the 31 carbon substrates. D-Mannitol su bstrate had the highest carbon utilization, averaging 1.624, and 2-Hydroxy benzoic Acid substrate had the lowest utilization, aver-aging 0.023.  Figure 5.

Correlation among Physiochemical Traits, Ca tabolic Diversity, and the Autotrophic Bacterial Community There were significant ( p < 0.05) correlations among the soil physicochemical proper-ties and cbbL -harboring bacterial community compositions (Figure 6a). Spearman correla-tion analysis across the tillage treatments revealed that SOC was positively correlated with TN, saturation conductivity, SMBC, and SMBN, but it was negatively correlated with bulk density (Table S8). Total soil N was correlated positively with TK, saturation conduc-tivity, and SMBN, while soil bulk density was negatively correlated with saturation con-ductivity, SMBC, and SMBN. Further, the Mantel  test revealed that the structure of the autotrophic bacterial communities was highly correlated with SOC ( r = 0.315, p < 0.05), TK (r = 0.328, p < 0.05), bulk density ( r = 0.724, p < 0.05), total porosity ( r = 0.415, p < 0.05), saturation conductivity ( r = 0.349, p < 0.05), and SMBC ( r =0.377, p < 0.05) (Figure 6a). Redundancy analysis, showing the relation ship between carbon source utilization and the structure of cbbL -harboring communities at the genus level, revealed that the com-munity composition varied from 14.20 to 20.68% (Figure 6b).

The utilization of L-Arginine substrate in the TS treatment was 73.9% higher(p< 0.05) than that in the T treatment. The NTS treatment increased the utilization ofL-Phenylalanine substrate by 85.5%, compared with the T treatment ( p< 0.05).

Correlation among Physiochemical Traits, Catabolic Diversity, and the AutotrophicBacterial CommunityThere were signiÔ¨Åcant ( p< 0.05) correlations among the soil physicochemical propertiesand cbbL -harboring bacterial community compositions (Figure 6a). Spearman correlationanalysis across the tillage treatments revealed that SOC was positively correlated withTN, saturation conductivity, SMBC, and SMBN, but it was negatively correlated with bulkdensity (Table S8). Total soil N was correlated positively with TK, saturation conductivity,and SMBN, while soil bulk density was negatively correlated with saturation conductivity,SMBC, and SMBN.

The abundance and diversity of the genus Gaiella  were closely related to miscellaneous. The 19 years of till age treatments had an impact on bacterial community structure, with the genera Bradyrhizobium  and Gaiella  presenting highly in the soil under the NTS treatment, while the genus Variovorax  was high in the soil with contin-uous T practices.

Diversity of Soil cbbL-Carrying Bacterial Communities Shaped by Crop Residue Retention The biomarker cbbL  genes, which encode a large subu nit of ribulose-1 ,5-bisphosphate (RUbP) carboxylase/oxygenase in the Calvin ‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham cycle, are considered im-portant indicators of CO 2-fixing autotrophic microbes in soil. We found a significant shift in the phylogenetic diversity of cbbL -carrying bacteria in response to soil management, and the largest differences in diversity existed between the NTS and the T treatments. The NTS treatment reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria  while increasing the abun-dance of Actinobacteria  at the phylum level, and at the genus level, the NTS treatment in-creased the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium  while reducing the relative abundance of Variovorax . The mechanisms for the shift in the bacterial community composition due to different soil management treatments are unclear, but we suggest the following possi-ble mechanisms: (a) the minimal physical disturbance to the soil, coupled with continuous crop residue input (in each growing season , year-after-year), provides cumulative Figure 6. A complex of correlations ( a) between the autotrophic bacterial compositions (Table S4)and environmental factors (including soil physiochemical properties) and ( b) between autotrophicbacterial community and microbial catabolic diversity in response to soil tillage treatments.

The abundance and diversity of the genus Gaiellawere closely related to miscellaneous. The 19 years of tillage treatments had an impacton bacterial community structure, with the genera Bradyrhizobium and Gaiella presentinghighly in the soil under the NTS treatment, while the genus Variovorax was high in the soilwith continuous T practices.4. Discussion4.1. Diversity of Soil cbbL-Carrying Bacterial Communities Shaped by Crop Residue RetentionThe biomarker cbbL genes, which encode a large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate(RUbP) carboxylase/oxygenase in the Calvin‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham cycle, are considered im-portant indicators of CO 2-Ô¨Åxing autotrophic microbes in soil. We found a signiÔ¨Åcant shiftin the phylogenetic diversity of cbbL-carrying bacteria in response to soil management, andthe largest differences in diversity existed between the NTS and the T treatments. The NTStreatment reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria while increasing the abundanceofActinobacteria at the phylum level, and at the genus level, the NTS treatment increased therelative abundance of Bradyrhizobium while reducing the relative abundance of Variovorax .The mechanisms for the shift in the bacterial community composition due to different soilmanagement treatments are unclear, but we suggest the following possible mechanisms:(a)the minimal physical disturbance to the soil, coupled with continuous crop residueinput (in each growing season, year-after-year), provides cumulative feedback to the soil‚Äôsmicroenvironment, forming a balanced C to N ratio over the years, which favors microbialactivities. A high N availability in soil is found to promote Proteobacteria while prohibitingActinobacteria . A high C availability in soil is found to stimulate Proteobacteria while pro-hibiting other microbes compared to low N or low C soils. (b)The 19 years of continuousinput of crop residue as organic material in the NTS treatment increased C sources forenergy, essential for the cell synthesis of organisms [ 17], leading to the increased abundanceofcbbL genes encoding ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase for CO 2Ô¨Åxation.The decomposition of the input material increased the substrate sources, leading to thegreat shift in the taxonomic composition of cbbL -carrying bacterial communities. (c)Theshift in the microbial community composition due to soil management led to the formationof a microenvironment favorable to the humiÔ¨Åcation process of SOC, increasing the sizeof the organic C pools. Additionally, (d)the facultative CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacterial members insoil may grow heterotrophically with the addition of crop residue (besides autotrophicactivities) [ 40,41]. Nevertheless, our results, in combination with the Ô¨Åndings reported byothers [ 42‚Äì44], bring us to a new level of understanding that long-term crop residue inputwith minimal disturbance can shape microbial community composition, beneÔ¨Åting CO 2Ô¨Åxation processes and soil C cycling.4.2. cbbL-Carrying Bacterial Catabolic Diversity in Relation to Soil ManagementBacterial OTU richness and catabolic diversity were highest in the soil under notill with crop residue retention among the soil treatments evaluated, suggesting that soilmanagement does alter the diversity of soil microbiota, provided that the soil is treatedfor a longer period of time (19 years in the present study). Other researchers have foundthat the catabolic diversity is reÔ¨Çected by the shift in microbial community compositionaccompanied by the different capacities of carbon substrate utilization [ 45]. However, thecatabolic diversity found in bulk soils may not be detectable in rhizosphere soils [ 46], sinceAgriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 14 of 18the expression of genes for soil nutrient reduction varies with soil microenvironments.Further, we found that the 19 year soil treatments did not affect soil pH (Table 1). ThecbbL-carrying taxa were mainly afÔ¨Åliated with the types of bacteria, regardless of the level ofpH tolerance. The diversity of autotrophic bacterial communities was highest in soil underthe NTS treatment and lowest in soil under the T treatment, mainly due to the continuouslack of disturbance and crop residue input that created an ideal microenvironment thatfavored microbial activities. Our results support the Ô¨Åndings of some researchers that soilpH does not have a direct role in impacting bacterial community diversity [ 47,48], andthey do not agree with some others [ 49,50]. We suggest that the relationship between soilpH and bacterial community diversity is likely driven by pH-related soil nutrients. Forexample, the heavy use of N fertilizers can reduce the diversity and abundance of cbbLgene-containing microorganisms [ 51], mainly due to soil N decreasing pH, which prohibitssome beneÔ¨Åcial microbial activities [17,52].4.3. Relationships among Physiochemical Properties, CO 2Fixation, and Bacterial DiversitySoil is a comprehensive ecosystem in which microbial communities have a strongcorrelation with soil management options, host plants, and edaphic factors [ 53,54], includ-ing nutrient availability, ion exchange capacity, and SOC turnover [ 55,56]. In our study,the 19 year soil management practices led to substantial changes in physiochemical andbiological properties. No till coupled with crop residue retention signiÔ¨Åcantly increasedcbbL gene abundance, SOC, SMBC, and SMBN while decreasing bulk density comparedto conventional tillage. Our results add new knowledge that in a no-till soil microenvi-ronment, bulk density, SMBC, and SMBN impact the cbbL gene abundance, and that theincreased cbbL gene abundance, in turn, increases CO 2Ô¨Åxation, afÔ¨Årming the positive roleofcbbL-carrying bacteria in soil‚Äôs C cycling. The cbbL-carrying facultative autotrophs playeda more prominent role than the obligate autotrophs in soil CO 2Ô¨Åxation, as we identiÔ¨Åedboth facultative and obligate bacteria through sequencing, and we found that the relativeabundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level was highest in all the soil treatments evalu-ated. Proteobacteria is a well-known facultative aerobic autotroph that assimilates CO 2viathe Calvin‚ÄìBenson cycle. However, the CO 2-Ô¨Åxing capability of autotrophs may vary withother factors, such as plant species [57], crop fertilization [51], and soil amendments [58].4.4. Implication of Long-Term Field StudiesBacteria play an important role in soil C cycling, some of which serve as the de-composers of root exudates, plant litter, and other carbon sources which break down theorganisms and convert organic energy into forms useful to the rest of the organisms inthe food web. The conversion process releases nutrients and thus improves soil fertility.However, limited information is available regarding how the bacterial community compo-sition and diversity are inÔ¨Çuenced by long-term soil management options, such as tillagepractices and crop residue input. In the scientiÔ¨Åc literature, some aspects of the relationshipbetween soil bacterial communities and anthropogenic activities are documented, for exam-ple, soil tillage practices shape microbial community composition [ 59,60], change microbialdiversity [ 46,61], and provide feedback to soil physiochemical properties [ 62]. However,most published Ô¨Åndings are primarily drawn from short-term (< 10 years) experiments,such that the conclusions are often inconclusive, inconsistent, or even controversial fromone study to another. Running a large Ô¨Åeld experiment continuously, year after year, isundoubtedly costly, but the experience of conducting the 19-year Ô¨Åeld experiment hasprovided us with the high conÔ¨Ådence for making concrete conclusions on the subject area.The improved soil microenvironmental conditions due to no till and crop straw re-tention for 19 years has led to increased soil productivity. Pea yield ranged from 1030 to1980 kg ha 1and aboveground plant biomass ranged from 4300 to 6400 kg ha 1(Figure S1).Spring wheat followed a similar trend of treatment effect as that obtained in Ô¨Åeld pea.The effect of soil management on crop yields in 2019 was similar to that averaged crossthe 19 study years; the NTS, TS, and NT treatments increased ( p< 0.01) yields by 32.5,Agriculture 2022 ,12, 1415 15 of 1825.1, and 10.0%, on average, of wheat and pea, respectively, compared to the T treatment.The soils receiving residue retention treatments (i.e., NTS and TS) had signiÔ¨Åcantly higherproductivity (22.7% more) compared to the soil without crop residue retention (i.e., NTand T).Knowledge of the complex nexuses among soil‚Äôs physiochemical properties, micro-biomes, and anthropogenic activities (such as tillage practices and crop residue input) ishighly demanded in the development of strategies to improve the health of soil microen-vironments. Our Ô¨Åndings are well positioned to meet the needs. One of the importantaspects in the assessment of the impact of long-term soil management practices is to quan-tify the relative weights or percent impact between the two subfactors‚Äîtillage practiceand crop straw retention. There is a need to understand whether the combination of thetwo subfactors actually generates additional synergy between the two. For example, theNTS treatment in our study had the greatest beneÔ¨Åts in terms of soil microbial diversity,C-cycling, and nutrient enrichment compared to the rest of the treatments; however, wewere unable to differentiate the relational weight of the impact between tillage practice andstraw retention. Did the beneÔ¨Åts stem from the NTS treatment due to straw input (x% of thebeneÔ¨Åts), no tillage (y% of the beneÔ¨Åts), or the combination of the two? Nevertheless, ourlong-term experiment has been running since 2001 at a site representative of the 1.56 millionhectares of the China Loess Plateau. The results of the study can provide some guidelinesfor improving soil health and productivity in local regions, and possibly extended to areaswith similar climatic conditions to the experimental site.5. ConclusionsThe results of the 19-year Ô¨Åeld experiment show that continuous disturbance to the soilproÔ¨Åle elevated the selective pressure to the soil CO 2-Ô¨Åxing bacteria community, disturbedmicrobial catabolic activity, and created hardship for the microenvironment. Conversely,no disturbance to the soil, coupled with residue-retaining on the soil surface or cropresidue being incorporated into the soil, increased the soil‚Äôs organic carbon and nutrientsand lowered the soil‚Äôs bulk density. The underlying micro-driven functional changesled to enhanced soil carbon utilization. We conclude that bacterial community structure,composition, and CO 2-Ô¨Åxing capability are highly regulated by soil management practices,and that a minimal disturbance to the soil‚Äôs microenvironment, coupled with the retentionof crop residues in the soil, will improve bacteria-involved biological activities and increasenutrient cycling and soil productivity.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/agriculture12091415/s1, Table S1: Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between cbbL gene abun-dance and soil physicochemical properties, Table S2: Detailed sequencing depth and OTUs numberof the cbbL -harboring bacterial communities under different soil treatments, Table S3: PERMANOVAand ANOSIM results for the effects of tillage and crop residue management treatments on soilcbbL -harboring bacterial communities, Table S4: Relative abundance of soil cbbL -harboring bacterialtaxonomic composition at different levels for all samples as affected by tillage and crop residuemanagement treatments, Table S5: Co-occurrence network properties of soil cbbL -harboring bacterialcommunities under the four tillage and crop residue management treatments, Table S6: Lists ofthe top 15 bacterial biomarkers taxa of cbbL -harboring bacterial communities under the differenttreatments, Table S7: Soil microbial catabolic diversity response to the four tillage and crop residuemanagement treatments, Table S8: Spearman correlation coefÔ¨Åcients among the soil‚Äôs physicochemi-cal and biological properties, and Table S9: Redundancy analysis of the relationship between carbonsource utilization and the cbbL -harboring bacterial community at the genus level and clustering ofthe soil samples.
