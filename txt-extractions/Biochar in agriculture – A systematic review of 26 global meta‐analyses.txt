Its use in agriculture includes animal feed-ing, manure treatment (e.g. as additive for bedding, composting, storage or an-aerobic digestion), fertilizer component or direct soil application. Because the feedstock carbon is photosynthetically fixed CO2 from the atmosphere, producing and applying biochar is essentially a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology, which has a high- technology readiness level. However, for swift implementa-tion of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), biochar use in agriculture needs to deliver co- benefits, for example, by improving crop yields and ecosys-tem services and/or by improving climate change resilience by ameliorating key soil properties. Agronomic biochar research is a rapidly evolving field of research moving from less than 100 publications in 2010 to more than 15,000 by the end of 2020. Here, we summarize 26 rigorously selected meta- analyses published since 2016 that investigated a multitude of soil properties and agronomic performance parameters impacted by biochar application, for example, effects on yield, root biomass, water use efficiency, microbial activity, soil organic carbon and green-house gas emissions. All 26 meta- analyses show compelling evidence of the over-all beneficial effect of biochar for all investigated agronomic parameters. One of the remaining challenges is the standardization of basic biochar analysis, still lacking in many studies. Incomplete biochar characterization increases uncer-tainty because adverse effects of individual studies included in the meta- analyses might be related to low- quality biochars, which would not qualify for certification and subsequent use (e.g. high content of contaminants, high salinity, incomplete pyrolysis, etc.). In summary, our systematic review suggests that biochar use in agriculture has the potential to combine CDR with significant agronomic and/or environmental co- benefits. 17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Several ancient civilizations have even much older traditions (Frausin et al., 2014; Kern et al., 2019) where the generation of more fertile soils by adding biochar (i.e. charcoal) mixed with other amendments was prac-ticed, for example, in sub-  Saharan Africa (Solomon et al., 2016). However, these anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) were only recognized by scientists over the past 15 years. Their discovery was triggered by biogeochemical research on ADE in Brazil (‘Terra Preta do Indio’ (Glaser, 2007)), based on the ground- breaking works of Wim Sombroek (Sombroek, 1966). The recognition of such biochar en-riched soils concurred with a growing awareness of global warming and the necessity of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), that is, the creation of carbon sinks (C-  sink). The term ‘biochar’ was initially defined as ‘charred organic matter [that] is applied to soil in a deliberate manner, with the intent to improve soil properties’ (Lehmann & Joseph, 2009). Lately, an extension of the definition of biochar has been discussed, including beneficial material use (e.g. in building or composite materials) that goes beyond soil use but provides equally C-  sinks (Bartoli et al., 2020; EBC, 2020; Schmidt, Anca-  Couce, et al., 2019).In the early years of biochar research, very high rel-ative amounts of biochar were applied both in field and pot trials. These were often >10  tons per hectare up to 100 tons (Biederman & Harpole, 2013; Jeffery et al., 2011, 2014; Kammann et al., 2012). The large quantities were mainly due to the fact that Brazilian ADE contain often more than 100  t ha−1 biochar-  carbon (Glaser, 2007). These C- rich fertile ADE, surrounded by highly weath-ered soils of low fertility, served as the initial inspiration for early biochar experiments (e.g. Steiner et al., 2008) in the tropics. As biochar research intensified and spread into temperate latitudes, biochar-  carbon was discovered in similar dark earth soils as the result of human activity in Northern Germany, Australia and Sub-  Saharan Africa (Downie et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2016; Wiedner & Glaser, 2015; Wiedner et al., 2015). However, it has never been credibly shown that these large amounts of biochar were applied to soils in a single application. The current assumption is that the high biochar-  carbon concentra-tions in Amazonian ADE soils built up over several cen-turies by repeated application and as part of a recycling system of organic wastes (Glaser & Birk, 2012; Kern et al., 2019). The addition of biochar to organic waste probably minimized nutrient losses, increased biological activity and prevented putrefaction of the organic residues and thus reduced bad odours (Bezerra et al., 2019; Frausin et al., 2014). After incorporation into the soil, those mixes of organic wastes and biochar render the molecular and physical structure of the soil more complex, which ap -parently lead to the build- up of soil organic carbon (SOC) (Blanco-  Canqui et al., 2020; Kammann et al., 2016; Kern et al., 2019; Lehmann et al., 2020). In this context, it is im-portant to note that the dark to black colour of the ADE soil profiles was not derived from the biochar per se but from the substantial accumulation of SOC above that of surrounding weathered, SOC- poor soils (Glaser et al., 2001; Kern et al., 2019; Solomon et al., 2016).Despite widespread consensus that biochar was al-ways applied with non- pyrogenic organic matter in the traditional models, scientific biochar trials were mostly undertaken with production- fresh, mostly untreated bio -char. To avoid experiments with too many varying factors that are hard to normalize, biochar was applied without prior blending with organic and/or mineral nutrients, mixing with biomass and/or inoculating it with an active microbial community. Latest publications and data indi-cate that biochar is more efficient as an enhancing ma-trix for fertilizers and microbially active substrates than a pure, mono-  constituent amendment (Godlewska et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2021; Sanchez- Monedero et al., 2018; Schmidt et al., 2017a,2017b; Ye et al., 2020) confirming some of the earliest biochar experiments especially from Eastern Asia where organic enhancement and microbial inoculation were already included (Ogawa & Okimori, 2010). However, even if the vast majority of biochar meta- analyses is based on publications that used large amounts of pure, production fresh biochar, compiling the available knowledge condensed in these meta- analyses may help to improve our mechanistic understanding and optimize the application of biochar in agriculture. Here, we address the following key questions: What agronomic and envi-ronmental effects may be expected when using a given biochar? Can there be harm when using biochar and if KEYWORDSanthropogenic dark earth (ADE), biochar- based fertilization, climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas emissions, negative emission technology (NET), pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), soil organic carbon 17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

What settings have the most beneficial effects without negative side effects? The aim of this review is to assist in developing a road map for future beneficial CDR strategies involving biochar use in agricul-ture, and to shape its future use scenarios to tackle specific agricultural problems.With more than 17,000  scientific publications on the topic of biochar (Web of Science, April 2021) and the ma-jority of these papers on its agricultural use, a large num-ber of meta-  studies (45 in total, see Figure 1) have now been conducted on various topics, from crop yields and root growth, to nutrient dynamics, SOC priming effects, soil biological activity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emis -sions from soils. Very different biochars, soils and climates around the world are covered.The present systematic review summarizes the re -sults of 26 meta- analyses published between 2016 and 2020 and meeting pre-  defined quality standards. They allow a fair assessment of the overall agronomic effects that can be expected when biochar is used in different agricultural systems and in different regions, which pos -sible side effects must be considered, and to what extent the application may promise environmental and eco -nomic benefits.2 | RESEARCH METHODS2.1 | Search strategyWe selected biochar- related meta- analyses that were published between 2016 and 2020 but included also sev-eral earlier published meta- studies for the overall discus-sion where necessary. The main reason for focusing on meta- studies published after 2016 is that the newer meta- analyses were able to include a considerably larger num-ber of studies and they often built up on databases from older meta- analyses, which are, thus, indirectly consid-ered in the newest meta- analyses.We searched the following electronic databases: Scopus and ISI Web of Science Core Collection. To identify the relevant publications, we used the following search terms: ‘biochar’ AND ‘meta- analysis’ in ‘Article Title, Abstract or Keywords’. We did not include the terms charcoal, py -rogenic carbon, PyC, activated carbon or carbon black, which are different names for essentially the same pyro -genic material as biochar but are generally not used when the pyrolyzed biomass is applied for agricultural purposes. The references cited in, and citing the reviewed studies, were also scanned separately for relevant publications.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 1711SCHMIDT et al.This search strategy resulted in 76 publications in Scopus and 65 in ISI Web of Science (Figure 1). When merged, the results of both databases yielded 78 articles. Two ad-ditional articles were found by manual search (He et al., 2020 and Pockarel et al., 2020).2.2 | Selection of studiesWe assessed the titles and abstracts of all retrieved refer-ences of relevance to the objective of this review. We ex-cluded studies that (a) were not in English, (b) evaluated only biochar properties, (c) focused on one geographical area or specific agro- ecosystem like paddy rice that are not representative for general agriculture, (d) related to very specific aspects of soil ecology, (e) when reviews did not include data analysis and (f) commentary, corrigendum ar-ticles or individual experiments (Figure 1). We included all studies that investigated agronomically relevant effects of biochar soil application and found 45 meta- studies that ful-filled these requirements. From those, we excluded 10 stud-ies that did not use proper meta- analytical tools (Gurevitch et al., 2018) but carried out other statistical methods instead (e.g. paired t - tests, analysis of co- variance). Finally, we set up the following quality criteria: (a) a minimum of 100 pairwise comparisons (biochar/control) for the selected pa-rameter; (b) exclusion of studies that used time- series data as independent and (c) in the case of GHG emissions, we excluded studies that did not clearly specify what type of data (cumulative, average or daily fluxes) were collected because this is a critical aspect that can bias the results. Eventually, a total of 26 independent publications, sum-marizing more than 30 parameters were selected. However, it cannot be excluded that original data points were used by several meta- analyses dedicated to the same parameters (e.g. GHG- emissions). Most publications presented more than one meta- analysis (Table 1). Each of the selected meta-  analyses were grouped under 11 topical parameters and are discussed individually in the following sections. Reported results were only discussed as significant when the 95% confidence intervals of effect sizes did not overlap with zero. Several studies that did not meet the above requirements were discussed in the respective sections if they provided complementary data and interpretation to shed light on the underlining mechanisms; however, they were not included in Table 1 and Figures S2a,b.2.3 | General assessment of the quality of selected meta- analyses.The implementation of meta- analyses in agricultural sciences is very recent compared with medical or social sciences. Its generalized use, however, is rapidly growing, which can be very useful if they are conducted to a high standard (Philibert et al., 2012).All meta-  studies included in Table 1 and Figure 2 used meta- analytical techniques, that is, they extracted data from individual studies in the form of effect sizes, which were entered into a statistical model with the goal of assessing overall effects and heterogeneity in outcomes (Gurevitch et al., 2018). They also evaluated heterogeneity with random-  effects models as generally recommended in agronomic studies (Philibert et al., 2012). The vast major -ity of studies included the program (and specific packages) they used for the statistical analyses, the weighing meth-odology and the terms used in the bibliographic search. However, there were other quality measures that were not consistently followed by all studies: (a) the inclusion of detailed quality criteria for the selection of the studies, (b) data harmonization, (c) data availability, (d) analysis of publication bias, (e) consideration of non- independent data and (f) the inclusion of sensitivity analyses. In the following, we further detail the proportion of the selected studies that did or did not follow these quality measures:1. About 60% of meta- analyses included detailed quality criteria for the study selection. These quality crite-ria could be for instance that the studies they have include should have a minimum of replicates per treatment, a randomized experimental design, the use of a specific technique for measurements, etc. The inclusion of quality criteria for primary stud-ies in systematic reviews is essential to avoid the effect known as ‘garbage- in- garbage- out’. The effect of the differences in inclusion criteria on the results of meta- analyses have been widely discussed in other disciplines (Whittaker, 2010).2. Equally important, only 56% of the studies gave details about data harmonization (e.g. Gao et al., 2019; Jeffery et al., 2017; Verhoeven et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2020). This is very relevant because studies might report relevant data with different units, or measured with different methods. A clear example is the biochar application rate, which many studies provide in % of volume or weight, whereas others as kg per ha or even kg of C per ha. It is highly recommended in such cases to show how data have been harmonized in the com-mon data set that was finally analysed.3. Although most meta- analyses provided the list of pri-mary studies included for the meta- analysis, only 40% of selected studies made their full data sets available (Borchard et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019; He et al., 2020; Jeffery et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018; Verhoeven et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018, 2019). This is a moderately high percentage compared, for instance,  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Data availability (either deposited in publicly available repositories or presented as sup-plementary information) is nowadays considered es-sential for transparency and reproducibility. Many high- ranking journals require the publication of the data sets to accept a meta- analysis for publication.4. Publication bias, that is, the over- representation of statistically significant results in the published litera-ture, can distort the results of a meta- analysis. Several methods have been developed to take the possibility of a publication bias into account. About 72% of the selected meta- analyses included methods for testing publication bias (e.g. funnel plots, fail- safe numbers) (Lin & Chu, 2018).5. Many pairwise observations in a meta- analysis can be non- independent, for example, because they share the same control in a field study, or they might repre-sent data points from a time series. Only a few num-ber of studies took into account or even mentioned the possibility of non- independence in their data sets (Cong et al., 2018; Jeffery et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; Verhoeven et al., 2017). The selection of criteria for non- independence was found to be the most important factor leading to different outcomes in meta- analyses (Hungate et al., 2009).AuthorsMain parameter summarizedMean effect size (% change)95% CI (±)# Comparisons -  (independent studies) CommentsReduced uptake of heavy metals from contaminated soilsChen et al., 2018 Cd in plants −38 3 505Chen et al., 2018 Pb in plants −39 5 292Chen et al., 2018 Cu in plants −24 4 237Chen et al., 2018 Zn in plants −16 4 266Peng et al., 2018 Zn in plants −20 8 241 Pot studies onlyPeng et al., 2018 Cd in plants −30 4 490Peng et al., 2018 As in plants −19 28 155Peng et al., 2018 Ni in plants −36 6 137Peng et al., 2018 Cu in plants −26 5 193Peng et al., 2018 Pb in plants −41 5 284Change of methane fluxesCong et al., 2018 CH4 emissions* −0.02 0.13 app. 150 Raw mean differences are used as effect size.

Finally, only a very limited number of studies (<20%) included any type of sensitivity analysis (Liu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018), which are very relevant to de-termine the robustness of meta- analytical results.To summarize, all selected meta- analysis followed sev -eral of the mentioned quality criteria and, in spite of their potential limitations, they can be considered reliable, not -ing that a certain degree of precaution is always recom-mended to avoid over- interpretation.2.4 | Data extractionMean effect sizes, 95% confidence intervals and number of pairwise comparisons were extracted from the 26 selected meta- analyses. Data were directly extracted from the text or tables when available. Otherwise, WebPlotDigitizer 4.4 (https://autom eris.io/WebPl otDig itize r/) was used to extract data from the figures. The vast majority of meta- analyses used the response ratio (RR) as effect size:where XT represents the mean of the treatment and XC the mean of the control. In most cases, the effect sizes were directly expressed as % change. When data were reported as RR, the following equation was used to convert it to % change:The RR, although advantageous because it is very intuitive and can be directly translated to % change, is problematic when there are negative values in the data set. For this reason, some studies chose a different ef-fect size metric, such as the differences between means or the Hedge's d (Cong et al., 2018; Jeffery et al., 2016). These studies could not be directly compared with other studies included in Table 1, but their results are reported as well.3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION3.1 | Plant productivityIncreasing crop and/or biomass yield is often considered as the most important goal of biochar application. Jeffery et al. (2017) gathered an outstanding database compris-ing 1125 comparisons from 109 independent studies and reported a significantly increased crop yield of 13% after biochar application. They found a higher effect in acidic soils (e.g. 40% increase for soils with pH <5) compared with neutral or alkaline soils where no significant effects could be found. However, this meta- analysis focuses on biochar as the only amendment and did not include treat-ments where biochar was applied in combination with mineral or organic fertilizers and compared with fertilized controls.The largest meta- analysis to date of biochar effects on crop yield evaluated 1254 paired comparisons from 153  scientific articles published until November 2017 (Dai et al., 2020). However, the inclusion quality criteria are not clear, and the data set is not public. Unfortunately, this study did not distinguish between biochar applica-tions with and without fertilizer. Regardless of the bio -char quality and soil conditions, the authors calculated a mean yield increase of 16% though the variability of the data was very high, ranging from −32% to +974%. Here, the yield increases were significantly positive both for alkaline and for acidic soils though higher for the lat -ter. The authors examined this variability in more detail and plotted it as a function of specific biochar and soil properties. Their analysis indicates that in alkaline soils, the biochar- induced changes in SOC content, electrical conductivity, C/N ratio and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were the main causes of yield enhancement (Liu et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2017). Regarding biochar prop -erties, the pH of the biochar (pH 7– 8), its ash content (>25%), its bulk density (<0.3  kg/l) and its C/N ratio were the most critical factors for the achieved yield in-creases. Further results from Dai et al. (2020) indicate that biochars made from crop residues, straw, manure and sewage sludge had more pronounced yield effects than biochars from woody biomass when not blended with fertilizers. These results contrast with the trend in Europe, where biochar is produced mainly from wood to achieve high carbon and low ash contents. The bio -chars identified as most promising by Dai and colleagues were consistently rather ash rich. Biochar application achieved the best results on yield when applied to sandy, acidic (pH <6) soils with low CEC and higher nitrogen contents.In a meta- analysis of high technical quality, Ye et al. (2020) evaluated 56 publications with 264 direct compar -isons on sole and combined effects of biochars and fer -tilizers on crop yield across different soils and climates. Importantly, the authors clearly distinguished between studies that used biochar with and without fertilizer, matching them to respective fertilizer (or no fertilizer) controls. They demonstrated that biochar is not only an amendment for weathered tropical soils but can, in com-bination with fertilizers, also result in significant crop yield increases in temperate climates. The application of biochar and fertilizer in combination resulted in an RR=ln/parenleft.s1XT∕XC/parenright.s1,%(RR)=/bracketleft.s1exp(RR)−1/bracketright.s1×100%. 17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

The biochar application rates were well below 10 t ha−1. Remarkably, the highest yield increases were not achieved with biochars from wood but straw and other rather lignin- poor, mineral- rich biomasses, which is in good agreement with the results of Dai et al. (2020) dis -cussed above. However, no impact of biochar on yields was found for regions with mean annual temperatures lower than 10℃ .To summarize, all recent meta-  studies about yield ef-fects conclude that the use of biochar in soils induced an overall higher yield (Figure 2) even if this was not the case in every soil and not with every biochar. As a way forward, we suggest to systematically investigate the following questions to further optimize biochar- based fertilization:1. Type of biochar (biomass feedstock, pyrolysis condi-tions, particle size) and possible post- pyrolysis treat-ment (biological treatments such as lactic fermentation or composting, chemical treatments such as acidifi-cation, etc.).2. Mode of mixing of biochar and fertilizer (separate ap-plication, mixing of biochar with liquid fertilizer, mix-ing of biochar with a solid, chemical formulation of the blended fertilizer, etc.)3. Optimal application method (homogeneous spreading, strip application, injection, micronized biochar parti-cles via drip irrigation, etc.).Biochars may contain and release relevant amounts of macro-  and micronutrients when produced from mineral- rich feedstock, especially from manures and biosolids (Ippolito et al., 2020). However, total and available nutri-ent concentrations in biochar from vegetal feedstock are usually too small to fully replace conventional fertilizers. Therefore, biochar is generally not considered a fertilizer and should be combined with organic or mineral fertil-ization to improve plant nutrition. This may encompass the formulation of granular biochar-  containing organic or mineral fertilizer products as part of future CDR strategies.Organic nutrient- rich solutions and suspensions such as cattle urine (Schmidt et al., 2015), biogas slurry (Glaser et al., 2014), press water from tofu production (Barber et al., 2018), compost tea (Edenborn et al., 2018) or commercial liquid fertilizers are suitable for nutrient enhancement of biochar. Mineral NPK fertilizers have also been shown to be effective solutions for the preparation of biochar- based fertilizers (Dietrich et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Omara et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2018). Thus, biochar can act as a carrier matrix for nutrients to reduce leaching (Borchard et al., 2019). Fertilizers are ei-ther loaded in liquid form into the pore structure of the biochar or mixed in solid state, for example, by granula-tion or pelleting. Alternatively, they are co- applied. To this end, biochar can be incorporated into the topsoil while fertilizers are applied to the surface and would slowly per -colate by rainwater into the biochar containing soil layers. Biochar apparently improves the microbially controlled FIGURE 2 Selected parameters with highest agronomic relevance that were investigated in the 26 reviewed meta- analyses. The mean overall effect size   (% change) and 95% confidence intervals are given as reported in the original studies. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of pairwise comparisons used for that specific parameter 17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

Conversely, in already optimized high-  yield systems such as arable farming on fertile soils with sufficient pre -cipitation combined with optimized fertilization or special crops grown with fertigation, further yield increases are more difficult to achieve. However, even in these systems, lower increases would be economically relevant; or the same yields may be achieved with less input and at lower environmental costs.3.2 | Stimulation of root growth and photosynthetic performanceXiang et al., (2017) conducted a comprehensive meta- analysis on the effects of biochar on the growth and mor-phology of roots assessed by various parameters, including 136 published studies with 2108 paired records. Biochar amendment increased plant root biomass by an average of 32% and root surface area and specific root length by 39% and 52%, respectively, as well as the number of root tips (17%) and the number of N2- fixing nodules (25%). These changes in the presence of biochar were more pro-nounced in annual crops than in perennial (woody peren-nial) crops and were significantly higher in legumes than in non- legumes. On average, root N concentration was not altered, but root P concentration increased by 20%. Evaluation of the effects of biochar showed that pyrolysis conditions, especially pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis intensity (heat transfer, residence time, mineral catalysts, highest treatment temperature), played a more signifi-cant role than the different feedstocks used for biochar. Biochars made at higher temperatures are generally more alkaline, have lower nutrient availability, and present higher specific surface area, water- holding capacity and electric conductivity, which are all characteristics that may explain increased root growth. Overall, this meta- analysis indicates that biochar increases the nutrient appropria-tion capacity, especially for phosphorus, by promoting root growth (especially root length and branching).As the formation of SOM is mainly dependent on plant roots, their exudates and fine root turnover (Kätterer et al., 2011; Lehmann et al., 2020; Rasse et al., 2005), biochar- induced promotion of root growth is a highly relevant effect with regard to soil fertility, crop resilience, and cli-mate change mitigation. The reported increases of root biomass, root volume, root surface area, root density, and root length are likely to affect the nutrient and water up -take of plants positively, which indirectly increases pho -tosynthetic C- acquisition and can, therefore, improve overall plant growth and/or plant resilience (Bruun et al., 2014; Makoto et al., 2010). Enhanced root growth and photosynthetic performance do, however, not necessarily lead to equally higher crop yields because the increased plantal energy throughput might primarily be used for higher root growth and root exudation for nutrient acqui-sition and stimulation soil microbiota.He et al., (2020) investigated plant physiological pa-rameters such as photosynthetic rate, stomatal conduc-tance and water use efficiency (WUE) at the leaf level via 347 data sets from 74 publications. Biochar appli-cation increased the above- mentioned parameters be -tween 16% and 27%. Remarkably, biochar application showed a significantly higher effect in C3 plants (32%) such as wheat, rice and soybean than C4 plants (7%) such as maize, sugarcane, miscanthus and millet. The RR of the photosynthetic rates to biochar amendment was significantly correlated with that of the resulting total, shoot and root biomass, respectively, which was again stronger in C3. This effect might be explained by the fact that C4 plants are usually more heat and water stress- resistant so that the supposed biochar effect on remedying nutrient or drought stresses was probably of less importance.3.3 | The use of biochar for tree culturesNo meta- analyses have been published after 2016 on the effect of biochar on tree growth. A study by Thomas and Gale (2015) examined the literature on how forest trees responded to biochar's soil amendment and summarized 17  scientific publications covering 36 tree species with trials both in nurseries and adult trees. They reported a mean increase in tree growth of 41% in the treatments with biochar, compared with the control without biochar. Growth increases were particularly pronounced at early growth stages, higher in tropical than temperate climates and higher in deciduous trees than conifers, but signifi-cant for all tree species in all climates.It should be noted that biochar for tree treatments (also in urban tree restauration activities) is usually deliber -ately applied in the root zone, usually by precise manual application. When planting a tree, the biochar substrate is then added to the planting hole, and for already es -tablished trees, it is applied either in the topsoil directly around the tree or in holes or furrows around the radius of the tree canopy. This application method is similar to that recommended for biochar- based fertilization also in field crops (Farrar et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2017a,2017b)  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License1718 |   SCHMIDT et al.where the use of low biochar doses (<2 t ha−1) achieved significant yield increases. Because agroforestry and refor -estation approaches are increasingly discussed in terms of CDR-  delivering land- use change approaches (Cardinael et al., 2017), more studies as well as a first in-  depth meta- study on tree planting and establishment with biochar are clearly desirable.3.4 | Microbial biomass, enzymatic activity and N2 fixation performance of legumes using pure biocharLiu et al. (2016) showed that biochar increased soil mi-crobial biomass carbon (MBC), especially in field studies where biochar was applied with fertilizer. They included 80 pairwise comparisons for MBC and found an average increase of 36%. In a meta- study including 413 direct com-parisons, the increase in MBC and microbial biomass N (MBN) due to biochar were 25% and 22%, respectively (Zhou et al., 2017). However, significant increases of mi-crobial biomass were only observed on acidic and neutral soils, but not on alkaline ones. In a meta- analysis includ-ing 336 direct comparisons Li et al. (2020) found that bio-char increased microbial biomass based on phospholipid fatty acid analysis and had variable effects on microbial diversity.These results are consistent with another meta- analysis that included 108 direct comparisons from 30 publications, where biochar increased soil MBC by an average of 22% (Pokharel et al., 2020). This study focused mainly on soil enzymatic activities and reported an increase in the activ -ity of extracellular enzymes such as urease, phosphatase and dehydrogenase by 23%, 25%, and 20%, respectively. However, a decrease in β-  glucosidase, acid phospha-tase and phenol oxidase, by −7%, −6% and −13% was also found, respectively, although it was not significant. The greatest effects for N- acquisition enzymes (acetyl- glucosaminidase, leucine amino peptidase and urease) were obtained in low-  SOC soils (C < 2%, TN <0.2%) and finely textured soils. These results confirm data assessed by Zhang et al. (2019) on soil carbon, nitrogen, and phospho -rus hydrolytic enzymes based on 401 paired comparisons from 43 studies. While the N and P cycling soil enzyme ac-tivity (SEA) increased by 14 and 11%, respectively, indicat -ing the stimulation of plant nutrient cycling, the C-  cycling SEA decreased by 6%, tentatively indicating reduced SOC turnover. While nutrient- rich, low- temperature biochars stimulated the N and P cycling SEAs, the C-  cycling SEA was more suppressed by nutrient- poor, high- temperature biochars confirming that there is no one best biochar for all purposes but differently designed biochars for more or less clearly designed tasks.Zhang et al. (2018) scanned 265 comparisons of 49 pub -lications for specific microbial effects of different types of biochars in different soils. Across all studies, biochar addition significantly increased the abundance of soil mi-croorganisms (total PLFA), bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, G+ and G-  bacteria by 8%, 20%, 19%, 9%, 11%, and 13%, respectively. The application of biochar in acidic soils and soils with low SOC led to the strongest shifts in the fungi- to- bacteria ratio (+38%). Increased fungi- to- bacteria ratios indicate that carbon decomposition and fungal- mediated N mineralization led to more efficient plant nutrient up -take and plant growth promotion (Luo et al., 2017).A study on changes in the N cycle (208 studies) as a result of biochar applications (Liu et al., 2018) evaluated a subset of four studies with 25 comparisons regarding the effects of biochar on the stimulation of nitrogen fixation in legumes. Although the data set was rather limited and the meta- analysis did not meet our selection criteria, it is worth noting that the authors found a 63% increase in bi-ological N fixation that was explained by the fact that mi-croorganisms (especially rhizobia) were stimulated, soil pH increased, nutrient supply including P, K, Mo and B was improved, and hence root nodulation was stimulated. More research is needed in this particular area, where the few studies to date show promising results.3.5 | Plant available soil water and bulk densityBiochar is frequently suggested as an amendment to im-prove the water- holding capacity of soils and eventually plant available soil water. The highly porous material pre-senting pore volumes of up to 5 cm3 g−1 (Sigmund et al., 2017) can absorb within the pore structure and between particles significant amounts of water and dissolved nu-trients (Conte & Schmidt, 2017). However, to achieve sig-nificant effects on soil water availability, large amounts of biochar (>10 t ha−1) would have to be applied.A meta- analysis by Omondi et al. (2016) found that, on average, soil bulk density significantly decreased by 8% after biochar amendment. Soil porosity significantly and aggregate stability increased both by 8%, available water- holding capacity by 15%, and saturated hydraulic conductivity by 25%. However, the effects are highest with biochar application amounts above 80 t ha−1 and low to insignificant at less than 20 t ha−1.More recently, the meta- analysis by Gao et al. (2020), using 43 studies with 284 pairwise comparisons, found a significant increase in plant WUE of 19% on average and leaf-  WUE of 20%. Plant-  WUE is defined as the amount of biomass accumulated per total amount of water used (Gao et al., 2020; Pazzagli et al., 2016), while leaf-  WUE  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 1719SCHMIDT et al.is defined as water loss per net CO2- uptake at the leaf (or canopy) level (Gao et al., 2020; Paneque et al., 2016). However, the authors found very high variability in WUE responses, ranging from −36 to +313% which was due to several different factors such as pH, C and K content of the biochar, and application rate (<20 t ha−1). However, the individual data sets were too small and not standardized enough to identify the impact of these different parame -ters according to the authors.A meta-  study by Razzaghi et al. (2020) was devoted to biochar's effect on the change in bulk density of various soils and on the increase in plant- available water. The mean value of the resulting decrease in soil bulk density across all experiments was 9% and was of the same order of mag -nitude for all soils and biochar types. With respect to plant available water, however, the results for the various soil types differed considerably. In coarse- textured soils, avail-able water increased by 47%, in medium- textured soils by 9% but in fine- textured soils, biochar had no significant effect. Thus, an agronomically positive impact on water availability was mainly seen in coarse- textured soils and only achieved with very high application rates of 0.27– 10% biochar in dry soil. This effect is also used when planting urban trees in intentionally coarse- textured substrates with high concentration of biochar designed to ensure the drainage of rainwater collected on the surface (Embren, 2016). Overall, it should be noted that the water- holding capacity of biochar can vary from less than 50% of its dry weight to more than 500%, depending on the bulk weight, pore structure and surface chemistry (unpublished data, data of EBC certificate analyses, Ithaka Institute), which, along with soil structure and aggregation, mainly de -termines the water- holding capacity of soils containing biochar.Another data synthesis study of biochar effects on soil water dynamics was undertaken by Edeh et al. (2020). They found that biochar improved all investigated soil water properties such as available water content (+28.5%; 107 data sets), field capacity (+20.4%; 94 data sets), per -manent wilting point (+16.7%; 75 data sets), total poros -ity (+9.1%; 36 data sets), saturated hydraulic conductivity (−38.7%; 61 data sets) and bulk density (+0.8%; 131 data sets) regardless of the soil type. However, again, the over -all effects were dominated by studies that applied more than 30 t ha−1, effects were considerable smaller for lower application rates, except for bulk density. They concluded that particle size, specific surface area and porosity of biochar are the main parameters influencing soil water dynamics. To achieve optimum water relations in sandy soils, biochar with a small particle size (<2 mm) and high specific surface area and porosity are recommended by the authors, while in clayey soils, biochars with larger particle sizes and with high specific surface area are more advantageous.Although biochar can significantly increase the water- holding capacity of soils and the WUE of plants, the overall agronomic effect must be considered relatively low, especially at low application rates of 0.5– 2 tons per hectare and year in arable farming. However, with con-centrated root- zone application, higher water availability may be provided to the roots and during the early stages of plant growth when the plants are still especially vul-nerable to drought and other stresses. With higher mois -ture in the root zone, the capacity of the capillary pump (Barghi, 2018), which transports water via capillary prin-ciples from deeper soil layers to the humid root zone, can be improved. Also, intensive horticulture and special ap -plications may allow higher application rates so that the benefits regarding water availability can be realized.3.6 | Biochar induced soil organic matter increase, soil organic carbon– priming, and C- sinkThe application of biochar to agricultural soils has been dis-cussed since the beginning of the millennium as a carbon sequestration method (Laird, 2008; Lehmann et al., 2006; Woolf et al., 2010). As biochar applied to soil resists deg-radation, it can be assumed that most of the pyrolytically transformed carbon persists in the soil for several centuries (Lehmann et al., 2015; Zimmerman & Gao, 2013) and rep-resents, thus, a carbon sink (Schmidt, Anca- Couce, et al., 2019; Werner et al., 2018). It was calculated with two dif-ferent methods that 13.5, respectively, 13.7% of the global SOC is in fact natural pyrogenic carbon (Leifeld et al., 2018; Reisser et al., 2016). There is strong scientific consensus that the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar carbon in soil is higher than that of all other organic carbon com-pounds (Coppola et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016a,2016b). Nonetheless, a very slow degradation of biochar does occur in soils and must be included into any carbon accounting system that covers the time scales of generations.Due to the absence of long- term experiences (>100  years), knowledge about biochar degradation is limited and either based on natural pyrogenic carbon turnover (Hammes et al., 2008) or on modelling of data from shorter term experiments. Using 128 observations of biochar-  derived CO2 from 24 studies with stable (13C) and radioactive (14C) carbon isotopes, Wang et al. (Wang, Lee, et al., 2016) meta- analysed biochar decomposition in soil and estimated its MRT. They found that biochar has a small labile C- fraction of 3%, which degrades within the first year, and a large recalcitrant C pools of 97% with an  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License1720 |   SCHMIDT et al.MRT of 556 years. The large recalcitrant fraction can con-tribute directly to long- term C sequestration in soil.Besides the direct C-  sink effect of soil applied bio -char which is considered as one of the six main negative emission technologies (Fuss et al., 2018; Schmidt, Anca- Couce, et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2019), the application of biochar may affect the dynamic of native SOC. At the beginning of biochar research, scientists were concerned that the use of biochar might cause positive priming (i.e. accelerated mineralization) of the non- pyrogenic SOC. Negative priming, however, means that decomposition is slowed down, and losses of newly incorporated (root) carbon are reduced (i.e. SOM build- up) (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). The fear of positive priming was fuelled by an early study where charcoal was added to the organic litter layer in a boreal coniferous forest. Over 10  years, accelerated decomposition of (acidic) organic matter was observed in the presence of charcoal (Wardle et al., 2008). However, the results of this particular setup in a boreal ecosystem could not be confirmed for other locations and setups by later studies. It is possible that biochar's adsorption of nitrification- inhibiting phenolic compounds from the needle litter increased N mineralization (DeLuca et al., 2006), thus enhancing decomposition of the needle raw humus material.Numerous researchers investigated the topic of prim-ing with incubation studies of mineral soils (arable, grassland, and forest soils) since then, often using stable isotope tracing. A meta- analysis by (Wang, Lee, et al., 2016) using 116 observations from 21 individual studies found a slight negative priming effect of 3.8% in short- term studies (<5 months) without plants and explained it by a shift in substrate utilization by the microbial biomass. Agronomically, this effect can be considered positive, as it testifies to the fact that microbial activity and thus nu-trient recycling in the soil are stimulated by biochar ad-dition. The number of long- term studies was, however, too low to draw robust conclusions on long- term biochar   induced SOC priming.More recently, Ding et al. (2018) evaluated 27 incu-bation studies without plants and showed that biochar properties (33.7%) had a greater effect on the increase of SOC (negative priming) than variation in soil properties. The authors further showed that it was mainly the du-ration of the incubation (i.e. the time since the biochar was applied to soil) that determined the outcome. On av -erage, in all evaluated studies (without plants, i.e. fresh C input), native soil carbon was positively primed over the first 200  days. From then until the 770th day, SOC increased sharply compared with the controls (negative priming), after which the increase slowed down until the SOC remained relatively stable after almost 3 years. Overall, the biochar application led to a 40% higher SOC content compared with the control after 3  years. However, experiments without plants which deliver a continuous C- input to the soil are of limited value for ex -trapolating to field set- ups.Liu et al. (2016) reported a 52% increase in SOC in a meta- analysis that included 148 direct comparisons. More recently, Bai et al. (2019) meta- analysed data com-paring different climate-  smart agricultural practices (conservation- tillage, cover-  crops and biochar) and found that biochar represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39% increase in SOC including biochar-  C) compared with other strategies (<10%).In a field study by Weng et al. (2017) in subtropical grassland in Australia, it was shown that about 25% more young, root- borne carbon remained in the soil in the 10th year after biochar application compared with the control soil without biochar. The study was not included in the meta- analysis discussed above because it included plant-  C inputs. In a large-  scale field trial in the Midwestern US, Blanco-  Canqui et al. (2020) supplied 9.3 t ha−1 biochar to corn under no- till management, switchgrass and prairie grasses with the three different cropping systems being cultivated without intensive tillage. After 6 years, the soils’ SOC content had increased on average by 7 t ha−1 carbon (in addition to the carbon introduced with the biochar) compared with 2  t ha−1 in the control treatments. The carbon introduced into the soil by the biochar was, thus, more than doubled by the increase in SOC after 6 years (Blanco-  Canqui et al., 2020). Apart from the significant SOC increase, the authors did not detect positive agro -nomic effects on yield, or plant health. Both Weng's et al. (2017) and Blanco-  Canqui's et al. (2020) results indicate that biochar in the field can substantially increase non- pyrogenic SOC. The overall outcome of biochar addition to vegetated ecosystems cannot be quantified by meta- studies yet, because studies that differentiate all three fluxes are challenging, they demand the use of stable iso -tope techniques, and are, thus, still scarce (Weng et al., 2017; Whitman & Lehmann, 2015).3.7 | Plant- available phosphorus and mineral nitrogen speciesPhosphorus (P) is a macronutrient for plants that must be added to the soil as phosphate fertilizer in intensively managed agricultural systems. However, only a portion of the fertilized phosphate is available to plants and relevant amounts of phosphate are washed out primarily through surface runoff and subsequently pollute surface waters. Besides, mineral P is a finite resource, so increasing the P fertilizer use efficiency would both minimize environmen-tal impacts and reduce pressure on limited P resources. 17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 1721SCHMIDT et al.Gao et al. (2019) conducted a meta- analysis of 124 stud-ies to determine whether the application of biochar increased the plant availability of phosphate. Overall, bio -char applications without blended fertilizer increased the available P in topsoil by 45% and P in microbial biomass by 48%. These results are statistically significant for those soils where plant uptake of phosphate is impaired due to iron or aluminium toxicity (Dai et al., 2017) and where P is, therefore, a limiting factor of plant growth. Hence, biochar might be a tool for reducing fertilizer application rates and environmental costs, even in soils with regular P supply.Another study from the same year (Glaser & Lehr, 2019) only included 25  studies and 108 pairwise com-parisons, because they focused on experiments without additional P fertilization. They identified in some cases much higher P uptake by plants after biochar amend-ment compared with the non- amended control (450% on average). However, the study did not distinguish whether plants took up soil- , fertilizer-  or biochar- borne phospho -rus. Because biochars from nutrient- rich biomasses such as animal manure or sewage sludge are considered P fertilizers (Wang et al., 2012) and because such biochars were used in some of the included studies, it is possible that the high average increases were due to the fertilizer effect rather than an indirect effect of soil P- reserve mo -bilization. Remarkably, the most increased P uptake was found in acidic soils.In the meta- analysis by Gao et al. (2019) a 12% re -duction in topsoil nitrate and an 11% reduction in am-monium content were found. This might be related to the observation that soil- applied biochar can reversibly capture significant amounts of nitrate and to a lesser ex -tent ammonium within its pore structure, which is not entirely detected with conventional soil extraction meth-ods (i.e. shaking for 1 h with 0.01 M CaCl, 2 M KCl, or comparable approaches). Longer and repeated extraction times are necessary to mobilize the N captured in biochar particles (Hagemann, Kammann, et al., 2017; Haider et al., 2016, 2020; Kammann et al., ,2015). Under con-stant plant-  growth promoting moisture conditions, plants were able to retrieve the nitrate captured in biochar par -ticles (Haider et al., 2020; Kammann et al., 2015) which could not be detected by the analytical methods used in the studies analysed by Gao et al. (2019). The same prob -lem of inappropriate Nmin- analysis for biochar amended soils encumbers the interpretation of data from an ear -lier meta- analysis (Nguyen et al., 2017) who found a similar 10– 11% Nmin- reduction in the topsoil. However, when pure biochar without nutrient enhancement is ap -plied in large quantities to the soil, an initial reduction in plant available N due to adsorption from the soil can be expected. The N is not lost though but captured and can be released over more extended plant growth periods (Hagemann, Kammann, et al., 2017).3.8 | Biochar in compostingCo- composting was one of the first methods to achieve agronomically measurable and economically benefi-cial results of biochar application in temperate climate (Kammann et al., 2016; Steiner et al., 2010). Still today, many biochar- based products on the European market are produced by co- composting biochar (EBC, internal certi-fication data). Numerous studies published between 2015 and 2020 demonstrated positive effects of biochar on the composting process, compost properties and plant growth enhancing qualities once applied to soil (Godlewska et al., 2017; Hagemann, Joseph, et al., 2017; Hagemann, Kammann, et al., 2017; Kammann et al., 2015; Prost et al., 2012; Sanchez- Monedero et al., 2018).In a first meta-  study on the effect of biochar-  compost as a soil amendment that, however, included only 14 publications, Wang et al. (2019) found that compost with co- composted biochar increased average crop yield signifi-cantly by 40% compared with the control compost without biochar. The highest yield increases occurred in soils with pH values between 4 and 5. However, it should be noted that, besides the low number of studies, the methods and conditions of composting varied widely among the studies compared. The decisive factor is not the addition of biochar but remains the composting technique itself (Kammann et al., 2016).A meta- analysis published in 2020 found that compost -ing releases on average one- third of the nitrogen present in biomass in gaseous forms, with an average of 1.2% of nitrogen emitted as N2O (Zhao et al., 2020). The addition of biochar to composting could reduce nitrogen losses by 30.2% (38 pairwise comparisons). These results are sup -ported by the finding that physical additives like biochar and zeolite were more effective at reducing the total GHG emissions (67.2%) during composting of solid wastes com-pared with chemical additives because of the greater miti-gation of N2O emissions (Cao et al., 2019). Hence, biochar could be an effective compost additive for reducing GHG emissions and improving the environmental performance of composting.The state of knowledge regarding the use and mech-anisms of biochar in composting was comprehensively reported in the review articles by Godlewska et al. (2017), Kammann et al. (2016), and Sanchez- Monedero et al. (2018) but, nevertheless, the N- retaining effects during composting and the agronomic effects of aerobic biochar- composts should receive further research attention. The two meta- analyses found on the topic (Cao et al., 2019 and  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License1722 |   SCHMIDT et al.Zhao et al., 2020) were not selected among the 26 meta- analyses because of the limited number of original studies included (less than 100 pairwise comparisons).3.9 | Uptake of heavy metals from contaminated soilsBased on 1813 data sets from 97  scientific publications, Peng et al. (2018) showed that biochar application to soils polluted with toxic elements (TE) led to a reduction of their uptake and incorporation into the biomass and/or the edible parts of the plants grown in them. Biochar par-ticularly reduced the uptake of chromium (Cr, by 64%), lead (Pb, by 49%), and cadmium (Cd, by 32%). Plant up-take of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn) were also reduced, but not always significantly so (or significantly only with certain types of biochar). No reduc-tion was observed for arsenic (As) when untreated biochar was tested. However, special pyrolytic surface treatments, for example, with Mg(OH)2 can turn biochar into a highly effective sorbent for As, which is already used in drinking water purification (Alkurdi et al., 2019; Dieguez- Alonso et al., 2018; Rajapaksha et al., 2016; Vithanage et al., 2017). Remarkably, the TE reduction effects of non- woody biochars obtained from pyrolysis of, for example, straw, husks, manure, or even sewage sludge were often more pronounced than those of woody biochars. Another meta- analysis, resuming data from 74 publications confirmed significant Cd, Pb Cu and Zn plant- uptake reduction of 38 and 39, 25 and 17% respectively (Chen et al., 2018). Generally, the higher the biochar pH, the greater was the decrease in plant heavy metal uptake.There is a broad consensus that biochars can minimize TE contamination of soils (Hilber et al., 2017; Kloss et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2013) so that crop or at least biomass production becomes possible again on pol-luted sites where TE contamination impairs plant growth and crop quality. On slightly polluted sites, the heavy metal content of crops can be reduced below the appli-cable product thresholds. A prominent example here is cocoa cultivation where high geogenic background con-centration of Cd may cause Cd-  contents of cocoa prod-ucts above new EU thresholds. Root zone applied biochar can significantly reduce cocoa beans’ cadmium content (Ramtahal et al., 2019).3.10 | Change of methane fluxes between soil and atmosphereIn the last 4 years, three major meta- analyses have been published about biochars’ effect on methane fluxes between agricultural soils and the atmosphere. While Cong et al. (2018) found no significant effects of biochar, Jeffery et al. (2016) and Ji et al. (2018) showed average re-duction of methane emissions from flooded soils, though mostly for pot and not for field trials.Two basic microbial processes control soil- borne CH4 emissions: (a) methane production by methanogenic ar -chaea under strictly anoxic conditions (e.g. in waterlogged soils or at greater soil depth or in anoxic microsites) and (b) methane oxidation (consumption of methane) by methanotrophic bacteria, which require O2, or by nitrite- dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane known as n- damo (Ettwig et al., 2008). For example, in a rice field, methanotrophic bacteria settle in the rhizosphere where rice roots release O2, which leads to the oxidation of CH4 produced by methanogenic archaea below and around the roots. The net flux between soil and atmosphere is then determined by the balance of the two processes because most CH4 leaves rice paddy ecosystems through the aeren-chyma of rice plants and less by ebullition and diffusion.The comprehensive analysis by Jeffery et al. (2016) in-cluded 42 studies with 193 data sets on agricultural soils covered with plants and not all of them rice paddies. Here, a significant reduction of methane emissions was found, especially on sites with predominant CH4 production, such as rice fields, while there were no apparent effects in ecosystems with dominant methane oxidation and thus al-ready very low to zero emissions or rather net CH4 uptake.Ji et al. (2018) stated in a meta- analysis including 222 paired measurements from 61 publications: ‘that the role of biochar in soil CH4  mitigation potential might have been exaggerated’. The authors found, averaged across all studies, a significantly decreased of CH4 release rates by 12% for paddy soils. However, these experimental data was mainly gained in pot trials. Field trials, on the con-trary, did not deliver significant results. Moreover, the co- application of N- fertilizer weakened the measured CH4- reduction. To investigate the underlying mechanisms and improve prediction of biochar effects on soil- related CH4- emissions, Cong et al. (2018) did not state overall average effects but argued that the interaction of the fol-lowing three soil factors: water saturation, soil texture and SOC content explain best the soil CH4 flux responses re -ported for biochar additions.Due to the high variability and insufficient systemat -ics of the studies, it is currently only possible to specu-late on the reasons for a potential increase or decrease in soil- borne CH4 emissions. However, it should be noted that agricultural methane emissions only reach climate- relevant levels in flooded soils such as in rice cultivation, on former peat soils with near-  surface water tables or after heavy and extended rainfall events. Interestingly, in wetland restauration mesocosms, the addition of biochar  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License   | 1723SCHMIDT et al.greatly decreased cumulative CH4 emissions by up to 92%; the effect was most pronounced in waterlogged or field- capacity mesocosms that had received additions of com-post as a source of labile C for CH4 formation via archaeal methanogenesis (Rubin et al., 2020). It is evident that the mechanisms of reduced or increased CH4  fluxes tied to biochar properties, soil moisture conditions and the soil microbiome deserves further research.Co- feeding biochar to ruminants had in some exper -iments the effect of reduced enteric methane emissions (Leng et al., 2013). This effect could not yet be confirmed by most published studies (Schmidt et al., 2019). It was further suggested that the application of biochar in an-imal bedding and as an additive for liquid manure stor -age could reduce manure- related methane emissions (Kammann et al., 2017). However, reliable experimental data are still missing, mainly due to the complexity of methane measurements in animal housing and large ma-nure lagoons with sufficient replicates. No meta- analysis on biochar uses in animal farming was published yet.3.11 | Reduction of N2O and effects on NH3 emissions and nitrate leachingThe reduction of soil nitrous oxide emissions through bio-char amendment is one of the best- documented effects of its use. The first meta- analysis on this topic was already conducted in 2014 (Cayuela et al., 2014). It showed a mean reduction of N2O emissions when using biochar of 49% across all studies, although they were mostly laboratory- based studies with high biochar application rates.In a meta- analysis including only results from field studies Verhoeven et al. (2017) found an average decrease in N2O emissions of 12.4%. However, considering the high diversity of biochars used as well as cropping systems and pedo-  climatic conditions, the number of direct compari-sons included was relatively low (122). The authors high-lighted the importance of data collection at field scale, specifically the necessity of long- term studies across var -ied cropping systems, and the assessment of yield-  scaled N2O emissions.A more recent meta- analysis, which evaluated 88 stud-ies, showed a reduction in cumulative N2O emissions (435 paired records) of 38% across all studies (field and greenhouse; fertilized and unfertilized) and 46% when only experiments with mineral fertilization were con-sidered (Borchard et al., 2019). Application rates below 10 t ha−1 had lower effects. The largest reductions were achieved using biochars with a production temperature of 600– 700℃ and using woody feedstock for biochar produc-tion. Based on these three meta- analyses, a clear consensus can be stated: Biochar soil application reduces agricultural N2O emissions. Further research on the permanence of N2O emission reduction is still needed because the vast majority of (field) studies primarily measured emission reduction in the first year after application. However, Hagemann, Joseph, et al. (2017) could show that biochar reduced N2O emissions from a field fertilized with min-eral N by 63% in the third year after application.Cumulative nitrate leaching (120 paired records) was significantly reduced by 26% to 32% by biochar in stud-ies with an observation period of at least 30 days. Longer study duration was associated with more significant ni-trate leaching reductions (Borchard et al., 2019). This result is consistent with the lower extraction of mineral N found using traditional methods as reported in section 3.7. and the discovery of reversible uptake of nitrate in biochar particles after aging in soil or compost, which re -sults in the formation of an organic coating that enables biochar to more effectively retain anions (Hagemann, Joseph, et al., 2017; Hagemann, Kammann, et al., 2017; Haider et al., 2016; Joseph et al., 2017; Kammann et al., 2015). Also, low- molecular-  weight organic acids in aque -ous solution (Achor et al. 2020) and the general presence of acidity, respective a lowered pH in solution (Fidel et al., 2018), have been shown to increase the ability of biochars to immobilize nitrate. In the above- mentioned wetland restauration study of Rubin et al. (2020), where up to 10% biochar addition decreased nitrate leaching up to 92%, the soil had a low pH of 4.6. Hence, organic coating and or -ganic acid adsorption may be part of the overall mecha-nisms underlying the meta-  study result of Borchard et al. (2019) on nitrate leaching in the presence of biochar.In a meta- analysis of 41 studies and 144 pairwise com-parisons, summarizing the effect of biochar on gaseous ammonia losses from agricultural field, no significant effect was observed. A high variation of results, with in-creases or decreases in NH3- emissions, was found de -pending on soil and type of biochar used (Sha et al., 2019). For example, the application of alkaline biochar to highly acidic soils increased ammonia volatilization and emis -sions. In contrast, when the biochar was applied together with mineral or organic fertilizer (<200  kg N ha−1), or when the biochar was acidified, both resulted in signifi-cantly reduced ammonia emissions. Looking at ammonia, relevant emissions occur during storage and application of (liquid) manure. However, only few studies are available, also due to complexity of gas sampling in animal housing and during application of liquid manure. Additionally, ef-fects of biochar will strongly depend on the method and timing of biochar use (feed vs. bedding vs. manure) which impact further the comparability of studies.So far, however, there are no studies that investigated N2O, NH3 emissions or nitrate leaching from biochar- based fertilization with root- zone application, where  17571707, 2021, 11, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12889 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [17/02/2023].

No negative agronomic or en-vironmental effects were consistently demonstrated for any of the parameters evaluated. Even if there is a cer-tain tendency in scientific publication practice to publish rather significant and positive results (publication bias), the number of studies and the selection criteria used here nevertheless stands for a robust data basis.These considerable improvements in such a broad spectrum of agronomic parameters (Figure 2) do not mean that all major questions regarding the use of bio -char have already been answered nor that it should auto -matically be considered an economically viable practice. The question of economic viability arises particularly in Central- Northern Europe, northern North America and other regions with annual mean temperatures below 10℃, where systematic yield increases by biochar application could not be achieved yet.However, since around 2015, new agronomic meth-ods of biochar application have been gaining attention. Today, biochar is more often used in combination with fertilizers and biochar- based fertilizers that are applied, for example, in the root zone, at significantly lower ap -plication rates of 0.5 –  2 t (DM) per hectare which may be repeated annually (Blackwell et al., 2010; Cornelissen et al., 2013; Joseph et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2021; Schmidt et al., 2017a,2017b; Ye et al., 2020). The biomass neces -sary for producing these lower biochar amounts may be either obtained from the agricultural land directly (e.g. crop residue plus agroforestry, hedgerow pruning of landscape biodiversity or of wind- protection elements) or could be purchased, as these lower doses of biochar may be financially more affordable. However, scientific literature on these new methods is still rare and only a few of the reviewed meta-  studies used data from those recent experiments. However, the investigation of ef-fects of the application of larger amounts of biochar are meaningful for (a) the identification of possible nega-tive effects (b) achievable biochar effects which can be further optimized with tailored biochars for specific soils and applications, with a spectrum of organic, min-eral, and biological enhancements, and with advanced application strategies such as micronized biochar with drip irrigation and (c) evaluating biochar as a soil carbon sequestration and hence CDR measure.Although scientific studies are primarily concerned with investigating underlying mechanisms and meta- analyses summarize overall effects, industrial research and development aim to achieve optimized products with the highest possible efficiencies. If special biochar prod-ucts are developed for specific applications based on the scientific results from the meta- analyses, higher increases in yield, root growth, SOC, nutrient efficiency and GHG emission reductions than those reported here might be possible.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis study was conducted within the BioC project of the r4d call of the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant No.: IZ08Zo_177346).
