Due to the global growth of the building industry, concretecomponents have been partially or completely replaced with waste materials that can be used asbinders or aggregates. Besides the ecological aspects, modern architecture widely needs materials tomake the concrete durable, resisting large loads and various detrimental forces in the environment.This opens the possibilities of managing waste materials and applying them in practice. This paperpresents a concise review of the green solutions for ecofriendly materials in the building industry thatdeal with the practical application of materials commonly treated as waste. The main emphasis wasplaced on their inÔ¨Çuence on the properties of the building material, optimal composition of mixtures,and discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù additives. It turned outthat some solutions are far from being ecofriendly materials, as they leech and release numerousharmful chemicals into the environment during their presence in concrete. Finally, the paper suggestsa research direction for the development of an ecofriendly structural material for a sustainable future.Keywords: green concrete; waste management; waste as a cement Ô¨Åller; secondary raw materials;alternative cements1. IntroductionConstant technological progress and increasing expectations of the market determinethe growing demand for modern technologies and products used in everyday life. Manyof the technologies known and used for years are based on the linear economy model:take‚Äìmake‚Äìdispose [ 1]. Nevertheless, the depletion of natural resources of many types ofraw materials, the deteriorating quality of the environment, issues with the managementof increasing amounts of waste, and thus the environmental and climatic changes takingplace currently as a result of pollution have contributed to a shift in the public awarenessand have signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced economic models and legal regulations. The past fewyears have brought changes in the industry that have led to a trend of replacing theclassic linear economy models in material manufacturing to a closed circular economymodel. The circular economy model is constantly being introduced in various industrialsectors, and one of its main assumptions is the reuse of raw materials contained in waste.This concept can be applied widely to manufacturing processes of concrete with reusedadditives, resulting in materials with altered properties.Recycling 2022 ,7, 37. https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling7030037 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/recyclingRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 2 of 231.1. The Composition of the Ordinary Portland CementDue to the constantly increasing world population and economic growth, one ofthe most developing industries is the building sector, in which a wide variety of novelmaterials are used. Despite many technological innovations in the building industry,cement remains the main concrete component, acting as a strong binding agent or adhesivematerial strengthening constructions. Concrete includes mainly ingredients such as anordinary Portland cement (OPC), based on tricalcium silicate (3CaO SiO 2), dicalciumsilicate (2CaO SiO 2), tricalcium aluminate (3CaO Al2O3), and a tetra-calcium aluminoferrite(4CaO Al2O3Fe2O3) made by heating limestone and clay up to 1400C. The most commonlyused OPC is calcium‚Äìsilicate‚Äìhydrate (C‚ÄìS‚ÄìH) hydraulic cement [ 2]. The cement marketis booming and the global cement market will grow from USD 326.80 billion in 2021 toUSD 458.64 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% in the2021‚Äì2028 forecast period, while the global green cement market will record an increase of14.1% CAGR in 2017‚Äì2023. The driving force behind the global green cement market is,among others, the growing awareness of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions andtheir harmful impact on the environment. Moreover, the building industry, to meet therequirements of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), focuses on greenconstruction [ 3,4]. Additionally, a new sustainability index for mortars and concrete as amodiÔ¨Åcation of the Empathetic Added Sustainability Index (EASI) was proposed [5].1.2. Environmental HazardsProduction of the main ingredient of cement, i.e., OPC, contributes to tremendousair pollution, as it is a source of noxious gasses emissions such as carbon dioxide. In fact,the OPC manufacturing process covers about 8% of the world‚Äôs human carbon dioxideemissions [ 6,7], while depending on the type of cement and the production process used,each ton of OPC produced requires 60‚Äì130 kg of heating oil or other substance and ap-proximately 110 kWh of electricity [ 8]. Since climate change occurs because of the releaseof greenhouse gasses into the environment, the building industry began to implement acarbon-retaining production process. This has resulted in the manufacturers applying recy-cled ingredients, low-emission fuels, or the combination of low-carbon content materials,which have a cement property with clinker [ 9]. The price of cement is rising because ofboth depletion of natural resources and an increase in the environmental taxes [10].1.3. ModiÔ¨Åcation MethodsThe development of improved production methods and concrete composition toensure the reduction or elimination of CO 2is highly important. In recent years, this hasincreased the need for changes in concrete and its components‚Äô manufacturing, particularlywaste additives. Green concrete consists of a binder made from supplementary cementitiousmaterials (SCMs), in which the OPC has been partially or entirely replaced with anothermaterial and/or waste and recycled materials as aggregates [ 11]. The materials of wasteorigin used in fresh concrete can be divided into three main groups: industrial, agricultural,and municipal waste. To improve concrete properties like workability, structure, andlater-age strength properties, the waste material in concrete is often activated by physical,chemical, or physicochemical processes. The Ô¨Årst one is breaking down the ingredientsinto smaller particles, which increases their effective surface area. The second one, themost efÔ¨Åcient and widely used type of activation, is the use of a chemical substance, whichactivates the pozzolanicity of cement‚Äôs ingredients. Concrete is chemically activated withthe help of substances such as sodium sulfate anhydrite, sodium silicate, acid, or calciumformate [ 12]. In turn, both activation methods are combined to reduce or even removeinconsistencies in their chemical properties [ 13]. Because of this, depending on the additiveswithin the concrete, the physical properties of the concrete can be improved.In this paper, we discuss the recent solutions in applying waste materials as ingredientsof the concrete that are treated as green additives and compare them with the typicalsolutions used in concrete.

Supplementary Cementitious Materials as a Binder One of the green alternatives is supplemen tary cementitious materials (SCMs) used as binders in the concrete, which are mainly waste from other industries, selected while ensuring adequate waste management. While it  is known that SCMs can override the OPC in the range of 10‚Äì50% of the wt.% [17], it is not a rigid regulation; the percentage of SCMs is selected depending on the desired characteri stics of the building material. Such cement additives may be natural, such as quartz, mica, pyroxene, and feldspar, or of industrial origin, such as calcined clays. The first is rich in silica, while the latter requires prior acti-vation to react with the calcium hydroxide [18]. SCMs provide better pozzolanic and filler properties of concrete and can also improve the mechanical and strength properties. One of the popular materials used as an SCM is a by-product of the production of FeSi, the so-called silica fume (SF) [19]. It contributes to  the enhancement of the concrete‚Äôs mechanical properties. Studies show that ad ding microsilica to concrete in a percentage share of 10% results in a material that is characterized by a higher level of cubic and prismatic compres-sive, axial tensile, and bending strength, and a higher value of the modulus of elasticity [20]. In addition, slag (SL) is commonly used in stead of OPC or its parts. It improves con-crete‚Äôs mechanical and strength properties [21]. Other SCMs can be made from wheat straw ash (WSA) containing high silica [22]. In another work, WSA was applied as an internal hardener to reduce the spontaneou s shrinkage of high-performance concrete (HPC) [23]. The study demonstrated that the addition of WSA reduces the final autoge-nous contraction of concrete. Figure 3 shows the properties of silica fume, slag, and WSA compared with ordinary Portland cement based on the literature. Figure 2. Literature search Ô¨Çowchart.3. Green Additives3.1. Supplementary Cementitious Materials as a BinderOne of the green alternatives is supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) usedas binders in the concrete, which are mainly waste from other industries, selected whileensuring adequate waste management.

The Ô¨Årst is rich in silica, while the latter requires prioractivation to react with the calcium hydroxide [ 18]. SCMs provide better pozzolanic andÔ¨Åller properties of concrete and can also improve the mechanical and strength properties.One of the popular materials used as an SCM is a by-product of the production of FeSi,the so-called silica fume (SF) [ 19]. It contributes to the enhancement of the concrete‚Äôsmechanical properties.

The study demonstrated that the addition of WSA reduces the Ô¨Ånalautogenous contraction of concrete. Figure 3 shows the properties of silica fume, slag, andWSA compared with ordinary Portland cement based on the literature.Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 5 of 23Recycling 2022 , 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 24   Figure 3. Diagram presenting the properties of silica fume, slag, and WSA comp ared with ordinary Portland cement based on the literature. Other alternatives provide alkali-activated materials (AAM) [24]. Such material is formed by the alkaline activation of silica and alumina-rich materials using alkaline acti-vators. Slag and fly ash with rich silica-alumina sources can be used as reaction precur-sors. Moreover, these components affect the mo re favorable properties of the entire con-crete, such as low thermal conductivity, high volume stability, rapid strength gaining, fire, and chemical erosion resistance. In turn, the complete elimination of OPC is provided by alkali-activated binders (AAB), which are hy draulic cements with a high aluminosilicate binder phase content. In fact, aluminosilicate s do not react too slowly in an aqueous me-dium, while because of the high amorphous content, they undergo hydrolysis and con-densation in an alkaline environment. As a result, three-dimensional polymer structures characterized by a load-bearing capacity are created [25,26]. Alkali-activated binders can be split into several categories, including alkali-activated slag-based cement, alkali-acti-vated pozzolan cement, alkali-activated lime‚Äìpozzolan/slag cement, alkali-activated cal-cium aluminate blended cement, and alkali-act ivated Portland blended cement [27]. The properties of the above-mentioned cement depe nd on their composition; for example, in the case of the first group of materials, they depend on the properties of the slag and the type and dose of the activator used. A properly  selected activator can significantly reduce energy consumption in production and reduce  the carbon footprint. An interesting pro-posal is to add high pozzolanic kaolin to the alkali-activated binders [28]. This proposal study has determined that the higher Fe and Al content in this kaolin lowers the compres-sive strength. Another interesting study shows that ferrosilicon slag can be applied in the Figure 3. Diagram presenting the properties of silica fume, slag, and WSA compared with ordinaryPortland cement based on the literature.Other alternatives provide alkali-activated materials (AAM) [ 24]. Such material isformed by the alkaline activation of silica and alumina-rich materials using alkaline activa-tors. Slag and Ô¨Çy ash with rich silica-alumina sources can be used as reaction precursors.Moreover, these components affect the more favorable properties of the entire concrete,such as low thermal conductivity, high volume stability, rapid strength gaining, Ô¨Åre, andchemical erosion resistance. In turn, the complete elimination of OPC is provided by alkali-activated binders (AAB), which are hydraulic cements with a high aluminosilicate binderphase content. In fact, aluminosilicates do not react too slowly in an aqueous medium,while because of the high amorphous content, they undergo hydrolysis and condensationin an alkaline environment. As a result, three-dimensional polymer structures characterizedby a load-bearing capacity are created [ 25,26]. Alkali-activated binders can be split intoseveral categories, including alkali-activated slag-based cement, alkali-activated pozzolancement, alkali-activated lime‚Äìpozzolan/slag cement, alkali-activated calcium aluminateblended cement, and alkali-activated Portland blended cement [ 27]. The properties of theabove-mentioned cement depend on their composition; for example, in the case of the Ô¨Årstgroup of materials, they depend on the properties of the slag and the type and dose of theactivator used. A properly selected activator can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce energy consumptionin production and reduce the carbon footprint. An interesting proposal is to add highpozzolanic kaolin to the alkali-activated binders [ 28]. This proposal study has determinedthat the higher Fe and Al content in this kaolin lowers the compressive strength. AnotherRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 6 of 23interesting study shows that ferrosilicon slag can be applied in the production process ofheat-insulating geopolymer bricks, which are characterized by the compressive strength of6.1 MPa [ 29]. It also turned out that the increase in alumina waste content decreased thethermal conductivity, water absorption and apparent porosity of the geopolymer brick.The green concrete-based building solutions may also consist of calcium aluminateand calcium sulphoaluminate [ 30]. Initially, calcium aluminate was added to the concreteto improve its sulfate resistance. Calcium aluminate concentrate (CAC) can be obtainedfrom various wastes, inÔ¨Çuencing its mechanical properties. Mineral wool waste CACs arecharacterized by their increased compressive strength.Besides alkali-activated OPC, cost-effective cement glass-based binders and additivesare attractive solutions, where the glass is used as a sand substitute [ 31]. Aliabdo andco-authors [ 32] proposed using the waste glass powder as a substitute for up to 25% ofthe cement. Waste glass powder reÔ¨Ånes the pores of mortar and improves the mechanicalproperties, where the glass powder addition of up to 15% enhances concrete‚Äôs tensilestrength, compressive strength, and voids ratio for 33 MPa concrete grade. Shukla et al. [ 33]proposed using marble mud dust as a 100% alternative to natural sand in concrete. Authorsshow that with the addition of 10% of the marble dust, the strength of concrete has increased.Thus, as a case study shows, if 7.5‚Äì25% of the aggregate used in concrete production isreplaced by glass, better freezing properties and better resistance to thawing and peelingof the concrete surface will be achieved. Rao et al. presented a literature review on thepossibility of using aggregates from the recycling of construction and demolition wasteas a component of concrete materials. The authors showed that these additives can beeffectively used in concrete, especially in lower-level applications. Recycling aggregatescan also be applied to produce standard structural concrete supported by additives, e.g.,Ô¨Çy ash [34].The following type of industrial waste is tire rubber-based additives like choppedor shredded rubber in the form of Ô¨Åbers or powder and carbon black as a product of thetire rubber pyrolysis. These materials are used as a substitute for gravel [ 35‚Äì38]. Thisoffers a reduction in the concrete‚Äôs weight and inÔ¨Çuences the compressive and Ô¨Çexuralstrength [39‚Äì41] . However, its production costs often exceed the OPC‚Äôs manufacturing cost,while the production of such concrete releases less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Moreover, only half of the end-of-life tires are recycled [ 38,42]. Recycled rubber aggre-gate (RA) has concrete lightening properties. It increases the fatigue life and strength ofconcrete and contributes to the improvement of the dynamic properties and ductility ofconcrete [43,44] . The disadvantageous effect of the presence of rubber in the concrete isa reduction in compressive and tensile strengths, and a reduction in Young‚Äôs modulusof elasticity [ 45]. Thus, adding ground tire rubber (which is a non-biodegradable sub-stance and poses a threat to the natural environment) to concrete reduces its mechanicalstrength, while the thermal insulation decreases compared to magnesium oxychloridecement (MOC)-based composites [ 46]. Preliminary results show that in the case of concretewith rubber waste, the workability, compressive, and Ô¨Çexural values increase with theincreased substitution rate of rubber; in the case of 50%, rubber waste is the highest [ 47].Rubber can also be used as a composite Ô¨Åller with a polymer matrix reinforced with jute forstructural applications. The tensile strength and Ô¨Çexural strength in such a composite arehigher than in a composite without rubber [ 48]. The addition of rubber to the sand mortarhas a positive effect on the physical properties of the mortar. In turn, adding 5% to 20%of rubber crumbs in the matrix and replacing sand with 20% of the rubber in the quarrymortar reduces thermal conductivity [ 49]. SoÔ¨Å 2018 [ 50] presented the gradual reductionof the compressive strength up to 23% load of rubber against aggregates up to 40% forcement replacement, presenting the optimal results for the max. 12.5% replacement. Table 1presents the correlation between the Ô¨Åller, chemical composition, and properties of therubber-based additives that are loaded into the green concrete.Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 7 of 23Table 1.

Tire rubber is a complexmaterial containing various compounds, including pigments (e.g., zinc oxide, zinc sulfate,and titania dioxide), reinforcing agents (e.g., clays, carbon black, and carbonates), softeners,plasticizers, vulcanization additives, activators, and antioxidants. In contrast, additiveslike accelerators can contain heavy metals or heavy metal oxides, including white lead,lead monoxide, and even cadmium, that are released into the environment [ 51]. Theliterature clearly indicates that tire rubber easily releases aromatic compounds such as higharomatic oils (HA-oils) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have a toxic effecton aquatic organisms like Daphnia magna when they leak into the water [ 52]. Anotherreference presents the toxicity of the leakage on Ceriodaphnia dubia and fathead minnowsRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 8 of 23(Pimephales promelas ), where the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organiccompounds (SVOCs), and metal ions were released [ 53]. Recent studies also show thegenotoxic effect of chemicals released from the tire particles [ 53‚Äì56]. As can be seen, therubber can release many compounds that can harm human health, wildlife, and biologicaldiversity. So, their use in concrete, where rubber waste-based materials are exposed to thealkali media, may even enhance the leakage.In industrial and household waste, many plastic waste products (e.g., nylon, polypropy-lene, polyesters, etc.) need to be managed. Recently, plastic Ô¨Åbers have been used as con-crete Ô¨Ållers, improving its compression performance [ 57,58]. Several sources present controlof spalling cracks for high load levels [ 59]. Moreover, plastic waste additives improvedurability [ 60‚Äì62], Ô¨Çexural strength [ 61], and splitting tensile strength [ 63], and reduce theweight of concrete [ 64]. Kaur and Pavia [ 65] present the mortars enhanced with plasticwastes such as polycarbonate (PC), polyoxymethylene (POM), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) granules, consisting of 5‚Äì20% byvolume of the mortar leading to the enhancement of the compressive strength reaching37‚Äì71 MPa and 4‚Äì9 MPa improvement of the Ô¨Çexural strength for 20% substitution. Theyalso show the tensile strength improvement in mortars with more than 15% of substituteduring exposition to loading, frost expansion, salts, or swelling clays. Other alternativewaste includes wood‚Äìplastic composites (WPCs) [ 66], which include multilayer packagingwastes (PCRs), recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE), and wood powders. It hasbeen shown that WPCs that contain 10 wt.% of PET/PE PCR exhibit better mechanicalproperties than WPCs without PCR, i.e., a 23% higher Ô¨Çexural modulus. In turn, consider-ing frost resistance, the best concentrate-based composite containing nano-silica is 2.5%,and PVA Ô¨Åber is 0.4% [67].Despite improving the mechanical properties of the concrete and reducing concreteproduction costs, within the application of the plastic and rubber waste, these solutions alsohave disadvantages [ 68]. Plastics can contain plasticizers, Ô¨Çame retardants, pigments, andeven heavy metals that can be quickly released and, once they are released, they may leakinto the environment, becoming secondary pollutants [ 69‚Äì71]. The number of compoundsreleased into the environment is signiÔ¨Åcant, including compounds that can act as endocrinedisruptors or even cause genotoxicity.With the growing use of electronic devices and portable electronics, electronic waste(e-waste) has increased dramatically within the last decade. For that reason, sustainablewaste management methods are of great importance. Therefore, the literature presents theexotic possibility of e-waste management by utilizing it as an additive concrete Ô¨Åller. Thee-waste includes cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plastics, metalwires, printed circuit boards (PCBs), spent batteries, smoke detectors, cables, computermoldings, light-emitting diodes, switches, thermostats, solder, bulbs, etc. These numerouswaste products have become one of the most problematic waste types for sustainablemanagement. Therefore, e-waste was proposed to be used as a concrete additive, eventhough because of the complex composition of the e-waste, it needs to be pretreated beforeuse in concrete. Ullah et al. [ 72] proposed the application of e-waste as a substitute for theÔ¨Åne aggregate with 7.5% of the aggregate mass. The authors presented the improvementof the compressive strength of the concrete; however, above the 15% additive content, thecompressive strength gradually decreased. Balasubramanian et al. [ 73] have developeda green concrete blending e-waste based on PCBs by the weight of coarse aggregate for5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. The authors presented the highest increase in thecompressive strength for the 15% content of e-waste compared to the conventional OPC.Another reference also shows the compressive strength improvement when the e-wastecontent is below 15% substitution of the aggregates [ 74]. In work presented by Arora andDave [ 75], the authors suggested using 4% of e-waste as an aggregate substitute to improvethe gained strength of the concrete. In Luhar and Luhar [ 76], the broad discussion about themanagement of the e-waste within its incorporation in concrete is presented, indicating theneed for the separation of the particular components of the e-waste such as glass, plastic,Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 9 of 23metal, etc. Depending on the type of components used as a substitute for aggregates, theproperties of concrete can differ drastically. The addition of e-waste to concrete changesthe mechanical strength properties of concrete such as compressive strength, split tensile,Ô¨Çexural strength, shear strength, and durability properties. Usually, the optimal contentof the e-waste substitute is below 15‚Äì20% of the aggregate added to the cement. Despitethese advantages, e-waste can release many harmful compounds, including heavy metalsthat are proven to be toxic to human health and the ecosystem, contaminating water, soil,and air, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and metal ions, including leadand cadmium [ 77‚Äì80]. Since e-waste has been an emerging environmental health issue,its application in concrete needs adequate procedures that require additional chemicalsand energy to separate toxic compounds from the e-waste to obtain safe materials thatcan be incorporated into the mortar. To avoid the leakage of harmful substances, specialprocedures need to be implemented before the concrete application of e-waste to preventenvironmental and health consequences.3.2. Biochar as a Concrete CompositeThe following group of materials that can be used as binders is biochar obtained fromcontrolled thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) of biomass. Due to the growing agriculturalwaste production, biomass needs management, and its management within concrete ap-plication seems to be a promising solution. The physicochemical properties of biochardependent on different factors are presented in Table 2.Table 2. Features inÔ¨Çuencing physicochemical properties of biochar, based on [81‚Äì89].BIOCHARPhysical Properties Chemical CompositionPorosity (from micro‚Äìto macropores)depends on the source of biomass andpyrolysis timeDepends on the pyrolysis temperatureMoisture sorption abilityThe high content of the total and organiccarbonDifferent morphology (from granular andwire-like structure toirregular shapes)Content of micro-and macroelements such aspotassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, copper,zinc, ironSpeciÔ¨Åc surface area (dependent on thepyrolysis temperature)The high content of surface functional groupsThe biochar‚Äôs porosity and moisture sorption ability are added to cement as a Ô¨Åller,enhancing the compressive strength and durability of concrete [ 81‚Äì83]. Depending on thesource of the biomass and the pyrolysis conditions, biochar can have different morphology‚Äîfrom the granular to wire or highly irregular shapes [ 84‚Äì86]. Besides shape, the biochar canalso have different chemical compositions depending on the pyrolysis temperature, time,and feedstock [ 87‚Äì89]. As an effect, biochar may have different mechanical properties anddifferent functional groups on its surface, which can inÔ¨Çuence the pH of the suspensionunder the mortar preparation and, as an effect, the mortar hydration, as well as themechanical strength of the concrete [ 90‚Äì92]. Bearing in mind the reduction in carbondioxide emissions, an interesting addition to the concrete is biochar and calcium carbonateas a part of the carbon storage system [ 93]. The biochar‚Äìcalcium carbonate‚Äìcement wouldsave the carbon storage places on land and/or at sea and help reduce cement usage.One of the main forms of agricultural waste in Eastern countries is a rice husk thatcan be used as a cement binder after the pyrolysis. Zunino et al. [ 94] describe rice husk ash(RHA) as a mortar component, showing that incorporating RHA decreases Ô¨Çowability andincreases water requirements. It can also affect the mechanical and durability properties ofconcrete by reducing compressive strength and increasing the permeability of the concrete.Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 10 of 23In turn, in [ 95], RHA-based concentrate, composed of amorphous silica made by thecharcoal incinerator, 15% OPC can be successfully replaced with RHA without loss ofstrength with a w/b ratio of 0.50. Moreover, an increase in RHA content causes an increasein split tensile strength.Taking into account the mechanical properties, Ô¨Çexibility, and low production costs, aplant that is an excellent additive to cement is bamboo and bamboo waste, in particularbamboo Ô¨Åbers and bamboo leaf ash (BMBLF), which indicates a considerable potential as apozzolanic material [ 96,97]. In [ 97], bamboo-based biochar was added in the 0.2‚Äì4% wt.%,and the compressive strength of the biochar-Ô¨Ålled mortar was tested. It is shown that the1% wt.% replacement of bamboo biochar with cement has the best strengthening effect,making concrete the most crack-resistant compared to the different percentages of biocharand to the neat mortar without biochar Ô¨Ålling. Tan et al. [ 89] presented biochar based onwaste wood as a binder in the 1‚Äì10% wt.%. Replacing the cement with wood-waste biocharby 1‚Äì3% improved mechanical properties, while it did not change the Ô¨Çexural strengthsuch as the elasticity of the mortar compared to the neat mortar without biochar. It is alsoshown that the biochar addition decreased linearly with the biochar content.Depending on the source of biomass, the binding properties of biochar vary.Zeidabadi et al. [93] proposed the application of the rice-husk biochar and bagasse biocharobtained under identical pyrolysis conditions, comparing the mechanical properties ofthe concrete. Authors show that incorporating such agricultural waste into concrete hadbeneÔ¨Åcial effects on the compressive and tensile strengths, where the replacement of 5%wt.% of the cement improved the mechanical properties of the mortar compared to othermixes and control concrete. However, a further increase in the biochar content decreasedthe tensile strength of mortar.Akhatar and Sarmah [ 98] show the utilization of biochar based on poultry litter,rice husk and pulp, and papermill sludge as a cement binder, where cement content upto 1% of total volume was replaced. Authors show that rice-husk biochar, paper mill,and pulp at 0.1% of total volume are the most effective binders compared to the neatconcrete, while tensile strength values for the paper pulp and papermill sludge biochardoped concrete obtained comparable values. Generally, all used biochars signiÔ¨Åcantlyimproved the Ô¨Çexural strength of concrete, while poultry litter and rice-husk biochar at0.1% produced optimum results with a 20% increment to control specimens. Rice straw isalso a promising source of biochar. Even a 1% addition of that type of biochar to cementimproves compressive strength and thermal conductivity [ 99]. Gupta et al. proposedbiochar prepared from food and wood waste, investigating fresh and hardened propertiesof mortar, proving an increase in the compressive strength, sorptivity, resistance to waterpenetration, and ductility compared to conventional mortar [ 100]. The best effectivenessof the biochar addition is 1‚Äì2% wt.%. Praneeth et al. presented biochar derived fromcorn-stover biomass added in the cement‚ÄìÔ¨Çy ash blocks as 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% of wt.,where the optimal content was about 4‚Äì6% depending on the admixture. Moreover, theproposed material had increased CO 2uptake [ 101]. Biochar is also widely derived frombiomass-based Ô¨Çy ash [ 102‚Äì106]. Chen et al. have presented Ô¨Çy ash-based biochar asan additive promoting cement hydration reaction via pozzolanic reaction and internalcuring [ 102].Qin et al. [107] described the use of the biochar obtained from the eucalyptusplywood boards incorporating 0.65‚Äì13.5% wt.% into the concrete. It has been found thatthe BC content has little and/or no impact on the porosity and water permeability of theBC-modiÔ¨Åed concrete samples considered here and that the water absorption increases withBC contents. This concrete also shows a greater compressive strength and splitting tensilestrength than conventional ones when the BC content is 0‚Äì6.5%; above this percentage,these strengths are compromised. This is because a small amount of BC will promotecement hydration, so the products of this process generated in a higher amount concerningthose without BC contribute to the development of the strength of pervious concrete. It hasalso been found that 6.5% BC in the cement paste can decrease the albedo by 0.05, while itcan be compensated for by the water absorption increment and strength improvement. SoRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 11 of 23far, pervious concrete could be replaced by up to 6.5%, in weight, of cement with pulverizedBC and it is feasible to curtail CO 2emissions and lock up BC.Sirico et al. [ 108] proposed using biochar from wood chips of local forests (alder, beech,poplar, chestnut, oak, and hornbeam), where biochar was subjected to gasiÔ¨Åcation andused as a cement binder. The authors showed that fracture energy was improved by usinga 1 wt% addition of biochar. However, this also slightly decreased the Ô¨Çexural strength.Recently, biochar was proposed to be applied in higher content than described elsewhere.Chen et al. [ 109] used a content of biochar of about 30% wt.% and 9% wt.% metakaolinto reduce the CO 2emissions. The authors presented the ability of the created concrete tosqueeze 59 kg of CO 2per ton and enhance economic proÔ¨Åts in concrete production withsuch a signiÔ¨Åcant content of biochar.As an additive to a concrete-based composite, metal-supported biochar seems to be apromising solution. It may improve the properties of conventional concrete, i.e., bendingstrength and splitting tensile strength. Moreover, a carbon storage system in concretewould limit clinker production and consequently reduce the production of carbon dioxide.The presence of biochar inÔ¨Çuences concrete properties, but biochar-based composites‚Äôcharacteristics require further research. Biochar acts as a gravel substitute leading to thereduced production costs of the concrete, making it possible to produce climate-positiveconcrete whose properties are comparable to or can even exceed those of a correspondingconventional OPC-based concrete. At the same time, the biochar as a product of pyrolysisis dependent on the experimental conditions during heat treatment. If treated as a wastesource, it reduces the concrete costs.3.3. Non-Carbonized Agricultural WasteAgricultural waste is a global problem, so its incorporation into concrete reduces boththe energy consumption for its regular utilization and during concrete preparation [ 110].Natural, organic Ô¨Åbers and particles can provide signiÔ¨Åcant advantages over biochar ob-tained within the pyrolysis process because of the lower costs and omission of energyconsumption during pyrolysis. Dry biomass contains many Ô¨Åbers that may work as areinforcement of cement. In contrast to the classical reinforcement based on natural miner-als and reinforcement with steel or synthetic materials, plant-based additives cannot becompared in the case of their mechanical properties because of the soft structure. However,plant-based additives can also improve the characteristics of mortar, such as changes in thehydration rate, elasticity, volumetric changes, porosity, etc.Sellami et al. [ 111] presented results where the wild vegetal diss plant was used as alignocellulose-based Ô¨Åbrous reinforcing additive. The authors show that the pretreatmentof the plant has a signiÔ¨Åcant role in the Ô¨Ånal product properties, where the boiling andwashing of Ô¨Åbers results in higher mechanical strength than in the case of dry Ô¨Åbers. Itis shown that the resistance against fracture can be improved within the arrangement ofthe Ô¨Åbers. Positioning of Ô¨Åbers horizontally enhances adhesion with the cement paste. Inother work, agricultural waste products obtained from palm oil and coconut oil processingwere added to the cement [ 112]. The authors presented concrete containing coconut shell(CS) and palm kernel shell (PKS) as a facile method for utilizing waste and reducing thecosts of the concrete production, where agricultural waste was used in two nominal mixratios (1:1:2 and 1:2:4) involving crushed, granular CS and PKS as substitutes for gravel ingradations of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% and water/cement ratios of 0.75 and 0.50 forboth mix ratios 1:2:4 and 1:1:2. Results showed that the compressive strength of the concretedecreased with the increase of the percentage of shell, while the compressive strength canbe modiÔ¨Åed by varying the ratio of the shells vs. OPC. Kriker et al. [ 113] also presentedpalm-based waste as a cement additive. Date palm Ô¨Åbers were proposed to replace cementin dry environments where there is a need for strengthening against high temperatureamplitudes. The authors showed that Ô¨Åbers can provide technical solutions for improvingthe mechanical performance of the mortar, while male date palm surface Ô¨Åber (MDPSF)has the most tensile strength among the other types of date palm-based Ô¨Åbers. Due to theRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 12 of 23brittle nature of concrete in dry environments, moisture has a curing effect on the cracks.An increase in the MDPSFs and their length has a beneÔ¨Åcial effect on the self-curing ofthe concrete under the moisture presence. It is also shown that the optimal compressivestrength is obtained with a lower percentage and shorter Ô¨Åber length, as that minimizes theÔ¨Çaws in the matrix and gives a more uniform distribution in the concrete. Another workpresented by Lim et al. [ 114] showed the effects of palm oil empty fruit bunch (POEFB)Ô¨Åbers on the compressive strength of foamed concrete (FC) and shrinking under dryingwere 0.25% and 0.5% based on dry mix weight with 1‚Äì2 cm in length Ô¨Åbers were used.Commonly used Ô¨Åbers improve the concrete characteristics, durability, mechanicalstrength, and thermal properties and reduce costs of mortar production [ 115‚Äì117]. Incontrast to the other green additives, hemp Ô¨Åbers are even treated as the main componentof the mortar, making up over half of the Ô¨Ålling of the cement. The hemp bast Ô¨Åber can beconsidered a greener and sustainable industrial waste for producing cellulose nanoÔ¨Åbers,which have good crystallinity and thermal stability [ 118]. The mechanical properties ofhemp-based composites are affected by many factors, including the type and length ofÔ¨Åbers, their matrix, and the manufacturing process [ 119]. The adhesion issues betweenthe Ô¨Åbers and the matrix are among the main issues in the hemp-concrete manufacturingprocess [ 120]. The advantage of natural Ô¨Åber reinforcements is that the required Ô¨Åber ratiois much lower than in conventional reinforcements. In Davino et al., the application ofthe hemp Ô¨Åbers to improve the thermal stability of mortar and the compressive strengthwas proposed [121]. Another work researched the compounds obtained with hemp Ô¨Åbersand found [ 119] that the bending strength of concrete that contained hemp braid increasedonly in some of the samples, while in all of them, the average of the ultimate deformationsincreased by 74%.In work presented by El-Feky et al., the nanocellulose Ô¨Åbers in 0.02‚Äì0.08% wt.% wereused as an alternative to the carbon-based nanotubes (CNTs), enhancing the mechanicalstrength and microstructure of the concrete [122]. To improve the ductility and toughnessof concrete, Ô¨Åber can be added to create a composite material. At present, scientists andtechnicians have conducted a considerable amount of research on applying natural plantÔ¨Åbers such as those from banana, sisal, hemp and Ô¨Çax, jute, coconut, oil palm, and wheatstraw in cement-based composite materials [ 123‚Äì128]. The use of natural plant Ô¨Åbers incement composites requires their prior treatment. An example of chemical treatment ofÔ¨Åbers is soaking them in an alginate solution and then in calcium chloride. However,most often, the Ô¨Åbers are soaked in NaOH solutions to remove amorphous biologicalresidues, e.g., waxes, and increase their compatibility with the alkaline matrix [124,126‚Äì132] .The research showed that additional mechanical properties and strength of concrete areachieved because of the vegetal Ô¨Åbers. Table 3 shows the inÔ¨Çuence of various natural Ô¨Åbermaterials on the mechanical properties of concrete. Based on the analysis, compressivestrength was reduced with the Ô¨Åber fraction in the concrete composite. Nonetheless,Ô¨Åbers considerably improved the Ô¨Çexural and the splitting tensile strength of the concrete.Additionally, concrete composites with waste vegetable Ô¨Åbers showed a change in thermalproperties such as lower thermal conductivity and speciÔ¨Åc heat capacity, and higher thermaldiffusivity compared to the control mix. [ 129,133]. Besides the above-mentioned examples,another article proposes the application of the palm oil fuel ash, showing that it reducesthe negative impact of steam curing for long-term transport properties [134].Agricultural waste such as natural plant Ô¨Åber, agricultural waste ash, and multi-application waste is a low-cost material that can be used as a concrete Ô¨Åller that offersexcellent value in developing environment-friendly concrete. Depending on the source andthe properties of the material, such as the size of granules or Ô¨Åbers, their concentration, andsurface activation, the mechanical properties of the concrete are altered.Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 13 of 23Table 3.

DiscussionThe classiÔ¨Åcation of acceptable types of cement in Europe is given by BS EN 197-1:2011. It is divided into Ô¨Åve groups: Portland cement and up to 5% of minor additionalconstituents, Portland cement with up to 35% of other SCM, Portland cement with a higherpercentage of blast furnace slag, usually around 60% to 75%, Portland cement with up to55% of selected pozzolanic constituents, and Portland cement blended with GGBS or Ô¨Çyash and pozzolanic material [ 8]. The American Society for Testing and Materials providesother classiÔ¨Åcations, which include the original OPC, cements that contain no more than 8%tricalcium aluminate (Ca 3Al) for moderate sulfate resistance, cements with moderate heatof hydration characteristic, more Ô¨Ånely ground OPCs able to produce higher early strengths,cement with no more than 5% Ca 3Al2O6for high sulfate resistance, and cement that allowsthe minimization of the rate and amount of heat generated by hydration. It is expectablethat the strong trend to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cement production willcontinue in the coming years. This is due to both concern for the environment, as wellas strong economic conditions, including counteracting the impact of new regulations,green taxes, and rising fuel prices on product costs. The SCM application can signiÔ¨Åcantlycontribute to the reduction in CO 2emissions; in particular, ceramic waste reduces emissionsby about 29% [ 142], Ô¨Çy ash by 14% [ 143], and condensed silica fume by 15% [ 4,9], whilegeopolymers by even 80% [ 144]. As a consequence, the above division and standard maychange, while the green transformation of the world is in progress [ 145], in particular inthe cement industry [146].4.1. Green Additives to ConcreteBased on the review of selected literature sources, the main types of green additivesused in the production of concrete were determined. The summary being an introductionto the green additives section is presented in Table 4.Table 4. The types of additives used for the production of green concrete, based on [19‚Äì153].Green Additive ApplicationInÔ¨Çuence on Propertiesof ConcreteSlag [21,29] Binder component Improvement in mechanical and strength propertiesWheat straw ash [22,23,147] Binder componentReduction in the spontaneous shrinkage of high-performanceconcrete and the Ô¨Ånal autogenous contraction of concreteAlkali-activated materials [24] Binder componentMore favorable properties of the entire concrete, such as lowthermal conductivity, high volume stability, rapid strengthgaining, Ô¨Åre, and chemical erosion resistanceCalcium aluminate andcalcium sulphoaluminate(mineral wool waste) [ 27,30,148]Binder componentImprovement of sulfate resistance, enhancement of mechanicalproperties, increase in compressive strengthWaste glasspowder [31,32]Sand substituteImprovement of concrete mechanical properties, such asconcrete tensile strength, compressive strength,and porosityMarble mud dust [33] Sand substituteImprovement of the strength of concrete, freezing propertiesand resistance to thawing and peeling of the concrete surfaceAggregates from the recyclingof construction and demolitionwaste [34,149‚Äì153]Component of concretematerialsImprovement of the concrete, especially those used inlower-level applicationsTire rubber-based additives[34‚Äì37,41,43,46,148]Gravel substitute, compositeÔ¨Åller, additive to sandmortarReduction in the concrete‚Äôs weight, improvement of thecompressive and Ô¨Çexural strength, reduction in compressionand tension and a reduction in Young‚Äôs modulus of elasticity,reduction in thermal conductivityRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 15 of 23Table 4.

Theamount of traditional SCMs such as Ô¨Çy ash and slag is limited, particularly in underde-veloped countries. Other materials to partially replace ordinary Portland cement are ofhigh importance. For example, calcium aluminate concentrate products from the recyclingof sanitary waste improve mechanical properties and the high-temperature behavior ofPortland cement [ 148]. CAC provides a practical possibility of recycling glass waste in theproduction of building materials. Moreover, CAC is also a promising additive to Portlandcement to produce 3D-printing mixtures, which are characterized by very good mechanicalproperties. Other widely available waste materials that can be used as components of greencement are sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) [ 154], geopolymer metakaolin (MK), and millethusk ash [ 147]. These compounds provide higher compressive strength and split tensilestrength than conventional concrete. Factors such as the presence of uncalcined kaoliniticclay or swelling clays affect the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete [ 155]. OtherRecycling 2022 ,7, 37 16 of 23alternative binders in concrete provide the alkali-activated binders, which require a signiÔ¨Å-cant amount of energy and generate a considerable amount of carbon dioxide during theproduction process.Since the literature widely describes the application of many waste materials fromdemolition waste, glass waste, plastic Ô¨Åbers, carbon black from spent tires, alkali-activatedbinders, biomass-derived biomass, and non-carbonized plant-based materials, primarilythe mechanical strength of the modiÔ¨Åed concrete is described [ 149‚Äì152]. So far, in thispaper, focus has been placed mainly on the mechanical properties of green concrete.Agricultural waste shows excellent potential in the building industry, particularly inareas with high agricultural production, which results in enormous environmental liabilitiesin some countries. It can improve the mechanical strength, working performance, anddurability of concrete, as these parameters depend on the number of materials incorporatedin cement. Both agricultural waste and biochar particle application as a concrete Ô¨Ållerreduce waste accumulation and prevent natural resource depletion, reducing environmentalpollution caused by carbon dioxide emissions. However, these materials can be at differentmaturity levels and derived from various regions, so their physicochemical propertiesmay vary, inÔ¨Çuencing the concrete‚Äôs properties. For that reason, natural biomass sourcesrequire pretreatment methods to improve the mechanical properties and durability ofgreen biomass-based waste concrete. At the same time, the mechanical, compressive, andÔ¨Çexural strength along with the stability of the non-carbonized waste-based concrete needsimprovement to increase the loads of the concrete; however, the addition of natural crops orÔ¨Åbers is a lightweight solution. Pyrolyzed biomass acts well as a gravel substitute, making ita promising aggregate, especially for its small size and usually alkali pH that improves thestability of the concrete. That feature enhances the corrosion resistance, especially in steel-reinforced concrete, where the alkali media can delay the corrosion. Hence, the applicationof the carbon-based particles in the concrete seems to be the most promising solution forthe wide availability of biomass waste, physicochemical properties, and low productioncosts. In turn, concrete containing biochar has a lower density than conventional concrete,and consequently, its scope of application is greater. In addition, the compressive strength,Ô¨Çexural strength, and splitting tensile strength in the case of biochar-based concrete presenta substantial increase. Another interesting alternative is the usage of marine brown algaeas a natural polymer in concrete [156].The e-waste can be used as a concrete additive; however, its use requires adequatesafety procedures. E-waste contains many harmful chemicals from heavy metals such aslead, cadmium, and mercury, and many organic compounds that can be easily released intothe soil, water, and air. The concrete-Ô¨Ålled e-waste is still called green as an effective wayto manage the spent electronic materials; however, from the ecological point of view, thattype of concrete is far from the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù approach and requires much more materials andenergy consumption than the other concrete additives. Moreover, the e-waste addition toconcrete seems controversial and non-ecological, and may generate severe health problemsif the harmful materials were to leak under the concrete operation because of exposure toenvironmental elements.Another important environmental issue is connected with the high level of freshwaterconsumption during the manufacturing process of the concrete, in particular in the coun-tries in which the supply of fresh water is limited. Freshwater, a hydration reagent and theion transport medium, can be replaced with recycled water from wastewater. Therefore,wastewater can be used for the concrete preparation, reducing production costs. However,as water is a good solvent, it would need pretreatment depending on the wastewatersource to avoid releasing chemicals that would be harmful to the environment and health.Besides the many concrete applications, steel-reinforced concrete is one of the most widelyused materials in the building industry, and each additive can affect the corrosion of thereinforcement. The application of waste materials also needs to be tested on reinforcedconcrete. Green concrete offers many advantages, such as reducing concrete productiontime, shortening the waiting time for curing, lowering construction costs, and, consequently,Recycling 2022 ,7, 37 17 of 23earlier construction project completion. Still, building regulations, including such data asthe levels of clinker and chemical concrete, the cement‚Äôs composition, or insufÔ¨Åcient dataon the long-term durability of the structure, and the selection of green concrete dependingon its application, are the main challenges in the use of green concrete. The critical issue isalso the development of new and affordable activators.4.2. Future DirectionsDespite the recent developments in building engineering, there is still a need to Ô¨Åll thegap between the laboratory studies and real application. Some of the recommendations forfuture research are: CO 2emission reduction within the green concrete production. Improvement of the waste-modiÔ¨Åed concrete with the controlled properties such asthe chemical composition and morphology of the used waste-based materials with theminimization of the pretreatment energy consumption. 3D printing capability of the green concrete. Light-generating studies enabling application of the green concrete for the light ab-sorption capability and light emission. Durability, compression strength, tensile strength, Ô¨Çexural strength, ion penetration,long-term environmental conditions treatment studies of the modiÔ¨Åed concrete. Improvement of the electrical conductivity and acoustic wave damping of the waste-loaded concrete as intelligent materials for versatile applications. Improvement of long-life cycle of the green concrete and reusability. Investigation of volume change, such as shrinkage and expansion of the waste-modiÔ¨Åed concrete in various experimental conditions such as salinity, humidity, andtemperatures to simulate other geographical regions. Water storage studies and application. Heat storage studies and application in passive buildings. Abrasion resistance, chlorine and sulfate ions resistance, acid resistance, and toughnessof the proposed concrete should also be investigated deeper. One of the most important issues is safety, so despite the leakage studies, the materialsproposed for the concrete application should be carefully selected to reduce the risk ofleakage of harmful chemicals. Improvement of concrete durability, especially towards the seismic damping. Sustainable waste management within the concrete application. IT tools based on ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence towards prediction of the mechanical propertiesof the green concrete. Scalability towards industrial scale application of green concrete.5. ConclusionsGreen concrete opens the possibilities of managing waste materials and applyingthem in practice. Nevertheless, from the environmental perspective, incorporating wastematerials that may leak harmful compounds (waste plastics, some demolition waste, andsome chemicals) generates secondary pollution that can affect health and ecosystems [ 153].So far, the last point should be the most important in the sustainable building industry andit should be prioritized. By mixing waste materials with mortar, green concrete productionis important for energy consumption reduction; still, some solutions are far from greenwhen taking into the consideration the leakage of harmful chemicals into the environmentunder their application in concrete.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, W.U., M.O. and M.G.; methodology, M.O., S.W. and A.P .;writing‚Äîoriginal draft preparation, M.O., A.P ., S.W. and W.U.; writing‚Äîreview and editing, M.O.,A.P ., S.W., W.U. and M.G.; visualization, S.W. and M.O.; supervision, M.G.
