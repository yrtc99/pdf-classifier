EditorialUnravelling mechanisms andimpacts of day respiration in plantleaves: an introduction to aVirtual IssueLeaf respiration plays a key role in plant primary production due toits roles in determining rates of daily net carbon gain, nutrientacquisition, and growth. It is now well-accepted that leaf respira-tion differs considerably between darkness and light, not only inrate but also in its metabolic pathways and biological functions(Tcherkez et al., 2012). As such, it is common practice to usedifferent terms: light (day) and dark (night) respiration, withassociated variables describing their rates, Rlight(Rd) and Rdark(Rn).While leaf dark respiration has been documented for a long time,including its well-known relationship with growth, substratesupply and energy demand (O’Leary et al., 2019), there is stillconsiderable uncertainty about many aspects of day respirationincluding: (1) how to measure the rate Rlight; (2) metabolicmechanisms underlying carbon dioxide (CO 2) release and oxygen(O2) consumption; and (3) its impact on photosynthesis. Thispersistent uncertainty is highly problematic because it affectscalculations of photosynthetic parameters, our understanding ofnitrogen (N) assimilation and how it interacts with photorespira-tion, and calculations of carbon use efﬁciency or gross primaryproduction at the canopy and /or ecosystem scale. This Virtual Issuecompiles 33 articles that provide signiﬁcant advances in addressingthese challenges, propose new techniques to measure Rlight,quantitatively assess the impact of Rlighton calculated rates ofcarbon exchange in leaves, or enhance our understanding about dayrespiration through the documentation of diel patterns in Rdark.Aspeciﬁc review on day respiration can be found in Tcherkez et al.(2017b). Key aspects related to day respiration that are discussed inthis Editorial are summarized in Fig. 1.How to measure Rlight?In mathematical terms, day respiration participates in net photo-synthetic CO 2assimilation ( A) according to:A¼vc/C0voξ/C0Rlight Eqn 1where vcand voare carboxylation and oxygenation velocities,respectively, and ξis the stoichiometric coefﬁcient betweenphotorespiratory O 2consumption and CO 2release (very closeto 2; Abadie et al., 2016). At ﬁrst glance, the role of Rlightininﬂuencing Aseems very simple. However, what is not shown inEqn 1 is the role that variations in Rlightplay in determiningintracellular CO 2concentrations (CO 2mole fraction at carboxy-lation sites, cc)–a parameter that is crucial in determiningobserved rates of net photosynthesis ( A) through the dependenceofvconcc(Farquhar –von Caemmerer –Berry model). Moreover,Rlightcannot be easily determined without the knowledge of ccandthus of internal (mesophyll) conductance ( gm), or any otherparameter that can solve the problem of having several variablesconvoluted in Eqn 1. Historically, two main techniques have beenused to estimate Rlight: the Laisk method and the Kok method(Atkin et al ., 2000). Both methods have advantages anddisadvantages, which are reviewed in Tcherkez et al. (2017a,b).Of particular interest is the Kok method because it is relatively easyto implement and has therefore been used widely in surveys andrapid determinations of Rlight. This method relies on exploitationof the Kok effect, that is, the abrupt change in slope in the A–lightrelationship in the region of very low light (0 –40µmol m–2s–1incident light). The decrease in slope as light intensity increases haslong been interpreted as being a consequence of the inhibition ofrespiration by light reaching a maximum at the irradiance wherethe slope decreases. Hence the technique has been used to estimateRlightby linear extrapolation when taking into account changes inthe intercellular concentration of CO 2(Kirschbaum & Farquhar,1987). The major problem with this method is that there is nodeﬁnitive evidence that the Kok effect is due to the inhibition ofrespiration by light (Tcherkez et al., 2017a). In other words, isRlightobtained with the Kok method actually representative of dayrespiration?Four papers in this Virtual Issue make decisive advances on thequestion of whether Rlightcan be quantiﬁed using the Kok method.A useful starting point for understanding the discussion that followsis the relationship between Aand absorbed irradiance ( Iabs)explained further in Yin et al.

Eqn 2 shows that an apparent change in slope in the A–Iabsrelationship can come from either photosynthetic parameters(typically a,Φorcc/Γ*) or a dependence of Rlightwith Iabs. Using amodelling exercise, Farquhar & Busch (2017) proposed that achange in cc/Γ*when irradiance varies in the low light region caneffectively explain part, if not all, of the Kok effect. Thisassumption was experimentally tested by Buckley et al. (2017),who found that in broad bean ( Vicia faba ) leaves, there is a limitedimpact of both internal conductance and oxygen mole fraction(and thus Γ*) on the Kok effect. This ﬁnding suggests that theeffect of cc/Γ*is insufﬁcient to explain the Kok effect. Moreover,using a semi-empirical determination of internal conductance tocalculate ccand an analysis of the light dependence of aΦ, Yin et al.(2020) showed that in sunﬂower ( Helianthus annuus ) leaves,changes in cc/Γ*andaΦwere responsible for c. 25% and 11% ofthe change in slope in the Kok effect, respectively. Taken together,these results represent a major advance because they support theview that the Kok effect is, at least in part, a real respiratoryphenomenon (i.e. Rlightdecreases with increasing irradiance). Togain insight on the metabolic basis of the Kok effect, Gauthier et al.(2020) carried out measurements on sunﬂower leaves labelled with13C-glucose. Using metabolic analyses, they showed that in the lowirradiance region, there were light-dependent changes in metabolicﬂuxes, with a progressive increase in decarboxylating activities asIabsdecreased. Interestingly, pathways other than the tricarboxylicacid pathway (TCAP) appeared to be involved, such as malatecatabolism (by malic enzyme), perhaps indicating that the Kokeffect is linked to metabolic changes associated with the onset oflight-enhanced dark respiration. Taken as whole, we now have afuller picture of the Kok effect, with it being a consequence ofmultiple factors, including the irradiance dependence of the CO2mole fraction at carboxylation sites ( cc), quantum yield ( aΦ) andRlight. That is, Kok-derived estimates are not entirely representativeofRlight.Given that the Kok effect is unlikely to be due solely toirradiance-dependent changes in respiratory metabolism, thequestion arises of what might be a better method for measuringRlight. Three new methods are proposed in this Virtual Issue. Gonget al. (2018) took advantage of the slow turnover of respiratorysubstrates to calculate Rlightusing an isotopic disequilibriumapproach. That is, when the isotope composition of CO 2of theatmosphere is changed abruptly, day respired-CO 2has the isotopecomposition of ‘old’ substrates for some time and this represents anexcellent opportunity to extract the value of Rlight. One advantage ofthis technique is that it is independent of gm, thus providing a way ofestimating Rlight, and in turn, assisting in calculating values of gmandcc.Berghuijs et al . (2019) elaborated on the 2D model ofphotosynthetic cells described in Berghuijs et al. (2017) and usedobserved values of Ato predict maximal carboxylation ( Vcmax) andRlightby ﬁtting.

However, as always with geometric models,users must remain conscious that Rlightestimates are highly sensitiveto calculated electron transport ( J) and the chosen value of Γ*.The method proposed by Moualeu-Ngangue et al. (2017) takesadvantage of an A–cicurve ﬁtting where ﬂuorescence and gasexchange measurements are made in parallel. Here, the inputparameters are A,Φ, incident light and ci, while Rlightis a ﬁttedparameter, as well as Vcmax,Jand photosystem photon absorptionparameters combined in a unique variable, denoted as τ. This studyis very helpful because it clearly demonstrates that while estimatingRlightis technically possible using photosynthetic response curves,there are many instances where ﬁtted Rlightvalues equal zero. Inaddition, Rlightvalues are generally lower than that those foundusing ﬁtting methods that assume a constant gm. In other words, thepersisting problem of mathematical interdependency betweenRlightandcc(and thus gm) mentioned above (Eqn 1) cannot be easilyovercome: alternative techniques independent of Jorccare requiredto estimate Rlight, like the isotope disequilibrium techniqueproposed by Gong et al. (2018).A further question that needs to be considered is what effectvariations in Rlighthave on calculated photosynthetic parameters?This question is of importance because photosynthetic capacity isessential for photosynthetic modelling (when scaling up from leavesto whole ecosystems) and perhaps, calculated photosyntheticparameters are not very sensitive to Rlightvalues. A comprehensiveanalysis of internal conductance showed that across plant lineages,gmestimates are not very sensitive to the chosen value of Rlightbetween 0.5 and 1.5 µmol m–2s–1, with variations in Rlightleadingto less than 10% changes in gm(Xiong & Flexas, 2020). By contrast,estimating Vcmaxappears to be very sensitive to the chosen Rlightvalue, particularly when using the one-point Asatmethod (DeKauwe et al., 2016). Because of this, there is a much betteragreement between Vcmaxvalues calculated from A–cicurves andAsat,when observed values of Rlightare used instead of assumedvalues (e.g. Rlight=1.5% of Vcmax) (De Kauwe et al., 2016).Day respiratory metabolismA critical question is the origin of CO 2produced by day respiration,not only because it may impact on the12C/13C natural isotopecomposition but also because it reﬂects metabolic pathwaysmobilized by respiratory metabolism and the use of storedmetabolites (reserves). In fact, it is important to remember thatmany pathways can generate CO2such as plastidial and mito-chondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, the TCAP, the γ-aminobu-tyrate (GABA) shunt, the malic enzyme or cytosolic pentosephosphates (reviewed in Tcherkez et al., 2017b). Articles in thisVirtual Issue provide very useful information on the origin of CO2generated by day respiration.Gauthier et al. (2020) show that under low irradiance, the carbonﬂux through malic enzyme contributes to Rlight. Under moderateirradiance,13C labelling and NMR analyses show that the TCAPmakes a rather small contribution to day respiratory CO 2efﬂux andis linked to N assimilation via glutamate synthesis (Abadie et al.,2017), while the contribution of pyruvate dehydrogenase prevails(Lothier et al., 2019), as found previously (Tcherkez et al., 2008).The relatively low contribution of the TCAP to CO 2evolution isnot only linked to the capture of TCAP intermediates to feed Nassimilation but also related to the down-regulation of TCAPenzyme activity in the light (Tcherkez et al., 2012). This effect isnicely illustrated in Ahmad Rashid et al . (2020) wheremetabolomics were used to show the opposite behavior of citrateplus aconitate (which is more abundant at night) and other TCAPintermediates (more abundant in the light). Also, in mitochondrialmutants affected in Complex I activity, rates of day respiration arehigher, due to pyruvate dehydrogenase activity being higher whileanaplerotic bicarbonate ﬁxation by phospho enolpyruvate carboxy-lase (PEPc) is lower (Lothier et al., 2019). This raises the question ofthe inﬂuence of PEPc on observed rates of Rlight. That is, Rlightcanbe viewed as a net efﬂux resulting from CO 2production bycatabolism, reﬁxation (accounted for in calculations reviewedabove) and PEPc activity. Direct assessment of PEPc ﬁxation bylabelling shows that the ﬂux is moderate under ordinary conditionsbut can reach 1 µmol m–2s–1or more at high photorespiration(Abadie & Tcherkez, 2019). Conversely, the bicarbonate leaf poolcould reform CO2by acid-base equilibration and this couldcontribute to CO 2efﬂux. Feeding cut poplar ( Populus deltoides )leaves with13C-bicarbonate shows that the contribution ofbicarbonate to Rlightis very small, only up to 20% when bicarbonateis fed with concentrations as high as 11 mM (Stutz & Hanson,2019).Processes in which respiration plays a role were summarized andhierarchized in ‘core principles’ by O’Leary et al. (2019). In brief,these principles relate to: (1) metabolic functions (ATP and NADHenergy generation, carbon skeleton synthesis, redox balancing); (2)metabolic ﬂexibility (alternative routes); (3) regulation with supply(sugars, intracellular ADP regeneration) and demand (such as ATPutilization); (4) effects of plant life cycle (such as carbon investmentin growth at different developmental stages); and (5) its roles inacclimation to environmental parameters such as temperature, ortolerance to salinity (Munns et al., 2020). These ﬁve principles arerelevant to day respiration (as they are to dark respiration). Here,special emphasis can be given to aspect (1) because in leaves,nutrient assimilation takes place in the light and thus the generationof carbon skeletons needed by N and S assimilation is essential(electron utilization for N and S assimilation is further discussed inTcherkez & Limami, 2019). Mitochondrial metabolism is alsoimportant for redox homeostasis since excess redox power andphotorespiratory-derived NADH can be consumed by the mito-chondria via NADH re-oxidation through the respiratory electronchain (via the alternative and cytochrome pathways). In Dahal et al.(2015) and Dahal & Vanlerberghe (2017), Rlightwas estimatedusing the Kok method during progressive drought in either wild-type plants or alternative oxidase (AOX) knock-down mutants orover-expressors. Interestingly, Rlightwas found to decrease underdrought but this decline is not observed in over-expressors. Inaddition, there was a negative relationship between electron©2021 The Authors.

While the link between these results and theregulation of catabolism (decarboxylations) remains to be eluci-dated, these studies suggest that there is a beneﬁcial effect of theelectron ﬂow via AOX to sustain PSII function, i.e. mitigation ofelectron pressure in the chloroplast. Similarly, at high irradiance,the engagement of the AOX (measured with16O/18O respiratorydiscrimination in the dark) seems to be beneﬁcial for PSIIphotochemistry across four species (Florez-Sarasa et al., 2016).How does day respiration respond to environmentalconstraints?There is relatively little practical data on how day respiration varieswith environmental conditions. In the recent past, the relationshipbetween dark or day respiration, temperature and CO2has beenexamined (e.g. Ayub et al., 2014) and surveys across differentbiomes have been carried out (e.g. Heskel et al., 2016). However,the response of Rlightto temperature, growth CO 2mole fractionand nutrients is not very well known, and furthermore, it is possiblethat the response to such environmental parameters varies whendifferent techniques are used to measure Rlight.A number of studies on Rdarkare included in this Virtual Issuesince they provide information on how Rlightmay respond toenvironmental parameters. For instance, Vcmaxcalculated from Asatat different temperatures requires the knowledge of Rlight; in caseswere Rlightestimates are not available, one can use Rdarkas asurrogate. Possible uncertainties in doing so are discussed in Atkinet al. (2015). The response of photosynthesis and Rdarkto keyparameters involved in climate change (temperature and CO 2)i sthoroughly reviewed in Dusenge et al. (2019). The impact oftemperature was also explored in Aspinwall et al.(2016) where dailyaverage air temperature and prevailing leaf temperature were foundto have contrasting effects on Rdark. In addition, Aspinwall et al.(2016) provides the surprising result that the Rdark:Asatratio (atprevailing leaf temperature in each growth treatment) wasnegatively related to total nonstructural carbohydrates, suggestingthat carbon partitioning to respiration changed as Aincreased. It isworth noting that in the short-term (i.e. minutes to hours), it hasalso been shown with isotopic labelling that the carbon allocation toTCAP intermediates in illuminated leaves is not proportional to therate of assimilation, with allocation to the TCAP being lower underconditions that increase assimilation rates (i.e. conditions thatlower photorespiration) (Abadie et al., 2018).This Virtual Issue also comprises highly valuable articles thatdirectly address day respiration and include measurements of Rlightunder different environmental conditions. Way et al. (2019)looked at the response of day respiration to temperature in forestred gum ( Eucalyptus tereticornis ) both in the short-term (via rapidchanges in leaf measurement temperature) and in the long-term(via a comparison of plants grown at different temperatures). Dueto acclimation, there was little effect of growth temperature on Rlight(and Rdark) taking place at the prevailing temperature of eachenvironment, regardless of whether the Laisk or the Kok methodwas used. There was also little effect of growth temperature on Rlightcalculated from A–cicurve ﬁtting (Kumarathunge et al., 2019). Incontrast to earlier studies pointing to leaf respiration being lesstemperature sensitive in the light than in darkness (Atkin et al.,2005, and references therein), recent work reported in this VirtualIssue found that Rlightwas more sensitive than Rdarkto measuredtemperature, with higher Q10values. Interestingly, Rlightobtainedwith the Laisk method was sometimes negative (net CO 2ﬁxation),perhaps showing the prevalence of PEPc ﬁxation (mentionedabove) over catabolic decarboxylation at low temperature (Wayet al., 2019). This quite complicated effect of temperature isimportant to keep in mind, particularly when attempting to predicthow rates of nonphotorespiratory CO2release in the light respondto short- and long-term changes in temperature. When thetemperature varies, Rlightis the result of both changes in the degreeof inhibition of respiration by light (i.e. the extent to which Rlightdiffers from Rdark) and thermal acclimation, and thus bothphenomena may affect computations of plant, ecosystem or globalCO2net exchange (Heskel et al., 2013; Vanderwel et al., 2015).The effect of neglecting the inhibition of respiration by light hasbeen examined precisely using whole canopy CO2exchange inforest gum trees by Drake et al. (2016). They found that whileautotrophic respiration ( Ra) is visibly lower (on average by 21%)when light inhibition is accounted for, gross primary production(GPP) and the Ra: GPP ratio are only impacted by a few percent(and the dependence on temperature is also minimally affected).In addition to temperature, nutrient availability is also afundamental parameter that dictates respiration rate, and this notonly includes N but also phosphorus (P), sulphur (S) or potassium(Tcherkez, 2017). Using a survey across many species of differentlife forms grown under contrasted N /P conditions, Crous et al.(2017) demonstrated the relationship between Rlight(measuredwith the Kok method and expressed per leaf surface area) and N andP elemental content (per leaf surface area). It is worth noting thatRdarkhas also been found to be related to N and P content (per leafsurface area) in a survey of tropical trees, also included in thisVirtual Issue (Rowland et al., 2017). The relationship betweenRlightand N and P seems to be speciﬁc to these nutrients since thereis no correlation between Rlightand leaf mass per surface area (Crouset al., 2017), unlike Rdark(Rowland et al., 2017). Interestingly, thedataset of Crous et al. (2017) did not reveal a close relationshipbetween RlightandRdark, with Rlight<Rdarkin 84% of cases andRlight>Rdarkin 16% of cases. When the dataset is restricted tomeasurements where Rlight<Rdark, the average Rlight:Rdarkratio isabout 0.64 (i.e. 36% inhibition) which falls within the range ofvalues commonly observed. Furthermore, the rather unusualsituation where Rlight>Rdarkis associated with signiﬁcantly largerAmax(per unit of mass), lower N elemental content (per leaf surfacearea) and concerns more herbs than woody species. Collectively,these observations suggest a possible link between nitrogen useefﬁciency (and /or C : N ratio) and day respiration –a topic thatrequires further work in the future. In addition, Clemente-Morenoet al. (2020) present an interesting correlation analysis betweenmitochondrial electron chain capacity via the cytochrome pathway(assayed in the dark using16O/18O fractionation) and somemetabolites (quantiﬁed in leaves sampled in the light), usingAntarctic pearlwort ( Colobathus quitensis ) and a temperate coun-terpart of the same family, rainbow pink ( Dianthus chinensis ).

Of course, measuring Rlightremains challengingand most methods have their drawbacks. Importantly, the paperspresented in this Virtual Issue have helped in identifying andaddressing such problems. Moreover, this Virtual Issue combinespapers that deal with modelling, biochemistry and physiologicalexperiments. Such a combination reﬂects the fact that: (1) couplingdifferent approaches (trans-disciplinarity) is critical to the provi-sion of signiﬁcant advances; and (2) classical physiology such as gasexchange remains essential and must not be overlooked despite theincreasing role played by next-generation omics in plant science.ORCIDOwen K.
