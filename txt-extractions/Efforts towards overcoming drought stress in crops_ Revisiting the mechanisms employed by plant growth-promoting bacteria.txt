However, several variables,including improper mechanization, limited arable land, and the presenceof several biotic and abiotic pressures, continually impact agriculturalproductivity. Drought is a notable destructive abiotic stress and may bethe most serious challenge confronting sustainable agriculture, resultingin a signiﬁcant crop output deﬁciency. Numerous morphological andphysiological changes occur in plants as a result of drought stress. Hence,there is a need to create mitigation techniques since these changes mightpermanently harm the plant. Current methods used to reduce the effects ofdrought stress include the use of ﬁlm farming, super-absorbent hydrogels,nanoparticles, biochar, and drought-resistant plant cultivars. However, mostof these activities are money and labor-intensive, which offer limited plantimprovement. The use of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) hasproven to be a preferred method that offers several indirect and directadvantages in drought mitigation. PGPB are critical biological elements whichhave favorable impacts on plants’ biochemical and physiological features,leading to improved sugar production, relative water content, leaf number,ascorbic acid levels, and photosynthetic pigment quantities. This presentreview revisited the impacts of PGPB in ameliorating the detrimental effectsof drought stress on plants, explored the mechanism of action employed, aswell as the major challenges encountered in their application for plant growthand development.KEYWORDSdrought, food production, phytohormones, plant growth promotion, sustainabilityFrontiers in Microbiology 01 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 2Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427IntroductionAmong the main abiotic pressures endangering foodsecurity, drought is one of the most damaging and catastrophic.Drought stress has detrimental consequences for social,economic, and environmental systems, including forests,shrubs, and grasslands. Recent ﬁndings suggest droughts haveserious impacts on the pools, processes and ﬂuxes of terrestrialcarbon and nitrogen cycles in these three ecosystem types(Deng et al., 2021). Drought is also expected to aﬀect plantgrowth and agricultural output in more than half of arableareas by 2050 under the present climate change scenario (Kasimet al., 2013). Therefore, drought is a complex abiotic stressthat aﬀects plants from the to the molecular levels, resultingin yield loss (Wang X. et al., 2016; Kaur and Asthir, 2017). Itseﬀects on food security are, however, being addressed globallyviacomprehensive measures (Grover et al., 2011).Farmers deal with drought as a serious issue yearly. Droughtis a natural occurrence that is brought on and sustainedover an extended period by a lack of fresh water supply tomeet human and ecological demands (Balint et al., 2013).Monitoring drought is often diﬃcult as it is typically notconﬁned to a particular time frame or an area (Salehi-Lisarand Bakhshayeshan-Agdam, 2016). This multifaceted stressmostly emanates from declining rainfall and a subsequentdry spell. Drought stress is divided into four diﬀerent types:hydrological, meteorological, socio-economic, and agriculturaldrought (Ahluwalia et al., 2021). Hydrological drought takesplace in locations with a scarce and limited supply of watersupply, notably on the ground and surface levels. Meteorologicaldrought takes place in locations with dry weather; socio-economic drought takes place in situations where there is anintense scarce and low supply of water; agricultural droughtis often linked to a reduction in the level of soil water levelsand consequent crop failures, majorly aﬀecting the global foodproduction (Heim and Richard, 2002; Ahluwalia et al., 2021).Aside the fact that it aﬀects global food production,drought also causes water quality deterioration, worsens soilerosion, and disasters such as ﬂoods, ﬁres, and the spread ofdiseases. According to the 2018 report of the United NationsWorld Water Development, an estimated 55 million people areimpacted by drought globally, and 700 million people mightbe displaced because of it by 2030 (WWAP, 2018). The socio-economic eﬀects of drought also result in signiﬁcant ﬁnanciallosses. For instance, the prolonged California drought resultedin around 3.8 billion dollars in agricultural losses, with 1.7billion dollars in crop income losses between 2014 and 2016(Howitt et al., 2015). Similar to this, the 2005 Spain’s Ebro RiverBasin drought had an estimated economic of about 0.57 billiondollars (Juana et al., 2014).Interestingly, cultivars that can withstand drought stress,genetic engineering procedures, crop calendar adjustments,and resource management practices have all been studiedextensively across the world as potential solutions to alleviatemoisture stress, however, a number of these techniques areonerous (Philippot et al., 2013). Nevertheless, these methodsare costly, stressful, consume more time and may result in theloss of the desired feature in the host’s gene pool (Philippotet al., 2013). Furthermore, under the terms and conditionsof national rules, genetically altered plants are not readilyapproved (Kasim et al., 2013). In this way, microbes arean underappreciated contributor to increasing plant droughtresistance (Kang et al., 2014b; Singh et al., 2016). As a result, afocus on sustainable agriculture, food security, and protectionof the environment improves when utilizing the potential ofbeneﬁcial microorganisms, such as plant growth-promotingbacteria or PGPB (Ilangumaran and Smith, 2017). Screeningand selection of drought stress tolerance PGPB and its usage inplants, according to Kaushal and Wani (2016), might assist toovercome productivity barriers in drylands.Furthermore, PGPB, which are natural soil inhabitantsof the rhizosphere as well as excellent colonizers of plantinternal compartments and surfaces, may eﬃciently overcomethe harmful eﬀects of drought stress in plants (Sati et al., 2022).Azospirillum ,Azotobacter ,Bacillus ,Klebsiella ,Paenibacillus ,Pseudomonas ,Rhizobium , and Serratia , are the popular plant-associated PGPB genera (Abdelaal et al., 2021). Of course,other PGPB genera have shown beneﬁcial abilities to amelioratedrought stress in plants (Manjunatha et al., 2022). There arenovel and new strains, which are emerging with new and broadpotential as bioinoculants, showing that most of these bacteriacan improve growth characteristics and yield parameters inmost crops exposed to diﬀerent abiotic stresses under naturalcircumstances through the synthesis of phytohormones, aminoacids, enhancement of nutrient availability and nitrogen ﬁxation(Alkahtani et al., 2020a,b).Through the production of indole acetic acid (IAA),gibberellins, cytokinins, siderophores, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and numerous importantnutrients, such as manganese, zinc, and phosphorus, PGPB canconvert infertile soils to fertile soils and boost the adaptionof a plant to drought stress and other numerous stressessuch as light, extreme temperatures, salinity, and diseases.Many plant crops, such as wheat, rice, bean, tomato, andmaize (García et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020), can beneﬁt fromthe application of PGP microorganisms because they increasethe availability of nutrients. Overall, plant growth-promotingbacteria as biofertilizers oﬀer a low-cost, environmentallyacceptable method of enhancing the development and growthof plants under drought circumstances, making them a crucialtool in facilitating sustainable agriculture (Sarkar and Rakshit,2020). PGPB are also known to increase the growth and yieldof plants as well as agricultural sustainability. This presentreview concentrated on the impact and mechanisms of actionemployed by plant growth-promoting bacteria in the mitigationof drought stress in crop plants. It further discussed theFrontiers in Microbiology 02 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 3Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427challenges encountered in the use of PGPB for plant growth anddevelopment as well as in sustainable agriculture.Impacts of drought stress on plantgrowth and healthDrought stress has a signiﬁcant impact on plant metabolismat all levels, including molecular, morphophysiological, andbiochemical (Wang X. et al., 2016). Dehydration producedby moisture stress aﬀects plant metabolic activities such asrespiration, chlorophyll content decrease, sugar metabolism,photosynthesis, and nutrient translocation (Dos Reis et al.,2012). Moisture stress also reduces cell water potential andcauses the closure of the stomata, which aﬀects the growthand cell elongation. Several crops, including maize, rice, wheat,and barley have been extensively researched under droughtstress (Laﬁtte et al., 2006; Vardharajula et al., 2011). Accordingto Kaur and Asthir (2017), drought stress occurring duringthe reproductive period might cause blooming to be disrupted,resulting in yield loss.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals, some ofwhich include hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, andhydroxyl radicals are released as a result of drought stress(Figure 1 ). In plants, greater levels of ROS cause membranedegeneration, lipid peroxidation, nucleic acid, protein, and lipiddegradation (Nair et al., 2008). Drought stress causes an increasein the production of ethylene, which is synthesized in responseto abiotic stress (Narayanasamy et al., 2020). However, becauseof the promotion of chlorosis, senescence, and leaf abscission,such an elevated ethylene concentration is harmful to normalplant health and growth. Moisture stress relief is more importantthan ever to attain food security, given the consequences ofmoisture deﬁciency stress and the constantly rising demand forfood. As a result, leveraging the potentials of plant and soil-related microorganisms to deal with the negative impacts ofdrought stress has gotten a lot of attention as a way of boostingcrop output (Y ang et al., 2009).Plant microbes: An intersectionbetween drought stress and planthealthPlant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) are free-living in soil and are associated with the rhizosphere, rhizoplane,phyllosphere, and endosphere (Babalola et al., 2020; Fadiji andBabalola, 2020a; Fadiji et al., 2020). The roles of endophyticbacteria are less well-reported as rhizospheric as PGPMs inthe promotion of plant growth (Bashan and De-Bashan, 2005;Bashan et al., 2014; Fadiji et al., 2021; Sarkar et al., 2022).Plant development is aided by PGPM’s acquisition of nutrientsand secretion of phytohormones. In addition, priming of cropplants with PGPM boosts resistance to a variety of stresses,such as salt stress, heavy metals contamination, and drought(Sarkar and Rakshit, 2020; Fadiji et al., 2022; Sarkar et al., 2022).Furthermore, certain PGPMs are biocontrol agents, promotingplant development by inhibiting phytopathogens (Orhan, 2016).Plant-growth-promoting bacteria also have several actionmechanisms, such as siderophore production, ACC deaminaseactivity, excretion of cell wall degrading enzymes, quorumquenching, and antibiotics which assures induced systemictolerance (IST) and induced systemic resistance (ISR) inplants to both biotic and abiotic stressors (Olanrewajuet al., 2017; Fadiji and Babalola, 2020a; Akanmu et al.,2021; Sarkar and Rakshit, 2021). Agrobacterium ,Bacillus ,Bradyrhizobium , Burkholderia , Caulobacter , Erwinia ,Pseudomonas , and Rhizobium are among the well-studiedPGPB (De Souza Vandenberghe et al., 2017).Plant growth-promoting bacteriaPlant-growth-promoting bacteria are members of thecommunity of microbes associated with plants ﬂourishing ina variety of environments. To increase their growth, thesemicrobes consume organic compounds from the rhizosphereof plants, some of these include sugars (trehalose), and aminoacids like glutamine and betaine, among others. Intracellularand extracellular PGPB are the two types (Y adav, 2010).Intracellular PGPB are bacteria that promote plant developmentbut only on the interior of the root surface/rhizoplane root.Likewise, extracellular PGPB boost growth characteristics andthe root surface colonization area or the cortex’s intercellularspace (Abdelaal et al., 2021). Endophytic growth was initiallyidentiﬁed as a very advanced stage of the bacterial lifecyclein 1926 (Hennig, 1940; Fadiji and Babalola, 2020b). Afterwhich several endophytes were similarly identiﬁed from planttissues that had been surface-disinfected (Mondal et al.,2020). Azospirillum ,Azotobacter ,Bacillus ,Erwinia ,Micrococcus ,Pseudomonas , and Serratia , are among the extracellular PGPB,whereas Rhizobia such as Mesorhizobium ,Bradyrhizobium , andAllorhizobium , alongside Frankia , are among the intercellularPGPB (Rai et al., 2020).Endophytic bacteria are symbionts that spend most of theirlives within the tissues of the plant without causing harm to theirhost (Abdelaal et al., 2021) and may be isolated from the interiortissues of the plant (Odoh et al., 2020). Plant development canbe aided by PGPB through direct or indirect methods. Increasednutrient availability, such as nitrogen, iron, and phosphorus,alongside increased phytohormone synthesis, is used for thedirect enhancement of plant growth (Rastegari et al., 2020).Tolerance to a variety of phytopathogens is developed by anindirect process including antagonistic eﬀects (Glick, 2014).The direct strategy of PGPB includes secretion of siderophoresFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 4Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427FIGURE 1A diagrammatic representation of the responses of plants to drought stress.

Furthermore, the production ofantibiotics such as pyoluteorin, phenazines, hydrogen cyanide,phloroglucinols, and pyrrolnitrin, alongside bacteriocins andsiderophores, has been shown to aid not only in the inhibitionof phytopathogen development (Y adav and Y adav, 2018) butalso in the improvement of plant’s tolerance to various stresses(Abdelaal, 2015). It has been proposed that the inoculationof bacteria and other plant growth-promoting organisms(consortia) may also have additive or synergistic eﬀects on plantgrowth and health (Santoyo et al., 2021).Drought stress in millet was alleviated by bacterial strainsisolated from foxtail millet in a semi-arid agroecosystem thatproduced EPS and ACC deaminase (Niu et al., 2018). Drought-tolerant bacteria, such as B. endophyticus ,B. tequilensis ,and P. aeruginosa increased tolerance to drought stress inArabidopsis seedlings by secreting EPS and phytohormones(Ghosh et al., 2019). Ilyas et al. (2020) also reported thatB. subtilis and A. brasilense produced signiﬁcant quantities ofosmolytes and EPS that increased plant drought tolerance inwheat. The co-inoculation of these microorganisms resulted ingreater levels of ABA, proline and EPS synthesis, as well aschanges in stress-induced phytohormone levels. However, inresponse to plants under osmotic stress, germination of seeds,growth of the plant, and seedling vigor index, all increased inresponse to the inoculation of these microbes (Ilyas et al., 2020).Drought tolerance in Medicago truncatula infected withSinorhizobium sp. was increased by upregulating translationof the jasmonic acid signaling pathway and downregulatingethylene production (Staudinger et al., 2016). Also, whencompared to untreated drought-stressed control plants, potatoplants treated with B. subtilis HAS31 showed greater solubleproteins, total soluble sugars and chlorophyll, as well as higherperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase enzyme activityunder drought stress (Batool et al., 2020).The impact ofplant-growth-promoting bacteria inameliorating drought stressThe usefulness of microbial inoculations for promotingplant development exposed to drought stress has beeninvestigated in several studies (Abdelaal et al., 2021;Frontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 5Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427Santoyo et al., 2021). PGPB are well-known for boostingthe development of a variety of plants under harsh conditions,including vegetables, grains, and legumes (Sandhya et al., 2010;Abdelaal et al., 2021; Fadiji et al., 2022). PGPB are used tolessen the negative eﬀects of environmental pressures on plantgrowth and production, through the enhancement of nutrientabsorption and increasing tolerance to environmental stress(Ngumbi and Kloepper, 2016). Numerous studies have shownthat rhizobacteria can assist to mitigate the harmful eﬀects ofdiﬀerent stressors on crop development (Curá et al., 2017).Drought is one of the most damaging conditions aﬀectingplant productivity in semiarid and arid areas (Maheswari et al.,2013). PGPB are useful and beneﬁcial for enhancing plantdevelopment exposed to drought stress (Nadeem et al., 2010,2014), because rhizobacteria may create exopolysaccharides likecellulose and alginate, which are known to aid drought tolerance(Zahir et al., 2009; Glick, 2014). Exopolysaccharides may thusplay a crucial role in stress reduction for both microbial andplant populations under drought conditions.Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are known for the formation ofa zone of attachment between soil particles, root systems andbacteria themselves. A few PGPB creates EPS, which may beused as a barrier for protection for the roots and also aidplant development in salinity-stressed conditions (Y ang et al.,2016). Biopriming of quinoa seed with Bacillus sp. MN54 andEnterobacter sp. MN17 and resulted in better plant developmentunder drought environments (400 mM NaCl) (Atouei et al.,2019). Furthermore, B. subtilis inaquosorum and Marinobacterlypoliticus SM19 were shown to mitigate the eﬀect of salinityand drought stresses in soybean (Miransari and Smith, 2009).Genistein (a nod gene inducer) was reported to increase soybeangrowth and nodulation, and such eﬀects became greater underhigh salinity levels over time.Lipo-chitooligosaccharides are also secreted by PGPB; thesecompounds are produced by rhizobia and stimulated byﬂavonoids found in root exudates. Bradyrhizobium japonicum532C inoculated soybean increased growth under salinity anddrought stress (Gepstein and Glick, 2013). Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide that is present in plants, bacteria, fungi,and insects. It aids plant tolerance to abiotic conditions suchas salt and drought stresses. Trehalose is known to be a stablemolecule that is highly resistant to acidity and temperatures; itcan also ameliorate the eﬀects of drought and salt stresses byavoiding protein aggregation and breakdown of protein, whichhappens under a variety of stress conditions (Jalili et al., 2009).The enhancement of plant growth under drought stressmay be a result of ACC-deaminase produced by certain strainsof PGPB, an enzyme that improves the absorption of someessential nutrients such as K, N, and P , thereby enhancingthe growth of plants grown under diﬀerent environmentalconditions (Vaishnav et al., 2016). Application of the PGPBA. brasilense and H. seropedicae improved drought tolerance inmaize (Curá et al., 2017); the positive outcome recorded may bea result of an increment in water use eﬃciency and enhancedactivity of antioxidant enzymes exposed to drought stress.Additionally, PGPB boosts growth characteristics bygenerating plant growth hormones such as cytokinins (CKs),gibberellins (GAs), and IAA which increase nitrogen ﬁxationand promote nutrient absorption (Tiwari et al., 2020).Furthermore, due to the buildup of abscisic acid (ABA), PGPBplays an important role in reducing drought stress resistance.PGPB, on the other hand, accumulates osmoprotectants andantioxidants, which might help root development in responseto stress (Sharma et al., 2019). The synthesis of IAA byAzospirillum species resulted in better root development andincreased lateral root formation under drought (Zahir et al.,2009). Under drought stress, inoculating Lavandula dentatewith B. thuringiensis resulted in improved metabolic activityand nutrient absorption in plants (Vurukonda et al., 2016).Inoculation with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species alsoacclimated grapevine and Arabidopsis plants to drought stress(Armada et al., 2016). In Platycladus orientalis , foliar treatmentofBacillus stimulates stomatal conductance, increment inABA, and increases water content under drought conditions(Radhakrishnan et al., 2014).In another research, Pseudomonas inoculation of soybeanplants increased the stem height, and fresh weight underdrought stress, with similar increases in ABA, and salicylic acid(SA) concentrations, in contrast to the control (Abdelaal et al.,2021). Furthermore, the use of A. brasilense and H. seropedicaein wheat cultivars resulted in increased drought tolerance,membrane stability, and relative water content (Xu et al., 2018),all of which were linked to a variety of mechanisms such asosmolyte accumulation, ACC-deaminase activity, antioxidantactivation and hormonal activity (Barnawal et al., 2017). Thebuildup of proline and numerous suitable solutes like osmolytesis said to mediate the beneﬁcial eﬀects of PGPB on plantslike barley, especially in the enhancement of tolerance tostress (Saikia et al., 2018). Under drought stress, PGPB candirectly or indirectly promote ACC deaminase activity, whichboosts plant growth (Cakmakci et al., 2007). This method isdependent on PGPB consuming ACC before it is oxidized byplant-produced ACC oxidases. As a result of their ability toreduce ethylene concentrations, PGPB may be a good source ofstress tolerance and growth promoters (Santoyo et al., 2016).PGPB were shown to increase plant development in wheatby increasing the activity of ACC deaminase and controllingethylene levels (Din et al., 2019). Drought-tolerant PGPB whichcan produce ACC deaminase, inoculated into maize seedlings,enhanced drought tolerances and boosted water and nutrientintake from the soil, resulting in improved plant development(Mohamed et al., 2019).In a similar report, Bhattacharyya and Jha (2012) found thatapplying Pseudomonas sp. 4MKS8 to maize plants increasedagronomic features such as root elongation. Furthermore,inoculation with Enterobacter cloacae 2WC2 helped inoculatedFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 6Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427plants under water stress maintain their water content anddevelop their root system (Casanovas et al., 2002). Droughtstress increased electrolyte leakage and catalase activity inmaize genotype TP 30, alongside damage to the membrane,which might be attributable to oxidative stress. In maize plantsexposed to drought stress, Bacillus spp. treatment resulted inreduced electrolyte leakage, membrane damage, and improvedmembrane stability as a result of elevated activity of anantioxidant enzyme (Vardharajula et al., 2011). PGPB canreduce the side eﬀects of salt and drought stress by producingACC deaminase, cytokinin, trehalose, exopolysaccharides,organic compounds, and abscisic acid (Forni et al., 2017). PGPBhave been found as a promising way of boosting the yield andgrowth of drought-stressed crops ( Table 1 ).Potential mechanisms used byplant growth-promoting bacteriain mitigating drought stressInduced systemic tolerance (IST) refers to a microorganism-mediated response to abiotic stress responses of agriculturalplants. Drought stress is mitigated by the plant-associatedmicrobiome, which has innate genetic and metaboliccharacteristics (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2015). Many plant-associated microorganisms from the genera Azospirillum ,Bacillus ,Enterobacter ,Methylobacterium , and Pseudomonas(Vardharajula et al., 2011; Tiwari et al., 2016; Abdelaalet al., 2021), have been well-studied for their importancein the enhancement of drought tolerance and plant growthimprovement. The plausible explanations for plant-associatedbacteria-induced tolerance to drought stress are (1) rootarchitecture modiﬁcation (2) phytohormones production suchas cytokinin, gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, and auxins (3)production of ACC deaminase for ethylene stress reduction,(4) production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inducedsystemic tolerance, and (5) exopolysaccharides production(Dimkpa et al., 2009; Vurukonda et al., 2016; Figure 2 ).Plant-associated microorganisms also improve stresstolerance in plants by antioxidant production, modulatingdrought stress-adaptive genes, metabolite and osmolytesynthesis (Jalili et al., 2009). Apart from plants’ capacity tosupport the colonization of the free-living PGPB populationin the soil, the eﬃciency of PGPB in drought stress tolerancemight be connected to interactions between the type of soil andPGPB strains. The function of PGPB-mediated moisture stressresistance is also inﬂuenced by the duration and degree of stress,alongside the stage of development of the plant during droughtexposure (Ngumbi and Kloepper, 2016). There is a huge numberof ﬁndings available that explained mechanisms used by PGPBin mitigating the drought stress in crop plants ( Table 2 ).Osmolytes concentration in enhancingdrought stress tolerancePlants’ osmolarity concentration has been changed becauseof adverse environmental circumstances, which has hamperedtheir development and survival. For minimizing dehydrationloss caused by moisture stress, osmotic adjustment and thebuildup of suitable solutes are required. Sugars, polyaminesbetaine, proline, quaternary ammonium compounds, aminoacids, and dehydrins are some of the compatible solutes thatmay be implicated in the adjustment of osmolytes. Plants thatare stressed can either reduce evaporation or maintain wateruptake. One of the vital cellular adaptations in plants exposed todrought stress is osmotic changes, which help in stress tolerance(Farooq et al., 2009). The buildup of osmolytes maintainscellular turgor and reduces the cell water potential while alsoprotecting enzymes and membrane proteins alongside cellularorganelles from oxidative damage (Huang et al., 2014). Animportant example of proteinogenic amino acid is proline whichincreases during drought stress and is required for key metabolicprocesses (Huang et al., 2014). Furthermore, by quenchingROS, proline works as a molecular chaperone, lowering lipidperoxidation, altering cytosolic pH, and subcellular structureprotection (Zouari et al., 2019). In many plants, prolineaccumulation during oxidative stress has been linked to droughtresistance. Consequently, plant priming with the use of PGPBchanges the proline level, which enhances plant drought-tolerant potential. Plants inoculated with PGPB often showan increment in proline levels under drought stress in severaltrials (Bano et al., 2013; Gusain et al., 2015). Under moisturestress, inoculating maize plants with Bacillus sp. boosted prolinecontent (Vardharajula et al., 2011).Trehalose is a vital osmoprotectant that helps to keep cellsignaling and subcellular structures in check (Y ang et al., 2009).In a macroarray analysis of nodules of common bean ( Phaseolusvulgaris ) which was coated with Rhizobium etli , Suárez et al.(2008) found that the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene wasoverexpressed, indicating an improvement in the productionof drought stress-responsive genes in contrast to control.Furthermore, glycine betaine functions as an osmoprotectant,assisting in the stabilization of enzymes and membrane proteinsunder induced dehydration stress. According to Zhang et al.(2010), coating Bacillus subtilis onArabidopsis plants resulted inhigher levels of choline, betaine, and glycine than controls.

As a result, plantswith higher levels of amino acid and soluble sugars are thoughtto be better able to withstand drought. Under drought stress,Yooyongwech et al.

According to Cruz De Carvalho(2008), increased formation of a wide range of reactiveoxygen species, including hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical,singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, is one of the probablerepercussions of moisture stress.By causing oxidative stress to a macromolecule, proteins,alongside similar lipids, ROS can disrupt normal plant metabolicoperations and even cause the death of cells (Farooq et al.,2009; Hasanuzzaman et al., 2013). Although, a rise in ROScauses oxidative stress, a lower amount of ROS is required bythe plants for signaling occurrences that will activate defensemechanisms. To control signaling events and oxidative stress inplants, it is critical to manage reactive oxygen species throughcontrolled regulation of reactive oxygen species generationand quenching. PGPB priming of plants often changes thelevel of antioxidants, which is an eﬃcient Microbe-inducedsystemic tolerance (MIST) mechanism in enhancing toleranceto drought, according to several reported studies (Cohen et al.,2015; Ortiz et al., 2015).Under moisture stress, Solanum tuberosum plants primedwith plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) showed animprovement in numerous enzymes scavenging the reactiveoxygen species (Gururani et al., 2013). Furthermore, undermoisture stress, catalase activity was 1.8 times greater than thelevel observed in the control plants. Green gram infected withB. subtilis EPB and P. ﬂuorescens Pf1 showed an improvementin the activity of CAT (Saravanakumar et al., 2011). Most plants,such as maize, wheat, and rice, have shown a link betweendrought resistance and the production of ROS (Vardharajulaet al., 2011; Kasim et al., 2013; Gusain et al., 2015).Seed coating with B. methylotrophicus and RABA6 andB. altitudinis FD48 in rice enhanced the production of enzymescapable of quenching ROS which aids tolerance to drought stress(Narayanasamy et al., 2020). Eleusine seedlings injected withR. intraradices demonstrated enhanced ascorbate, glutathioneand ﬂavonoid under drought stress, according to recent ﬁndings(Narayanasamy et al., 2020). As a result, plants primed withspeciﬁc PGPR produce more ROS scavenging enzymes, whichreduces ROS overproduction and confers drought resistance.Phytohormones modulation toenhance plant tolerance to droughtstressPhytohormones are hormones generated in minute amountsin plant tissues that aﬀect plant development and growth,such as fruit ripening, lateral root growth, blooming, budinitiation, and so on. Ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinins, indoleacetic acid, and gibberellins are plant hormones that assistplants to survive in stressful environments. PGPB can alsosecrete phytohormones, which drive plant development andaid plant survival in hostile environments. These ﬁndingsimply that bacterial hormone production and their capacity toFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 10Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427activate endogenous hormone levels in plants are important inincreasing tolerance (Cassán et al., 2001).AuxinsAuxins, such as IAA, are responsible for apical dominance,cell division, root and shoot growth direction, and later rootdevelopment among other things (Glick, 1995). IAA can beproduced by about 80% of PGPR (Olanrewaju et al., 2017).Earlier studies have proposed that PGPMs can assist plants inmanaging abiotic stress by supplying IAA, hence helping cropdevelopment and growth. Under drought stress, clover plantscoated with PGPB’s B. megaterium and P. putida increasedshoot and root biomass, which is associated with increased IAAproduction (Marulanda et al., 2010).Furthermore, Arabidopsis injected with P. brassicacearumSTM196 have longer roots, and the architecture of root systemmodiﬁcation confers drought resistance (Bresson et al., 2013).The results suggested that IAA may help mitigate bacterial-caused drought to some extent. Inoculation of tomato andwheat seedlings with IAA-producing Azospirillum resulted inincreased formation of lateral and root development, resultingin increased water and nutrient absorption under drought stress(Vurukonda et al., 2016). In earlier research, Ambreetha et al.(2018) claimed that B. altitudinis FD48 inoculation altered theroot system architecture in rice, and this was established byexamining the mode of expression of genes encoding defenseresponsive in the formation of primary root (OsIAA4 andOsIAA1) and lateral root (OsIAA13 and OsIAA11). The resultsshowed that inoculating rice with FD48 alters the endogenouslevel of IAA viaregulating the genes encoding auxin expression,modulating the architecture of the root system and ensuring thesurvival of the plant exposed to moisture stress.Abscisic acidAbscisic acid (ABA) is a critical hormone that performsa key function in a plant’s physiology and is required fortolerance to most abiotic stresses (Cohen et al., 2015). Plant-associated bacteria secrete high levels of abscisic acid whichcan help plants withstand moisture stress. Under water-stressedsituations, increased levels of abscisic acid in plant tissuesled to physiological changes which aided plant development(Farooq et al., 2009). Under osmotic stress, abscisic acid activatesdrought stress-adoptive genes and modulates cell signaling,resulting in the elicitation of greater resistance responses.Abscisic acid is an antitranspirant that stimulates the closureof the stomatal in addition to signaling (Egamberdieva et al.,2017). Furthermore, in a stressful environment, abscisic acidalters the root system and develops deeper roots, as well as othermodiﬁcations in auxiliary roots that obstruct water for optimalplant growth and the acquisition of nutrients. Furthermore,ABA preserves the root and shoot hydraulic conductivity toproperly use water from the environment, resulting in turgorpotential retention in plant tissues. The buildup of abscisic acidin Arabidopsis coated with P. brassicacearum strain STM196was discovered to modify drought response, leading to a lowerrate of leaf transpiration. Bacillus sp. primed in lettuce producedmore ABA than fake plants, according to Vurukonda et al.(2016), resulting in increased moisture stress tolerance. Theyalso found a link between ABA levels and drought tolerance.Similarly, Arabidopsis plants treated with A. brasilense Sp245enhanced their resistance to drought stress by accumulatingmore ABA (Cohen et al., 2008).Many studies have been proposed to understand themethods through which ABA might increase drought resistance.One hypothesis is that ABA improves drought tolerance bycontrolling the hydraulic conductivity of the root and leaftranspiration (Aroca et al., 2008). A similar idea claims thatabscisic acid helps in the mitigation of moisture stress byaquaporin regulation (Zhou et al., 2012). It is clear from all thetheories that abscisic acid plays an important function in plantdevelopment and resistance to moisture stress.GibberellinsGibberellins are notable hormones of plants that governa variety of physiological activities in plants at variousphases of development, including blooming, seed germination,senescence, elongation of the stem, and fruiting (Kang et al.,2014a). Numerous studies have suggested that priming GA-producing bacteria might assist host plants to adapt tomoisture stress. Drought stress is mitigated by GA generatingAzospirillum lipoferum stimulated in maize plants, accordingto a study carried out by Kaushal and Wani (2016). Inaddition, P. putida H-2-3 inoculation is known to inducedrought tolerance and produce gibberellins in maize plants.Exogenous treatment of GA, on the other hand, improvesroot characteristics (such as root tips, surface length, andarea), resulting in enhanced nutrient absorption and therebymodifying the functions of plants in stressful conditions(Vacheron et al., 2015).CytokininsPhotosynthetic activity, plant cell division, and the closureand opening of the stomata under drought are all greatlyinﬂuenced by cytokinins. Aside from plants, a wide spectrum ofsoil bacteria and PGPB may produce cytokinins. Plants coatedwith PGPB also revealed a possible inﬂuence of cytokinins ontolerance to drought stress (Arkhipova et al., 2007; Liu et al.,2013; Hai et al., 2020; Abdelaal et al., 2021).1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylatedeaminase enhances tolerance to droughtstressEthylene is a common hormone that serves as animportant oscillator for the development and growth ofplants alongside serves as a key component in the regulationof plants. Abiotic stress biological signals coordinate ethyleneFrontiers in Microbiology 10 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 11Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427biosynthesis (Hardoim et al., 2008). Upon exposure toenvironmental challenges, plants are known to generatemore ethylene (Abdelaal et al., 2021). Increased ethylenelevels, on the other hand, cause chlorosis, senescence,and leaf abscission, which are all harmful to properplant development and growth. Plant-associated bacteriagenerated ACC, which decreased the impact of ethyleneon stressed plants and improved plant health. S-adenosylmethionine (S-Adomet) is transformed into ACC, whichis widely known ethylene precursor in the production ofethylene.Endogenous ethylene in plants often leads to lower plantgrowth in stressful situations. The regulation of ACC is acritical mechanism through which the PGPB tries for favorableimpacts on plant development and growth in drought-stressedconditions (Saleem et al., 2007). ACC deaminase, a rhizobacteriaenzyme that cleaves ACC into a-ketobutyrate and ammonia,lowered the quantity of ACC, and hence the quantity of ethylene,and thus the harmful impact on plants at greater ethyleneconcentrations, was abolished (Glick, 2014). As a result, it aidedplant development by reducing drought stress.Production of exopolysaccharides inenhancing drought stress toleranceBacterial EPS has been studied extensively in the rhizospherefor its function in moisture retention (Ali et al., 2014). Slimematerials and capsular EPS are released into the soil in twoforms: slime materials and capsular EPS which may be absorbedthrough the clay surfaces viacation bridges, the Van der Walsforce, hydrogen bonding, and anion absorption process providesa protective barrier surrounding soil aggregates (Sandhya et al.,2009). Furthermore, alginate, a tiny polysaccharide existingas a bioﬁlm, helps to maintain a hydrated microenvironmentby water retention and drying at a slower pace than thesurrounding environment, thus protecting plant roots andmicroorganisms from desiccation (Sandhya et al., 2009).According to Selvakumar et al. (2012), bacteria-produced EPSincreases soil impermeability by enhancing the aggregationof soil and maintaining increased water potential over theroot area. As a result, the absorption of nutrients increases,which improves the growth of the plant and resistance tomoisture stress.Plants primed with bacteria capable of producing EPS showenhanced resilience to moisture stress (Ojuederie et al., 2019).When subjected to moisture stress, the seedlings of sunﬂowerinjected with Pseudomonas sp. GAP-P45 improved the survivalof the plants exposed to stress by increasing plant biomass andthe RAS/RT ratio. The bacteria were successfully colonized inroot-adhering rhizoplane and soil, resulting in increased soilaggregate stability (Sandhya et al., 2009). More RAS aggregationallows for increased water and nutrient absorption from therhizosphere, allowing plants to survive and ﬂourish in the faceof induced drought stress (Sandhya et al., 2009).Amendment in the architecture of theroot systemThe roots of the plant are an essential tissue for thegrowth of the plant because they help with the absorptionand transportation of nutrient water, anchoring, and symbioticinteraction with beneﬁcial microorganisms in the soil, all ofwhich contribute to increased plant health and growth (Hodgeet al., 2009; Abdelaal et al., 2021). In drought-stressed plants,the architecture of the root system is the most importantcharacteristic. The structure of the root system, the geographicaldissemination of secondary and primary roots, variations inthe root number, and root diameter are all included in theroot system. Root ﬂexibility in the response of plans to waterscarcity is a valuable tool for dealing with moisture stress(Ngumbi and Kloepper, 2016).The architecture of the root is altered by PGPB-mediatedalterations in root development and ﬂexibility. Some of thebacteria-associated changes in the structure of the root areintended to increase the area of the root surface and, as a result,nutrient and water uptake, which has a considerable impacton drought resistance (Ngumbi and Kloepper, 2016; Abdelaalet al., 2021). Under drought stress, maize seedlings primed withA. faecalis AF3. Ambreetha et al. (2018) stated that B. altitudinisFD48 inoculation altered the architecture of the root system inrice, and this was later corroborated by the pattern of expressionof defense-responsive genes encoding the main development ofthe root (OsIAA4, OsIAA1) and the formation of lateral root(OsIAA13, OsIAA11).These ﬁndings show that inoculating rice with FD48alters endogenous IAA levels and auxin-responsive genes,thereby resulting in changes to the root system architecture.PGPB-mediated root architecture modiﬁcation is importantfor increasing rice yield under extreme environmentalcircumstances (Paez-Garcia et al., 2015). Many studies haveshown that modifying rice root system features can increaseyield in stressful settings (Zou et al., 2015). The PGPR producessignaling molecules that naturally change the root systemarchitecture of related crops (Phillips et al., 2004; Ojuederieet al., 2019).Most PGPB such as B. megaterium , and Pseudomonas sp.have been widely reported in the modiﬁcation of the Arabidopsisroot architecture (Zamioudis et al., 2013). The developmentof lateral roots in B. megaterium primed Phaseolus vulgarisroots was boosted (Lopez-Bucio et al., 2007). As a result, PGPBcaused changes in the ﬂexibility of cell membranes of theroot, known as the key reactions in the area for increasedmoisture stress tolerance (Vurukonda et al., 2016). In addition,computer-based analysis and imaging techniques are utilized toFrontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 12Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427compare the root architectural characteristics of the plants, inaddition to morphological perception and observation of theroot system. Another accurate program used to comprehendthe architecture of rice roots is WinRHIZO, GiA Roots, and 3Droot imaging (Ambreetha et al., 2018). Under in vitro settings,volatile chemicals released by B. pumilus T4 and E. cloacaeJM22 enhance overall biomass and induce adventitious rootdevelopment (Delaplace et al., 2015).Emission of microbial volatile organiccompounds to mitigate drought stressRhizosphere-dwelling and plant-associated microorganismscan assist the plant in dealing with drought stress through avariety of methods (Ojuederie et al., 2019; Ahluwalia et al.,2021). Recent research has shown that insoluble metabolitesproduced by rhizospheric microbiomes as microbial volatileorganic compounds (mVOC) improve plant drought tolerance.According to Narayanasamy et al. (2020), volatile compoundsare interesting candidates for stress reduction during plantdevelopment and growth. Wheat seedlings treated withB. thuringiensis AZP2 volatiles, for example, showed a ﬁvefoldimprovement in survival under drought, owing to a largeimprovement in plant biomass, which enhances photosyntheticrate (Narayanasamy et al., 2020).Some mVOCs emitted by B. thuringiensis , such as geranyl,b-pinene, and benzaldehyde compounds, increase tolerance todrought in wheat. Cho et al. (2008) revealed that microbialvolatile organic compound 2R,3R-butanediol generated byP. chlororaphis O6 assists in promoting tolerance to droughtstress in Arabidopsis by the closure of the stomatal. Thispoints to the mVOC’s key signiﬁcance in tolerance to droughtstress and pathways of hormone signaling. Recent researchhas revealed that 2,3-butanediol stimulates the synthesis ofnitric oxide (NO) in plants, which improves the survivalof the plant under drought, suggesting that NO signalingplays a vital role in improving tolerance to drought (Choet al., 2013). B. subtilis GB03 also generated VOCs, such as2,3-butanediol, which is important in drought relief (Zhanget al., 2010). Additionally, Arabidopsis exposed to B. subtilisGB03 volatile organic compound shad greater levels ofglycine betaine and choline accumulation, as well as increasedlevels of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT)transcripts, which are required for glycine betaine and cholineproduction (Mou et al., 2002; Abdelaal et al., 2021).Many PGP bacterial strains, including Pseudomonasaeruginosa Pa2, create exopolysaccharides that assist inmaintaining soil moisture content, improving plant droughtresistance (Naseem and Bano, 2014). Some mVOCs, such asacetic acid generated by bacteria, can promote the productionof bioﬁlms, with EPS being the most important element(Chen et al., 2015). As a result, speciﬁc microbial volatileorganic compound-mediated exopolysaccharide synthesis inrhizobacteria may aﬀect tolerance to drought indirectly inplants. Inoculation of wheat with O. pseudogregnonense IP8 andB. safensis W10 resulted in the formation of high amounts ofantioxidants and metabolites, which play an important functionin the mitigation of drought stress (Chakraborty et al., 2013).PGPR primed potatoes also increased the accumulation ofproline and ROS scavenging enzymes and gene expression,indicating improved resistance to abiotic conditions such as salt,the toxicity of heavy metals and drought (Gururani et al., 2013).Regulation of drought-responsivegenesStudies involving the expression of a gene are a usefultechnique for determining and comparing plant responses totheir surroundings. The transcriptome research examines theexpression of a cell’s whole collection of transcripts (mRNA)at a normal developmental stage or exposed to variousenvironmental circumstances (Vurukonda et al., 2016). Plantscolonized by microbes have distinct gene expression patternsthan non-colonized plants, resulting in increased tolerance todrought. Comparison-based transcriptomic proﬁling aids in theidentiﬁcation of diverse groups of gene transcripts responsiblefor changes in two physiologically distinct expressions underdiﬀerent situations (Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010; Fadiji andBabalola, 2020c). Therefore, some of the most important toolsin investigating plant-microbe interactions are transcriptomeproﬁling from microarray and mRNA sequencing (Wang W.et al., 2016).The physiological function of PGPB was used to assessgene regulation impacted by moisture stress, according toMohammadipanah and Zamanzadeh (2019). In Arabidopsisplants infected with B. polymyxa B2, the favorable impact ofplant growth-promoting bacteria on improving plant stresstolerance at the transcriptomic level was investigated (Y anget al., 2009; Vurukonda et al., 2016; Abdelaal et al., 2021).These results show that the inoculated plants produce thedrought-adaptive gene early response to ABA-regulatory geneRAB18 (LEA) and dehydration 15 ( ERD15 ), but uninoculatedsham plants do not.Similarly, wheat plants infected with A. brasilense NO40and B. amyloliquefaciens 5113 demonstrated enhanced droughttolerance as measured using real-time qPCR, with activationof genes that are stress-responsive ( HSP17 ,SAMS 1, and APX 1)in the leaves of wheat. Microarray investigation of A. thalianaprimed with P. chlororaphis O6 demonstrated downregulationof the signaling gene for responses to drought as comparedto plants without being colonized by bacteria, accordingto Vurukonda et al. (2016).In addition, the bacterium-primed plants caused activationof the genes signaling jasmonic acid VSP1 and PDF-1.2 , theFrontiers in Microbiology 12 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 13Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427salicylic acid regulatory gene PR1, and the ethylene-responsivefactor HEL. The impact of stress-responsive genes such asOsWRKY11, OsDREB 1A, OsDIL ,OsGADPH ,OsAP 37, andOsNAC 6 was upregulated in rice plants primed with co-inoculation of two PGPR strains, namely B. amyloliquefaciensBK7 and B. laterosporus B4, indicating the microbe-inducedsystemic drought tolerance (Kakar et al., 2016). Similarly,qPCR analysis of P. ﬂuorescens strain Pf1 primed rice revealedupregulation of six drought-responsive genes during droughtstress, including COX1 ,PKDP ,Hsp20 ,AP2-EREBP ,COC1 ,and bZIP1 . Rice plants treated with T. harzianum elevateddrought-related genes such as aquaporin, malondialdehyde,and dehydrin, as well as physiological indices, according toPandey et al. (2016). It also boosts phytohormones, antioxidantenzymes, and defense proteins, all of which contribute todrought resistance and endurance. In P. trifoliata infected withArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( F. mosseae ). Liu et al. (2018)found that root genes PtYUC 3 and PtYUC 8 linked to IAAproduction were upregulated under drought stress and normalconditions. During water deﬁciency stress, the transcriptionallevels of PtLAX 2 and PtABCB 19 (root auxin species inﬂowcarriers) increased, whereas the expression levels of PtPIN 3 andPtPIN 1 (root auxin eﬄux carriers) decreased. These ﬁndingshighlighted the usefulness of transcriptome proﬁling as atool for studying the functional genomes of plants, and itcontains multiple potential genes as a natural indicator ofdrought resistance.Major constraints in theapplications ofplant-growth-promotingbacteria-induced droughttoleranceDrought stress is a major danger to agriculture and theproduction of food in the long run. It produces a buildup ofROS, which results in oxidative stress in plants. Furthermore,it causes a decrease in agricultural output and a loss of incomefor farmers. It is critical to have a cheaper method of increasingagricultural output under abiotic stress if the ever-increasingpopulation of humans is to be fed satisfactorily. The loss offarmland, the absence of regulated water sources, and thelong-term impacts of climate change have the potential to bedisastrous to food production (Kasim et al., 2013; Abdelaal et al.,2021).Various ways to reduce the impact of drought on plantshave been developed, with the most concentrated beingthe production of drought-resistant cultivars, which includescurrent biotechnology technologies (Ashraf, 2010). However,because the processes of enhancing tolerance to drought stressare ambiguous, the introduction of novel drought-resistantcultivars is critical, as genetically modiﬁed crops are widelyrejected in most countries of the world. Plant-associatedmicroorganisms are an underappreciated source of droughtresistance in agricultural plants. Plant development and growthare ensured by the widespread use of microbial inoculants,although the research is restricted to controlled circumstances.In natural settings, the results obtained from earlier researchdo not achieve a suitable level of accuracy and eﬃcacy forcommercialization on a worldwide scale. This might be owing tothe intricate interactions being deﬁned by soil physicochemicalcharacteristics and microbial populations (Nadeem et al., 2014).Plant-associated microorganisms can colonize theabove plant’s tissues or roots, enhancing development andabiotic stress tolerance through biological modulation ofphytopathogens. One of the most diﬃcult challenges inthis science is identifying distinct strains of the beneﬁcialmicrobiome as well as their likely functional roles. It’s crucialto ﬁgure out how the notable microbiome works and whatfunction it plays in agricultural sustainability (Pujar et al.,2017). The associative microbiome’s relationship with the plantmay be inherently unstable. Some results acquired in vitroare not always expected to be comparable to those achievedin the ﬁeld. The plant-associated bacteria’s poor coordinationmight be owing to environmental restrictions that aﬀect plantdevelopment and growth. Soil qualities, climatic circumstances,dynamics, and the activity of the microbial population in thesoil are examples of such restrictions.Conclusion and futureperspectivesCrops treated with microbial inoculants employ a varietyof methods to battle drought stress, resulting in higher cropyields. Using PGPB’s capacity to promote plant developmentand defense against drought stress is a cost-eﬀective,environmentally friendly, and promising way to reducethe impacts of drought stress on crops. The PGPB functionalproperties mentioned in this review are also fundamentalmethods by which PGPB enhance plant development andgrowth. Plant development under drought stress is also aﬀectedby PGPB interactions, which enhance antioxidant enzymes andsynthesis of osmolytes, as well as the expression of drought-adaptive genes. As a result, multifunctional PGPB are crucial forlong-term food security and agricultural production, especiallyin harsh environments. Whatever functional qualities PGPBhas in drought stress mitigation, the primary problems arecolonization, competence, survival in non-native soils, andexerting the required advantages under ﬁeld settings. It iscritical to investigate the mechanism by which PGPB imposetheir drought-tolerant eﬀects on plants, as well as the impactsof numerous environmental factors, alongside other microbialinteractions, to achieve the best growth-promoting relationshipFrontiers in Microbiology 13 frontiersin.orgfmicb-13-962427 July 25, 2022 Time: 18:16 # 14Fadiji et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.962427between seedlings and beneﬁcial microorganisms. As a result,developing competent strains for ﬁeld circumstances or aspeciﬁc location is a key task. We are only at the beginning ofour knowledge of the processes of PGPB in plants, as evidencedby the fast growth and prognosis of microbial-induced droughtstress resistance in plants.Nonetheless, recent development in the sector indicates thatfuture study has enormous prospects to bring new insightsinto food production and sustainability. Newer formulations,such as nano encapsulations, might be researched to assurethe eﬃciency of bioinoculants in ﬁeld circumstances for betterdrought tolerance, colonization and distribution of beneﬁcialmicrobes on host plants. Furthermore, PGPB aﬀects not only theplants but also the soil qualities when there is a drought. As aresult, more molecular studies into plant-microbe interactionsare needed in the future to understand the routes employedby rhizospheric microorganisms in induced systemic toleranceand rhizosphere engineering under drought stress. To reap thesebeneﬁts, future studies must focus on identifying the optimumsort of potential strain, adequate mechanism of delivery, andﬁeld evaluation for long-term crop and food production.Author contributionsAF and OB conceived the ideas, collected the data, anddeveloped the manuscript.
