Soil organic carbon(SOC) status is directly related to the amount of organic matter in soil and therefore is generally usedto measure it. Soil carbon sequestration refers to the removal of carbon (C) containing substancesfrom the atmosphere and its storage in soil C pools. The soil microbial community (SMC) plays animportant role in the C cycle, and its activity is considered to be the main driver of differences inC storage potential in soil. The composition of SMC is crucial for maintaining soil ecosystem services,as the structure and activity of SMC also regulate the turnover and distribution of nutrients, as wellas the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. Here, we applied fungi on the soils takenfrom two Ô¨Åelds, one used as a pasture and one for agriculture (wheat cultivation), in a histosol inthe eastern part of T√ºrkiye and investigated the changes in the organic carbon and enzyme activitycontents of the soils at the end of the 41-day incubation period. In the study, four different fungalspecies ( Verticillium dahliae (SOR-8), Rhizoctonia solani (S-TR-6), Fusarium oxysporum (HMK2-6), andTrichoderma sp.) were used and catalase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase activities were examined.Results showed that the values of SOC were V . dahliae (7.46%), Trichoderma sp. (7.27%), R. solani(7.03%), Control (6.97%), and F. oxysporum (6.7%) in pastureland and were V . dahlia (4.72%), control(4.69%), F. oxysporum (4.65%), R. solani (4.37%), and Trichoderma sp. (4.14%) in agricultural land,respectively. SOC and soil enzyme activities were signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by land use types ( p< 0.05).The higher SOC and enzyme activities were observed in pastureland. Finally, it was determinedthat soil organic carbon and soil enzyme activities were affected by fungi. This study is important interms of revealing that the effects of fungi on soil organic carbon and enzyme activities are differentin various land types.Keywords: land use type; fungi; soil organic carbon; catalase activity; urease activity;alkaline phosphatase activity1. IntroductionSoil carbon includes both soil organic matter and inorganic carbon (carbonate min-erals). It is reported that the carbon stored in soil is higher than the carbon pool in theatmosphere [ 1,2] and is also the largest terrestrial carbon stock. A small change in this soilcarbon pool has a major impact on the global climate [ 3] because soil organic carbon (SOC)plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. In addition, it has a signiÔ¨Åcant effect on manyprocesses taking place in soil. Improper soil management and the conversion of forest andpasturelands into Ô¨Åelds can cause large losses of carbon and convert these areas from carbonstores to carbon sources [ 4]. SOC mineralization is an important process, which is part ofthe carbon cycle and is largely controlled by carbon quality [ 5]. According to Schimel andSchaeffer [6], the structure and availability of SOC greatly inÔ¨Çuence SOC mineralization.Most soil-dwelling microorganisms are heterotrophic; they cannot synthesize theirown nutrients and depend on soil organic matter as a source of energy and carbon. SinceSustainability 2023 ,15, 1765. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15031765 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2023 ,15, 1765 2 of 12they show aerobic development, they obtain energy from the oxidation of organic materials.The difference in organic matter decomposition can be attributed to characteristics of soilmicrobial communities, including structural and functional diversity [ 7]. According toRousk et al. [ 8], the two main groups of the microbial decomposer community are bacteriaand fungi, and they share the function of decomposing organic matter. Naturally, thenumber and diversity of microorganisms are directly affected by the environment they livein, namely soil properties [9].These microorganism communities living in soil are considered as energy and nutrientstores apart from performing the mineralization of organic matter [ 10]. Understandingsoil C storage in terms of soil microbiology is of great importance for the developmentof applications that will change soil microbial properties [ 6,11]. SOC quality, microbialcommunities, and nutrient status are thought to affect SOC mineralization [ 8,12,13]. Ac-cording to Fontaine et al. [ 14], the effects of the structure and activity of the microbialcommunity on SOC decomposition are quite strong. So far, although a number of studieshave acknowledged the importance of characteristics of microbial communities such asbiomass, diversity, and composition in the regulation of soil C storage [ 15], clear conclu-sions regarding the relationships between these microbial community characteristics andSOC have not been established.Hao et al. [ 16] claimed that microbial biomass and composition affect SOC whileDegrune et al. [ 17] showed that microbial community diversity was not directly relatedto SOC. It is stated that SOC mineralization is strongly affected by exogenous substancesadded to soil [ 18]. There are studies showing that exogenous additions can increaseor decrease SOC mineralization through the activities of microorganism communities,resulting in positive or negative ignition effects [ 19]. As a result, it is of great importance toinvestigate the effect of microorganisms in the soil on SOC in terms of global carbon stockand carbon mineralization.Among microorganisms, fungi play an important role in soil biomass and soil structureand affect biochemical and biophysical mechanisms directly and indirectly [ 20]. Despitethis important role of fungi in the soil habitat, they can cause diseases in plants in differentways. Rhizoctonia spp., Fusarium spp., Verticillium spp., Sclerotinia spp., Pythium spp., andPhytophthora spp. cause heavy losses to many crops. They share some basic features asresting structures (microsclerotia, sclerotia, chlamydospore, or oospores) which can survivefor longer periods in host plant debris, soil, or organic matter without a host. Soilbornediseases are especially difÔ¨Åcult to control, and chemical control is not effective. Therefore,biological control was accepted as a potential control strategy [ 21].Trichoderma spp. haseffective biocontrol agents against plant pathogens [ 22] and is a better alternative to chemi-cals. The genus are the active mycoparasites which are known to produce large quantitiesof fungi-toxic metabolites [22‚Äì24].Soil enzymes are closely related to soil physical, chemical, and biological properties.They play an important role in nutrient cycling especially on the recycling of soil organicmatter, which has a direct effect on soil properties in soil. Therefore, soil enzyme activitiesare closely associated with soil organic matter. Soil enzyme activities are used as main andsensitive indicators of biological processes. They can provide fast and accurate informationabout small changes in microbial activity, soil organic matter, pH, and other soil properties.Since enzymes are very sensitive to the changes on their environment, soil enzymes areaffected by all kinds of applications on soils [25,26].In this study, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) it is expected that the effect ofdifferent land use, which is cultivated (wheat grown) and uncultivated (natural pasture),on soil organic carbon and enzyme activity will be different; (2) soil organic carbon and soilenzyme activities can change after inoculation with fungi.We examined the relationships among soil organic carbon and soil enzyme activitiesincluding urease, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase in different soils used as agriculturaland pasturelands with destructive soilborne fungal pathogens, namely Verticillium dahliae ,Sustainability 2023 ,15, 1765 3 of 12Rhizoctonia solani , and Fusarium oxysporum in the agricultural land and Trichoderma sp. asbioagent against these pathogens.2. Material and Methods2.1. Study SiteThe soil samples were collected from the agricultural land where the wheat was grownand pastureland from Eastern Anatolia Region of T√ºrkiye (Kars). The Eastern AnatoliaRegion has very cold and snowy winters, while summers are cool and rainy, with harshcontinental climate characteristics. It has one of the lowest average temperatures in T√ºrkiye.It has an annual average of 3.8C. The average of the highest temperature values during theyear occurs in July (16.1C) and the average of the lowest temperature values in January( 8.8C) [27]. Some soil characteristics are shown in Table 1.Table 1.

Soil SamplingFor soil physical and chemical analysis, disturbed soil samples were collected at Ô¨Åvedifferent points with three replicates at a depth of 0‚Äì30 cm into the soil layer for bothpasture and agricultural land in 2021 in Kars.2.3. Fungal Cultures and Soil TreatmentsFungi used in the study: V . dahliae (SOR-8), R. solani (S-TR-6), F. oxysporum (HMK2-6),and Trichoderma sp. isolates were supplied from the culture collection of Igdƒ±r University,Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Protection and Phytopathology Laboratory.The fungi isolates were cultivated on 90 mm Petri dishes containing Potato Dextrose Agar(Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 25C for seven days. Then, 10 discs withmycelia (5 mm diameter) cut from the edge of a colony of these isolates were placed in aplastic zipper bag (15 cm 10 cm) which was Ô¨Ålled with 60 g of soil, and the soil inoculumwas prepared. The control was inoculated 10 agar discs with only PDA. Three replicationswere used per treatment. At the same time, a total of 10 mL sterile water was addedinto each soil sample on day 21. The soil samples were incubated at room temperature(232C) for 41 days and were evaluated in treated soils after incubation.2.4. Soil AnalysisSoil texture, organic carbon, soil pH, electrical conductivity, catalase activity, ureaseactivity, and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined in disturbed soil samples. Soiltexture, organic carbon, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined according to Geeand Bauder [28], Walkley and Black [29], McLean [30], and Rhoades [31], respectively.For determining catalase activity, 20 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 10 mL of3% H 2O2substrate solution were added to 5 g of soil. The volume (mL) of O 2releasedwithin 3 min at 23C was measured. Controls were tested in the same way but with theaddition of 2 mL of 6.5% NaN 3[32].To determine urease activity, 0.25 mL of toluene, 0.75 mL of citrate buffer (pH 6.7), and1 mL of 10% urea substrate solution were added to 1 g soil, and the soil samples were incu-bated for 3 h at 37C. The formation of ammonium was discovered spectrophotometricallyat 578 nm [33].To detect alkaline phosphatase activity, 4 mL phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 1 mLp-nitrophenyl phosphate (disodium salt hexahydrate) solution were added to the 1 g soilSustainability 2023 ,15, 1765 4 of 12sample, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37C. The formation of p-nitrophenol(p-NP) was explored spectrophotometrically at 410 nm [34].2.5. Statistical AnalysisThe data were analyzed using statistical software program SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, CA, USA ).The mean values of each group were tested by ANOVA (Analysis of variance) tests. Thedifferences between each group were detected for statistical signiÔ¨Åcance ( p< 0.05), and thedifferences between speciÔ¨Åed groups were determined by the Duncan multiple comparisontest ( p< 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA), and partialredundancy analysis (P-RDA) were used to determine the correlations between soil organiccarbon, soil enzyme activities, pasture-agricultural land, and fungi using Xlstat.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)Soil organic carbon is very sensitive to applications on soil [ 35,36]. Tillage, one ofthe land use changes in pasturelands, can affect soil organic carbon [ 37‚Äì39]. In the study,the higher values were detected in pastureland for all fungi and control. In pastureland,the highest SOC was in V . dahliae (7.46%), Trichoderma sp. (7.27%), R. solani (7.03%), con-trol (6.97%), and F. oxysporum (6.7%), respectively. According to Ô¨Åndings, it is clear thatF. oxysporum decreased soil organic carbon while the other fungi increased under pasture-land, but the difference was statistically insigniÔ¨Åcant except for V . dahliae andTrichoderma sp.(Table 2, Figure 1). Soil organic carbon was higher in pastureland than agricultural land. Itmeans soil organic carbon decreased with agricultural practices (tillage). The decrease insoil organic carbon can be explained by the fact that tillage accelerates the decompositionof organic matter by breaking down soil aggregates [ 40]. In accordance with our study,many researchers reported that soil organic carbon decreased with tillage practices [ 41,42].Additionally, Dalal et al. [ 43] and Gebresamuel et al. [ 44] determined that soil organiccarbon was reduced when pastureland was converted to agricultural land.Table 2.

The means of variables were statistically significant and the variables were catego-rized as ‚Äúa‚Äìf‚Äù according to Duncan multiple  comparison test as given in Figure 1. The values of soil organic carbon differed for all fungi, but the difference was statis-tically insignificant except for Trichoderma sp. in the agricultural land. The values were in V. dahliae (4.72%),  control  (4.69%), F. oxysporum (4.65%),  R. solani (4.37%),  and Trichoderma sp. (4.14%), respectively  (Table 2, Figure 1). The soil organic matter sources are plant and animal (micro-macro organisms) resi-dues. Microbial residues are important source s for soil organic matter [45‚Äì48]. Moreover, fungal residues are rich in amino acids, fungal polysaccharides, and mineral elements and act as organic materials [49]. In the study, we  determined that fungi increased soil organic carbon, except F. oxysporum  under pastureland. Trichoderma sp. decreased soil organic car-bon, and the decrease was statistically significant, but the other fungi did not statistically affect soil organic carbon in agricultural la nd. The increase in pastureland may be due to fungal residues which are a source of organic matter, as stated in previous studies [45,48]. In agreement with the findings, Khan et al. [5 0] reported that microbial residues increased soil organic carbon. Some other researchers ob served that the application of chemical fer-tilizers in combination with fungal residue enhanced carbon sequestration capacity of soils [51]. Additionally, Wu et al. [52] stated that the application of Trichoderma sp. in-creased the concentration of effective phosph orus, available potassium, and organic mat-ter. 3.2. Soil Enzyme Activity The type of vegetation or land use is an important factor affecting the extracellular enzyme activities of the soil. In the study, alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities were significantly affected by land use types. Phosphatase, catalase, and urease activities were measured as 117.44, 177.03, and 12.87 in  the pastureland and as 109.07, 76.05, and 11.52 in the agricultural land, respectively. Similar results were also found in the treat-ments where the fungi were applied. However, the decrease in urease activity was statis-tically insignificant in control and F. oxysporum  (p > 0.05); it was significant ( p < 0.05) in V. dahliae, R. solani , and Trichoderma  sp. (Table 3; Figures 2‚Äì4). The differences between land use types may be because of th e differences in soil organic carbon [53,54]. In agreement with the findings, Tang et al. [55] and Li et al. [56] demonstrated that soil enzyme activities were higher under grassland than farmland be cause of soil organic carbon concentration. B≈Çonska et al. [57] stated that woodland soils were with significantly greater enzyme ac-tivity in comparison to agricultural soils. Yang  et al. [58] reported that soil enzyme activ-ities were significantly affected by different land cover and land use types depending on the studied enzymes. Lebrun et al. [59] determined that hydrolases activities were higher in the grasslands than in the cropped soils. At the same time the fungicide applications used in agricultural areas affect the amount of soil enzymes. Chen et al. [60] indicated that Figure 1. Soil organic carbon (%). Note.

The values were inV . dahliae (4.72%), control (4.69%), F. oxysporum (4.65%), R. solani (4.37%), and Trichoderma sp.(4.14%), respectively (Table 2, Figure 1).The soil organic matter sources are plant and animal (micro-macro organisms) residues.Microbial residues are important sources for soil organic matter [ 45‚Äì48]. Moreover, fungalresidues are rich in amino acids, fungal polysaccharides, and mineral elements and act asorganic materials [ 49].

[ 50] reported that microbial residues increased soilorganic carbon. Some other researchers observed that the application of chemical fertilizersin combination with fungal residue enhanced carbon sequestration capacity of soils [ 51].Additionally, Wu et al. [ 52] stated that the application of Trichoderma sp. increased theconcentration of effective phosphorus, available potassium, and organic matter.3.2. Soil Enzyme ActivityThe type of vegetation or land use is an important factor affecting the extracellularenzyme activities of the soil. In the study, alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities weresigniÔ¨Åcantly affected by land use types. Phosphatase, catalase, and urease activities weremeasured as 117.44, 177.03, and 12.87 in the pastureland and as 109.07, 76.05, and 11.52in the agricultural land, respectively.

However, the decrease in urease activity was statisticallyinsigniÔ¨Åcant in control and F. oxysporum (p> 0.05); it was signiÔ¨Åcant ( p< 0.05) in V . dahliae,R. solani , and Trichoderma sp. (Table 3; Figures 2‚Äì4). The differences between land usetypes may be because of the differences in soil organic carbon [ 53,54]. In agreement withthe Ô¨Åndings, Tang et al. [ 55] and Li et al.

Soil urease activity (¬µg g N soil‚àí1 h‚àí1). Note.

As shown in Figure 4, the means of variables were statistically significant and the variables were categorized as ‚Äúa‚Äìd‚Äù according to Duncan multiple comparison test. Another finding in the study was that alkaline phosphatase activities were signifi-cantly affected by fungi, except for Trichoderma sp. under pastureland ( p < 0.05). F. ox-ysporum , V. dahliae , and R. solani decreased soil alkaline phosphatase activity. The catalase activities were significantly affected by fungi and F. oxysporum (149.28 mL O 2 3 min‚àí1 g soil‚àí1), V. dahliae (90.91 mL O 2 3 min‚àí1 g soil‚àí1), R. solani (104.94 mL O 2 3 min‚àí1 g soil‚àí1), and  Trichoderma sp. (161.29 mL O 2 3 min‚àí1 g soil‚àí1) which decreased catalase activity when compared to the control (177.03 mL O 2 3 min‚àí1 g soil‚àí1). The activities of urease were sig-nificantly affected by F. oxysporum , R. solani , and Trichoderma sp. under pastureland ( p < 0.05). The lowest value of urease was in F. oxysporum (7.67 ¬µg g N soil‚àí1 h‚àí1), and the high-est was in Trichoderma sp. (17.08 ¬µg g N soil‚àí1 h‚àí1). In agricultural land, soil enzyme activities were significantly affected by fungi ( p < 0.05). Moreover, all fungi decreased soil alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and urease activ-ities (Table 3; Figures 2‚Äì4). The decrease ma y be caused by the sampling time (the sam-pling time was the 41st day of inoculation). According to Christopher et al. [61], the en-zyme activities increased from the seventh to the fourteenth day of sampling, and the maximum activities were observed on the fourteenth day, and then it started to decrease. Fungi can change soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass [62,63]. Agaricus bispo-rus 100% and 150% fungal residues affected the content of soil nutrients (available N, P, and K) and soil enzymatic activities (urease, neutral-phosphatase, and catalase) at vege-tative growth stage and reproductive growth stage of rice and wheat [64]. Soil enzymes such as urease, phosphatase, catalase, and saccharase are derived from various soil micro-organisms. In the study, fungi decreased soil  enzyme activities. In agreement with the findings, Naseby et al. [65] repo rted that urease activities of Trichoderma harzianum  isolates (TH1, T4, N47, and T12) and Trichoderma pseudokoningii isolate (To10) showed similar trends in the control. However, T. harzianum  (TH1, T4 and N47) significantly reduced the urease activities according to Pythium  control. Isolates T. harzianum  (TH1, T4, and T12) significantly decreased the alkaline phosphatase activities when compared to the Pythium  control. Wu et al. [52] reported that urease activity and sucrase activity differed according to treatments. Some treatments significantly reduced urease activity, but some other treat-ments (single applications of the Trichoderma ) caused no significant differences. Figure 4.

Different letters represent signiÔ¨Åcant differ-ences between variables according to Duncan multiple comparison test at p< 0.05 signiÔ¨Åcance level .The means of variables were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant and the variables were categorizedas ‚Äúa‚Äìg‚Äù according to Duncan multiple comparison test (Figure 2).It was seen that the means of variables were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant and the variableswere categorized as ‚Äúa‚Äìh‚Äù according to Duncan multiple comparison test (Figure 3).As shown in Figure 4, the means of variables were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant and thevariables were categorized as ‚Äúa‚Äìd‚Äù according to Duncan multiple comparison test.Another Ô¨Ånding in the study was that alkaline phosphatase activities were signiÔ¨Åcantlyaffected by fungi, except for Trichoderma sp. under pastureland ( p< 0.05).

(161.29 mL O 23 min 1g soil 1) which decreased catalase activity whenSustainability 2023 ,15, 1765 7 of 12compared to the control (177.03 mL O 23 min 1g soil 1). The activities of urease weresigniÔ¨Åcantly affected by F. oxysporum ,R. solani , and Trichoderma sp. under pastureland(p< 0.05 ). The lowest value of urease was in F. oxysporum (7.67 g g N soil 1h 1), and thehighest was in Trichoderma sp. (17.08 g g N soil 1h 1).In agricultural land, soil enzyme activities were signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by fungi ( p< 0.05 ).Moreover, all fungi decreased soil alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and urease activities(Table 3; Figures 2‚Äì4). The decrease may be caused by the sampling time (the samplingtime was the 41st day of inoculation). According to Christopher et al. [ 61], the enzymeactivities increased from the seventh to the fourteenth day of sampling, and the maximumactivities were observed on the fourteenth day, and then it started to decrease.Fungi can change soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass [ 62,63].Agaricusbisporus 100% and 150% fungal residues affected the content of soil nutrients (availableN, P , and K) and soil enzymatic activities (urease, neutral-phosphatase, and catalase)at vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage of rice and wheat [ 64]. Soilenzymes such as urease, phosphatase, catalase, and saccharase are derived from varioussoil microorganisms. In the study, fungi decreased soil enzyme activities. In agreementwith the Ô¨Åndings, Naseby et al. [ 65] reported that urease activities of Trichoderma harzianumisolates (TH1, T4, N47, and T12) and Trichoderma pseudokoningii isolate (To10) showedsimilar trends in the control. However, T. harzianum (TH1, T4 and N47) signiÔ¨Åcantlyreduced the urease activities according to Pythium control. Isolates T. harzianum (TH1, T4,and T12) signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased the alkaline phosphatase activities when compared to thePythium control. Wu et al. [ 52] reported that urease activity and sucrase activity differedaccording to treatments. Some treatments signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced urease activity, but someother treatments (single applications of the Trichoderma ) caused no signiÔ¨Åcant differences.Contrary to our Ô¨Åndings, Qin et al. [ 66] studied the effects of Arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi on different soil enzyme activities (protease, peroxidase, dehydrogenase, Ô¨Çuoresceindiacetate, cellulase, -glucosidase, trehalase, esterase, invertase chitinase, neutral phos-phatase, acid phosphatase, total phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, nitrogenase, urease,and catalase) and positive effects were determined among all enzyme activity except forpolyphenol oxidase. Liu et al. [ 67] showed that T. harzianum biofertilizer signiÔ¨Åcantlyincreased soil available sucrase and catalase activities, but the activities of urease decreased.Asghar and Kataoka [ 68] obtained similar results where phosphatase activity was higherwith Trichoderma sp. than in organic materials without Trichoderma sp.Trichoderma hamatumFB10 increased enzyme activity when compared with the control, urease (12%), phos-phatase (291%), catalase (27.5%), and saccharase (69%) [ 69]. Ji et al. [ 70] determined thatT. harzianum ,Trichoderma asperellum ,T.hamatum , and Trichoderma atroviride inoculationresulted in increased soil enzyme activity including urease, phosphatase, and catalase com-pared to control. Xiao et al. [ 71] stated that Funneliformis mosseae increased soil nutrientsand soil enzyme activities.3.3. Correlation of VariablesThe principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were applied for deter-mining the correlation of variables. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariateanalysis method based on data reduction, taking into account the correlation between data.In the study, data were well correlated; 85.35% of the total information was explained withtwo PCs; and 66.28% of the information was explained by PC1 alone (Table 4).Table 4. Percentage of information retained by each PC.PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6Eigenvalue 3.977 1.144 0.568 0.220 0.078 0.012Variability (%) 66.283 19.070 9.467 3.672 1.303 0.206Cumulative (%) 66.283 85.352 94.819 98.491 99.794 100.000Sustainability 2023 ,15, 1765 8 of 12The amount of each of the original variables contained in the PC is deÔ¨Åned by loading(Figure 5). By plotting the loading for two PCs, it is possible to assess the relative importanceof each of the variables (i.e., fungi, SOC): the further the variable is from the origin, the moreimportant it is. Correlations between variables are observed in the loading plot (variableswith positive correlations will be placed close to each other or variables with reversecorrelation will be at 180angles to each other). The loading plot shows the importanceof original variables in each PC. Soil organic carbon, urease activity, alkaline phosphatase,and catalase activities were negatively correlated with pasture-agricultural land. The Ô¨Ågurealso shows that soil organic carbon and urease activity had closer angles, which meansthat the variables were correlated. On the other hand, fungi and pasture-agricultural landwere inversely correlated with the other variables, and pasture‚Äìagricultural land had anangle about 180to the soil organic carbon. A 180angle indicates that land use types werenegatively correlated with soil organic carbon. Because the type of land use system is animportant factor controlling soil organic carbon levels, it affects the quantity and quality oflitter input, litter decomposition rates, and organic matter stabilization processes in soil.Table 5 shows that the catalase (20.89%), alkaline phosphatase (20.09%), urease (14.61%),soil organic carbon (21.98%), and pasture-agricultural land (21.26%) had a higher impacton PC1. On the other hand, fungi (1.15‚Äì82.01%) were negligible to PC1 and had a higherimpact on PC2.Sustainability 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13   Figure 5.

Conclusions Applications of fungi (soilborne pathogens and bioagents) to the soil affected soil organic carbon and soil enzyme activities in both pasture and agricultural lands. The high-est SOC and soil enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities) were in pastureland. Moreover, Trichoderma  sp. increased SOC in pastureland. Therefore, if mi-croorganisms such as bioagents ar e not harmful to soil health, it is recommended that they be applied in order to increase the retention of organic carbon in soil. On the other hand, another result of this study is a decrease in soil organic carbon in the cultivated agriculture area in the same region. This has prompted us to recommend as mi nimum tillage as pos-sible in order to retain carbon in soil in terms of its impact on climate change.
