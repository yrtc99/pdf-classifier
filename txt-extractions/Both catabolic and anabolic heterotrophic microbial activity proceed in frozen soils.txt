Buford Price, University of California, Berkeley, CA, and approved October 25, 2010 (received for review June 22, 2010)A large proportion of the global soil carbon pool is stored in soils ofhigh-latitude ecosystems in which microbial processes and produc-tion of greenhouse gases proceed during the winter months. It hasbeen suggested that microorganisms have limited ability to seques-ter substrates at temperatures around and below 0 °C and that a met-abolic shift to dominance of catabolic processes occurs around thesetemperatures. However, there are contrary indications that anabolicprocesses can proceed, because microbial growth has been observedat far lower temperatures. Therefore, we investigated the utilizationof the microbial substrate under unfrozen and frozen conditions ina boreal forest soil across a temperature range from −9° Ct o+ 9° C ,b yusing gas chromatography-isotopic ratio mass spectrometry and13Cmagic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy to determine microbialturnover and incorporation of13C-labeled glucose. Our results con-clusively demonstrate that the soil microorganisms maintain bothcatabolic (CO 2production) and anabolic (biomass synthesis) pro-cesses under frozen conditions and that no signi ﬁcant differencesin carbon allocation from [13C]glucose into [13C]CO 2and cell organic13C-compounds occurred between +9 °C and −4° C .T h eo n l ys i g n i f -icant metabolic changes detected were increased ﬂuidity of the cellmembranes synthesized at frozen conditions and increased produc-tion of glycerol in the frozen samples. The ﬁnding that the processesin frozen soil are similar to those in unfrozen soil has importantimplications for our general understanding and conceptualizationof soil carbon dynamics in high-latitude ecosystems.soil organic matter mineralization |13CO2|13C-NMRAbout 40% of the earth ’s soil carbon pool is stored in high-latitude ecosystems (1), and boreal forest covers a large partof this area. Microbial processes and production of greenhousegases continue during the winter months in soils of high-latituderegions (2 –6), and a signi ﬁcant fraction of the carbon ﬁxedduring the growing season can be lost during the following winter(7, 8). Hence, knowledge about winter microbial processes isessential for understanding carbon mineralization in these eco-systems and its coupling to climate change.The amount of unfrozen water in frozen soil has been found tobe an important control for microbial processes at subzero tem-peratures (3) because low liquid water contents, like dry conditions,also affect the diffusion rates, and thus the supply, of substrates (9).When soil freezes, the liquid water content is reduced (10), and thesolutes in the liquid water phase must be concentrated for theunfrozen water to reach the required water potential for a speci ﬁcsubzero temperature (11). That soil microbial catabolic processesoccur in frozen soils is known through the detection of biogenicCO 2production (2, 3, 12), but knowledge about anabolic processesand the partitioning of the carbon ﬂow between catabolic and an-abolic processes in frozen soil is less complete.It has been suggested that at temperatures below their optimummicrobes have increasing dif ﬁculty in sequestering substrates fromtheir environment (13) and that the soil microbial communityundergoes a shift from growth to maintenance-related metabolismwhen the soil freezes. This shift would markedly reduce the meta-bolic carbon allocation to biomass synthesis through anabolic pro-cesses (14). However, microbial CO 2production has been detectedat temperatures down to −39 °C in frozen surface horizons of tundra(4), and anabolic activity has been determined in bacterial pop-ulations from permafrost down to −6 °C (15) and −20 °C (16). It alsohas been suggested that there is no evidence of a minimum tem-perature for the metabolism of microbes in permafrost and ice (17).For cell membranes to be physiologically active under such extremeconditions, the acyl chains of the membrane lipids must maintaina liquid-like state to keep the membrane proteins active. Both bac-teria and fungi adjust their membrane composition in response tochanges in temperature >0 °C in ways that maintain a lamellar liquidcrystalline phase (18). This adjustment requires anabolic processes.Several studies have investigated differences in soil microbialbiomass and soil metabolic activity (e.g., incorporation of14C-la-beled acetate into lipids) at temperatures ≤0 °C (16, 19), but, as faras we know, none of these studies has distinguished between cat-abolic and anabolic processes. The objectives of the this study wereto determine the potential metabolic activity of soil microbialcommunities in frozen soils to assess the relative rates of anabolicand catabolic processes and to identify compounds synthesizedacross a temperature range from −9 °C to +9 °C. To do so, we usedgas chromatography-isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS)and13C magic-angle spinning NMR (13C MAS NMR) spectro-scopic evaluation of the microbial turnover of13C-labeled glucose,together with appropriate amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus,in samples of the organic surface layer of a boreal forest soil in-cubated at freezing and nonfreezing temperatures. We hypothe-sized that both catabolic and anabolic processes could proceedunder frozen conditions.Results[13C]CO 2Production Rates. Biogenic [13C]CO 2was produced in soilsamples incubated at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4 °C, but at −9 °C pro-duction rates bordered on the detection limits of the experimentalset-up. Two phases with different rates of [13C]CO 2productionwere identi ﬁed at the three higher temperatures, but with differingtime constants (Fig. 1 and Table S1 ). Production rates in phase 1were 0.44, 0.52, and 0.006 mg13C g soil organic matter (SOM) ·d−1at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4 °C, respectively. Corresponding rates forphase 2 were 1.82, 1.36, and 0.06 mg13C g SOM ·d−1. Phase 1 lastedfor about 2 d at temperatures above 0 °C and for ca.6 0da t −4° C .The relative increase in production rates in phase 2 was 4.1, 2.6, and11.4 times that of phase 1 at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4 °C, respectively.The relative increase is based on exact ﬁgures ( Table S1 ).Compounds Derived from Biogenic Glucose Utilization.

The chemical shifts of the acyl region of the lipids(SI Methods ) in the spectra we acquired showed that the formedfatty acids were ester bound to a backbone (Fig. 2). The chemicalshifts corresponded well to those of the phospholipid dio-leoylphosphatidylcholine but did not coincide with shifts of freefatty acids. At all the investigated temperatures formation ofglycerol was observed (at ∼63.6 ppm; Fig. 2). At +9 °C, ethanol(∼C1 58.5 ppm and C2 17.9 ppm) and glycerol ( ∼63.6 ppm and∼72.4 ppm) were formed after 2 –3 d, but both these compoundsdecreased at the end of the incubation period. At +4 °C, glycerolwas formed after ca. 3 d but decreased after 7 d, when ethanolwas detected; ethanol subsequently declined to subdetectablelevels by the end of the incubation period. At −4 °C, glycerol wasFig. 1.

At −9 °C, formation of glycerol wasdetected at the end of the incubation period (day 160, Fig. 2), butit could not be quanti ﬁed signi ﬁcantly because of the low signal-to-noise ratio. Signals corresponding to glycogen were observed(∼60–100 ppm), especially in the ﬁnal +9 °C spectrum, indi-cating that glycogen was formed as a storage compound.The time corresponding to the consumption of 50% of theadded glucose was estimated to be 2.5 d at +9 °C, 2.9 d at +4 °C,and 93.7 d at −4 °C. At this point, the partitioning of glucose into[13C]CO 2and organic13C-compounds (Fig. 3) did not differ sig-niﬁcantly among the investigated temperatures, although theproportions of glycerol were signi ﬁcantly higher in the samplesincubated at −4 °C than in those incubated at temperatures >0° C(P≤0.05; 95% ttest; Table 1). The carbon use ef ﬁciency (CUE)index and growth index (amount of membrane phospholipidsformed per amount of [13CO 2]carbon produced) were determinedat the different temperatures at the time when 50% of the glucosehad been consumed. These indexes were not signi ﬁcantly different,and no shift in the carbon allocation pattern was observed betweenthe unfrozen and frozen samples (Fig. 3).Length of Acyl Chains and Degree of Unsaturation in Lipids. Theaverage number of double bonds (C = C) per acyl chain in thesamples at the end of the incubations ( ±SE) was estimated to 0.43 ±0.04, 0.32 ±0.05, and 0.69 ±0.05 at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4 °C, re-spectively. Hence, the degree of unsaturation in the membranelipids was signi ﬁcantly higher at −4° Ct h a na te i t h e r+ 4° Co r+ 9° C(95% ttest). At +9 °C and +4 °C the acyl chains were, on average,signiﬁcantly (95% ttest) shorter than at −4° C( 1 3 . 7 ±0.44, 13.0 ±0.07, 16.6 ±0.36 at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4 °C, respectively).Carbon Budget. To assess the recovery of added [13C]glucose aseither [13C]CO 2or13C-organic compounds, [13C]carbon massbalances were calculated for the samples incubated at each of thetemperatures ( Table S2 ). The mean ratio of measured13C/added13C for all samplings was 1.07 ±0.05. However, on three sam-pling occasions the sum of measured13C-compounds accountedfor less than 80% of the initially added amount of [13C]glucose.At +9 °C and +4 °C most of the added glucose was consumedduring incubation (Fig. 4). At the end of the incubation at +9 °C,30% of the added [13C]glucose had been respired as [13C]CO 2,66% had been incorporated in organic13C-compounds, and 4%remained as glucose. At the end of the +4 °C incubation, 39% ofthe added glucose had been respired as [13C]CO 2, 56% had beenincorporated in13C-compounds, and 6% remained as glucose. Atthe end of the −4 °C incubation, 14% of the added glucose hadbeen respired as [13C]CO 2, 47% had been used for organic13C-compounds, and 39% remained as glucose (Fig. 4). Given the lowactivities at −9 °C, no signi ﬁcant consumption of added glucosecould be detected.DiscussionOur results provide conclusive evidence that not only catabolicprocesses (CO 2production) but also anabolic microbial processes(synthesis of biomass) proceed below 0 °C in frozen boreal forestsoils. It has been suggested that no (or highly limited) microbialgrowth can take place at temperatures <0 °C because the severelylimited ﬂuidity of the cell membrane at low temperatures inhibitsthe utilization of substrates from the environment (13). It also hasbeen suggested that the soil microbial community undergoes ashift from growth to survival-related metabolism, with decreasedcarbon allocation to anabolic processes, when subjected to variousstresses, including freezing (14). This suggestion is refuted by ourresults, which show that the soil microorganisms in frozen soilreadily use substrates from their environment for both catabolicand anabolic purposes.[13C]CO 2Production. At temperatures ranging −4° Ct o+ 9° C ,t h edetermined [13C]CO 2production rates from the added glucose arein the same range as previously reported CO 2production ratesafter sugar additions to soil incubations at similar temperatures (6,20). However, the [13C]CO 2production rate at −4 °C increasedafter 60 d to about 11 times the initial rate. This result stronglysuggests that experiments with commonly applied incubation times(12) of days or weeks may severely underestimate the potential forCO 2production at freezing temperatures. Conceivably, the periodof low respiration represents an induction period during whichthe microbial community adapts to the degradation of glucose attemperatures <0 °C. Winter soil respiration has been shown torespond rapidly to increases in labile carbon availability (21), andthis response also was observed in our study, because utilizationof the added glucose commenced within days at −4 °C. Under ﬁeldconditions, roots contribute signi ﬁcantly to the production ofreadily available carbon substrates (exudates) (22), and the soilsucrose concentration has been shown to be eight times higherduring the winter (beneath snow) than in summer and spring (23).It has been suggested that this increased sucrose concentrationdepends on mechanical damage from soil frost of shallow roots, inwhich sucrose is produced as a low-temperature protectant forsensitive tissues (23). The fact that the microbial community wasable to adapt to a colder environment indicates that more of thewinter CO 2ﬂux may come from carbon mineralization of soils thanestimated from short-term incubation experiments.Our results indicate that carbon mineralization in boreal forestsoils at −9 °C is insigni ﬁcant in relation to carbon mineralizationat−4 °C, supporting previous investigations reporting strongtemperature sensitivities in CO 2production in frozen soils (7, 24).Glucose Transformation and Synthesis of13C-Compounds. At thetime when 50% of the added glucose remained, we observed nosigniﬁcant differences in relative13C allocation patterns duringmetabolism between samples incubated at +9 °C and −4 °C,although the processes were slower in the frozen soil matrix. Thisﬁnding contradicts the general view of microbial processes inlow-temperature soil, i.e., that catabolic processes become moreprominent, in relation to anabolic processes, as the soil freezes andsubstrate diffusion and membrane ﬂuidity become limited (6, 13,14). However, we observed a response in the phospholipid com-position as a result of freezing. The ability of the microorganismsto continue to grow in frozen soil may be related to the observedresponses in their phospholipid composition to freezing. Commonfeatures of these temperature responses include changes in theFig. 3. Interpolated values of CUE and growth index at +9 °C, +4 °C, and −4° Cat the time when 50% of the glucose was consumed.

These featurescan be discerned in our results showing that the average degree ofunsaturation of the acyl chains in the membrane lipids was higherat−4 °C than at temperatures above 0 °C, indicating that ﬂuidity ofthe membrane lipids was maintained at −4 °C.Based on data obtained from the samples incubated at −4 °C,we estimated (see SI Methods for details) that the membranelipids in the samples would be transformed into a more rigid gelstate at ca.−24 °C. Small changes in the composition of themembrane lipids can change the transition temperature overa range of 100 °C (26); hence, minor adjustments of membranecomposition should allow microbial activity to occur even atextremely low temperatures (4, 17).The observed changes in lipid composition in response to tem-perature changes could be caused by adaptations in one or a fewspeciﬁc organisms. Alternatively, the changes could be caused bythe selection of microorganism species occurring at lower tem-peratures. We cannot couple the observed change in lipid com-position to speci ﬁc organisms or populations and therefore cannotdistinguish between these possibilities. However, we have shownas i g n i ﬁcant shift in the lipid composition of the cell membrane asa result of freezing, and this shift may explain the observed lag-phase in the frozen samples.In addition to changes in the membrane lipid composition, wealso observed differences in the production of glycerol. Glycerol isbest known as an antifreeze medium, but it also serves as a sub-strate for certain microorganisms at low temperatures (27, 28).The production of glycerol at −4 °C coincided with the increase inCO 2production and the synthesis of phospholipids that occurredafter the lag-phase. However, the level of glycerol was in-signiﬁcant at the start of the incubation period at −4 °C, when onlycatabolic processes (CO 2production) were detected. The highlevel of glycerol detected at the end of the incubation at −4° Ccould re ﬂect its use as an antifreeze agent that limits intracellularcell damage caused by freezing and hence maintains microbialactivity and CO 2production at subzero temperatures. This usewould induce a positive feedback reaction of microbial activityunder frozen condition and illustrates the important ability of thesoil microbial community to maintain metabolic activity at frozenconditions.However, the temperature is likely to decrease more graduallyunder ﬁeld conditions than in our experiments, and adaptation togradual changes is likely to be easier than adaptation to suddenshifts conceivably affecting the length of the lag-phase.Carbon Budget. The mean ratio of the measured13C to the added13C for all incubation temperatures indicated that we closed the13Cmass balance and were able to keep track of all13C-compoundswith an uncertainty (SE) of about 5%. When half the glucoseremained, the proportion of phospholipids in the synthesized13C-compounds was higher at −4 °C than at temperatures >0 °C, sug-gesting that the viable microbial community is capable of cell mem-brane synthesis in frozen soil. It is possible that the total amount ofphospholipids might change without changes in total microbialbiomass. However, measurements of total amounts of phospholi-pids (or the amount of phosphate in the phospholipid fraction) insoil are well recognized as re ﬂecting the microbial biomass (29 –31).These observations of the active synthesis of cell membrane fattyacids also support other studies in which both fungal and bacterialtotal biomass values have been found to be higher under snow-covered soil than in summer, re ﬂecting signi ﬁcant anabolic activitybut also suggesting microbial growth during the winter monthsFig. 4.

PNAS |December 7, 2010 |vol. 107 |no. 49 |21049ENVIRONMENTALSCIENCESDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 203.163.208.119 on April 14, 2023 from IP address 203.163.208.119.(5, 19, 32). Previous studies also have indicated that patterns oftrace gas ﬂuxes from soils during winter are consistent with a tran-sition in metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic (33, 34), a transitionthat indicates an active response of the microbial community in-volving changes in enzymatic expressions and metabolic pathwaysrequiring anabolic processes. However, depending on the in-sulating capacity of the accumulated snowpack, winter conditionsdo not necessarily imply frozen soils. Nonetheless, we can concludethat the previously observed increases in microbial biomass undersnow also may occur if the soil is frozen. In addition, our ﬁndingscontradict earlier studies suggesting that the microbes shiftresources to predominately catabolic processes at subzero tem-peratures (14).We conclude that both catabolic and anabolic processes canproceed in boreal forest soils at typical winter soil temperatures.Furthermore, no clear differences in carbon allocation during glu-cose metabolism were observed at the various temperatures, re-futing the conclusion from previous investigations that a shift towardcatabolic processes occurs when soil is subjected to freezing. How-ever, the extent to which the microbial community can use morecomplex substrates (polymers) and the extent to which freezing mayselect for certain organisms or groups of organisms remain to beresolved. The ability for microbial biosynthesis and growth to con-tinue, in combination with the strong temperature sensitivity attemperatures <0 °C (9, 24), also has implications for how microbialcommunities (e.g., those in permafrost soils) may respond to rela-tively small increases in temperature.MethodsSoil Samples. The materials examined in this investigation were collectedfrom a site in the central boreal climate zone of northern Sweden (64°11 ′N,19°35 ′E) at the end of October 2008. The site was dominated by spruce(Picea abies, L. ) with sparse pine ( Pinus sylvestris, L. ). The soil type was TypicHaplocryods (35). The investigations were con ﬁned to the organic (O)-horizon (96% OM). A more detailed description of the methods is found intheSI Methods .Soil Incubation. On collection, roots, coarse debris, and contemporary (i.e.,green) plant debris were removed manually. The soils were homogenized bypassing through a cutting sieve (6 ×3.5 mm mesh) and stored at −20 °C untilsample preparation. The frozen soil was thawed to ca. +4 °C, and ﬁeld-moistsamples of soil were transferred to glass bottles. A [13C]glucose solution withnitrogen and phosphorus (1, 1/13, 1/18) was prepared and added to the soilsamples in amounts corresponding to 40 mg [13C]glucose/g dry SOM (36, 37),and the water content of the soil was adjusted to 550% H 2O/g SOM (38). Weincubated the samples at +9 °C and +4 °C for 6 and 10 d, respectively, andthe samples at −4 °C and −9 °C for 99 d and 160 d, respectively. The [13C]CO 2content in gas samples from the incubations was analyzed by GC-IRMS.No evidence of nonbiological processes was detected after sterilizationwith NaN 3.NMR. The synthesized anabolic compounds formed after addition of [13C]glucosewere studied using13C MAS NMR spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were acquiredwith a 500 spectrometer (Avance DRX; Bruker). After each CO 2sampling, themicrobial activity ( n= 3) was terminated by adding 0.5% NaN 3, and13C NMRspectra were obtained on wet samples. Spectra of the metabolites formed inthe unsterilized samples were obtained by subtracting a glucose spectrumfrom them. A sample from the −4 °C incubation was analyzed by13C-solutionNMR to identify a13C MAS peak at 63.6 ppm (C1 and C3 of glycerol).Identi ﬁcation of Compounds Measured by13C MAS NMR. We de ﬁned the totalmicrobial synthesized compounds as the13C-compounds synthesized from theadded [13C]glucose and measurable by NMR. Several references were usedto identify the newly synthesized13C-compounds derived from microbial[13C]glucose transformation (39 –43). The chemical shifts of our spectra werecompared with the chemical shifts in the references (see above) and identi ﬁedwith respect to chemical shifts, intensities, and coupling patterns. We iden-tiﬁed the NMR-measured lipids as membrane phospholipids. More informa-tion about the identi ﬁcation of the synthesized13C-compounds and thechemical shifts of the acyl region of the lipids can be found in the SI Methods .The average degree of unsaturation of the membrane lipids and the averagelength of the acyl chains in the lipids were determined from the NMR data.Data Evaluation. The [13C]CO 2production rates of the initial rate (phase 1) andthe highest observed rate (phase 2) at each temperature were determined fromlinear regressions. Changes in the allocation of carbon between catabolic andanabolic processes over time at each investigated temperature were estimatedby calculating the relative (%) proportions of [13C]glucose, [13C]CO 2, and13C-compounds formed from anabolic processes as a function of time. The pro-portions of the synthesized13C-compounds measured by13C MAS NMR wereestimated by linear interpolation at the times when 50% of the added glucosewas left in the samples incubated at each of the temperatures (Table 1). Weestimated the variances (reported as SEs) for the interpolated values of eachcompound, and the effect of covariance between the data points were in-cluded in these estimations. The CUE of the microbial populations incubatedat each of the temperatures was then determined at the times when 50%glucose remained.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
