Rhizosphere nutrient avail-ability directly regulates plant growth and is in ﬂuenced by many factors, including soil properties, plant characteristicsand climate. A quantitatively comprehensive understanding of the role of these factors in modulating rhizosphere nu-trient availability remains largely unknown. We reviewed 123 studies to assess nutrient availability in the rhizospherecompared to bulk soil depending on various factors. The increase in microbial nitrogen (N) content and N-cycling re-lated enzyme activities in the rhizosphere led to a 10% increase in available N relative to bulk soil. The available phos-phorus (P) in the rhizosphere decreased by 12% with a corresponding increase in phosphatase activities, indicatingextreme demand and competition between plants and microorganisms for P. Greater organic carbon (C) contentaround taproots (+17%) con ﬁrmed their stronger ability to store more organic compounds than the ﬁbrous roots.This corresponds to higher bacterial and fungal contents and slightly higher available nutrients in the rhizosphere oftaproots. The maximal rhizosphere nutrient accumulation was common for low-fertile soils, which is con ﬁrmed bythe negative correlation between most soil chemical properties and the effect sizes of available nutrients.

Consequently, despite the higher microbial population densities in therhizosphere, the biomass of individual microbial cells decreased, pointing on their younger age and faster turnover.This meta-analysis shows that, contrary to the common view, most nutrients are more available in the rhizospherethan in bulk soil because of higher microbial activities around roots.Contents1 .

IntroductionThe global agricultural productivity must increase by up to 70% to meetthe food demand of nearly 10 billion people expected to populate Earth by2050 ( Hunter et al., 2017 ). This onerous challenge must be met without theexpansion of arable land and by using lower inputs of fertilizers and pesti-cides, or we may risk increasing natural ecosystem loss and causing the de-pletion of rock phosphate reserves ( Abelson, 1999 ;Chowdhury et al., 2017 ;Sattari et al., 2012 ;Tilman et al., 2011 ). Nutrient de ﬁciency, extensivelyconﬁrmed in most terrestrial ecosystems, threatens plant production andecosystem stability ( Elser et al., 2007 ;Hou et al., 2020 ). One of the waysby which plants attempt to overcome this stress is by reinforcing nutrientavailability in the rhizosphere ( Hinsinger et al., 2003 ;Kuzyakovand Razavi, 2019 ). The rhizosphere is one of the most pivotal microbialhotspots determining the dynamics and cycling of nutrients; therefore,the plant-microbial interactions are very intense in this criticalzone ( Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya, 2015 ). The interplay between rootsand microbes determines the available nutrient content by regulatingthree process groups: (1) the rate of nutrient uptake by plants, immobiliza-tion by microorganisms, or release from organic matter decomposition;(2) nutrient mobility in soils; (3) the conversion between unavailable andavailable forms of nutrients ( Darrah, 1993 ).Many interrelated factors, such as original soil properties, plant charac-teristics, and climate factors, in ﬂuence the three process groups and theirinterplay, and modulate the rhizosphere nutrient status ( Jones et al.,2004 ). For instance, in low-fertile environments, a range of mechanisms(e.g., exudation of organic compounds and protons) are activated toincrease the solubilization of nutrients in the rhizosphere ( Rengel andMarschner, 2005 ). In acidic soil, plants elevate pH and optimize rhizo-sphere nutrient availability by releasing various root exudates, enhancingthe uptake of anions (e.g., nitrate) or excreting OH−from nitrate reduction(Sugihara et al., 2016 ). In contrast, in alkaline soils, roots secrete organicanions (e.g. citrate and malate) and protons, leading to rhizosphereacidiﬁcation ( Sun et al., 2020 ). In addition, compared with plants withﬁbrous root systems, taproots are more strongly colonized by arbuscularmycorrhizal fungi, contributing to greater nutrient acquisition by accessingsoil micropores and transporting nutrients (e.g. phosphorus (P) and nitro-gen (N)) to plants ( Hodge et al., 2001 ;Hodge and Storer, 2014 ;Yanget al., 2015 ). The formation of root nodules in legumes allows the conver-sion of N 2to ammonia and amino acids and induces a divergent nutrientstatus in the rhizosphere, as compared to non-legumes ( Day et al., 2001 ;Moreau et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, moisture and temperature also stronglyregulate nutrient acquisition by plants by in ﬂuencing the diffusion rate, cellmembrane permeability, root physiology, and interactions with microor-ganisms ( Praeg et al., 2019 ;Warren, 2009 ). For instance, the root uptakeof NO 3−is more preferential relative to NH 4+or glycine under warmer tem-peratures ( Warren, 2009 ). The colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiis higher under drier conditions, inducing positive mycorrhizal P responsesin plants ( Cavagnaro, 2016 ). In summary, individual studies have identi ﬁeddifferences between the rhizosphere and bulk soil in terms of their nutrientcontent and availability ( Li et al., 2020 ;Marschner et al., 2002 ;Massaccesiet al., 2015 ;Steer and Harris, 2000 ). Similarly, the mechanism by whichrhizosphere nutrient availability is modulated by only one or severalinterrelated factors has long been unraveled. However, a thorough andquantitative understanding of the effects of these factors on rhizospherenutrient availability is still lacking and strongly recommended for furtherclariﬁcation ( Cheng et al., 2014 ;Jones et al., 2004 ;Marschner et al.,2004 ;Pii et al., 2016 ).Bacteria and mycorrhizal/saprotrophic fungi are the dominant compo-nents of rhizobiomes. They play important roles in improving nutrient ac-quisition, facilitating plant growth by exuding enzymes and organicmolecules, and inhibiting fungal pathogens ( Artursson et al., 2006 ;Philippot et al., 2013 ). For instance, in P-depleted soil, P-mobilizing bacte-ria release available P from organic compounds, which provides a P pool forplant growth and arbuscular fungal hyphae to extend to roots ( Kucey et al.,1989 ). Even though the mobility and dispersal of bacteria and fungi are dif-ferent, speci ﬁc bacteria can migrate via fungal hyphal structures and colo-nize novel microhabitats (e.g., the rhizosphere). Many bacteria also feedon living saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi, as well as fungal remains(Ballhausen and de Boer, 2016 ). These relationships suggest that bacteriaS. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539082and fungi have speci ﬁc survival and colonizing strategies, which may con-tribute to diverse changes in their densities in the rhizosphere compared tobulk soil. Microbial densities in the rhizosphere, are two to three orders ofmagnitude greater than those in bulk soil ( Ramos et al., 2000 ). The classi ﬁ-cation of microorganisms based on their life strategies (i.e., copiotrophs andoligotrophs) suggests that copiotrophs (grow faster and rely on resourceavailability; r strategists) are more abundant in the rhizosphere, whereasoligotrophs (ef ﬁciently exploit resources at the expense of growth rate; Kstrategists) are abundant in resource-poor environments (such as bulksoil; Ho et al., 2017 ;Liu et al., 2021 ;Ling et al., 2022 ). For instance, theabundances of the copiotrophic phyla Bacteroidetes and β-Proteobacteriaare generally greater in the rhizosphere than those in the surroundingbulk soil ( Fan et al., 2017 ;Kavamura et al., 2018 ). The fungal phylum Asco-mycota, a copiotrophic taxon, is more abundant in the rhizosphere by utiliz-ing a higher number of resources compared to Basidiomycota ( Egidi et al.,2019 ;Pascual et al., 2018 ). While the shift of microbial communities in therhizosphere has been acknowledged, a quantitative elucidation of the rela-tive abundance of bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere isstill seldom ( Ling et al., 2022 ).We collected studies on nutrient content and availability in the rhizo-sphere, depending on plant characteristics, soil properties, and climatic fac-tors. These studies mainly reported nutrients (e.g., N, P, and K) content,organic carbon (C) content, microbial C, activity of enzymes, bacterialand fungal population densities, and other original soil properties(e.g., pH, total N, and P). Plant species information (e.g., legumes/non-legumes, ﬁbrous roots/taproots, trees/herbaceous plants/forbs), andclimate factors (mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temper-ature (MAT)) were recorded. A meta-an alysis was performed to elucidate therhizosphere effects on nutrients (i.e., N, P, and potassium (K)) content. Ourmain aims were to (1) quantify nutrient availability in the rhizosphere com-pared to bulk soil, (2) identify how plant characteristics, original soil prop-erties, and climatic factors in ﬂuence nutrient availability in the rhizosphererelative to bulk soil, and (3) quantitatively elucidate the relative abundanceof bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere compared to bulksoil. We hypothesized that (1) available pools of nutrients are more de-pleted in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil due to intensive root uptakeand microbial immobilization; (2) Plants with taproots accumulate moreorganic C and nutrients compared to plants with ﬁbrous roots owing tostronger interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi during their longerlife; (3) copiotrophic groups are more abundant than oligotrophs in the rhi-zosphere than in bulk soil.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data collection and extractionPeer-reviewed research articles were collected from the ISI Web of Sci-ence search engine. China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)search engine was also used to increase the number of studies for themeta-analysis. The searching keywords included: either “rhizosphere soilor rhizospheric soil, ”either “bulk soil ”or“non-rhizospheric soil ”and either“soil nitrogen ”,“soil phosphorus ”,“organic carbon ”,“organic matter ”,“en-zyme* ”or“microbial community ”. The articles had to meet the followingcriteria to be included in the database: (i) data from bulk soil were includedfor comparison with data from rhizosphere soil; (ii) at least one of the var-iables presented in Table S1 should be included; (iii) the mean and replicatenumbers for each variable were reported. A total of 123 articles, including1030 observations, were found and included in the database for furtheranalysis (Fig. S1; Table S1).The data in the tables or main text were directly derived from thearticles. The data illustrated in the ﬁgures of the articles were extractedusing the WebPlotDigitizer (v.4.4) software ( https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer ). The mean value, standard deviation (SD), and numbersof replicates (n) of each variable were extracted from the original sources.When standard error (SE) was reported, it was converted to SD by usingthe following equation: SD=SE×n0.5. When SD or SE were not available,a SD approximated value as one-tenth of the mean was adopted(Gattinger et al., 2012 ;Luo et al., 2006 ;Xu et al., 2019 ).In addition to the aforementioned variables, other information, such asgeographical coordinates, climate factors (MAT and MAP), plant character-istics, original soil properties (pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen(TN), total phosphorous (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen(AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK)) were alsocollected from the articles. The methods to collect rhizosphere and bulksoil or analyze soil nutrients content are all commonly used, which ensuresthe observations are comparable. Only data reported as populationdensities (CUF·g−1) were collected to calculate the effect size of microbes(i.e. bacteria and fungi) between rhizosphere and bulk soil. When thearticles reported soil organic matter content, we converted it to SOCcontent by using a factor of 1.724 ( Swanepoel et al., 2016 ). When articlesdid not include MAT or MAP data, we downloaded these from WorldClim(http://worldclim.org/version1 ) using the reported coordinates andArcGIS 10 software ( Hijmans et al., 2005 ). Detailed information on plantcharacteristics was further examined, including plant types (herbaceousplants, shrubs, and trees), legumes/non-legumes, and root system types(ﬁbrous roots and taproots). Descriptive statistics of climate factors andoriginal soil properties in primary studies revealed that the studies coverbroad climatic zones and have very diverse original soil properties. Conse-quently, the results are relevant for broad range of ecosystems (Table S2).ΔpH was calculated by subtracting the bulk soil pH from the rhizo-sphere pH. The relationship between ΔpH and original soil pH was testedusing a linear regression model. As soil pH is an important factor in ﬂuenc-ing nutrient availability, this relation shows the pH modi ﬁcation inrhizosphere by plants and microbes, which helps to understand the mecha-nisms of nutrient mobilization, accumulation or depletion in the rhizo-sphere. The average and SE of ΔpH were also calculated. Data regardingthe relative abundance of bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere and bulksoil were extracted from seven research articles using the above-mentioned approach. These data were used to quantitatively evaluate therelative abundance of bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere compared tobulk soil. The difference in microbial phyla was calculated by subtractingthe relative abundance of individual phyla in bulk soil (bacteria, archaea,or fungi) from that in the rhizosphere soil ( Ren et al., 2021 ). The averagevalue of the difference for individual phyla was calculated as D. The equa-tion for calculating the average value is as follows:D¼∑N1DiN(1)where Dis the average value of the difference between individual phyla. Nis the number of observations for each phylum. Diis the difference in thephyla between the rhizosphere and bulk soil for the ith observation. TheSE of the difference for individual phyla was also calculated.2.2. Data analysis and statisticsEffect size was calculated as the natural log of the response ratio (RR) torepresent the difference of individual variables between the rhizosphereand bulk soil ( Hedges et al., 1999 ):lnRR ¼lnXRXB/C18/C19(2)where XRandXBare the means of a variable in the rhizosphere and bulksoil, respectively. The positive or negative lnRR represented an increaseor decrease of the variable in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soil.The variance of lnRR was determined as follows ( Curtis and Wang, 1998 ;Ren et al., 2018 ):VlnRR¼S2RnRX2RþS2BnBX2B(3)S. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539083where SBandSRare the SDs of the variables in the bulk and rhizospheresoils, respectively. nBand nRare the sample sizes of the variables in thebulk and rhizosphere soils, respectively. To elucidate the overall rhizo-sphere effect, the weighted mean response ratio (lnRR ++) was determinedusing a random-effects model ( Curtis and Wang, 1998 ;Ren et al., 2018 )a sfollows:lnRR þþ¼∑mi¼1∑nj¼1wijlnRR ij∑mi¼1∑nj¼1wij(4)where m is the number of compared groups, jis the number of comparisonsin the ith group, and wis the weight of lnRR (i.e., wij=1 / V lnRRij). The SEs oflnRR ++were calculated as follows:slnRR þþ ðÞ ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ1∑mi¼1∑nj¼1wijs(5)Accordingly, the percentage change can be derived using the equation:[(exp(lnRR ++)−1) × 100%]. When 95% con ﬁdence intervals did notoverlap with zero, the rhizosphere effect on individual variables was signif-icant. Otherwise, the increase (or decrease) of the variable in the rhizo-sphere was insigni ﬁcant compared to that in bulk soil. Kendall's tau rankcorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation were used to test the publica-tion bias within each variable (Table S3). Rosenthal's fail-safe numbers sug-gested that possible publication bias within some variables does notinﬂuence the results ( Rosenberg, 2005 ). During the categorical moderatoranalysis, the signi ﬁcance of the heterogeneities between groups (Q between )and within groups (Q within ) was applied using the Chi-square test. For in-stance, a p-value of Q between smaller than 0.05, represents signi ﬁcant het-erogeneity of the effect size between categories of individual explanatoryvariables. Spearman's correlation coef ﬁcients were calculated to analyzethe relationships between the effect sizes of available nutrients (AN, AP,AK, NH 4+, and NO 3−) and other factors (i.e., original soil properties, MAT,and MAP). Only ﬁeld experiments which were directly affected by climatefactors were included when calculating the correlation coef ﬁcients betweenMAT and MAP and the effect sizes of available nutrients (AN, AP, AK, NH 4+,and NO 3−). The meta-analysis was performed using MetaWin 2.1(Rosenberg et al., 2000 ). Other data analyses were performed using Origin2020b (OriginLab Inc.) software.3. Results3.1. Available nutrients in the rhizosphere vs. in bulk soilThe available N (AN) was 10% higher in the rhizosphere than in thebulk soil ( Fig. 1 A). The NH4+(11%), NO 3−(24%), TN (14%), and MBN(32%) contents in the rhizosphere increased ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Higher enrich-ment of NH 4+and NO 3−was observed in the rhizosphere when either MATor MAP was relatively low ( Fig. 3 ,p<0.05), which generally represents bo-real or relatively dry conditions. The effect size of AN increased at high orig-inal soil pH or when the original SOC, TN, and TP were low, while theopposite trends were found for the effect size of NO3−(Fig. 3 ,p<0.05).Unlike AN, AP decreased by 12% and was more depleted in the rhizo-sphere than in the bulk soil ( Fig. 1 B). The effect size of AP increased athigh original soil pH, but decreased with an increase in the original TPand AP ( Fig. 3 ,p<0.05).The available K (AK) increased by 15% in the rhizosphere compared tothe bulk soil ( Fig. 1 E), whereas the TK content was similar in the rhizo-sphere and bulk soil ( Fig. 2 D). The effect size of AK decreased at high pre-cipitation ( Fig. 3 ,p<0.05).3.2. Soil biochemical and biological factors in the rhizosphere vs. in bulk soilThe increase in pools with fast turnover, for example, MBC and MBN,was approximately twice stronger in the rhizosphere (19% and 32%,respectively) compared to SOC (9%) and TN (14%) ( Fig. 2 ). The activitiesof all enzymes were greater in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil(Fig. 4 ). Remarkably higher bacterial (205%) and fungal (254%) popula-tion densities in the rhizosphere were also con ﬁrmed ( Fig. 2 G–H), empha-sizing the importance of the rhizosphere as a microbial hotspot. Positiverelationships between MBC and bacterial population density, MBC and fun-gal population density, and effect sizes of bacterial and fungal populationdensities were also con ﬁrmed ( Fig. 5 ).The relative abundances of bacteria and archaea, such asProteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, were greater in the rhizo-sphere than in the bulk soil ( Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the relative abundanceof Crenarchaeota ,Actinobacteria ,and Acidobacteria in the rhizospheredecreased.3.3. Rhizosphere nutrient status as affected by plant characteristicsMost available nutrients (AP, AK, NH 4+,a n dN O 3−)w e r em o r ee n r i c h e din the rhizosphere of taproots than in ﬁbrous roots, as indicated by theirlarger change around taproots ( Fig. 1 ). Similar strong enrichments werealso found for the SOC, TN, TP, TK, MBC, and MBN contents around tap-roots ( Fig. 2 ). Further, bacteria and fungi were more abundant in the rhizo-sphere of taproots than in ﬁbrous roots ( Fig. 2 G–H).AN and AP were more exhausted in the rhizosphere of legumes than innon-legumes ( Fig. 1 A–B). In contrast, the MBC and MBN contents werehigher in the legume than in the non-legume rhizospheres ( Fig. 2 E–F). Sim-ilarly, the effect size of bacterial and fungal population densities was alsohigher in the rhizosphere of legumes than in that of non-legumes ( Fig. 5 C).3.4. Shift of rhizosphere pH as related to original soil pH and plant characteristicsΔpH decreased with increasing original soil pH ( Fig. 7 A), indicating aneutralizing effect and buffering capacity of plant roots in both acidic andalkaline soils. On average, the soil pH in the rhizosphere was 0.16 ± 0.02units lower than in bulk soil ( Fig. 7 B). Plant characteristics strongly in ﬂu-enced the rhizosphere soil pH ( Fig. 7 C–E). Leguminous species induced amuch higher reduction in rhizosphere pH ( −0.44 units) than non-legumes ( −0.11 units).4. DiscussionThis meta-analysis demonstrated that the availability of most nutrientswas higher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil ( Figs. 1 and 8 ). Exception-ally, the AP was more depleted in the rhizosphere, indicating extreme P de-mand for plants (especially for legumes) and microorganisms. Among theinterrelated factor groups, the increase in nutrient availability in the rhizo-sphere as compared to bulk soil was higher for low-fertile or acidic soils be-cause of stronger root-microbial interactions and acidity neutralizingeffects. Plants with taproots have greater SOC than plants with ﬁbrousroots, which provide suf ﬁcient substrates for microbial growth and enzymesynthesis. This leads to a very strong increase in bacterial (+352%) andfungal (+483%) population densities and slightly higher AP, AK, NH 4+,and NO 3−contents around taproots than ﬁbrous roots ( Figs. 1, 2, and 8 ).A much larger increase in bacterial and fungal population densities in therhizosphere than in the microbial biomass (indicated as MBC, +19%) dem-onstrated that the average biomass of individual microbial cells decreased.We proposed that the higher dominance of copiotrophic microorganisms inthe rhizosphere, which have faster growth rates in response to higher avail-ability of C resources than oligotrophs, could be responsible for this de-crease ( Figs. 2 and 8 ).4.1. Effects of climatic factors and original soil properties on available nutrients inthe rhizosphereClimatic factors, such as precipitation and temperature, have speci ﬁce f -fects on nutrient availability within the rhizosphere. While NH 4+and NO 3−enrichments were strongly regulated by precipitation and temperature,S. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539084these did not in ﬂuence AP in the rhizosphere ( Fig. 3 ). NH 4+and NO 3−arethe two most important N forms for root uptake, the contents of whichare mediated by soil moisture and temperature. For instance, the transfor-mation between NH 4+and NO 3−, as well as the plant preference for Nuptake, strongly increases with temperature ( Clarkson, 1986 ;Ganmore-Neumann and Kafka ﬁ,1 9 8 0 ;Kafka ﬁ,1 9 9 0 ). Warming increases soilorganic matter decomposition ( Kuzyakov and Bol, 2006 ), thereby also Nmineralization, but also stimulates N uptake by plants and immobilizationby microorganisms ( Dong et al., 2001 ), which depletes NH 4+and NO 3−inthe rhizosphere. The effects of temperature on the root uptake of eitherNH 4+or NO 3−differs because of N diffusion, root physiology, membranepermeability, presence of mycorrhizal symbionts, and competition withmicroorganisms for N ( Clarke and Barley, 1968 ;Warren, 2009 ).Clarkson (1986) suggested that 85% of N uptake is in the form of NH 4+rather than NO 3−at temperatures below 9 °C. High NO 3−uptake ismore common under warmer conditions ( Warren, 2009 ). NH 4+can beadsorbed on and in clay particles, which strongly decreases its diffusiv-ity compared to NO 3−and in ﬂuences the effect of temperature change onNH 4+uptake. N availability in the rhizosphere is greater under droughtconditions due to decreased pla nt and/or microbial N uptake ( Creggeret al., 2014 ;Deng et al., 2021 ). This explains the negative relationshipbetween MAP and the effect sizes of NO 3−(Fig. 3 ). Similar to NO 3−,drought-induced reduction in K uptake by roots also contributes to Kenrichment in the rhizosphere ( Ge et al., 2012 ), leading to a negativerelationship between MAP and the effect size of AK.Compared to the effects of climatic factors, the original soil properties(pH, SOC, TN, TP, AP, and AK) were more important for the effect sizesof AN, AP, and AK ( Fig. 3 ). Soil with originally high fertility (high contentsof SOC, TN, TP, AP, and AK) provides suf ﬁcient available nutrients for bothplant and microbial communities ( Tang et al., 2021 ;Tian et al., 2020 ). Nu-trient delivery from bulk soil to the roots by diffusion and mass ﬂow meetsthe plant and microbial demand. In contrast, when soil is less fertile (lowerSOC, TN, and TP contents), the mass ﬂow from the bulk soil to the rhizo-sphere is low. Microorganisms and roots release more enzymes and carbox-ylates to increase nutrient mineralization from organic pools to maintaintheir growth ( Rengel and Marschner, 2005 ).Fig. 1.

Acidity and alkalinity neutralization in the rhizosphere modulates nutrientavailabilityAlthough most plant species acidify the rhizosphere, the ability of plantsto inﬂuence the rhizosphere pH depends strongly on the original soil pH(Fig. 7 A). Speci ﬁcally, the plant increases or decreases the rhizosphere pHto maintain the equilibrium between cations and anions at the root-soil in-terface ( Figs. 7 and 8 ). Roots acidify rhizosphere soil through the followingprocesses: i) uptake of cations coupled with proton release, ii) release of or-ganic acids ( Jones, 1998 ), and iii) CO 2release via root respiration ( RaoFig. 2.

Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539086et al., 2002 ), and iv) release of chelates removing cations from exchangesites. Microorganisms acidify the rhizosphere through similar processes.In particular, legumes strongly acidify the rhizosphere ( −0.44 unit,Fig. 7 D) because of the release of protons following the excess uptake of cat-ions over anions during biological N 2ﬁxation ( Haynes, 1983 ;Israel andJackson, 1982 ;Liu et al., 1989 ), as well as nitri ﬁcation of NH 4+to NO 3−(Ma et al., 2019 ;Raza et al., 2020 ). These processes help overcome the de-ﬁciencies of P and Fe as well as micro-nutrients in soil ( Custos et al., 2020 ).In contrast, in acidic soil, plants generally increase the rhizosphere soilpH to tackle Al stress ( Bagayoko et al., 2000 ) and increase the availability ofall macro- and most micro-nutrients. The plant uptake of anions (e.g., NO 3−)in excess of cations often causes the roots to secrete HCO 3−. The excretion ofOH−from NO 3−reduction is also the main mechanism to increase rhizo-sphere pH ( Sugihara et al., 2016 ). For legumes, the reduction of protonsto H 2by nitrogenase during biological N 2ﬁxation also contributes to anincrease in rhizosphere pH ( Mahon, 1979 ). In summary, these neutralizingeffects of the rhizosphere contribute to higher contents of AN, NH 4+, AP,and AK in the rhizosphere when the original soil pH is low ( Fig. 3 ).4.3. Nutrient depletion and accumulation in the rhizosphereThe rhizosphere volume is crucial for plant nutrition, as it de ﬁnes thetotal amount of each nutrient immediately available to the plant. The rhizo-sphere is expected to be depleted with nutrients compared to bulk soil(Joner et al., 1995 ;Wang et al., 2007 ). However, the global meta-analysisconﬁrmed this trend only for AP and AN in the rhizosphere of shrubs(Fig. 1 B), which contradicts our ﬁrst general hypothesis. Low P availabilityin the rhizosphere coupled with high acid and alkaline phosphatase activity(Fig. 4 A–B) compared to bulk soil, shows extreme P demand for plants andmicroorganisms. P availability in the rhizosphere is limited at low and highsoil pH ( Haynes, 1982 ). For instance, calcium phosphate precipitates in analkaline environment (i.e., pH >8.0). At pH values lower than 5.0, iron oraluminum phosphates are formed, and P is adsorbed onto Fe or Al(oxyhydr)oxides. Neutralization of acidity and alkalinity in the rhizosphereincreases P availability. It should be noted that when we calculated the totaleffect size of AP ( Fig. 1 B), all cases (including monoculture and polyculture)were included, but only monocultures were considered when analyzing theinﬂuence of plant characteristics (e.g., taproots and ﬁbrous roots). The neg-ative total effect size of AP, compared to the positive in ﬂuence of most plantcharacteristics ( Fig. 1 B), indicates that increased plant species richness mayexacerbate P depletion in the rhizosphere.In contrast to AP, high nutrient content (i.e., AN, AK, NH 4+,a n dN O 3−;Fig. 1 ) in the rhizosphere could be because mass ﬂow (the movement of nu-trients with water) is faster than the nutrient uptake by roots ( Barber,1962 ). If the nutrient supply from mass ﬂow exceeds their uptake, those nu-trients will increase around the root, which creates accumulation zones(Barber and Ozanne, 1970 ;York et al., 2016 ). This is common especiallyfor Ca2+uptake from calcareous soils ( Zamanian et al., 2016 ), or by Fe ac-cumulation around the roots in iron-rich water-saturated soils ( Hoeferet al., 2017 ;Jeewani et al., 2020 ;Williams et al., 2014 ). However, if nutri-ents are more enriched in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, diffusion mayoccur opposite to the mass ﬂow because of the concentration gradient.The diffusion rate of a nutrient is in ﬂuenced by the exchange of nutrientsbetween soil particle surfaces and surrounding water ( Kuzyakov andRazavi, 2019 ). Organic compounds excreted by roots (i.e., low and highmolecular weight organic compounds) also affect the diffusion rate throughacidiﬁcation, reduction/complexation, or ligand exchange reactions(Hoefer et al., 2017 ;Kramer-Walter et al., 2016 ;Terzano et al., 2014 ),but are mainly de ﬁned by microbial utilization ( Kuzyakov et al., 2003 ).These effects on diffusion can reduce the nutrient uptake of roots by13–61% compared to roots in a stirred nutrient solution ( Drew et al.,1969 ). Therefore, even though nutrients are enriched in the rhizosphere,the diffusion from the rhizosphere to the soil is diminished. On the otherhand, the stronger soil organic matter decomposition and mineralizationrate —the rhizosphere priming effects ( Huo et al., 2017 ;Pausch et al.,2013 ) as indicated by increased enzyme activities ( Sanaullah et al.,2016 ), MBC, and microbial abundance —increase nutrient mineralizationand their availability ( Figs. 2 and 4 ).4.4. Nutrient availability within the rhizosphere is mediated by plant and rootcharacteristicsPlant nutrient exploitation depends on root morphology (e.g., taprootsorﬁbrous roots), interaction with symbionts (e.g., mycorrhiza andrhizobia), and release of root exudates and enzymes ( Dinkelaker andMarschner, 1992 ;Moreau et al., 2019 ). Taproots acquire more water andnutrients from deeper horizons ( Kautz et al., 2013 ). Lateral roots growingfrom taproots extend the nutrient exploring capacity of the plants and en-hance their interactions with bene ﬁcial microorganisms. A larger increasein bacterial (+352%) and fungal (+483%) population densities aroundtaproots also implies stronger microbial activities in their rhizospherethan plants with ﬁbrous roots ( Fig. 2 G–H), contributing to the slightlyhigher AP, AK, NH4+,a n dN O 3−in the rhizosphere of taproots than ﬁbrousroots. The stronger increase in the rhizosphere SOC of taproots, in accor-dance with our second hypothesis, demonstrates the stronger ability of tap-roots to store C and energy sources during their longer life, which providesabundant substrates for enzyme synthesis and thus a larger release of avail-able nutrients ( Fig. 2 A). It should be noted that plants with ﬁbrous root sys-tems have much larger absorptive surface areas than taproots because ofmore highly branched ﬁne roots and active root hairs, which facilitate di-rect nutrient acquisition ( Holz et al., 2018 ). In contrast, the ability of tap-roots to absorb nutrients is limited because of their coarser system;therefore, assistance from microbial symbionts (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhi-zal fungi) is required, explaining the larger increase in bacterial and fungalpopulation densities. This indicates that both root systems have differentabsorptive strategies for nutrients from soils ( Yang et al., 2015 ).Legumes create symbiotic relationships with N- ﬁxing bacteria to in-crease N availability. However, to effectively form symbiotic relationshipswith bacteria and ﬁxN 2, leguminous plants acquire more P ( Magadlelaet al., 2016 ;Stevens et al., 2019 ), which explains why AP is more exhaustedin the rhizosphere of legumes than of other species ( Fig. 1 B). This was sup-ported by the increased alkaline (42%) and acid (108%) phosphatase activ-ities in the rhizosphere of legumes ( Fig. 4 A–B) and also suggested strongerFig. 3.

Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539087mineralization of organic P in legume plants ( Maltais-Landry, 2015 ). Con-trary to our expectation, the effect size of AN in the rhizosphere of legumeswas not different from zero ( Fig. 1 A). Even though the number of observa-tions (8 vs. 109) for the AN of legumes and non-legumes is imbalanced, in-dividual studies have shown either increased ( Dai et al., 2016 ;Qiu et al.,2014 ) or decreased AN ( Ding et al., 2017 ;Xu et al., 2020 ;Zhou, 2014 )i nthe rhizosphere of legumes. It has been argued that legumes could be either“altruistic ”or“self-serving ”(Xu et al., 2020 ). These divergent results can beattributed to the shift in the N-acquisition strategy of plants between N 2-ﬁxation and mineral N uptake pathways, depending on whether the canopyaccumulates enough N to support photosynthesis and rhizodeposition(Henneron et al., 2020 ).Fig. 4. Changes of enzyme activities in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soil. The negative and positive values represent the decrease and increase, respe ctively, of theenzyme activities in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. The open symbols indicate that the value is not signi ﬁcantly different with zero. The number in theparentheses beside each enzyme is the sample size. Error bars represent bootstrapped 95% con ﬁdence intervals. Note that the total effect size of the activity of eachenzyme does not re ﬂect the means from individual groups, because approximately 9 –36% of the observations cannot be subdivided to one of these groups, owing to theabsence of suf ﬁcient information in the original articles. Acp: acid phosphatase; Akp: alkaline phosphatase; NAG: N-acetyl- β-D-glucosaminidase; Dehydro: dehydrogenase;β-glu:β-glucosidase.S. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539088While AN decreased in the rhizosphere of legumes, NH 4+and NO 3−in-creased, as was the case in non-legumes. This inconsistent trend could beexplained by the low proportion of NH 4+and NO 3−in AN (Fig. S2). TheAN content was approximately equal to 5.5 –6.0% of the TN, while NH 4+and NO 3−accounted for only approximately 1% and 0.5% of the TN, respec-tively. This indicates that the remainder of AN, for example, peptides andamino acids, accounts for approximately 4 –4.5% of the TN, which equalsapproximately 73 –75% of AN. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of previ-ous studies ( Jämtgård et al., 2010 ;Young and Aldag, 2015 ), which demon-strated that the contents of soluble organic N forms are higher than that ofmineral N, especially in natural ecosystems. The signi ﬁcantly higherproportion of soluble organic N content in AN suggests that the change inorganic N content, not mineral N, mainly re ﬂects the variation inrhizosphere AN.4.5. Microbial activities and community shift in the rhizosphereThe enzyme activity in the rhizosphere increased by 3 –52% comparedto that in the bulk soil ( Fig. 4 ) and demonstrates an enzyme-speci ﬁc pat-tern. Catalase and polyphenol oxidase are two defense-related antioxidantenzymes ( Babu et al., 2015 ) and their activities increased by 3.4% and7.6%, respectively, in the rhizosphere. These enzymes can be expressedby plant growth-promoting bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas ) or other bene ﬁcialbiota, such as endophytes, which in turn not only strengthen the resistanceof plants to diseases induced by pathogenic fungi ( Hayden et al., 2018 ;Lazcano et al., 2021 ), but also facilitate the transfer of nutrients to thehost plant by colonizing root surfaces. For instance, endophytic bacteria(e.g., Bacillus tequilensis belonging to the Firmicutes phylum) stimulateroot hair development and N uptake by roots ( Beltran-Garcia et al.,2014 ). Increased polyphenol oxidase facilitates the degradation of phenoliccompounds and induces the breakdown of polyphenol-protein complexes,which enables the availability of a large portion of N contained in the com-plexes ( Hättenschwiler and Vitousek, 2000 ). Catalase is related to the redoxability of soil and is associated with aerobic microbial activity ( Nowaket al., 2004 ). In particular, catalase activity in the rhizosphere of legumesincreased by 20% because of the stronger increase in bacterial and fungalpopulation densities ( Figs. 2 and 5 ), indicating that leguminous specieshave a stronger ability to resist environmental stress and protect nodulesfrom pathogens.The increase in bacterial population density in the rhizosphere was sim-ilar to that of fungi ( Fig. 2 G–H), consistent with the close correlation be-tween the effect size of bacterial and fungal population densities ( Fig. 5 ).A much larger increase in bacterial and fungal population densities(205 –254%) in the rhizosphere than in microbial biomass (indicated asMBC, +19%) ( Figs. 2 and 5 A–B) suggests that the average biomass of indi-vidual microbial cells decreased. This could be attributed to the greaterdominance of copiotrophic microorganisms (e.g., Proteobacteria,Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) in the rhizosphere ( Fig. 6 A), which havemuch faster growth rates in available C rich environment than oligotrophs(Fierer et al., 2007 ;Gharechahi et al., 2021 ). Copiotrophs invest more re-sources to proliferate instead of increasing the biomass of each microbialcell. In contrast, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria, mostly belonging to ol-igotrophic microorganisms ( Lebeau, 2011 ), showed decreased relativeabundance of approximately 3.0% ( Fig. 6 A). The shift to copiotrophic mi-croorganisms is important for plant-microbial interactions and nutrientavailability because some members of the phylum (e.g., Mucilaginibacter be-longing to Bacteroidetes and Pseudomonas belonging to Proteobacteria) canproduce large quantities of polysaccharides to optimize the rhizosphere mi-croenvironment, e.g. aggregate soil particles ( Agnihotri et al., 2022 ), pro-vide an energy source for microorganisms, and promote the uptake oftrace elements ( Danhorn and Fuqua, 2007 ;Naseem et al., 2018 ). Ascomy-cota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in the rhizosphere soil(Qin et al., 2017 ). Basidiomycota can degrade lignocellulose organic mattermore easily ( Yelle et al., 2008 ), whereas Ascomycota are more prone to useeasily degradable organic compounds for fast-growing fungi ( Lundell et al.,2010 ). The higher relative abundance of Ascomycota (+4%; Fig. 6 B) in therhizosphere ensures greater production of organic matter-degradingenzymes and the facilitation of symbiotic associations ( Challacombeet al., 2019 ). Furthermore, Crenarchaeota is an ammonia-oxidationarchaeon that colonize roots ( Simon et al., 2000 ). Its relative abundancein this meta-analysis decreased by 10% in the rhizosphere compared tothat in bulk soil ( Fig. 6 ), corroborating the results of Xu et al. (2018) .S t r o n gcompetition from plants for N may constrain the diversi ﬁcation and growthof Crenarchaeota ( Liu et al., 2019 ;Treusch et al., 2005 ). It should be notedthat even though relative abundance of some phyla in the rhizospherecompared to bulk soil was revealed based on the data extracted from theseven studies, a more comprehensive systematic review is required toelucidate the shift of relative abundance and functions of microbialcommunities.5. ConclusionsTheﬁndings of our review have important implications for the elucida-tion of rhizosphere nutrient regulation by plant-microbial interactions.Firstly, the available N and K are enriched in the rhizosphere, while theavailable P is depleted compared to the bulk soil. Plants trigger a varietyof mechanisms to acquire nutrients, including intensive root exudationand neutralization of the acid or alkaline environment. Secondly, plantsFig. 5.

Error bars represent standard deviations.S. Liu et al. Science of the Total Environment 826 (2022) 1539089have various levels of interactions with microorganisms to acquire nutri-ents. For instance, plants with taproot systems will accumulate more or-ganic compounds in the rhizosphere and induce greater microbial densityrelative to plants with ﬁbrous roots, which provide microorganisms withenough substrates to synthesize enzymes and produce polysaccharides ben-eﬁcial for the microenvironment. Legumes create symbiotic relationshipswith N- ﬁxing bacteria and facilitate the release of root exudates and H+,leading to greater microbial number in the rhizosphere and alleviating seri-ous P de ﬁciency. Bacterial and fungal population densities increase muchmore than the total microbial biomass. Together with the more abundantcopiotrophs in the rhizosphere, these ﬁndings suggest that microorganismsin the rhizosphere invest more resources to proliferate instead of increasingtheir size. Even though small cells are presumed to be favored in oligotro-phic settings, speci ﬁc rhizosphere environments (e.g., stronger microbialactivities and higher resource availability) may induce speci ﬁc microbialgrowth strategies in this critical zone. For more comprehensive analysisof the drivers determining nutrient content and availability in the rhizo-sphere, the effects of various types and concentration of root exudatesand other soil properties (e.g. moisture, texture and types) on rhizospherenutrient availability require generalization. Furthermore, examination ofprocesses controlling nutrient content and availability from the perspectiveof molecular genetics of plants and microorganisms is necessary. Finally,considering that most primary studies were performed in China or writtenin Chinese, the consistency and generalization from these primary studiesneed to be veri ﬁed for other ecologies or other countries.CRediT authorship contribution statementShibin Liu: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation;Shibin Liu, Fakun He and Huxuan Xiao: Data curation, Writing-Original draft preparation, Funding acquisition; Yakov Kuzyakov:Writing-Reviewing, Editing and Funding acquisition; Shengyan Pu: Super-vision, Funding acquisition; Bahar Razavi: Writing-Reviewing, Editing.Duyen Thi Thu Hoang: Visualization, Investigation.Declaration of competing interestNo con ﬂict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript, andmanuscript is approved by all authors for publication.AcknowledgementsThe work is supported by the National Key Research and DevelopmentProgram of China (No. 2020YFC1808300), the National ScienceFoundation of China (NSFC; grant Nos: 41807091), and the Research FundFig. 6.

Changes of soil biochemical properties in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil (left), and nutrient depletion and accumulation processes (right). Note that the valuesin this conceptual ﬁgure are rounded up. Most soil properties (evaluated in this meta-analysis) increase in the rhizosphere as compared to the surrounding bulk soil.Exceptionally, soil pH decreases by 0.16 units. The available P decreased roughly by 10%, indicating extreme P demand for plants and microorganisms i n the rhizosphereand slow diffusion from the surrounding soil. The relative abundance of oligotrophic microorganisms (K strategists) decreased in the rhizosphere w ith highly competitivecopiotrophic microorganisms (r strategists) under greater C and nutrient availability. The available nutrients in the rhizosphere are mainly deri ved from thedecomposition and mineralization of various organic compounds (organic matter, root exudates, metabolites, etc.) and microbial cells killed by ph ages and soil animals.Enzymes released by microorganisms and roots accelerate nutrient cycling. Mass ﬂow, diffusion, and desorption from soil clay particles also contribute to nutrientaccumulation in the rhizosphere. In contrast, root uptake, immobilization by microorganisms, leaching, and adsorption by soil particles lead to nu trient depletion in therhizosphere. Acidity or alkalinity neutralization by roots and microorganisms regulates the nutrient availability in the rhizosphere.S. Liu et al.
