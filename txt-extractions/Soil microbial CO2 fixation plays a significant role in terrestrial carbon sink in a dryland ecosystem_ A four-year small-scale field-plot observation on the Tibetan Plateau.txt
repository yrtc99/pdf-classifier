Here we investigated the uncertainty and dynamics of gross primary productivity (GPP) bydistinguishing the contributions of soil microbial primary producers and plants to CO 2ﬁxation during four se-quential growing seasons in a fragile dry grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. The results demonstrated that soil mi-crobial GPP consistently accounted for a high proportion of plant GPP (18.2%), and both exhibited similarseasonal patterns during the four-year observation. Soil microbial GPP demonstrated a much greater interannualvariation (76.1%) than plant GPP (15.1%), indicating that the interannual GPP uncertainty could be largely frommicrobial primary producers. Regression analysis indicated that plant GPP had higher sensitivity (demonstratedby slope) than soil microbial GPP to both soil water content and temperature. The GPP ratio of soil microbes toplants also demonstrated a clear seasonal change, and peaked in July in the four-year observation, with a mini-mum interannual variation (6.8%). The GPP ratio enhanced with increasing soil water content ( P< 0.001), butdid not correlate with soil temperature. Our ﬁndings suggest the great potential of soil microbial GPP, and chal-lenge the plant-oriented models of terrestrial C estimation, which account for plant GPP but ignore soil microbialGPP. Thus, a more robust framework needs to incorporate both soil microbial and plant GPPs for accuratelyassessing C balance.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .

IntroductionDrylands cover more than 40% of the Earth's land surface, constitut-ing the most extensive terrestrial biome, and play a dominant role interrestrial C sink ( Poulter et al., 2014 ;Ahlström et al., 2015 ;Le Quéréet al., 2018 ;Green et al., 2019 ). Dryland regions, especially wherehave naturally sparse vegetation but widely distributed soil microbialcrusts under water limitation ( Belnap, 2003 ;Reynolds et al., 2007 ),may greatly introduce uncertainties in assessing ecosystem C dynamicsand gross primary production (GPP) ( Beer et al., 2010 ;Ballantyne et al.,2015 ;Fan et al., 2019 ;Kheirfam, 2020 ). Given the accelerated drylandexpansion ( Huang et al., 2016 ), a thorough understanding of the GPPuncertainties in dryland ecosystems is urgently required to assess thelocal and global C stock balance and their responses to climate change.Terrestrial GPP includes contributions from both plants and soil mi-crobial primary producers ( Tang et al., 2020 ). However, the widely usedtechniques for estimating GPP are for plant GPP, rather than soil micro-bial GPP, such as remote sensing-based Earth system models and in situobservations ( Zhang et al., 2016 ;Wang et al., 2017 ;Cui et al., 2019 ;Fatichi et al., 2019 ;Pei et al., 2020 ). Therefore, soil microbial GPP hasbeen seriously ignored, although these primary producers have beenevidenced to play a signi ﬁcant role in CO2ﬁxation ( Maestre et al.,2013 ;Weber et al., 2016 ). It has long been recognized that biologicalsoil crusts (BSCs, including mosses, lichens, bacteria, and fungi), a typi-cal type of soil primary producers, play an important role in ﬁxing CO 2indrylands ( Maestre et al., 2013 ;Su et al., 2013 ;Huang et al., 2014 ). Re-cent studies demonstrate that free microbial primary producers, besideBSC, also sequestrate abundant amounts of atmospheric CO 2in diversesoils ( Miltner et al., 2004 ;Yuan et al., 2012 ;Ge et al., 2013 ;Zhao et al.,2018 ). Primary producers and productivity are both sensitive to envi-ronmental changes in drylands, for instance, drought decreases vegeta-tion photosynthesis rate and growth, and consequently reducesterrestrial ecosystem productivity ( Wolf et al., 2016 ;He et al., 2018 ;Stocker et al., 2019 ). In contrast, soil microbes can better adapt toharsh conditions (such as dry and cold) ( Beer et al., 2009 ), therebygrow faster and have increasing CO 2-ﬁxing ef ﬁciency than plants(Usui and Ikenouchi, 1997 ). The high adaptive capacity of soil primaryproducers is evidenced by the wide distribution of BSCs and CO 2-ﬁxing genes ( e.g. cbbL gene) in drylands ( Belnap, 2003 ;Zhao et al.,2018 ). However, soil microbial GPP has not drawn much attention inlarge-scale GPP estimations by satellite monitoring, as remote sensing-based methods commonly use information on solar radiation and vege-tation greenness and type, but do not take the soil microbial primaryproducers into account ( Fan et al., 2019 ;Fatichi et al., 2019 ;Stockeret al., 2019 ). The individual contributions of soil microbes and plantsto terrestrial GPP, and their distinct responses to environmentalchanges have not been distinguished ( Maestre et al., 2013 ;Chen et al.,2017 ;Cui et al., 2019 ).In this study, an in situ ﬁeld observation of soil microbial and plantGPP was conducted in a dry alpine steppe on the Tibetan Plateau. Theobjectives were: 1) to evaluate the relative importance of soil microbes,compared to plants, in contributing terrestrial GPP and 2) to investigatetheir monthly and annually variations in response to temperature andwater conditions in the dryland ecosystem. We hypothesized that soilmicrobial CO 2ﬁxation would account for a considerable part of plantGPP, and the GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants varies with seasonsby altering temperature and water content.2. Materials and methods2.1. Description of study siteThe study site is located in Nam Co Station for Multisphere Observa-tion and Research, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Acad-emy of Sciences (N 30°46 ′, E90°59 ′, 4730 m above sea level, Fig. S1).The Nam Co site is at the foot of the Mt. Nyenchen Tanglha and theterrain here is ﬂat. The region represents a typical dry steppe ( Youet al., 2007 ;Wei et al., 2014, 2015 ). The region is under the control ofthe Indian Monsoon in summer and the Westerlies in the rest seasons.Over the past four decades, the average annual precipitation is415 mm (with large interannual variation ranging from 295 to550 mm), of which 80% –90% occurs in growing seasons from May andSeptember. The average annual temperature is −0.6 °C. The regionhas long, cold winters and short, cool summers, with strong solar radia-tion (max: 317 W m−2in May) and low air pressure at 571 h Pa. Thedominant vegetation species are Stipa Purpurea and Kobresia Pygmaeawith total coverage of 60 –80%. Other vegetation species includedOxytropis microphylla ,Leontopodium pusillum ,Androsace tapete ,Sibbaldia adpressa ,Potentilla spp., Saussurea stoliczkai . The heights ofthe plants ranged from 1 to 10 cm ( Lu et al., 2009 ;Zhu et al., 2015 ;Wang et al., 2020 ). The well-developed biological soil crusts are inlaidamong the plants, with dominant types of lichens (Fig. S1). In our previ-ous investigation, soil autotrophic microbial communities in the biolog-ical soil crusts were classi ﬁed as Cyanobacteria ,Rhizobiales andActinobacteria (Zhao et al., 2018 ). The soil is sandy silt at an early stageof weathering with soil organic C of 1.5%, cation exchange capacity of54.4 mmol kg−1, and pH value of 7.8 ( Wei et al., 2014 ). The researchsite has history of moderate grazing in recent decades, and has beenfenced for scienti ﬁc use since 2005.2.2. Field experimental designTheﬁeld experimental design is shown in Fig. S1. The experimentcontained two treatments (with plants and without plants for grossprimary productivity, GPP). The plots (10 in total) were distributedwith ﬁve randomized blocks in a uniform area of 6 × 10 m. The sizeof each plot was 50 × 50 cm with a minimum buffer distance ofaround 2 m between plots. We did not select a further distancewith the concern that the heterogeneity would affect the degree ofaccuracy of the plant GPP calculation (as shown in Section 2.3 ). Thetreatment without plants was maintained by removing abovegroundplants one day before the measurement during growing seasonsusing scissors.2.3. Gross primary production measurementsTo measure the GPP, stainless steel collars (50 × 50 cm) wereinstalled at depth of 5 cm in all plots two weeks before the initial mea-surements in 2016, and kept in place during the entire observation pe-riod. The aim of installing the collars at depth of 5 cm was to avoid therisk of air leakage from the sandy topsoil when conducting GPP mea-surements. The images showing the collars and the process of the GPPmeasurement were shown in Fig. S1.Static chamber method has been widely used for in situ measuringecosystem CO 2ﬂux (Novis et al., 2007 ;Niu et al., 2013 ;Su et al., 2013 ;Huang et al., 2014 ;Chen et al., 2015 ), and was used for the GPP mea-surements in the current study. The measurement processes werebrieﬂy shown in Fig. S1. GPP was calculated by the following equation:GPP ¼RE−NEEwhere RE is ecosystem respiration (RE, in mg CO 2m−2h−1)a n dN E Ei snet ecosystem CO 2exchange (NEE, in mg CO 2m−2h−1). NEE was mea-sured using a transparent chamber (50 × 50 × 50 cm) made of acrylicsheets, and RE was measured using a lightproof cloth to cover the trans-parent chamber. The chamber was attached to an infrared gas analyzer(LI-840A, LI-COR Inc. Lincoln, NE, USA) with an electric pump to circu-late gas viainlet and outlet tubes (4 mm inner diameter) at a ﬂow rateof 500 ml min−1.T h eC O 2ﬂux (including both RE and NEE) was calcu-lated as shown in the following equation:Fi¼ρi/C1V=AðÞ /C1 P=P0 ðÞ /C1 T0=T ðÞ /C1 dCi=dt ðÞH. Chen, F. Wang, W. Kong et al. Science of the Total Environment 761 (2021) 1432822where F iis the ﬂux rate in mg CO 2m−2h−1,ρiis the density at stan-dard condition, V is the chamber volume, A is the chamber base area,P is the air pressure, P 0is the standard air pressure, T is the air tem-perature, T 0is the standard temperature, and dC i/dtis the changerate of the gas concentration. Soil microbial GPP was measured inplots where plants were removed by scissors prior to in situ measur-ing the CO 2ﬂux, while plant GPP was calculated by the followingequation:Plant GPP ¼GPP in plot with plants −soil microbial GPP :The CO 2ﬂux measurement was extensively conducted for eachmonth of the growing seasons in 2016 (from May to October) and2018 (January and from June to October). Aiming to illuminate themonthly variation of CO 2ﬂux between years and possible soil microbialGPP in Winter seasons, CO 2ﬂux was measured for speci ﬁc months of2017 (April, October, November and December) and 2019 (May andSeptember). The CO 2ﬂux was measured every 2 h from sunrise to sun-set in a typical sunny day in each measuring month. For each time, theentire measurement for all plots was done in half an hour. Daily CO2ﬂux was calculated as the average hourly CO 2ﬂux throughout the day,and annually CO 2ﬂux was calculated as the average daily CO 2in eachmonth.2.4. Soil temperature and water content measurementsThe soil temperature and water content were recorded by a portablethermometer (L99-TWS-3, Lupu Corp., China) with sensors installed at2 cm deep in topsoil when CO 2ﬂux was measured. We selected adepth of 2 cm because the soil surface layer was considered to be themost relevant when studying the responses of soil microbial and plantphotosynthetic CO 2ﬁxation to the soil conditions.2.5. Statistical analysisThe normality of the data was checked using Kolmogorov-Smirnovtest in SPSS software (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and all ofthePvalues were greater than 0.05. Other statistical analyses were con-ducted using R software (version 3.5.3). Data are expressed as mean ±SE (standard error). Differences between treatments and months weretested using the Student's t-test. Correlation analyses (Spearman corre-lation) were used to investigate the relationship between GPPs and soilwater content and temperature.3. Results3.1. Monthly dynamics of soil microbial and plant gross primary production(GPP)Soil microbial GPP exhibited a marked seasonal change ( Fig. 1 ). In2016, soil microbial GPP signi ﬁcantly ( P< 0.001) increased from May(8.1 ± 2.7 mg CO2m−2h−1) to the highest in July (69.3 ± 13.9 mgCO2m−2h−1) by 7.5 fold, and then gradually decreased to the originallevel in October. Similarly, in 2018 soil microbial GPP signi ﬁcantly(P< 0.001) increased from June (5.3 ± 0.8 mg CO 2m−2h−1) to thehighest in August (57.9 ± 6.1 mg CO 2m−2h−1) by 10.0 fold, and thendecreased to the original level in October. The soil microbial GPP exhib-ited similar monthly patterns over the growing seasons in 2016 and2018. In contrast, yearly average GPP was 43.5 ± 10.6 mg CO 2m−2h−1in 2016 and 24.7 ± 8.6 mg CO 2m−2h−1in 2018, and showeda substantial interannual variation by 76%. We then selected severalmonths in 2017 and 2019 to check the monthly variation of the soil mi-crobial GPP across the four years. The soil microbial GPP in October of2017 and in May and September of 2019 were very similar to those ob-served in the same months of 2016 and 2018. Soil microbial GPP did notshow CO 2-ﬁxing activity in late autumn and winter months (from Octo-ber to April).Plants had signi ﬁcantly higher GPP than soil microbial primary pro-ducers ( P<0 . 0 0 1 , Fig. 1 ). Plant GPP exhibited similar monthly patternsto soil microbial GPP, in particular, the lowest and the highest GPP oc-curred in the same months in 2016 and 2018. In 2016, plant GPP dra-matically increased from May (38.4 ± 9.9 mg CO 2m−2h−1)t ot h ehighest in July (276.3 ± 33.1 mg CO 2m−2h−1) by 6.2 fold, and thensubstantially decreased to 2.2 ± 0.9 mg CO 2m−2h−1in October. Thevalue signi ﬁcantly ( P< 0.001) increased in 2018 from June (45.9 ±1.9 mg CO 2m−2h−1) to the highest in August (247.0 ± 34.6 mg CO 2m−2h−1) by 4.4 fold, and then substantially decreased back to135.7 ± 18.7 mg CO 2m−2h−1in October. The averaged values ofplant GPP in 2016 and 2018 were 141.2 ± 36.4 mg CO 2m−2h−1and122.7 ± 32.3 mg CO 2m−2h−1, respectively, with little interannual var-iation (15.1%). The selected measuring months in 2017 and 2019 alsodemonstrated similar GPP values as to the 2016 and 2018.3.2. Monthly dynamics of GPP ratio of soil microbes to plantsSimilar to the monthly GPP pattern, GPP ratio of soil microbes toplants also exhibited a monthly pattern ( Fig. 2 ). In 2016, the GPP ratioof soil microbes to plants gradually but signi ﬁcantly ( P< 0.001)Fig. 1. Seasonal dynamics in gross primary production (GPP) of soil microbial primary producers and plants during 2016 –2019. Soil microbial and plant GPP demonstrated similar seasonalpatterns in the four-year ﬁeld observation. Note that in the x axis the time line is equally spaced for the years 2016 and 2018 but not for 2017 and 2019.H. Chen, F. Wang, W. Kong et al. Science of the Total Environment 761 (2021) 1432823increased from May (8.0 ± 2.8%) to the highest in July (21.9 ± 4.1%) by1.7 fold, and then gradually decreased to the original level in October. In2018, the GPP ratio signi ﬁcantly ( P< 0.001) increased from June(10.3 ± 0.9%) to July (35.7 ± 4.7%) by 2.5 fold, and then gradually de-creased to 7.6 ± 2.3% in October. The ratios in selected months of2017 and 2019 were similar to those in the same months of 2016 and2018. The averaged GPP ratio was 17.6 ± 3.3% in 2016, similar to thatin 2018 (18.8 ± 5.4%, Fig. S2), with very little interannual variation(6.8%).3.3. Effects of soil water content and temperature on microbial and plantGPP and their ratioSoil water content and temperature had positive effects on soil mi-crobial GPP and its ratio to plants (both P< 0.05, Table S1). Linear re-gressions revealed that soil microbial and plant GPP both positivelycorrelated with soil temperature (both P< 0.001), and plant GPPshowed a higher regression slope than soil microbial GPP (Fig. S3). Sim-ilarly, soil microbial and plant GPP both positively correlated with soilwater content (both P< 0.01), and plant GPP showed a higher slopecompared to soil microbial GPP. GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants pos-itively correlated with soil water content ( P< 0.001), while there wasno signi ﬁcant correlation with soil temperature ( Fig. 3 ).4. Discussion4.1. Importance of soil microbial CO2ﬁxation in dryland ecosystemsThis study conducted an in situ observation comparison between soilmicrobial and plant GPP in the ﬁeld. The detected soil microbial GPP(33.0 mg CO 2m−2h−1, equal to 0.21 μmol m−2s−1) in the presentstudy was in the range of previously reported GPP of ﬁeld observationsin various drylands in China and global drylands ( Novis et al., 2007 ;Suet al., 2013 ;Huang et al., 2014 ). The plant GPP (131.1 mg CO 2m−2h−1,equal to 0.83 μmol m−2s−1) was also similar to those observed ingrassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau ( Chen et al., 2015 ). Com-pared to widely recognized plant CO 2ﬁxation, our ﬁndings demon-strated that soil microbial CO 2ﬁxation also substantially contributedto GPP in the dry grasslands ( Figs. 1, 2 and S1), which strongly sup-ported our ﬁrst hypothesis. The importance of soil microbial CO 2ﬁxa-tion has been evidenced by previous incubation studies using isotopiclabelling in laboratories ( Miltner et al., 2004 ;Yuan et al., 2012 ;Geet al., 2013 ;Zhao et al., 2018 ), and in ﬁeld observations of BSC in drylandregions ( Novis et al., 2007 ;Su et al., 2013 ;Huang et al., 2014 ). Here ourresults showed a consistently high proportion (on average 18.2%) of soilmicrobial to plant GPP and extended the previous recognitions.Over the past decades, strong integrations of biogeochemistry, plantphysiological ecology and remote sensing studies have substantially ad-vanced our understanding of terrestrial GPP ( Farquhar et al., 1980 ;Sellers et al., 1997 ;Beer et al., 2010 ). Remote sensing-based methodsFig. 2. Seasonal dynamics in gross primary production (GPP) ratio of soil microbes to plants during 2016 –2019. The GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants gradually increased from May to Julyand then decreased to the original levels. Note that in the x axis the time line is equally spaced for the years 2016 and 2018 but not for 2017 and 2019.Fig. 3. Regressions of gross primary production (GPP) ratio of soil microbial primaryproducers to plants with soil temperature (a) and soil water content (b). The GPP ratiopositively correlated with soil water content, but not with soil temperature. Lines andshaded polygons indicate the predictions and their 95% con ﬁdence intervals, respectively.H. Chen, F. Wang, W. Kong et al. Science of the Total Environment 761 (2021) 1432824for estimating terrestrial GPP have greatly counteracted the ‘missingsink ’observed previously ( Magney et al., 2019 ;Ryu et al., 2019 ;Stocker et al., 2019 ). However, these methods mainly focus on plantphotosynthesis ( Wang et al., 2017 ;Fatichi et al., 2019 ), and cannot ac-count for the soil microbial CO 2ﬁxation. The lack of incorporating soilmicrobial GPP has been proposed to result in substantial uncertaintiesin dryland and even global C balance ( Maestre et al., 2013 ;Weberet al., 2016 ;Rodriguez-Caballero et al., 2018 ).Our estimation of soil microbial GPP across the Tibetan Plateau andglobal drylands based on the in situ observation showed a considerableC sink potential that can not be ignored ( Zhang et al., 2002 ;Huang et al.,2016 , Table S2). The global importance of soil microbial GPP is expectedto substantially increase due to the accelerated dryland expansionunder climate change (half of the global land surface by the end ofthis century, Huang et al., 2016 ). Additionally, the dramatically higherinterannual variation of soil microbial GPP than plant GPP might alsocontribute to increase the substantial variabiity in global dryland C as-sessment. It should be noted that upscaling from a ﬁeld-plot study toglobal would be far from reality due to the spatial variation of drylandecosystem ( Beer et al., 2010 ;Ahlström et al., 2015 ). Thus, the currentcase study has its limitation on large-scale estimation but provides in-sights into how comprehensively understand ecosystem C sink in dry-lands and even in humid regions. In the future, more long-termobservation-based studies in different ecosystems may be needed tobroaden the regional recognition of relative importance of soil microbialand plant GPP as well as their relationships. Further, since the most re-mote sensing-based models solely address vegetation production(Wang et al., 2019 ), our results suggest an urgent need to develop amore robust theoretical framework for modelling terrestrial GPP, inwhich the soil microbial GPP should be taken into account. This is partic-ularly concerned in ecologically fragile ecosystems, such as drylands,where Zhao et al. (2018) reported that soil microbial CO 2ﬁxation ratenegatively correlated with plant biomass and soil nutrients, indicatingthe more important role of microbial GPP in oligotrophic soils.4.2. Responses of soil microbial and plant GPP to soil water content andtemperatureSoil microbial and plant GPP both substantially changed with thegrowing seasons, and the highest GPP occurred in July and August.This is in agreement with that season in ﬂuences soil microbial andplant activity by altering soil temperature and soil moisture ( Chenet al., 2018 ;Fan et al., 2020 ). This was evidenced by the strong positivecorrelations of soil microbial and plant GPP with soil temperature andmoisture (Fig. S3, Table S1). Soil temperature directly facilitated micro-bial and plant growth and activity, particularly in yearly cold regions,such as Tibetan Plateau ( Bai et al., 2020 ;Dong et al., 2020 ). Similarly,the facilitating effect of soil moisture could be both direct and indirectthrough affecting the availability of substrates, nutrients, and oxygen(Schimel et al., 2007 ;Singh et al., 2010 ). It has long been recognizedthat vegetation activity mainly drives the seasonal variations of atmo-spheric CO 2(Magney et al., 2019 ;Ryu et al., 2019 ). Our ﬁndings furtherextended the concept that soil microbial CO 2ﬁxation could also persis-tently and substantially affect atmospheric CO 2across seasons.Besides the similarities, the soil microbial and plant GPP also exhib-ited different responses to the seasons. Linear regressions showedhigher sensitivities of plant GPP than soil microbial GPP to soil temper-ature and moisture over seasons (Fig. S3). As positive effects of temper-ature and moisture on both plants and soil microbes have long beenrecognized ( Yao et al., 2017 ;Zhou et al., 2018 ;Winkler et al., 2019 ),higher sensitivity of plant GPP could be due to that plants have phenol-ogy, but soil microbes do not ( Piao et al., 2019 ). In contrast, soil micro-bial GPP appeared to be more heavily driven by soil factors ( i.e.watercontent and temperature), despite of strong positive interactions be-tween plant and soil microbial growth ( Wardle et al., 2004 ). The ab-sence of phenology in soil microbes was also evidenced by the largedifferences of soil microbial and plant GPP at early growing season.For example, in May of 2016 and June of 2018, soil microbes did notﬁxC O 2because of low soil temperature and moisture. In contrast,plant GPPs reached up to 23.3 and 25.4 mg CO 2m−2h−1in May andJune, due to the plants usually start greening in May and June, even inharsh environments. In addition, phenology partly explained thelower interannual variation of plant GPP than that soil microbial GPP(Shen et al., 2013 ;Cao et al., 2018 ).GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants, with the average of 18.2%, exhib-ited a clear seasonal pattern, and the highest GPP ratio occurred in July(Fig. 2 ). This ﬁnding supports the differences between soil microbial andplant GPP in response to climatic conditions, and is in agreement withour second hypothesis that relative contribution of soil microbial GPPwould change with seasons. We observed a positive relationship be-tween the GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants and soil water content,while the ratio did not signi ﬁcantly correlate with soil temperature(Fig. 3 ). This highlights the signi ﬁcant role of soil water, consistentwith that more signi ﬁcant effect of soil moisture than temperature onsoil microbial activity in dryland ecosystems ( Scola et al., 2018 ;León-Sobrino et al., 2019 ). Soil microbes usually better adapt to droughtthan plants ( Beer et al., 2009 ), and respond faster to increasing moistureand have higher C- ﬁxing ef ﬁciency in response to moisture ( Usui andIkenouchi, 1997 ). Drought impacts on terrestrial GPP are usuallyunderestimated by satellite monitoring methods, which has recently re-ceived much attentions ( Stocker et al., 2018 ;Green et al., 2019 ;Stockeret al., 2019 ). Here our ﬁnding indicates that the relative importance ofsoil microbial and plant GPP changed with soil moisture, thus providesfurther information on the underestimation of terrestrial GPP in relationto climate change. Further, recent studies suggests that different typesof soil biocrusts can also affect plant communities by changing the mi-croenvironment and surface soil nutrients, indicating the possible oc-currence of complicated interactions between plants and soilmicrobial GPP ( Xu et al., 2020 ). Due to the signi ﬁcance of soil microbialGPP, the differentiation and interactions of soil microbial and plantphysiological ecology in relation to terrestrial GPP deserves to be appre-ciated in diverse dryland ecosystems in the context of changing climate.5. ConclusionThis study in situ investigated the soil microbial and plant GPP, andtheir temporal variations during growing seasons in a dryland ecosys-tem on the Tibetan Plateau. Soil microbial GPP had similar change pat-terns as plant GPP over seasons, but exhibited a greater interannualvariation. The high GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants (18.2%) indicatesthat soil primary producers substantially contributed to terrestrial Csink in the dryland ecosystem. The GPP ratio of soil microbes to plantsexhibited the highest in July and enhanced with increasing soil watercontent but not temperature. These ﬁndings challenge the currentplant-oriented Earth system models of terrestrial GPP estimation. Wecall for more in situ observations in soil microbial contribution to terres-trial C sink in dryland ecosystems, which could be integrated intomodels for reducing uncertainties of terrestrial C balance. Further,more attentions should be drawn on the responses of plants and soil mi-crobial GPP to the changing climate in different dryland ecosystems andthe mechanisms underlying it.CRediT authorship contribution statementHao Chen: Methodology, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing -original draft.
