The phyllosphere, the aerial part of the plant, provides aunique habitat for diverse microbes, and in return the phyllosphere microbiome greatly affectsplant performance. As an open system, the phyllosphere is subjected to environmentalperturbations, including global change, which will impact the crosstalk between plants and theirmicrobiomes. In this review, we aim to provide a synthesis of current knowledge of the complexinteractions between plants and the phyllosphere microbiome under global changes and toidentify future priority areas of research on this topic.IntroductionThe interactions between plants and their associated microbiomesare crucial for host performance and resilience to environmentperturbations (e.g. global change) (Bulgarelli et al.,2013 ; Trivediet al.,2020 ). Historically, plant microbiome research has focusedmainly on the rhizosphere, including the symbiotic relationshipbetween plant roots and bacteria and fungi, as well as soil-bornepathogen dynamics. In the last decade or so, with the advent ofmolecular and genomic technologies, plant microbiome researchhas expanded rapidly, from the rhizosphere to phyllosphere,endosphere and seeds/fruits (Delmotte et al.,2009 ; Shade et al.,2017 ; Carri /C19onet al.,2019 ; Grady et al.,2019 ). The phyllosphererepresents the aboveground part of a plant, harbouring diversemicrobes in both epiphytic (an organism that grows on the surfaceof a plant) and endophytic (an organism that lives within a plant)niches (Vorholt, 2012 ). When considering the upper and lowerleaf surfaces, the total area of the phyllosphere on Earth isestimated to be over 109km2and harbours up to 1026bacterialcells (Lindow & Brandl, 2003 ; Vorholt, 2012 ; Penuelas &Terradas, 2014 ). The Earth and its ecosystems are undergoingrapid global changes such as climate change (e.g. warming anddrought) and land-use change (e.g. habitat loss and chemicalfertilization), which are exerting pervasive impacts on ecosystemprocesses and functions, and various interactions among plants,microbes and the environment (Vitousek, 1994 ; Jansson &Hofmockel, 2019 ; Z. Zhou et al.,2020 ). A systematic under-standing of how global change affects phyllosphere microbiomescould provide an important baseline for harnessing microbiomesto promote ecosystem resilience and plant productivity in asustainable way. In this review, we aim to provide an overview ofhow global change will inﬂuence the complex interplay betweenDedication: This paper is dedicated to the late Prof. Sally E. Smith.

For instance, some plant growth-promoting bacteria inhabiting the phyllosphere such as Microbac-terium ,Stenotrophomonas andMethylobacterium can improve thegrowth and nutritional status of the host plant by producing naturalgrowth regulators (e.g. IAA) and ﬁxing nitrogen (Madhaiyan et al.,2015 ; Abadi et al.,2020 ). The phyllosphere microbiome also playsimportant roles in reducing plant methanol (e.g. methylotrophs)and isoprene (e.g. isoprene-degrading bacteria of the genusVariovorax ) emissions to the atmosphere (Abanda-Nkpwatt et al.,2006 ; Crombie et al.,2018 ). Moreover, the phyllosphere micro-biome can play vital roles in maintaining plant health andsuppressing the overgrowth of plant pathogens. For example, thephyllosphere microbiome can protect Arabidopsis plants againstfungal pathogens and dysbiosis (a disruption to the microbiotahomeostasis) that could have deleterious impacts on the host health(Ritpitakphong et al.,2016 ; Chen et al.,2020 ). Recent ﬁndingsdemonstrate that bacteria and yeasts colonizing nectar canmodulate nectar chemical composition and consequently inﬂuencevisitation/foraging by insect pollinators (Liu et al.,2019 ). As such,the phyllosphere microbiome contributes to the gut microbiome ofinsect pollinators and therefore inﬂuences their ﬁtness andbehaviour (Liu et al.,2019 ). Nonetheless, it should also be notedthat phyllosphere microorganisms can have negative effects on hostplants. The presence of a large and varied microbial community inthe phyllosphere might increase competition with plants fornutrients and water (Saikkonen et al.,2015 ; Vacher et al.,2016 ).Some members of the phyllosphere microbiome might act as plantpathogens, resulting in different forms of plant disease (Lindow &Leveau, 2002 ; Whipps et al.,2008 ; Baker et al.,2010 ). Recently,Zhou et al.(2021b ) reported that the phyllosphere microbiome isinvolved in the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes in theurban green facade. Another report (B /C19artaet al.,2021 ) suggests thatthe phyllosphere microbiome aids in the establishment of theinvasive macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata L. under conditions ofnitrogen scarcity. Increasing evidence shows that global change haspervasive impacts on plant health and ecosystem functioning, andharnessing the beneﬁcial functions provided by the phyllospheremicrobiome to enhance plant growth and ﬁtness to face suchimpacts is considered a viable sustainable approach.Drivers and sources of the phyllosphere microbiomeAs the phyllosphere is an open system, its associated microbiomescan come from multiple sources. The assembly of the phyllospheremicrobiome is subject to: complex and variable environmentalconditions (e.g. temperature, solar radiation, humidity, soil typeand agricultural activity) (Vorholt, 2012 ; Aydogan et al.,2018 ;Truchado et al.,2019 ; Zhou et al.,2019 ; Stone & Jackson, 2021 );plant species and genotypes (Singh et al.,2018 ; Schlechter et al.,2019 ; Wagner et al.,2020 ); the adaptability to particular foliarstructures or resource secretions (e.g. leaf age and surface roughness,primary and secondary metabolites) (Crombie et al.,2018 ; Nam-daret al.,2019 ; Sun et al.,2019 ); and the complex interactionsbetween multiple trophic levels, such as microbe –microbe inter-actions and plant –herbivore –microbiome interactions (Remus-Emsermann et al.,2013 ; Agler et al.,2016 ; Helfrich et al.,2018 ;Carlstr €omet al.,2019 ; Liu et al.,2021 ). In addition, invasive plantscaused by global change may inﬂuence the phyllosphere micro-biome by altering soil properties and microbial communities andplant –soil feedback (McLeod et al.,2021 ).

This could partially explain theobservations of microbial overlap between plant tissues and soil(Baiet al.,2015 ; Zarraonaindia et al.,2015 ; Chen et al.,2017 ;X uet al.,2018 ). Furthermore, opening of leaf stomata and woundsprovides a pathway for the transformation and migration betweenendophytes and epiphytes, and the opportunity for externalmicrobes from aerosols and insects to colonize the plant, whichalso suggests that plants and the environment are interconnected(Mullens & Jamann, 2021 ; Xiang et al.,2021 ). Nevertheless, arecent study analysed the sources of phyllosphere microbes througha customized microcosm that was able to control external microbes(Zhou et al.,2021a ), and showed that microbial sources from soiland air were limited. In another study, oak seeds were found totransmit a large part of microbes to roots and the phyllosphere,emphasizing that plant seeds are the reservoir of the plantmicrobiome (Abdelfattah et al.,2021 ), particularly in the earlystages of plant growth (Berg & Raaijmakers, 2018 ; X. Zhou et al.,2020 ). Seeds can carry highly diverse and beneﬁcial bacterial taxa toensure the establishment of an optimal bacterial symbiosis foroffspring (Liang et al.,2021 ). These studies highlight thatinheritance of plant microbes may play a dominant role in shapingthe phyllosphere microbiota.Overall, the sources of phyllosphere microbes are complex anddynamic, inﬂuenced by both intrinsic plant factors and environ-mental conditions, while biotic and abiotic selection pressures mustalso be considered (Eldridge et al.,2021 ). A probable mechanism,therefore, is that the combination of environmental and geneticfactors determines the assembly of microbial communities (Shakiret al.,2021 ). Uncovering how global change affects microbiomeassembly, sources of transmission and plant –microbiome inter-actions in the phyllosphere could provide a mechanistic under-standing for future microbiome manipulation.Hotspots and frontier trends in the phyllospheremicrobiome responses to global changeBibliometric analysis was conducted by retrieving citation datafrom the Web of Science Core Collection database to highlight thehotspots and frontier trends in the phyllosphere microbiomeresponses to global change. Keyword cooccurrence networkanalysis showed that recent research has focused mainly on therelationships between phyllosphere microbiomes and plant growthand health under global change scenarios. These relationships alsoinclude interactions between pathogenic bacteria and plantpathogen resistance (Fig. 2a).

Furthermore, phyllosphere microbiomes alsoparticipate in carbon and nitrogen cycling by engaging in nitrogenﬁxing, metabolizing plant metabolites and producing volatileorganic compounds (Madhaiyan et al.,2015 ; Farre-Armengolet al.,2016 ; Cernava et al.,2019 ); how carbon and nitrogen cyclingmediated by the phyllosphere microbiome respond to climatechange have not clearly determined. Although network analysisindicates that the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is the mostpopular research taxon, a new plant model that is more agricul-turally relevant is urgently needed to study crop –microbiomeinteractions for the development of effective microbiome tools forsustainable agriculture. Burst word detection analysis was furtherused to show a time-series pattern of keywords, exploring researchtrends and advances in phyllosphere microbial ecology studies inresponse to global change over the last decade (Fig. 2b). Plantgrowth- and stress tolerance-related research has seen the greatestincrease since 2018 and therefore represents the current hotspot. Amethodological driver for the recent increase in mechanism-relatedresearch may be that the development of emerging technologies hasallowed researchers to disentangle the mechanisms of the phyllo-sphere microbiome regulating plant growth and tolerance.Impacts of agricultural fertilization on thephyllosphere microbiomeModern agricultural production relies heavily on the use ofchemical fertilizers, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) andpotassium (K) fertilizers. Global agricultural production isexpected to increase by 70% by 2050 to feed the increasing humanpopulation (Singh et al.,2020b ; Haskett et al.,2021 ), and the useof chemical fertilizers is likely to increase signiﬁcantly in futureagricultural production. However, intensive fertilization couldcause soil degradation such as acidiﬁcation and environmentalpollution (Raza et al.,2020 ). Currently, most studies on theimpacts of chemical fertilization on microbial communities havefocused on soil and the rhizosphere, while there is a paucity ofstudies investigating how phyllosphere microbiomes respond tochemical fertilization (Hartman et al.,2018 ; Trivedi et al.,2020 ).In general, the phyllosphere harboured a less diverse microbialpopulation including bacteria, fungi and protists than soil andrhizosphere, while the alpha- and beta-diversity of thesephyllosphere-associated microbes often showed more resistanceto fertilization (Sun et al.,2021a ,b). One explanation for this couldbe the open nature of the phyllosphere, as phyllosphere-associatedmicrobes are inﬂuenced by multiple factors within dynamic andheterogeneous environments (Lindow & Brandl, 2003 ; Remus-Emsermann & Schlechter, 2018 ), which may weaken the inﬂuenceof fertilization regimes on phyllosphere microbial variations. Inaddition, a recent study focusing on the soil –plant continuum ofmaize, wheat and barley has demonstrated host selection plays amore important role in shaping phyllosphere assembly andnetwork complexity than fertilization practices (Xiong et al.,2021b ). Nevertheless, fertilization process may inﬂuence somespeciﬁc microbial taxa in the phyllosphere. For instance, excessiveapplication of chemical N fertilizer increased the relative abun-dance of potential fungal plant pathogens in the leaf endosphere(Xiong et al.,2021a ). Similarly, a study on sorghum showed thatlong-term fertilization regimes did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence thediversity and composition of protistan communities in thephyllosphere, but some protistan consumers (e.g. Amoebozoa)were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by fertilization (Sun et al.,2021b ).Additionally, other macro- and micronutrients also play a role inphyllosphere microbiome assembly. For example, application ofthese nutrients in soil increased microbial biodiversity but reducedthe relative abundance of pathogen Candidatus Liberibacterasiaticus (CLas) in the phyllosphere of Gannan Navel Orange(Y. Zhou et al.,2021 ). Although these studies provided valuableinformation, the fundamental knowledge of the mechanismsunderlying phyllosphere microbiome assembly and activity underfertilization remains in its infancy.In addition to fertilization, microbial communities in agricul-tural ecosystems are usually inﬂuenced by agronomic managementregimes (e.g. organic and conventional management). It hasbeenreported that organic farming increased fungal alpha diversityin the wheat phyllosphere, compared with conventional manage-ment (Karlsson et al.,2017 ). A recent study also suggested thatagricultural management (i.e. organic, transition and conven-tional) strongly inﬂuenced the composition, functions and cooc-currence networks of the sugarcane phyllosphere microbiome(Khoiri et al.,2021 ). Organic farming was associated with acomplex microbial network and enriched some plant growth-promoting bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium andBacillus , whereasconventional practice decreased the abundance of functional genesinvolved in cell motility and energy metabolism of phyllospheremicrobiomes (Khoiri et al.,2021 ). Emerging evidence indicatesthat agricultural management is an important factor drivingphyllosphere microbiome assembly. Uncovering phyllosphere –microbiome interactions and their molecular mechanisms underdifferent agricultural management practices can provide newscientiﬁc knowledge to harness the phyllosphere microbiome forplant productivity and sustainable agriculture.Impacts of global warming on the phyllospheremicrobiomeGlobal warming caused by the ‘greenhouse effect’ is predicted tohave major consequences on element cycling and the functioning ofterrestrial ecosystems such as vegetation dynamics (Vitousek, 1994 ;Jones et al.,1998 ; Norby & Luo, 2004 ), which will substantiallyimpact the phyllosphere microbiome (Zhu & Penuelas, 2020 )(Fig. 3). Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC, 2014 ), global mean surface temperature is estimated toincrease by 2 –3°C within the next few decades (Stocker, 2014 ),which is predicted to result in a global increase in drought frequencyand duration.In recent decades, experimental studies of climate warmingeffects have focused mostly on the soil microbiome (Yergeau et al.,2012 ; Jansson & Hofmockel, 2019 ; Z. Zhou et al.,2020 ), while thepotential impacts of warming on the abundance and compositionsof the phyllosphere microbiome have largely been overlooked andNew Phytologist (2022) 234: 1977–1986www.newphytologist.com/C2112021 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112021 New Phytologist FoundationReview Research reviewNewPhytologist 1980 14698137, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17928 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023].

For example, based on a long-term ﬁeld warming experiment on a grassland (dominated byArrhenatherum elatius andGalium album ) with increasing surfacetemperature of 2 °C, Aydogan et al.(2018 ,2020 ) found thatwarming does not affect the total colonization and the concentra-tion of leaf-associated bacterial cells but shifted the diversity andNPMediate hydraulicactivation of stomataRhizosphereNutrientuptakeLayered defence againstplant pathogensPathogenpressureFoliar water uptakeSeed germinationParental inheritanceHorizontal transmissionClimatewarmingGlobal changeChemical fertilizationPhyllospheremicrobiome traitsSoil microbiomePhyllosphereFunctional traits- Nutrient stress signaling- Abiotic stress signaling- Immune signalingClosedstomataGuard cellsEpidermal cellOpenedstomataCO 2O2H2ORhizosphericdefenceEndophyticdefenceCross-talkH2O + O 2CO 2PrecipitationOpenedstomataABAH2OCO 2PhotosynthesisDroughtClosedstomataPathogenExcessive application ofchemical N fertilizerGuard cellCell wallLeafFig. 3 Impact factors of the phyllosphere microbiome. The phyllosphere comprises the aboveground part of a plant, harbouring diverse microbes in bothepiphytic and endophytic niches. These microbiomes derive from vertical transmission via parental inheritance, and horizontal transmission by su rroundingenvironments (e.g. soil and air). On the one hand, global changes such as climate warming, drought and precipitation might impact leaf functional tra its andphyllosphere microbiome traits, and the latter mediates the hydraulic activation of stomata relevant to the pathway for foliar water uptake. On the o ther hand,chemical fertilization can also affect the phyllosphere microbiome by changing rhizosphere communities and leaf morphology./C2112021 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112021 New Phytologist FoundationNew Phytologist (2022) 234: 1977–1986www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Research review Review 1981 14698137, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17928 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensephylogenetic composition of the bacterial communities. Moreimportantly, warming-induced decreases of beneﬁcial bacteria (e.g.Sphingomona s spp. and Rhizobium spp.) and enhancement ofpotentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae, Pseu-domonas , and Acinetobacter ) in the phyllosphere may indicate thatwarming increases the potential transmission of pathogens ingrassland ecosystems (Aydogan et al.,2018 ). In addition toaffecting phyllosphere bacterial communities, climate warmingalso decreased fungal richness, reduced evenness and shifted theoverall fungal community composition on pedunculate oak(Quercus robur ) (Faticov et al.,2021 ) and a boreal forest tree(Populus balsamifera L.) (Balint et al.,2015 ). In contrast topotential bacterial pathogens (e.g. Acinetobacter ), warming nega-tively affected putative fungal pathogens (Aydogan et al.,2018 ;Faticov et al.,2021 ). These elegant studies provided valuableinformation on the impacts of climate warming on the proﬁles ofthe phyllosphere microbiome. However, care must be taken wheninterpreting the outcomes of each study, as only limited plantspecies and genotypes have been considered. The differences in leaftraits, nutrient content and primary/secondary metabolites amonggenotypes could result in differential colonization of microorgan-isms, which may mask the effects of climate warming (Wagneret al.,2016 ). For instance, in contrast to the above observation,other studies have indicated that long-term warming experimentscaused no signiﬁcant changes in the foliar fungal communitycomposition of three perennial grass species ( Achnatherum letter-manii ,Festuca thurberi andPoa pratensis ) (Kazenel et al.,2019 ;Kivlin et al.,2019 ). Thus, it is unclear whether the response of thephyllosphere microbiome to climate warming is consistent acrossplant species and genotypes, although some excellent studies havebeen conducted on this topic (Faticov et al.,2021 ). Moreover, thepresent investigations on phyllosphere microbiomes have focusedgenerally on bacterial and fungal communities, while littleattention has been paid to other microbes such as archaea andprotists. All these observations have highlighted the need toimprove our understanding of climate warming on the phyllo-sphere microbiome.Impacts of precipitation and drought on thephyllosphere microbiomePrecipitation has begun to show a long-term downward trendunder global climate change, resulting in a global increase indrought frequency and duration (Sardans et al.,2008 ). Meanwhile,extreme weather events including ﬂoods and drought are beingrecorded more acutely and frequently. Such a change at the globalscale is expected to have signiﬁcant impacts on global agriculturalproduction, as it can inﬂuence plant growth and plant diseaseoccurrence by altering humidity and water availability (Howdenet al.,2007 ; Xin et al.,2016 ;X uet al.,2021 ; Romero et al.,2022 ).A recent large-scale survey suggested that precipitation is the mostimportant predictor of fungal communities and the abundance offungal plant pathogens, and the authors suggested that theabundance of fungal plant pathogens could increase by up to100-fold by 2050, especially in coastal regions (Chen et al.,2021 ).The interactions between water status, soil fertility and arbuscularmycorrhizal fungi could also shift the phyllosphere microbiome;for example, both water status and mycorrhizal disruption couldreduce phyllosphere bacterial richness, with a more homogeneousbacterial community composition of the tomato ( Solanum lyco-persicum ) phyllosphere (Debray et al.,2022 ). In addition, it wasfound that high humidity can transform nonpathogenic Pseu-domonas syringae strains into virulent pathogens and inducedyshomeostasis of the commensal bacterial community in thephyllosphere by affecting water status inside the apoplast (Xin et al.,2016 ). Furthermore, drought stress not only affects phyllospheremicrobial compositions (Bechtold et al.,2021 ) but also commu-nity assembly processes. A recent study on sorghum systems withabundant sampling indicated that the assembly of phyllospheremycobiomes was determined by stochastic processes (e.g. drift orstochastic dispersal) in the early stage of host development whensorghum is drought-stressed (Gao et al.,2020 ). Regarding precip-itation, recent work on the wetland macrophyte broadleaf cattail(Typha latifolia ) showed that rain events did not have a signiﬁcanteffect on the richness or evenness of its phyllosphere bacterialcommunity (Stone & Jackson, 2021 ). By contrast, climatic andleaf-related variables effectively shaped seasonal dynamics inphyllosphere diversity and composition (Stone & Jackson, 2021 ).Under the scenario of climate change, improving our understand-ing of how plant species and their microbiomes can cope withdrought events is one of the most relevant topics in plant science.Foliar water uptake (FWU) has been identiﬁed as a mechanismcommonly adopted by trees and other plants from various biomesand could be used to predict the sensitivity of plant species todrought (Schreel & Steppe, 2020 ). In addition to morphologicaland anatomical traits and leaf age (Schreel & Steppe, 2020 ), leafwettability also depends on the degree of cover by the phyllospheremicrobiome (epiphytic and endophytic organisms) and thus affectstheir hydrophobicity (Rosado & Almeida, 2020 ). For example, thecuticular permeability that allows the diffusion of water through thecuticle might be increased by biosurfactants produced by epiphyticbacteria (Park et al.,2018 ), indicating their potential effect onFWU. Moreover, the phyllosphere microbiome can also mediatethe hydraulic activation of stomata, which is relevant to thepathway for FWU. For example, fungal leaf endophytes mayincrease stomatal conductance, while bacteria may mediatestomatal closure and opening (Friesen et al.,2011 ). Consideringthe stomata as the gateway for the entrance of pathogens to plants(Gudesblat et al.,2009 ), regulation of the stomatal aperture by thephyllosphere microbiome is also a mechanism associated with plantdefence. All these observations suggest that phyllosphere-associatedmicrobiomes have great potential to improve plant resistance tofuture drought (Rolli et al.,2015 ; Llorens et al.,2019 ; de Vrieset al.,2020 ;X u et al.,2021 ).Ecoevolutionary dynamics between the phyllosphereand its microbiomes under global climate changeThe ecoevolutionary dynamics of plant –microbiome symbiosissystems are of increasing interest. Unfortunately, little has beendone regarding the phyllosphere. Among current studies, theimpacts of plant evolutionary history and contemporary evolutionNew Phytologist (2022) 234: 1977–1986www.newphytologist.com/C2112021 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112021 New Phytologist FoundationReview Research reviewNewPhytologist 1982 14698137, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17928 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [21/03/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseon plant, soil and rhizosphere microbiome responses to climatechange have received much attention (Lambers et al.,2009 ;Fitzpatrick et al.,2020 ; Petipas et al.,2021 ).As the outcome of past evolutionary history, the phylogeneticrelationship between plant species has been found to be able tointeract with climate change to modify plant microbiomes (Nayloret al.,2017 ). In the absence of drought, cereal grass phylogeny wasshown to determine rhizosphere microbiome composition. Sucheffects of host evolutionary history on microbiomes have beenwidely observed in plants, especially those with agriculturalsigniﬁcance (Stolf-Moreira et al.,2011 ; Peiffer et al.,2013 ;Santos-Medell /C19ınet al.,2017 ). Drought, however, promoted theabundance of Actinobacteria, weakening the importance of hostevolutionary history for microbiome community structure (Nayloret al.,2017 ). In addition, evolution at the contemporary timescale,in both microbiomes and plants, can mediate plant –microbiomeresponses to climate change. Microbes often have a large popula-tion size and high genetic variation, which translate to strongevolutionary dynamics to inﬂuence ecological processes (Yoshidaet al.,2003 ; Frantzeskakis et al.,2020 ). For example, using thesynthetic community approach, Batstone et al.(2020 ) showed thatrapid evolution has occurred in the nodule-forming bacteriumEnsifer meliloti and promoted mutualism between the bacteriumand the plant host Medicago truncatula . Unlike microbes, morebarriers exist for plant evolution. Nevertheless, recent evidence hassuggested the possibility of rapid evolution in plants. In anexperiment by terHorst et al.(2014 ), adaptation was found tooccur in Brassica rapa populations after a three-generation droughttreatment. When transplanted into a common garden underambient wet conditions, B. rapa populations (adapted vsunadapted to drought) showed different abilities in shaping thesoil microbiomes.We recognize that most existing work has focused on theecoevolutionary dynamics between plants and soil/rhizospheremicrobiomes, not microbiomes in other plant compartments,including the phyllosphere. Also, little attention has been given toseveral evolutionary processes unique to plants, such as within- andcross-species hybridization (Rieseberg & Carney, 1998 ) and theemergence of polyploidy plants (Adams & Wendel, 2005 ), whichcan introduce novel genetic variation to wild plant populations.Recent progress in research on ecoevolutionary dynamics hasprompted the development of new model systems for study of therole of plant evolution in ecological processes (Williams et al.,2016 ; Hart et al.,2019 ). For example, there is increasing interest inusing aquatic ﬂoating plants of the family Lemnaceae (commonlyknown as duckweeds) to examine plant ecological and evolutionaryresponses to environmental change (Armitage & Jones, 2019 ;O’Brien et al.,2020 ). Duckweeds have high within-species geno-typic and phenotypic diversity (Hart et al.,2019 ; O’Brien et al.,2020 ), making it possible to observe the changes in both speciescomposition (ecological dynamics) and genotypic composition(evolutionary dynamics) during plant –microbiome interactions atthe same timescale. The high tractability of these model systems canextend the scope of observational studies, providing more mech-anistic understanding of the importance of evolution in plant –microbiome systems.Conclusions and perspectivesThe phyllosphere microbiome plays an essential role in increasingthe ability of a plant to pass through environmental ﬁlters.Currently, however, we have limited capacity to predict theconsequences of the shift in the phyllosphere microbiome forecosystem functioning under a changing environment. Somefundamental questions remain largely unresolved: (1) What arethe mechanisms within and across plant hosts that underpinhost–microbe interactions? (2) What are the major microbial taxain the phyllosphere that control or mediate plant performance(e.g. nutrient uptake, plant disease suppression or growth)? (3)How does the phyllosphere microbiome interact with other plantmicrobiomes? (4) How can we manage the phyllospheremicrobiome to increase plant health and performance in achanging world? (5) How will host and the phyllospheremicrobiome evolve in response to global changes, and whatimpacts will this ecoevolution have on ecosystem functions?Therefore, we argue that advancing our fundamental under-standing of the impacts of global changes on the phyllospheremicrobiome and related ecosystem functions requires interdisci-plinary investigations. We need to shift the focus from the level ofcommunity ecology to ecosystem ecology for a better under-standing of the mechanisms underlying responses of the ‘holo-biont’ (assemblage of a plant and its microbiome living in oraround it) to global changes. A systems approach is needed tounderstand the complex interactions between the phyllospheremicrobiome and host ﬁtness, and the ecological functions of thesemicrobes for plant nutrition uptake, growth and survival underglobal climate change.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (42021005 and 42090063).ORCIDQing-Lin Chen https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-277XHui-Ling Cui https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9203-5072Gui-Lan Duan https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2880-5017Bin Ma https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4807-4992Jiaqi Tan https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8357-1965Zhong Wei https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7967-4897Chao Xiong https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3023-0494Li-Mei Zhang https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7383-8475Shu-Yi-Dan Zhou https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2585-7305Yong-Guan Zhu https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3861-8482ReferencesAbadi VAJM, Sepehri M, Rahmani HA, Zarei M, Ronaghi A, Taghavi SM,Shamshiripour M. 2020.
