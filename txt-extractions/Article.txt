It has been shown that the cultivation of catch crops may play an important role in the mitigation of CO 2 emissions. A study on the importance of catch crops (in relat ion to the main crop) in carbon dioxide sequestration was  conducted over the period of 2016 -2018 under the soil and climatic conditions of the central Lublin region, Poland. Subsequently, ploughed -in catch crop biomass is a kind of ‘soil CO 2 bank’. It was proven that in the case of successful catch crops one can  expect carbon dioxide sequestration by these crop cultures to be at a level from 4 to 6 tons CO 2 ha-1·yr-1. The quantity of CO 2 absorbed from the atmosphere by a catch crop is directly proportional to biomass yield produced by it. The following species, w hich are resilient to adverse weather conditions during seeding and initial plant growth, proved to be particularly useful in carbon dioxide sequestration by catch crops: white mustard, tansy phaceli a, winter rye, winter wheat + winter vetch mixture. Catch  crops also positively affect the amount of soil organic C compared to soils where they are not grown. Based on the obtained study results, it can be tentatively stated that catch crops are an import ant factor in carbon dioxide sequestration in broadly und erstood agricultural activity. It is advisable to promote catch crops on a wide scale due to relatively small costs of such crops compared to the benefits arising from them (phytosanitary effects on soil, CO 2 sequestration, and soil carbon storage). It is however necessary to conduct further research in this area in order to determine the suitability of specific catch crop species for CO 2 sequestration in various climatic and soil zones.

Many studies [1 -6] stress the important rol e of crops in mitigating the CO 2 emissions into the atmos phere. The use of plants as a source of energy is widely advocated as a remedy for CO 2 emissions. Nevertheless, the role of terrestrial ecosystems, including agriculture, in mitigating the increase o f CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere remains underapprec iated. It should be noted that the emissions from fossil fuels combustion and cement production constitute only about 4.7% of CO 2 emissions from the natural sources, i.e. terrestrial ecosystems and o ceans [4,  7, 8].                                                  *  Corresponding author: l.pawlowski@pollub.pl  C.A. KWIATKOWSKI et al.       INT J CONSERV SCI 1 1, 4, 2020: 1005 -1018 1006 The advantages of most rural areas in Po land include, among others, large agricultural land resources and the possibility of using their potential to grow catch crops. A catch crop is a crop grown in pure stand or in mixtures, cultivated in  a crop rotation between the main crops. In this way, a third additional yield from a field over a two -year period is obtained. The plants with a short growing period (with a fast growth rate) are primarily grown as catch crops, and they are used during th e vegetative growth period or at the initial stage of ge nerative growth, most frequently for the so -called green manure (mixed with soil/ploughed under) or as mulch (plants cut in autumn and left on the field surface to early spring, undergoing slow minera lization) [9, 10].  Catch crops, as an additional plant c over on a field during the growing season, can significantly contribute to sequestration of CO 2 from the atmospheric air and subsequently to trapping CO 2 in soil [11, 12].  Currently, a certain barrier  to the development of a low -emission economy in rural a reas in Poland can also be observed – plants for crop rotation are frequently selected inappropriately (without promoting catch crops). Moreover, farmers rarely grow proper catch crop species (those t hat are adapted to local soil and climatic conditions an d which leave a large amount of biomass in the form of crop residues incorporated into soil) [13, 14].  Thus, the assumed increase in the importance of catch crops – growing crops with a soil organic m atter reproduction rate (e.g. large -seed and small -seed legumes as well as their mixtures with cereals and grasses, white mustard, tansy phacelia) – constitutes an opportunity for the rural areas and agriculture [15 -17]. In Poland catch crops are very popu lar as an in -between crop in cereal monocultures [18].  Taking into account the above considerations, this study hypothesized that: an assumption was made that successful catch crops producing large aboveground and belowground biomass in a short time can a bsorb substantial amounts of CO 2 ha-1 per year. Promotin g this type of crops across the whole continent would contribute to realistically greater CO 2 sequestration by crop plants, thus being an added value in total sequestration of CO 2 by agriculture.  The aim of the present study was to determine the possibilit y and range of CO 2 sequestration by some plant species grown as catch crops (stubble crops, winter cover crops, undersown crops) relative to eighteen species (cereal, root and tuber, legume, oilseed, and meadow and pasture plants) grown as the main crop (a  list of crop plant species is below - in the Methods section). This study evaluated CO 2 sequestration by aboveground organs (primary and secondary yield) and belowground organs of these plants. It al so analyzed the importance of catch crops in soil organi c carbon storage.   Methods   Over the period 2016 -2018, studies of two types were conducted in production fields at the Czes ławice Experimental Farm (51°30′N; 22°26′E - Lubelskie Voivodeship, Poland)  on loess soil [19] with the grain size distribution of silt loam (PWsp) and classified as good wheat soil complex (soil class II). The experiment was set up as a split -plot design with 3 replicates in 12m2 plots (single plot: 3 ×4m). CO 2 sequestration by aboveground and belowground plant parts  The first type of  study related to CO 2 sequestration by aboveground and belowground plant parts. This study was carried out on 18 se lected agricultural crops being the main crop: winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), spring wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), spring barley (Horde um vulgare L.), winter rye ( Secale cereale L.), winter triticale ( x Triticosecale ), oats (Avena sativa L.), maize ( Zea mays L.), proso millet ( Panicum miliaceum L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentu m L.), amaranth ( Amaranthus cruentus L.), winter oilseed rap e (Brassica napus L. var. napus ), soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merr .) lentil ( Lens culinaris L.), narrow -leafed CAN CATCH CROPS BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION?    http://www.ijcs.r o 1007 lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.), sugar beet ( Beta vulga ris L. subsp . vulgaris convar . vulgaris var. altissima ), car rot (Daucus carota L.) and meadow hay; and 14 catch crops being an additional crop during the growing season, grown  in pure stand and in mixtures: white mustard ( Sinapis alba L.), spring oilseed r ape (Brassica napus L. var. napus ), tansy phacelia ( Phacelia  tanacetifolia L.), red clover ( Trifolium pretense L.), serradella (Ornithopus sativus Brot.), westerwolds ryegrass  (Lolium multiflorum L. var. westerwoldicum ), spring vetch ( Vicia sativa L.) + fi eld pea ( Pisum sativum subsp. arvense (L.) Asch .), narrow -leafed lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.), yellow lupine ( Lupinus luteus L.), oats ( Avena sativa L.) + spring vetch ( Vicia sativa L.) + field pea (Pisum sativum subsp . arvense (L.) Asch .), winter rye  (Secale cereale L.), perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne L.) + winter vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth .), winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) + winter vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth .). All the plant species analyzed in this research design were grown in the convention al farming system; conventional (plough) tillage was used, w hile fertilization and plant protection products were applied at dates and rates recommended for the specific spe cies. At the agronomically optimal harvest date of the particular main crop plant, plant material samples were collected (plants were pulled ou t from 1 .0m2 of each study plot) in order to determine the following parameters (expressed on a t/ha basis): prima ry yield (grain, seeds, roots, tubers, biomass), secondary yield (straw, stems, le aves), belowground crop residues (roots) and total yield (pr imary yield + secondary yield + crop residues). At the agronomically optimal harvest date of the particular catch crop plant, plant material samples were collected from an identical area (1 .0m2) of each cover -cropped plot in order to determine total biomas s yield (aboveground parts and roots). Samples were taken at 4 randomly selected places in each plot, according to the design shown in figure 1, within a 0.25 ×1.00m frame.    Fig. 1. The plan t samp ling scheme in a single plot (12 m2)  for primary yield of c atch crops   The collected samples were segregated into individual yield fractions and dried under labora tory conditions at a temperature of 40°C to determine yield (t ·ha-1). Next, carbon (C) conten t in plant tissues was determined for the individual yield fractions [20] and expressed as CO 2 content. CO 2 sequestration efficiency was calculated taking into acc ount primary yield of the crop (whose dry matter was 85 -88%, depending on the crop plan t spec ies) and carbon (C) content determined on a dry matter basi s in the individual crop species.  The determined carbon content was expressed on a CO 2 basis by multip lying C × 3.67  (t·ha-1).  Then, CO 2 sequestration (t CO 2 ha-1·yr-1) was calculated based  on th e yield of the individual plants (t ·ha-1). Determination of  soil organic C content  The second type of study involved the determination of organic C content (with a carbon analyzer) in the soil under the selected plants grown as catch crops (white mu stard, spring oilseed rape, tansy phacelia, red clover, serradella , Westerwolds ryegrass, spring vetch + field pea, narrow -leafed lupine, yellow lupine, oats + spring ve tch + field pea, winter rye, perennial ryegrass + winter vetch, winter vetch, winter wh eat + w inter vetch) relative to the control treatment without catc h crop. Organic carbon content was expressed in g kg-1 soil. To determine the comprehensive effect of c atch crops on soil chemistry (organic carbon content), soil samples C.A. KWIATKOWSKI et al.       INT J CONSERV SCI 1 1, 4, 2020: 1005 -1018 1008 were taken from the  0-20cm layer of soil. Soil samples were taken using a soil sampli ng tube from an area of 0.20 m2 in each plot in autumn.  Statistical analysis  Analysis of variance (ANOV A) was used to statistically analyze the results by employing Statistica PL 13.3, whi le Tukey’s  test was applied to determine HSD (Honest Significant Diff erence) values at p < 0.05. The mean for the study period is given in the results tables because the y ear-to-year differences between the characteristics analyzed were statistically insig nificant. No significant interaction was found between the experiment al factors: A (main crops/catch crops), and years (B). For the resulting data presented in tables 1, 2  and 4 the following were calculated: SD - standard deviation and CV - coefficient of  variation . Moreover, to determine dependencies and relationships bet ween the studied characteristics, correlation (r) analysis was applied.   Results   Productivity of main  crops and CO 2 sequestration  The productivity of crops specified in table 1, grown un der the so il and climatic conditions of the central Lublin region (Cz esławice Experimental Farm), is generally higher that the average yield of these species in Poland [21] .

CAN CATCH CROPS BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION?    http://www.ijcs.r o 1009 The data included in table 1 show that root crops (beetroot, carrot) and tuber crops (potato) are characterized by the highest primary and secondary yield (significantly higher relative to the other crops). This means that  species producing the largest biomass in primary and secon dary yield are characterized by the greatest CO 2 sequestrati on (Table 1). Nevertheless, the above -mentioned sp ecies are not leading crops in Poland’s crop structure [21] because cereal crops domina te by far in it, occupying about 75% of the total cropped a rea, while among them in particular winter and spring wheat,  spring barley, winter triticale, and for several years also maize. The data contained in table 1 reveal that the above -mentioned cereal species produce yields at a high level. Winter oilseed rape , which is becoming increasingly popular in the crop structu re in Poland, is also characterized by high yield potential. The yield potential of soybean (a plant that is also gaining popularity amon g farmers). The meadow vegetation should also be considered  to be an important link of the CO 2 sequestration (meadow ha y is generally a mixture of several grass species,  possibly together with a small -seed legume crop). Under the conditions prevailing in C zesławice, the yield potential of such crops is high – at a level of 5.4t·ha-1 (Table 1). The above -mentioned crop spec ies exhibit significantly higher primary and secondary yield as well as significantly greater CO 2 sequestration in comparison to the spec ies that produce low yields: buckwheat, proso millet, amaranth, and lentil. The species such as maize, narrow -leafed lu pine, and soybean were characterized by significa ntly the highest belowground crop residues, while meadow hay, proso millet, buckwheat an d amaranth by significantly the lowest belowground crop residues.

The scale of both CO 2 sequestrations by main crop plants (seed/tuber/root yield), secondary yield (straw/stems and leaves), and crop residue yield (roots), and of CO 2 seques tration by catch crops is directly proportional to bi omass produced by them (as confirmed by the calculated coefficients of correlation (r) – (Table 2). This table shows that in most of the C.A. KWIATKOWSKI et al.       INT J CONSERV SCI 1 1, 4, 2020: 1005 -1018 1010 crop plants analyzed, primary yield and secondary yield exhibit a significantly positive correlation with CO 2 sequestra tion by these crops. A particularly high relationship between yield and CO 2 sequestration is confirmed by the calculated correlation coefficients for the root crops (beetroot, potato, carrot), but also f or winter and spring wheat, maize, and narrow -leafed lupin. The plants with lower yielding potential (buckwheat, proso millet, amaranth, and lentil) showed a statistically insignificant (though positive) relationship with CO 2 sequestration. To sum up, the correlation coefficients presented in table 2 prove t hat primary and secondary yield are strongly correlated to CO 2 sequestration. Crop residues, on the other hand, have a much smaller relationship with CO 2 sequestration (Table 2).  Productivit y of catch cr ops and CO 2 sequestration  Unreliable yields due to agro -climatic conditions are a drawback of catch crops. The average biomass dry matter yield of catch crops grown in the central Lublin region (Poland) ranges from 2.64 to 4.26 t·ha-1 (Table 3) .   Table 3 .

This table shows that the divergence in yields of the specific catch crop species (sole cropped or grown in mixtures) is very large. Stubble crops (white mustard, tansy phacelia, CAN CATCH CROPS BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION?    http://www.ijcs.r o 1011 mixed spring vetch + field pea) and some winter cover crops (winter rye, wi nter wheat + winter vetch) give the most reliable  yields. The biomass of these catch crops was significantly higher than the biomass of  the other catch crop species included in this study. The above -mentioned catch crops are characterized by significantly the highest CO 2 sequestration (expressed as t ha-1·yr-1). Undersown crops (red clover, serradella, Westerwolds ryegrass) and some sole cropped legume species (yellow lupin, narrow -leafed lupin, winter vetch) produce significantly the lowest yields. To sum up, it should be noted that all the catch crop sp ecies studied exhibited high carbon dioxide sequestration by aboveground biomass, rang ing from 4.03 (Westerwolds ryegrass) to 6.64 (white mustard) t CO 2 ha-1·yr-1. Roots of the catch crops sequestration from  0.07 (Westerwolds ryegrass) to 0.46 (narrow -leaved lupine, yellow lupine) t CO 2 ha-1·yr-1. The statistical calculations confirmed a cl ose relationship (a significant coefficient of correlation) between the highest biomass yield of the catch crops (white m ustard, spring oilseed rape, tansy phacelia, narr ow-leafed lupine, yellow lupine, winter rye, and mixtures: spring vetch + field pea, o ats + spring vetch + field pea, winter wheat + winter wheat) and CO 2 sequestration by these catch crops (dry biomass: pla nts + roots). It should however be noted that it is the aboveground part of the catch crop biomass that predominantly determines the sc ale of CO 2 sequestration.  This means that catch  crops are a significant added value (e.g. + 30%) in carbon dioxide sequestration relative to the cultivation of main crops (in particular cereal plants, which are dominant in the crop structure in Poland, a s well as oilseed and legume pl ants) – table 4. A s a matter of fact, catch crops are primarily grown as an in -between crop between cereals cultivated as the main crop. Thus, they are an important factor in CO 2 sequestration by agriculture. The lower percen tage of the catch crops in tota l CO 2 sequestratio n relative to the root crops (e.g. 7.6%) is due to both the high primary yield of the root crops (roots) and the high biomass yield of leaves sorbing CO 2. In turn, a comparison of CO 2 sequestration by catch crops with carbon dioxide sorpt ion by meadow plan ts is purely theoretical (because catch crops are not grown as an in -between crop for meadow plants).

Organic carbon content in soil depending on catch crop biomass  Over the three -year study p eriod (2016 -2018) , the organic carbon content in soil under control treatment (without catch crops) was determined compared to treatments where some catch crop species were additionally grown. The results contained in table 5 demons trate that regardless of  catch crop speci es, ploughing in of catch crop biomass resulted in a significantly higher carbon content in the soil. But the differences in soil organic C content between the individual catch crop species were statistically insign ificant. Nonetheless, th e following trend  C.A. KWIATKOWSKI et al.       INT J CONSERV SCI 1 1, 4, 2020: 1005 -1018 1012 was found - a particularly high carbon content in the soil in the case of biomass of white mustard and mixed spring vetch and field pea.   Table 5 .

The organic C content in the soil was rather stable throughout the study peri od (it was statistically  insignificant be tween years). The coefficients of variation (CV) were low (ranging 3.0 – 5.4% in the plots with the catch cro ps and 7.3% in the control plots). A strict correlation was confirmed between the ploughed -in catch crop b iomass (incorporated int o the soil) and s oil organic carbon content. Particularly high (statistically significant) coefficients of correlation (r) were found in the following cases: white mustard, tansy phacelia, winter rye, and spring vetch + field pea mi xture and oats + spring vetch + field pea  mixture. This shows the particular suitability of these species as catch crops because they are characterize d by large biomass production and high CO 2 sequestration (Table 3.) as well as they contribute to a high o rganic C content in the soil (Table 5).   Discussion   In agriculture, when plants produce yield, they reduce carbon dioxide. This means that a global i ncrease in yields, amon g others through c atch crops by skillfully using agronomic practices, will promote reduction in CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere [22 -24]. As shown by the results of the present study, successfully grown catch crops (e.g. white musta rd, phacelia, spring ve tch + pea, rye) ar e able to fix substantial amounts of carbon (even up to 6 t CO 2                ha-1·yr-1), and this carbon is accumulated in soil together with ploughed -in biomass. Organic carbon contained in soils makes a significa nt contribution to the total balance of this element.  In Poland cereals are by far predominant in the crop structure. Therefore, the efficiency of cereals and the scale of CO 2 sequestration by these species is the most objective CAN CATCH CROPS BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION?    http://www.ijcs.r o 1013 “background” for CO 2 seques tration by catch crops. Catch crops a re most frequently  grown in the crop rotation cycle cereal  – catch crop – cerea l.  L. Pawłowski et al . [6] conducted a study on carbon dioxide sequestration by selected cereal crop species in Poland and in China. In Poland, such cereals as rye, wheat, triticale, oats, and barle y, are grown on an area of 7.6 million hectares. These crops  absorb about 23.8 million tonnes (Mt) of C, out of which 9.8 Mt C yr-1 in grain, 9.4 Mt C yr-1 in straw, and 4.7 Mt C yr-1 in roots. In China, these cereals are grown on an area exceeding 24 million ha and absorb 98.9 Mt C yr-1, out of which 55 Mt C yr-1 in grain,  36Mt C yr-1 in straw, and 7.9 Mt C yr-1 in roots. These data indicate that a wider application of agro-engineering techniques for carbon dioxide sequestration would facilitate the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions [6]. The present study is t he confirma tion of the above presented findings. Cereal crops (especially maize, wheat, triticale, rye, barley, and oats) absorb from about 11 to 20 t CO 2 ha-1·yr-1. Successful catch crops, in turn, absorb from about 4.1 to nearly 7.0t CO 2 ha-1·yr-1. The obtained resu lts show that catch crops are an important factor in CO 2 sequestration. It is worth stressing that catch crops have a shorter growing season than the main crop plants. In spite of that, their biomass yield and the scale of CO 2 sequestration ar e high. This is confirmed by the results of other studies [25, 26] . A drawback of catch crops (particularly Fabaceae/Leguminosae species) is their vulnerability to rainfall deficit and drought [14, 18]. Under such conditions, their productivity and related  CO 2 sequestr ation can be much lower than those presented in the results of this study.  There is a paucity of scientific studies on CO 2 sequestration by catch crops. Promotion of such crops would allow for an even greater contribution of widely understood agriculture t o CO 2 sequestration. Studies of other authors [1, 4] demonstrate how important agricultural ecosystems are in CO 2 sequestration. The observed increase of CO 2 absorption by terrestrial ecosystems is caused by the fertilizing effect of the risin g atmospheric  concentration of CO 2 on the plant growth as well as the fertilizing effect of nitrogen compounds, mostly nitrogen oxides emitted from industrial plants. Globally, plants absorb approximately 123 Gt C yr-1 in the photosynthesis process and at the same time emit 118.7 Gt C yr-1 in the respiration and biomass decomposition processes [27]. The CO 2 sequestration of agricultural crops amounts ca. 103 million t CO 2 yr-1. If combined with forests, the sum will total 187.5 million t CO 2 yr-1, which roughly correspond s to 59% of the emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. In other words, 59% of the CO 2 emissions from these two sources are absorbed by the agricultural crops and forests [4].  In the present study, catch crops were grown  and their cut biomass was incorporated into the soil (ploughed in). In this way, carbon dioxide absorbed by the catch crop biomass entered the soil together with the biomass. Nonetheless, the so -called “soil CO 2 bank” is not stable and the scale of carbon  retained in th e soil depends on many factors. Carbon constitutes approximately 43% of the biomass in the above -ground parts of plants. This carbon can be retained in a soil ecosystem over a longer time, provided that the biomass is used as green manure. T he amount of ca rbon that remains in soil permanently, and will not be released into the atmosphere in the form of CO 2, depends mainly on soil and climate conditions, such as porosity, humidity, temperature, etc.; these factors are also decisive in terms of  what part of t he root biomass remaining in the soil will be transformed into humic compounds [28 -30]. This study proves that catch cropping contributes to a significantly higher amount of carbon in the soil compared to control plots (without catch crops).  C. Poeplau and  A. Don [31] also found a significantly higher carbon content in soils where catch crops were grown compared to soils without catch crops Due to their beneficial effects on the environment, catch crops have now become an instrument for devel oping e nvironme ntally friendly agriculture [10, 12, 32]. Productivity of catch crops largely depends on weather conditions and hence it is advisable to determine which species are best adapted to a specific region of the country [13, 18, 33 -35]. The presen t study  shows t hat white mustard, tansy phacelia, serradella, oats + spring vetch + field pea mixture, and winter rye are the least unreliable species that are adjusted to C.A. KWIATKOWSKI et al.       INT J CONSERV SCI 1 1, 4, 2020: 1005 -1018 1014 Poland’s climate and soil conditions. Temperature is closely related to soil CO 2 content. A t higher  temperatures, organic matter is mineralized more quickly in the soil, which in turn leads to increased soil CO 2 emissions [30]. In the opinion of some authors [36 -39], increasing the retention of carbon in the biomass in soil will be possib le thro ugh the intensification of the biomass production and slowing the rate of soil organic matter mineralization, for instance through the application of thick vegetation cover, mulching and no tillage practices.  Enhancement of carbon sequestration cons titutes  one of the main tasks of regenerative (sustainable) agriculture, also known as agroecological farming. The aim of regenerative farming systems is to increase the soil quality and biodiversity in farmland while ensuring the profitable production. It  encomp asses a range of techniques, i.e. non -tillage, avoidance of leaving soil uncovered, integrating livestock and cropping operations on the land. These actions aim at reconstructing and maintaining soil fertility as well as sequestering of carbon [40 -42}. An IPCC rep ort [43] estimates that the amount of carbon in organic compounds found in soil is 1580 Gt. R. Lal [44] provides similar figures: 1550 Gt of organic carbon and 950 Gt of inorganic carbon.   Conclusions   As a result of mineralization of organi c matter u nder aer obic conditions, carbon is oxidized and CO 2 is formed, which can be emitted into the atmosphere. Efforts should be made to ensure that organic matter accumulation processes predominate over mineralization processes.  The following directi ons for ac tion in this area can be distinguished:  - To prevent erosion processes (by maintaining plant cover on fields as long as possible, among others through catch crops, and preventing mineralization processes);  - To increase soil organic carbon resour ces by usi ng natur al fertilizers, including green ones (growing catch crops whose biomass affects the organic carbon content in soils);  - To increase yields and the carbon content in yields.  Moreover, future research in this area should be expanded to incl ude the fo llowing aspects:  - To determine the optimal type of catch crops and catch crop species from the point of view of soil CO 2 sequestration timeframe;  - CO 2 accumulated in soil by ploughing under catch crop biomass is a ‘soil CO 2 bank’. This allows , among ot hers, me thane fermentation processes and biogas production specifics to be investigated. As a result of the above processes, secondary fertilizer is created, the so -called bioferment, which can be used in agriculture.  The results of the present s tudy show that the  cultivation of catch crops in the following crop rotation: cereal – catch crop – cereal, allows about 30% higher CO 2 sequestration per year to be achieved compared to the cultivation of cereals without catch crops.  The results of the pre sent study  entitle  us to suggest several catch cropping options in order to promote primary and secondary yield, carbon content in yield and in the soil as well as CO 2 sequestration.  Taking into account the above presented aspects of cultivation, yield, an d CO 2 fixation by catch crops, it is proposed to include in further research catch crop species characterized by the highest biomass production (which is equivalent to the highest carbon dioxide sequestration) and to investigate the extent of CO 2 sequestra tion over the enti re crop rotation cycle (main crops + a catch crop grown in a particular year /growing season in a field). The following catch crops are proposed to be studied over crop rotation cycles:  1. stubble crop (white mustard – a seeding rate of 20 kg·ha-1) in the fo llowing crop rotation cycle: winter wheat – white mustard – spring barley;  2. stubble crop (lacy phacelia – a seeding rate of 10 kg·ha-1) in the following crop rotation cycle: winter triticale – tansy phacelia – oats;  CAN CATCH CROPS BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION?    http://www.ijcs.r o 1015 3. winter catch cro p (winte r rye – a seeding rate of 140 kg·ha-1) in the following crop rotation cycle: winter wheat – winter rye – maize.
