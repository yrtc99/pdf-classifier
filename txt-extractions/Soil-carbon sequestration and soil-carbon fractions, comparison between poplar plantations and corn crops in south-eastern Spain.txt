IntroductionSoil  organic  matter  can  be  deﬁned  as  the  complex  mixture  ofdifferent  compounds  coming  from  the  plants  and  soil  microorgan-isms  (Stevenson,  1994 ).  Humiﬁcation  processes  produce  meta-stable  compounds  that  can  remain  in  superﬁcial  systems  for  longperiods.  These  processes  are  complex  and  currently  no  techniquesare  currently  available  to  accurately  describe  the  continuum  of  soilorganic  matter  (Paul  et  al.,  2006 ).Soils  play  a  central  role  in  the  global  carbon  cycle  and  constitutea  large  carbon  reservoir  (Quideau  et  al.,  1998;  Lorenz  et  al.,  2006 )3.3-fold  larger  than  the  atmospheric-carbon  pool  and  4.5-fold  thebiotic  pool  (Lal,  2004a ).  This  has  stirred  interest  in  ﬁnding  methodsto  mitigate  greenhouse-gas  emissions,  and  soils  have  beensuggested  as  a  potential  sink  for  atmospheric  carbon  (Feller  andBernoux,  2008;  Maia  et  al.,  2008;  Mondini  and  Sequi,  2008 ).The  duration  of  sequestration  can  be  separated  into  twocomponents:  ﬂow  duration  and  stock  duration.  Flow  durationrepresents  the  time  period  of  active  sequestration,  or  the  time  inwhich  annual  changes  in  soil  organic  carbon  occur.  Stock  durationrepresents  the  time  period  following  active  sequestration,  and  canbe  deﬁned  as  the  period  of  passive  sequestration,  or  the  time  inwhich  organic  carbon  remains  sequestered  (West  and  Six,  2007 ).  Inthis  way,  it  is  necessary  to  develop  agricultural  and  forestrytechniques  as  well  as  soil-management  practices  oriented  toencourage  the  long-term  duration  of  carbon  stock  in  the  soil(Macı´as  et  al.,  2004 ).The  main  mineralization  process  of  soil  organic  matter  is  theoxidation  by  abiotic  mechanisms  or  biocatalysed  by  metabolicprocesses.  Therefore,  the  ﬁrst  methods  used  to  analyze  soil  organicmatter  were  based  on  oxidative  pathways,  such  as  the  potassium-dichromate  method  (Walkley  and  Black,  1934 ),  and  otheroxidability  sequences  as  methods  using  potassium-permanganate(Tirol-Padre  and  Ladha,  2004 ).  The  study  of  soil  organic-matterstability  is  crucial  because  the  oxidation  processes  trigger  thechange  from  organic  to  inorganic  forms,  implying  the  emission  ofCO2to  the  atmosphere,  which  was  deﬁned  by  Lundergard  (1927)as  ‘‘soil  respiration’’.Now,  the  global  emission  of  CO2from  soils  is  recognized  as  oneof  the  largest  contributors  to  global  carbon  ﬂuxes,  and  smallchanges  in  the  magnitude  of  soil  respiration  could  havemomentous  effects  on  the  CO2concentration  in  the  atmosphere(Schlesinger  and  Andrews,  2000 ).  Deforestation  and  conversion  ofnatural  ecosystems  to  an  agricultural  one  constitute  majorsources  of  the  increasing  atmospheric  CO2concentration  (Lal,2004b ).  When  soils  are  disturbed  through  cultivation,  their  soilorganic-matter  content  declines  because  of  the  change  in  thedecomposition  conditions––soil  aeration,  destruction  of  soilaggregates,  and  moisture  content––leading  to  greater  rates  ofsoil  respiration.  Improved  management  and  alternative  land  usefor  agricultural  soils  could  potentially  bolster  the  role  of  soils  as  aCO2sink.Soil  &  Tillage  Research  130  (2013)  1–6A  R  T  I  C  L  E  I  N  F  OArticle  history:Received  3  July  2012Received  in  revised  form  18  December  2012Accepted  27  January  2013Keywords:Poplar  plantationOrganic-carbon  fractionsSoil-carbon  sequestrationA  B  S  T  R  A  C  TThe  potential  of  soils  as  a  sink  of  atmospheric  carbon  and  the  implications  related  to  mitigategreenhouse-gas  emissions  are  well  recognized.  The  raising  of  tree  crops  on  agricultural  soils  canaugment  soil-carbon  sequestration  more  than  do  other  agricultural  uses  such  as  corn  crops.  Thus,  6  plotswith  different  durations  of  use  as  poplar  plantation  (5,  10,  20,  30,  50,  and  100  years)  were  studied  incomparison  with  6  adjacent  plots  with  corn  crop.  The  carbon  pool  in  poplar-plantation  soils  waspositively  correlated  to  the  time  of  use  at  the  three  soil  depths  studied  (0–20,  20–50,  and  50–100  cm),  themean  annual  increase  being  1.16  Mg  C  ha/C01year/C01.  Poplar-plantation  soils  also  increased  the  totalcarbon  content  in  a  more  effective  way  because  the  duration  of  use  was  also  correlated  with  the  mostrecalcitrant  carbon  forms.  Therefore,  land-use  change  from  corn  crops  to  poplar-plantation  soils  iseconomically  proﬁtable  as  well  as  positive  both  for  the  total  organic-carbon  pool  as  well  as  for  theefﬁciency  of  carbon  sequestration  by  the  increase  of  non-oxidizable  forms  in  the  soil./C223  2013  Elsevier  B.V.

Affores-tation  of  agricultural  soils  can  help  comply  with  the  Kyoto  protocol(Article  3.3)  by  increasing  carbon  sequestration.  There  is  mountinginterest  in  planting  tree  crops  on  agricultural  land  as  an  energyfeed-stock.  Energy  crops  are  a  carbon-neutral  energy  source  for  theportion  of  biomass  harvested;  however,  there  may  be  an  additionalcarbon  sequestration  belowground  that  could  help  ameliorateincreases  in  atmospheric  CO2concentration  (Hansen,  1993 ).Carbon  sequestration  resulting  from  incremental  forest  manage-ment,  afforestation,  and  reforestation  are  eligible  for  receivingcarbon  credits  from  the  Kyoto  protocol  (UNFCC,  1998 ).  Organic-carbon  sequestration  in  poplar-plantation  plots  is  high,  reducingCO2in  the  atmosphere  and  thereby  lowering  the  use  of  fossil  fuels,and  adds  an  appreciable  amount  of  C  to  the  soil,  helping  to  mitigateclimate  change  (Deckmyn  et  al.,  2004;  Teklay  and  Chang,  2008 ).Hansen  (1991)  reported  that  soils  in  poplar  plantations  in  thenorth-central  United  States  sequestered  24  Mg  C  ha/C01more  thanadjacent  soils  under  corn  crops  after  an  average  of  15  years.The  present  work  studies  the  differences  between  the  amountsof  organic  carbon  ﬁxed  in  the  soils  of  the  alluvial  plain  of  Granada(Spain)  under  poplar  plantations  in  comparison  with  soils  undercorn  crops.  The  aim  is  to  establish  the  differences  in  the  amountand  stability  of  the  soil  carbon  as  a  mechanism  to  assess  theefﬁciency  in  carbon  sequestration  by  these  soils.2.  Materials  and  methodsThe  study  area  is  located  in  the  alluvial  plain  of  Granada  (Spain),in  the  municipality  of  Santa  Fe  (30S  435860-4117155).  This  areacontains  fertile  soils  under  irrigated  conditions,  and  is  located  inthe  geological  basin  of  Granada,  which  is  surrounded  byunirrigated  lands.  This  is  a  post-orogenic  basin  closed  on  all  sidesexcept  for  the  west  and  formed  by  an  alluvial  plain  crossed  fromeast  to  west  by  the  Genil  river,  one  of  the  main  tributaries  of  theGuadalquivir  river.  The  climate  is  typically  Mediterranean,characterized  by  mean  annual  precipitation  of  385  mm,  occurringmainly  during  autumn  and  winter,  with  the  summer  being  notablydry.  Mean  monthly  temperatures  ranges  from  5  8C  in  winter  and23  8C  in  summer,  with  a  mean  annual  value  of  13  8C.The  soil  type  in  all  cases  was  haplic  Regosol  (calcaric)  (ISSS-ISRIC-FAO,  2006 )  with  slight  variation  in  soil  properties  andconstituents.  The  soils  have  ﬁne  textures  that  progressivelybecome  coarser  with  proximity  to  the  river,  but  withoutstatistically  signiﬁcant  differences  in  depth  either  in  soil  fractionsor  in  mineralogy.  The  proximity  to  the  river  also  determines  thedepth  of  a  phreatic  layer,  producing  the  presence  of  grey  andreddish-brown  colours  heterogeneously  distributed  in  the  soilproﬁle  related  to  the  hydromorphic  conditions  [endogleyic  Regosol(calcaric)  and  Gleyic  Fluvisol  (calcaric);  Aguilar  et  al.,  2006 ].In  general,  the  soils  in  the  study  area  are  deep  with  a  highwater-holding  capacity  (>100  mm),  high  cation-exchange  capaci-ty  (>15  cmol (+)kg/C01)  and  the  exchangeable  complex  saturated  inbasic  cations.  The  pH  is  slightly  alkaline  (pH  =  8)  and  the  CaCO 3content  is  high  (40%)  throughout  the  soil  proﬁle  (Simo´n  et  al.,1997 ).  The  organic-carbon  content  in  the  surface  horizon  variesdepending  of  the  soil  use,  being  below  2.5%  in  poplar  plantationsand  below  2.0%  in  corn  crops,  registering  mean  values  of  C:N  ratioof  13  and  12,  respectively.  In  general,  they  are  usually  described  asfertile  soils.Soils  in  6  poplar-plantation  plots  in  the  alluvial  plain  of  theGenil  river  were  studied.  The  soil  type  and  topography  were  veryhomogeneous  in  all  the  study  plots,  and  poplar  was  P.  xeuramericana  NNDV  clone  in  all  cases.  Due  to  the  intenseagricultural  activity  in  the  area,  there  were  no  natural  soils  nextto  the  poplar  plantations  and,  therefore,  corn  crops  plots  adjacentto  each  poplar  plot  were  used  for  comparison  purposes.  The  poplarplots  sampled  had  a  minimum  surface  area  of  100  /C2  100  m,  and  aminimum  plantation  age  of  5  years.  In  each  of  the  6  plots  withdifferent  ages  of  poplar  plantation  (5,  10,  20,  30,  50,  and  100  years)and  in  the  6  adjacent  plots  with  corn  crop,  4  replicates  of  soilsamples  were  taken  after  division  of  the  plots  in  four  similar  parts(sub-plots)  and  taking  one  composite  sample  in  the  centre  of  eachsub-plot.  Each  sample  was  obtained  by  the  mixture  andhomogenization  of  four  sub-samples  taken  from  the  corners  of  a4  /C2  4  m  square,  coinciding  with  the  lanes  of  the  plantation,  andhaving  one  tree  in  the  centre.  Before  the  soil  sampling  the  litterlayer  on  the  surface  were  removed,  and  a  pit  50  cm  wide  and100  cm  deep  was  dug  to  take  samples  at  three  depths  (0–20,  20–50,and  50–100  cm).The  soil  management  for  the  poplar  plantation  included  soilconditioning  for  planting  that  consisted  of  crossed  subsoilingfollowed  by  a  pass  with  a  cultivator,  after  which  the  cuttings  wereplanted  on  4  /C2  4  m  centres.  For  the  ﬁrst  two  or  three  years,  theweeds  were  eliminated  by  passes  with  the  cultivator.  No  type  ofsoil  fertilization  was  applied  and  irrigation  was  by  ﬂood.  Every  10–12  years,  the  trees  were  cut  down  and  the  process  began  again.Corn  crop  soils  were  tilled  in  autumn,  followed  by  several  passeswith  a  cultivator  to  control  weeds.  After  planting,  a  roller  harrowwas  used  for  surface  compaction  to  encourage  germination  and  forthe  levelling  of  the  land  for  even  irrigation.Bulk  samples  of  mineral  soil  taken  at  each  depth  level,  werethoroughly  homogenized,  air  dried  at  room  temperature  andpassed  through  a  2-mm  sieve.  For  chemical  analysis,  an  aliquot  ofthe  soil  was  ground  in  a  ball  mill.  Total  carbon  (CT)  and  nitrogen(NT)  were  analyzed  by  a  LECO1TruSpec  CNHS.  The  carbonatecontent,  as  the  main  inorganic-carbon  source,  was  determined  bygas  volumetry  following  the  method  of  Barahona  et  al.  (1984) .Organic  carbon  was  estimated  by  the  difference  between  totalcarbon  and  the  inorganic  carbon  estimated  from  the  soil-carbonatecontent.  Soil  bulk  density  was  determined  by  a  gravimetric  methodin  which  a  known  volume  of  undisturbed  soil  sample  was  driedand  weighed.  Soil  bulk  density  allows  the  calculation  of  the  totalorganic-carbon  pool  in  soils  with  poplar  plantations  and  corncrops.  Carbon  fractionation  values  were  derived  by  oxidation  with33  mM  KMnO 4(Tirol-Padre  and  Ladha,  2004 )  and  333  mM  KMnO 4(Blair  et  al.,  1995 )  and  by  wet  oxidation  adding  10  ml  K2Cr2O70.4Nto  0.15–0.8  g  of  soil  sample  and  blank  sample  and  titring  the  excessof  K2Cr2O7with  FeSO 4/C157H2O  0.1N,  according  to  the  method  ofWalkley  and  Black  (1934)  and  modiﬁed  by  Tyurin  (1951) .  For  thedetermination  of  the  fractions  oxidizable  with  KMnO 4,  soilsamples  containing  15  mg  C,  calculated  from  the  known  total  Ccontent,  were  weighed  into  30-ml  plastic  screw-top  centrifugetubes  and  25  ml  of  33  or  333  mM  KMnO 4were  added  to  each  vial.Soil  and  blank  samples  were  shaken  for  1  h  and  centrifuged  for5  min  at  2000  rpm  and  the  supernatant  was  diluted  1:250  withdeionized  water.  Standards  were  prepared  by  adding  0.6,  1.0,  1.4,1.8,  and  2.0  ml  of  33  and  333  mM  KMnO 4,  respectively.  Theabsorbance  of  the  diluted  samples  and  standards  were  read  on  aspectrophotometer  at  565  nm.Carbon  oxidized  by  33  mM  KMnO 4was  termed  very  easilyoxidizable  carbon  (CVEO);  the  difference  between  carbon  oxidizedby  333  mM  and  33  mM  KMnO 4was  termed  easily  oxidizablecarbon  (CEO);  the  difference  between  carbon  oxidized  by  K2Cr2O7and  333  mM  KMnO 4was  termed  oxidizable  carbon  (CO);  and  thedifference  between  total  carbon  and  carbon  oxidized  by  K2Cr2O7was  termed  non-oxidizable  carbon  (CNO).Differences  of  soil  organic-carbon  fractions,  total  organiccarbon,  and  bulk  density  in  soil  depth  and  between  different  agesof  poplar  plantation  were  tested  by  one-way  analysis  of  variance(ANOVA)  and  Tukey’s  test  (p  <  0.05).  The  variables  were  tested  toM.  Sierra  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  130  (2013)  1–6 2the  normalized  Shapiro–Wilk  normality  test  and  to  Bartlett’shomogeneity  test  of  variance.  Spearman  correlation  coefﬁcientwas  used  to  analyze  the  relations  between  variables.  Statisticalanalyses  were  made  using  a  Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences(SPSS1for  Windows/C223,  Ver.  15.0.1,  Chicago,  IL).3.  Results  and  discussionThe  selected  soils  showed  slight  variation  in  the  mainproperties  and  constituents  (Table  1).  Texture  varied  somewhatbetween  plots,  this  parameter  being  considered  important  in  thephysical  protection  of  the  organic-matter  compounds,  promotinghigher  and  more  effective  retention  of  organic  carbon  in  soils(Lu¨tzow  et  al.,  2006 ).  The  correlation  analysis  between  the  totalorganic  carbon  and  the  different  textural  fractions  according  totheir  oxidizability  in  the  soils  had  positive  relationships  with  theﬁne  fractions  and  negative  with  the  coarse,  although  thecorrelations  were  not  signiﬁcant  in  any  case  (p  >  0.05).  Thisabsence  of  signiﬁcant  correlation  between  texture  and  organiccarbon,  and  the  homogeneity  of  other  parameters  (e.g.  pH  andcalcium  carbonate)  allowed  a  meaningful  comparison  betweenplots.The  mean  organic-carbon  content  in  the  poplar-plantation  soilswas  higher  than  in  the  corn  crops  (Table  2).  It  is  well  known  thatthe  soil  organic  matter  declines  in  soils  under  agricultureconditions,  depending  on  the  type  of  crop  and  soil  management.In  the  comparison  between  the  poplar  plantation  and  corn  crops,this  difference  was  signiﬁcant  (p  =  0.014)  only  in  the  surfacesamples  (0–20  cm)  but  not  in  the  deeper  soil  samples.  This  data  isalso  supported  by  the  positive  signiﬁcant  correlation  (p  <  0.05)between  the  soil  organic-carbon  content  and  the  age  of  the  poplarplantation.  This  correlation  was  statistically  signiﬁcant  at  the  threedepths  studied,  although  between  0–20  cm  and  20–50  cm,  theincrease  (slope)  was  2.5-fold  higher  than  in  samples  at  50–100  cmdepth  (Fig.  1).Soil  bulk  density  increases  in  samples  according  to  the  soildepth,  although  this  increment  was  more  pronounced  in  the  corncrop  soils  than  in  the  poplar-plantation  soils.  This  difference  maybe  related  to  the  different  soil  management,  because  in  the  corncrops  the  continued  tilling  increased  porosity  in  the  surface  layerbut  compaction  in  the  subsurface  samples.

Sierra  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  130  (2013)  1–6  3there  were  no  signiﬁcant  differences  in  the  soil  bulk  densityaccording  to  the  soil  use  and  plantation  age.  Because  of  thisvariation  in  soil  bulk  density,  the  ﬁeld-measured  bulk  densitieswere  used  to  calculate  the  organic-carbon  pool  for  both  soil  useconsidered  and  soil  depth,  by  site.  To  normalize  the  organic-carbonpool  for  each  level  to  a  uniform  soil  volume,  the  organic-carbon-pool  data  are  shown  as  organic-carbon  mass  per  30  cm  soilthickness  and  hectare  (Table  2).  The  trend  of  the  organic-carbon-pool  data  was  similar  to  the  CTpercentage,  with  statisticallysigniﬁcant  differences  (p  =  0.015)  in  the  surface  samples  (0–20  cm)but  not  in  deeper  samples  (>20  cm).The  carbon  pool  positively  and  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  theage  of  the  crop  in  the  poplar-plantation  soils  at  all  the  depthssampled  (Fig.  2).  The  comparison  of  the  trend  between  the  organic-carbon  pool  and  the  organic-carbon  content  in  depth  with  respectto  the  age  of  the  plantation  (Figs.  1  and  2)  shows  a  similar  patternat  the  three  levels  sampled,  although  the  carbon  pool  in  theuppermost  50  cm  of  the  soil  increased  1.9-fold  quicker  than  at  theshallowest  depth.Considering  the  organic-carbon  pool  and  the  age  of  the  poplarplantation  at  the  three  depths  sampled  and  compared  with  thecorn  crops  (Table  3),  there  were  statistically  signiﬁcant  differencesin  the  surface  samples  from  30  years  of  use  in  poplar-plantationsoils.  Between  20  and  50  cm  depth  the  differences  were  statisti-cally  signiﬁcant  in  relation  to  the  corn  crops  from  50  years  on,while  at  50–100  cm  these  differences  were  signiﬁcant  from  100years  on.  The  different  capacity  of  organic-carbon  sequestrationaccording  to  the  soil  use  and  management  is  highlighted  mainly  inthe  uppermost  part  of  the  soils  (Tolbert  et  al.,  2000;  Castro  et  al.,2008 ),  in  agreement  with  our  results.  On  the  other  hand,  theANOVA  showed  that  at  the  soil  surface  of  the  poplar-plantationsoils,  the  organic-carbon  pool  was  consistently  higher  than  in  thecorn  crops.  This  may  be  due  to  the  intense  mineralizationprocesses  of  the  organic  matter  in  the  agricultural  soils  undertraditional  tilling  (Lal,  2004a ),  the  lack  of  shading  by  the  vegetationcanopy  for  several  months  of  the  year  and  the  usual  lack  of  surfacemulch,  which  tended  to  increase  soil  temperatures  compared  toplantations  and  thus  to  augment  carbon  oxidation  (Grigal  andBerguson,  1998 ).  In  turn,  poplar-plantation  soils  had  a  higher  inputof  organic  carbon  via  leaf  litter,  which  forms  an  inherent  part  of  thenutrient  cycle,  contributing  a  major  source  of  soil  organic  carbon(Sayer,  2006 );  this  litter  also  acts  as  mulch,  cooling  soil  surface  andreducing  soil  organic  oxidation.  Also,  at  >20  cm  depth  the  carbonpool  in  the  poplar  soils  was  higher  than  in  the  corn  crops  after  20years  of  use.  Belowground,  roots  are  a  major  source  of  soil  carbon(Rasse  et  al.,  2005 )  and  they  are  protected  by  cooler  temperaturesand  less  aeration.  The  higher  organic  content  reached  by  poplar-plantation  soils  at  deeper  levels  could  be  due  to  the  low  root:shootratio  of  maize  plants  which  results  in  a  lower  root  carbon  input,reducing  soil  organic-carbon  content  (Richter  et  al.,  1990 ).Therefore,  the  organic-carbon  sequestration  capacity  of  thepoplar-plantation  soils  was  higher  than  the  corn  crop  soils,  notonly  over  the  short  term  but  also  over  the  long  term,  increasing  thecarbon  content  even  at  the  deepest  levels.  Taking  into  account  thedifferences  of  the  organic-carbon  pool  in  all  the  soil  proﬁle  (1  mdepth)  between  the  poplar-plantation  and  corn  crop  soils  inrelation  to  the  age,  and  considering  the  content  in  corn  crops  asconstant  over  time,  we  calculated  the  rate  of  mean  increase  in  theorganic-carbon  pool  to  be  1.16  Mg  C  ha/C01year/C01(Fig.  3).  The  rateof  soil-carbon  accumulation  calculated  was  well  within  thatmeasured  by  Garten  (2002)  but  below  rates  reported  by  Hansen(1993) ,  Blanco-Canqui  (2009) ,  and  Gupta  et  al.  (2009) ,  and  aboverates  predicted  by  Garten  et  al.  (2010) .  Considering  a  soil-usechange  from  the  corn  crop  to  poplar  plantation,  the  increase  incarbon  sequestration  would  require  a  mean  of  12  years  to  beeffective.y = 0.0123 x + 1.878 3R2 = 0.85 8y = 0.0124 x + 1.189 5R2 = 0.79 4y = 0.0052 x + 0.979 7R2 = 0.84 00,901,201,501,802,102,402,703,003,300 20 40 60 80 10 0age (years)g C Kg-1 0-20  cm 20 -50  cm 50 -100  cmFig.  1.

Sierra  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  130  (2013)  1–6 4The  C:N  ratios  were  comparable  in  poplar  plantation  soils,  andratios  slightly  decreased  with  depth  due  to  progressive  decompo-sition  (Table  2).  The  C:N  ratio  is  often  the  best  predictor  of  thedecomposition  rate  and  indicator  for  the  extent  of  decomposition,but  may  also  be  misinterpreted  as  a  coincidental  factor  relative  togross  biochemical  composition  and  spatial  arrangement  ofconstituents  in  plant  tissues  (Magid  et  al.,  2004;  Jensen  et  al.,2005;  Lorenz  et  al.,  2006 ).Total  soil  organic-carbon  measurements  have  been  widely  usedfor  monitoring  soil  organic  matter.  A  drawback  of  using  the  totalsoil  organic-carbon  measurement  alone  is  that  soil  organic  matterchanges  gradually  and  thus  short-term  variations  in  organiccarbon  may  be  difﬁcult  to  detect  against  a  high  background  level.Chemical  techniques  can  be  used  to  determine  the  partitioninginto  different  pools  with  variable  turnover  times  and  stability(Baldock  et  al.,  2004 ).In  the  present  study,  the  distribution  of  the  different  fractionsseparated  by  the  resistance  to  oxidation  differed  throughout  thesoil  proﬁle  (Fig.  4).  The  ANOVA  analysis  shows  a  transition  indepth  with  the  increase  in  the  non-oxidizable  fraction  (CNO),which  was  statistically  signiﬁcant  from  20  cm  in  depth  (Table  4).This  increase  may  be  related  to  the  higher  recalcitrance  of  theorganic  carbon  coming  from  the  roots,  the  main  source  of  carbonin  depth.  Chemical  recalcitrance  of  plant  litter  is  generallyattributed  to  the  aromatic  compounds  in  the  lignin,  becausemicrobial  decomposition  of  these  structures  requires  strongoxidation  agents  and  only  a  limited  number  of  soil  microorgan-isms  are  able  to  completely  mineralize  lignin  (Hammel,  1997 ).Lignin  and  other  recalcitrant  compounds  such  as  tannins  (Krauset  al.,  2003 ),  cutins  and  suberins  (Tegelaar  et  al.,  1989 )  show  ahigher  content  in  roots  than  in  shoots,  reaching  on  average  morethan  double  in  some  species  (Goering  and  Van  Soest,  1970 ).  Inaddition,  the  oxidizable  fractions  were  higher  in  the  uppermost20  cm  of  the  soils  and  signiﬁcantly  decreased  with  depth.  Thesurface  level  (0–20  cm)  signiﬁcantly  differed  with  respect  to  thedeeper  levels  in  relation  to  the  organic-carbon  fractionation,  withthe  exception  of  the  easily  oxidizable  fraction  (CEO),  which  washomogeneously  distributed  in  the  soil  proﬁle.  This  higherpresence  of  the  easily  oxidizable  fractions  in  the  uppermost  partof  the  soil  should  be  related  to  the  input  of  organic  carbon  comingfrom  the  litterfall,  and,  according  to  Gleixner  et  al.  (2001)  shoottissues  could  decompose  as  fast  as  root  tissue  in  soils  but  theirtransformation  products  would  have  shorter  residence  time  insoils  due  to  different  chemical  recalcitrance.y = 1.1626 x - 11 .81 4R2 = 0.98 7-200204060801000 20 40 60 80 10 0age (years)Poplarplantation pool C-Corn crop      pool C (Mgha-1)          Fig.  3.

Sierra  et  al.  /  Soil  &  Tillage  Research  130  (2013)  1–6  5According  to  the  age  of  the  soil  used  for  the  poplar  plantation,there  was  a  signiﬁcant  increase  (p  <  0.05)  in  the  relative  %CNOfraction,  while  on  the  contrary,  the  relative  percentage  of  theoxidizable  fractions  (CO;  CEO;  CVEO)  signiﬁcantly  decreased(p  <  0.05)  in  concentration.  There  were  marked  differencesbetween  poplar  plantations  and  corn  crops  in  terms  of  the  soil-carbon  turnover  times.  The  CNOwas  consistently  lower  at  threedepth  levels  in  corn-crop  soil  than  in  poplar-plantation  soil.Therefore,  land  use  signiﬁcantly  affected  both  the  total  organic-carbon  pool  and  chemically  separated  organic-carbon  fractions.The  results  in  the  poplar-plantation  soils  of  the  area  suggestthat  there  is  high  efﬁciency  in  the  organic-carbon  sequestrationcapacity  over  time  both  quantitatively,  by  the  increase  of  theorganic-carbon  pool  throughout  the  soil  proﬁle,  as  well  asqualitatively,  by  the  increase  of  more  non-oxidizable  forms  ofcarbon.4.  ConclusionThe  carbon  pool  in  poplar-plantation  soils  increased  over  timewith  a  mean  annual  value  of  1.6  Mg  C  ha/C01year/C01,  this  increasebeing  statistically  signiﬁcant  in  the  surface  samples  (<20  cm)  after30  years  of  cultivation.  The  different  organic-carbon  fractions,separated  by  the  differences  in  resistance  to  oxidation,  indicate  asigniﬁcant  increase  in  the  non-oxidizable  forms  over  time  inrelation  to  corn  crops.  Therefore,  a  land-use  change  from  corn  topoplars  is  economically  proﬁtable  as  well  as  positive  both  for  thetotal  organic-carbon  pool  as  well  as  for  the  efﬁciency  of  carbonsequestration  by  the  increase  of  non-oxidizable  forms  in  the  soil.ReferencesAguilar,  J.,  Martı ´n,  F.,  Dı´ez,  M.,  Sierra,  M.,  Ferna ´ndez,  J.,  Ortega,  E.,  Oyonarte,  C.,  2006.Mapa  Digital  de  Suelos  Provincia  de  Granada.
