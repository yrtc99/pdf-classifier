However,soil has the largest store of terrestrial carbon (C), a considerable sink and effective strategy for climatechange mitigation if managed properly. Cover crops (CC) and no-till (NT) management are twomanagement strategies that are known to increase percent organic carbon (%OC); however, adoptionof these practices has been low in the mid-South due to lack of region-speciÔ¨Åc research and resistanceto unproven practices. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of CC-NTtreatments in soybean cropping systems on soil percent organic carbon (%OC) and CO 2Ô¨Çux followinglong-term implementation. Results showed signiÔ¨Åcantly greater %OC in NT ( 1.27% 0.03) thanreduced till (RT; 1.10% 0.03; p< 0.001) and greater in both CC (rye: 1.23% 0.03,rye + clover :1.22% 0.03) than no cover (1.11% 0.03; p< 0.001). Bacterial abundance ( p= 0.005 ) and pH(p= 0.006 ) were signiÔ¨Åcant predictors of %OC. There was no overall signiÔ¨Åcant difference in CO 2Ô¨Çuxbetween tillage or CC treatments; however, there were signiÔ¨Åcant differences between NT and RTin July of 2020 when %RH increased ( p< 0.001). Bacterial abundance negatively impacted CO 2Ô¨Çux(p< 0.05 ), which contradicts most studies. The rate of proportional change and pattern of variabilityin C pools suggested loss of %OC in RT treatments that were not apparent when considering %OCalone. The results of this study provide valuable insight into C turnover and the effectiveness of CCuse in the Mid-South to increase soil C stocks.Keywords: carbon; no-till; cover crops; soil carbon sequestration; conservation agriculture;carbon measurement1. IntroductionLand use changes from natural landscapes to agriculture and pasture lands accountfor 32% percent of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions globally [ 1]. Conventional agriculturalpractices can deplete historic soil carbon (C) stocks by as much as 60%, largely becauseof poor soil practices that reduce C without an equivalent C input, which ultimatelylead to declines in soil health and productivity as well as increased C emissions into theatmosphere [ 2]. However, soil has the largest store of terrestrial C and the potential to store0.4‚Äì5 Gt C/year, a considerable C sink and effective strategy for climate change mitigationif managed properly [3‚Äì5].To that end, sequestering soil C has gained attention globally with the rise of C trading,which provides producers and landowners a market-based Ô¨Ånancial incentive to minimizeEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109. https://doi.org/10.3390/environments9090109 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/environmentsEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109 2 of 16greenhouse gas emissions [ 6]. With an increased economic value placed on soil organiccarbon, the implementation of agricultural practices that sequester C are critical for climatechange mitigation and the Ô¨Ånancial well-being of the growers who invest in C sequestrationstrategies. Soil greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation is dependent upon storing C in stableform, which is typically achieved by the adsorption of C compounds into mineral soil andlow rates of microbial respiration [ 7]. However, building labile fractions of soil organiccarbon are essential for effective nutrient cycling, soil biological activity and the creation ofsoil aggregates, which are all characteristics that contribute to soil health, but often result inincreased soil respiration [ 8‚Äì10]. Thus, agriculture is dually challenged to promote C Ô¨Çowthrough the soil system for agronomic vitality and prioritize soil C persistence for globalclimate mitigation goals.Cover crops (CC) and no-till (NT) are two conservation management practices thatincrease %OC and provide soil health beneÔ¨Åts by increasing microbial diversity and activ-ity [11], suppressing weeds, preventing erosion, and increasing moisture retention [ 12,13].Under certain circumstances, and when CC are used in combination with no-till (NT) man-agement, C in agriculture Ô¨Åelds can increase by as much as 70% [ 14]. However, differencesin CC species, management practice implementation, and regional climate create difÔ¨Åcultiesin predicting the effect of conservation practices on soil C stocks. For example, Zablotow-icz et al. [ 15], in a study of no-till combined with CC, found this combination of treatmentsto have the greatest accumulation of total organic carbon but Chu et al. [ 16] found thatsoil organic carbon did not signiÔ¨Åcantly differ across treatments and was comparable tobaseline measurements. Additionally, Aldridge et al. [ 17] found that CC could only explain5% of the variation in soil total carbon between treatments.Most studies addressing changes in soil organic carbon following NT and CC manage-ment aim to detect differences between treatment groups, with the intent to determine theeffectiveness of the management practice towards various agronomic goals and ecosystemservices. While this framework is informative when addressing soil health, it is less helpfulif the objective is to sequester C for use in a C trading system. For example, an increasein percent organic carbon (%OC) following CC application is usually accompanied bya simultaneous increase in CO 2emissions [ 18‚Äì20]. Therefore, the observed increases in%OC do not directly translate into C stabilization, but are an indication increased soilhealth. Alternatively, processed-based models, like those used in C trading markets, usesoil characteristics, climate, and management to predict C sequestration potential. Thisapproach requires complex algorithms and many time measurements to place a value ontons of CO 2mitigated from the atmosphere. These modeling approaches are the subjectof much controversy, have considerable uncertainty, and do not illustrate incrementalshifts in soil organic carbon over short time frames [ 21‚Äì23] and thus are impractical forproducers designing an adaptive management plan which must be tailored and adjustedto site-nuisances.These limitations become of particular concern in the mid-South, USA where a lackof research speciÔ¨Åc to regional nuisances has resulted low adoption rates of conservationmanagement, despite National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Ô¨Ånancial assis-tance programs [ 24]. The Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) region of the mid-South ischaracterized by intensive agriculture land use, historically alluvial soils, high rainfall(1375 mm/year) and above freezing winter temperatures (average high 16.1C, low 2.2C),all factors that promote rapid decomposition of plant material and CO 2emissions viamicrobial respiration.If CC and NT management are to be integrated into the mid-South, studies mustdirectly address both differences in soil organic carbon between treatments and providereadily transferable information on changes to C pathways following management imple-mentation. To address these limitations of site-speciÔ¨Åc C assessment, this study proposesa conceptual method whereby, measures of C pool turnover, via rate and proportionalvariability in C pools was assessed using multivariate measures [ 25], indicating whethershifts in C pool composition are directional (i.e., towards %OC accumulation or loss).Environments 2022 ,9, 109 3 of 16We describe site-speciÔ¨Åc changes in C pools relative to each other which can be rapidlyinterpreted and translated into action, either by management that continues to support Caccumulation or by shifting strategies towards those that minimize C emissions.Thus, this study had three purposes towards producer adoption of conservation man-agement: (1) to assess the impacts of CC-NT treatments in soybean cropping systems onsoil %OC and CO 2Flux after several years of implementation, (2) assess the relationship ofbacterial abundance, fungal abundance, soil moisture, soil temperature, cation exchange ca-pacity (CEC), percent relative humidity (%RH) and pH on %OC and CO 2Flux, respectively,and (3) model the directional change of site-speciÔ¨Åc C pools under different management.The results of this research provide valuable insight into soil C cycling and the effectivenessof CC use in the Mid-South to increase soil C stocks.2. Materials and Methods2.1. The Study Site and DesignThe study was conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the USDA-ARS Crop Productions Sys-tems Research Unit farm near Stoneville, Mississippi (MS), USA. In fall 2000, experimentalplots were established under cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) production in a split-blockdesign as described in Locke et al. [ 26]. Within each of four blocks, six treatment plots(n = 24 ) were constructed as 8 m wide and 32 m long (0.026 ha) with 8 1 m wide raised-bedrows in each plot. No-tillage or reduced tillage (NT or RT) was the main effect, with CC(abruzzi rye ( Secale cereale ), balansa clover ( Trifolium michelianum ) or none) as the split effect.Cotton was planted as the cash crop until 2007. Since spring of 2008 to present, AsgrowAG4632 variety soybean ( Glycine max ) was planted as the cash crop. The experimental areawith continuous soybeans did not include a CC from 2008 to 2014, but tillage treatmentsfrom the previous experiment (RT or NT) were maintained. Cover crop treatments wereadded again in 2014 with elbon rye ( Secale cereale ), crimson clover ( Trifolium incarnatum ), orno cover [ 27,28]. In 2017 until present, the following cover crop treatments were established:elbon rye (RY), elbon rye+crimson clover mix (RC) and no cover (NC). Tillage treatmentshave remained the same since plot establishment in 2000. The combinations of treatmentsin the present study were as follows: NTxRY, NTxRC, NTxNC, RTxRY, RTxRC, and RTxNC.In late April of 2019 and 2020 when rye CC reached peak growth, the CC was terminatedwith two applications of Gramoxone SL2.0 (Syngenta, Greensboro, NC, USA) 2 weeks apartat a rate 0.77 kg ha 1and rolled for cash crop planting. Potash was applied to all treatmentplots in January 2020.2.2. Cover Crop Biomass and Decomposition RateBiomass was sampled by selecting 2 random locations within each plot and cuttingall plant residue all vegetation within a 1 m2area. Volunteer vegetation was used for NCplots. The most common volunteer vegetation in NC plots was crimson clover ( Trifoliumincarnatum ) and common purslane ( Portulaca oleracea ). Plant biomass from each locationwas dried at 105C and the dry mass weight was measured. Twenty-four hours after CCtermination, 150 g of CC biomass was cut and placed in litterbags measuring 20.23 cm20.23 cm made from Ô¨Åberglass mesh screen (0.508 mm mesh size) [ 29]. Two litter bagscontaining CC biomass (or volunteer vegetation) from their prospective plots were stapledclosed and then secured on the soil surface (approximately mid-May). There was a total of48 litter bags, two litter bags per plot. Litter bags were collected in September, dried andweighed. The weight of the litterbags from each plot was averaged ( We) and then dividedby the starting weight ( Wi; 150 g) to obtain a decomposition rate. The rate was multipliedby the initial CC biomass ( CCi) to estimate remaining plant residue at the end of the season(CCe) within each plot (Equation 1). The midpoint between the starting and Ô¨Ånal biomasswas used as a proxy for mid-season CC biomass in the directional change model.WiWeCCi=CCe (1)Environments 2022 ,9, 109 4 of 162.3. Soil SamplingTwo soil samples per plot were taken, one from beneath each duplicate litter bag loca-tion with soil cores (3.8‚Äì4 cm diameter 10 cm depth) collected at the date of litterbag imple-mentation (approximately mid-May 2019 and 2020) and once a month through Septemberof each year. Cores from the same plot were consolidated into one composite sample perplot. There were 24 samples per sampling event (5 sampling events, May‚ÄìSeptember ),120 samples per year, for a total of 240 samples over two years (2019 and 2020). The initialsampling event (in May after CC termination) occurred before litter bags were secured tothe soil surface; all subsequently collected samples were taken from the soil directly underthe litterbag by lifting the bag. Samples from each plot were placed in a sterile plastic bagand stored on ice (~4C) for transport back to USDA Genetics and Sustainable AgricultureUnit in Starkville, MS. A portion of each soil sample was separated for soil moisture contentanalysis. Soil moisture was assessed using the gravimetric method: 10 g of Ô¨Åeld-moist soilwas weighed, followed by drying at 104C for 24 h and reweighing. Approximately 5 gof Ô¨Åeld-moist soil was separated and sent to Mississippi State University Soil Testing Labto be analyzed for %OC using an automated dry combustion Vario Max Cube ElementarC/N analyzer (Elementar Americas Inc, Mt. Laurel, NJ). The remaining soil sample wastransferred to a 473 mL (1 pint) container and sent to Pennsylvania State University SoilFertility Lab Soil for analysis of pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC) by the Mehlich3 (ICP) test.2.4. CO 2FluxCarbon dioxide Ô¨Çux was determined for each plot using a LI-COR LI-8100A soil Ô¨Çuxsystem. One PVC collar (20 cm diameter) was installed in the middle of each plot byinserting the collar into the soil leaving approximately 5 cm of the collar above the surface.Collars were leveled at insertion. The collars were established in the center of the plotwithin the planting bed. Four-point collar height measurements were taken from the soilsurface to the top of the collar before each CO 2Ô¨Çux reading to determine the chambervolume. Final CO 2Ô¨Çux was adjusted for moisture, temperature and chamber volumeusing program SoilFluxPro (Version 4.0.1) [ 30‚Äì32]. Measurements were taken once a monthbetween 9:00 AM‚Äì11:00 AM, beginning Ô¨Åve days after planting and continuing throughoutgrowing season (approximately May, June, July, August and September 2019 and 2020).2.5. Bacterial and Fungal AbundanceQuantitative qPCR can be used as an indicator of soil biological properties [ 33]. Totalmicrobial DNA was extracted from soil samples (0.25 g soil) using MP Biomedical FastDNASpin Kits on a FastPrep-24 homogenizer. DNA was quantiÔ¨Åed and subjected to serialdilution(s) (10- to 100-fold) prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to avoidinhibitory co-contaminants. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for 16 S rRNA (16 S) [34‚Äì36]and 18 S rRNA [ 37] were conducted using previously identiÔ¨Åed cycling and reactionconditions. An Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system was used in allqPCR assays. All qPCR assays were conducted in duplicate using ABI PowerSybr PCR Mix(Applied Biosystems), ampliÔ¨Åcation signals were quantiÔ¨Åed with a PCR-based standardcurve and conÔ¨Årmed using melt-curve analysis; controls included negative-template andinhibition controls. Samples were only recorded as positive when both duplicates exhibitedampliÔ¨Åcation and melt-curve signal. Quantitative PCR results were corrected for soilmoisture and reported as genomic units per g (GU g 1).2.6. Environmental ConditionsHobo sensors were installed within 4 treatments plots (NT-cover, NT-NC, RT-cover andRT-NC). To account for soil type differences, hobo sensors were strategically placed in thesecond and the last block (Figure S1) where a plot with cover was next to NC under the sametillage treatment (Figure S1; plot 7‚Äì8 and 23‚Äì24). Because both treatments contained a ryeCC, temperature differences between RY and RC were unlikely [ 38], therefore temperatureEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109 5 of 16treatments are referred to as cover or no cover. Soil temperature and %RH was measuredat 15 s intervals beginning in May through September in 2019 and 2020, when they wereremoved at the last sampling event of the year, prior to harvest. Sensors for %RH wereinstalled in June of 2019, thus data for May 2019 were unavailable. Soil moisture wasdetermined from each sample using the gravimetric method.3. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analysis were conducted in Program R [ 39]. Prior to analysis, soilparameters were checked for general multivariate frequentist test assumptions includinghomogeneity of variance, multivariate normality and outlier detection. Generalized linearmixed models (GLMMs) were used to assess the relationship between management (CCand tillage regime), month and year on %OC, CO 2Ô¨Çux, CC biomass, soil moisture andsoil temperature, respectively. The interaction of tillage (NT or RT), CC (RY, RC, or NC),month and year were Ô¨Åxed effects and block was used as a random effect to account for thegradient of soil types observed in the study plots. Each model was checked for goodnessof Ô¨Åt (homogeneity of variance, normality of residuals, residual distribution, normality ofrandom effect and collinearity). Tukey‚Äôs HSD post hoc test was used to identify pairwisedifferences between treatments. Alpha level was deÔ¨Åned at 0.05. Marginal differences wereconsidered at p-values 0.05‚Äì0.10.In order to assess the relationship of soil and environmental conditions on %OC andCO 2Ô¨Çux, respectively, a GLMM was Ô¨Åt to the data. We considered bacterial abundance(16 S), fungal abundance (18 S), soil moisture, soil temperature, cation exchange capacity(CEC), and pH as potential explanatory effects because they are often included in processed-based models of carbon sequestration [ 7,21,40,41]. In checking for multicollinearity, 16 Swas found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly positively correlated with 18 S ( r= 0.55, p< 0.05) and moisture(r= 0.63, p< 0.05). Parameters pH and CEC also were found to have signiÔ¨Åcant positivecorrelations ( r= 0.17, p< 0.01). Therefore, 16 S, pH and temperature were the only variablesused as Ô¨Åxed effects, and block was used as a random effect. Parameter estimates with 95%conÔ¨Ådence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the effect size. Covariates were centeredand scaled prior to analysis.Multivariate metrics were used to model C turnover in treatment groups along atemporal gradient. Prior to analysis, the data were scaled to be within range boundsusing the ‚ÄúpreProcess‚Äù command in package ‚Äòcaret‚Äô [ 42]. Analysis was conducted inprogram R using package ‚Äòcodyn‚Äô [ 43] and ‚Äòvegan‚Äô [ 44]. Change in the proportion of CCbiomass, %OC and CO 2Ô¨Çux between treatments was described in a time-lag analysis usingEuclidian distances, calculated on pairwise C pools across 6 time points (May 2019, July2019, September 2019, May 2020, July 2020 and September 2020). Because measurements ofCC biomass were only available for 3 months (May, July and September), June and Augustwere additionally omitted from the %OC and CO 2Ô¨Çux dataset. Distance values were usedin a regression against time intervals. The slope of the relationship describes the directionalrate of change in C pools within each treatment. The number of points in the regression isthe number of sample pairs and are therefore pseudo-replicated. Thus, the interpretationwas on the shape and slope of the pattern, rather than the signiÔ¨Åcance of the regressionline. To visually explore the change in pools of C over time, relative abundance of %OC,CO 2Ô¨Çux and CC biomass was calculated within each time point and treatment.Using the relative abundances calculated above, the ratio of %OC to CO 2Ô¨Çux (%OC:CO 2) was determined and then a GLMM was Ô¨Åt using cover and tillage as Ô¨Åxed effectsand block as a random effect. Tukey‚Äôs post hoc pairwise comparisons was used to identifypairwise differences in %OC: CO 2between treatments. The full data set (all sampling timepoints) were used in the analysis to balance comparisons between %OC: CO 2and %OC.Environments 2022 ,9, 109 6 of 164. Results4.1. Environmental ConditionsMean soil temperatures for 2019 and 2020 showed significant differences in treatments,months and years ( F39,143130 =1203, R2=0.24, p<0.05; Figure 1A). Tukey‚Äôs post hoccomparisons showed the overall temperature in cover to be significantly lower than no cover(p< 0.01) and NT to be significantly greater than RT ( p< 0.01), although these differencesvaried across time (Figure 1A). The slope of the trend of soil moisture was positive in NT,May, September, 2020, RCxJuly, RCxJune, Septx2020 and Julyx2020. The slope of the trendof soil moisture was negative with Mayx2020 [ 45].

To visually explore the change  in pools of C over ti me, relative abundance of %OC, CO ‚ÇÇ flux and CC biomass was calculated with in each time point and treatment.  Using the relative abundances calculated above, the ratio of %OC to CO ‚ÇÇ flux (%OC: CO‚ÇÇ) was determined and then a GLMM was fit using cover and tillage as fixed effects and block as a random effect. Tukey‚Äôs post hoc  pairwise comparisons was used to identify pairwise differences in %OC: CO ‚ÇÇ between treatments. The full data set (all sampling time points) were used in the analysis to balance comparisons between %OC: CO ‚ÇÇ and %OC.  4. Results 4.1.

Time lag regressional analysis of composition changein carbon (C) pools on different treatment combinations treatments (NT = no-till, RT = reduced till,NC = no cover, RC = rye + clover cover crop, RY = rye cover crop). Differences in C composition arecharacterized by Euclidean distances, which are calculated on pair-wise C pools across the entiretime series intervals (May, July, September 2019 and 2020). Plots that included a cover crop (RY andRC) showed stronger directional change than those without (NC). Positive slopes indicate that earlytime points of C pool composition are more dissimilar to time points further away than those closertogether, a negative slope indicates that early time points are more similar to points far away thanclose, and a neutral slope indicates a no pattern/change in dissimilarity.

Discussion5.1. Management Practice Effects on %OC and CO 2FluxA %OC increase in plots managed with NT and CC is consistent with other studiesfrom the region [ 26,46], where %OC increased in all plots that included CC. Cover cropsprovide an additional carbon source to the cropping system, increasing %OC as CC biomassdegrades, echoed in the 3.5‚Äì27.3% difference in OC g kg 1in study plots that includeda CC compared to plots without. In a regionally comparable study of CCs conducted inLouisiana, USA, Sanchez et al. [ 46] looked at the effects of CC and a variable N fertilizerrate on %OC. They found a 35% increase in %OC g kg 1after only two years, suggestingthe degree of %OC increase will be inÔ¨Çuenced by other factors, not just time (i.e., additionalmanagement, climate and edaphic properties). In a recent article by Daryanto et al. [ 19],ecosystem services of CC were quantitatively synthesized. It was found that CC consis-tently increase %OC concentration in soil by at least 9%, regardless of climatic region andmanagement, indicating that CC are a positive practice for %OC accumulation under mostagronomic conditions.Soil organic carbon is highly dynamic and its residence time in soil will depend onsoil biological and physical properties as well as climate conditions [ 47]. In this study,%OC was negatively affected by soil pH and positively affected by bacterial abundance.Generally, %OC and pH have a negative relationship, which has been documented atEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109 12 of 16various landscape scales [ 23,48]. When organic matter decomposes (e.g., CC residue),organic acids are released which lowers pH. Additionally, slight increases in pH canactivate bacterial populations that are dormant at a lower pH, resulting in decompositionof organic matter and a %OC loss. Soil bacteria (and other microorganisms) contribute tothe degradation and mineralization of organic matter as well as the to the generation ofnew organic metabolites. The produced metabolites form strong chemical bonds with themineral soil matrix, increasing stable soil C [ 41,49,50]. Counter to most statistical modelsthat use soil temperature to predict %OC [ 7,51], temperature was not a signiÔ¨Åcant predictorof %OC in the study plots. This may be because soil temperatures were mean valuesover a month period, which limits predictive power. Future studies should incorporatecontinuous temperature and measurements over time to fully capture their inÔ¨Çuence over%OC in the study system.Studies of CC inÔ¨Çuence on CO 2Ô¨Çux generally predict increased GHG emissionsbecause of increased decomposition of organic matter by soil microbes. However, no overalldifference in CO 2Ô¨Çux was found between CC treatments. Romdhane et al. [ 52] found thatmanagement of CC had a larger inÔ¨Çuence on soil microbial dynamics than the addition ofCC alone. The degree that CC residue comes into contact with soil through rolling, tilling,or standing, will shift rates of decomposition and mineralization. We hypothesize thatsigniÔ¨Åcant differences in CO 2Ô¨Çux were not observed because there was minimal CC contactwith soil after termination and there was substantial volunteer vegetation growth in NCplots. Changes in CO 2Ô¨Çux between treatments may be observed post-harvest, when RTtreatments incorporate residue, therefore future studies should include CO 2Ô¨Çux measuresfor a full year.While overall there was no difference in CO 2Ô¨Çux between treatments, CO 2Ô¨Çux waslower in NT in July of 2020 when compared to RT. Percent relative humidity was also highthat month, which has been linked to faster decomposition rates and an increase in CO 2Ô¨Çux [ 53]. Interestingly, bacterial abundance had a negative effect on CO 2Ô¨Çux, which wasreÔ¨Çected in greater abundances of bacteria and fungi in NT plots in July of 2020. This inverserelationship is counter to most studies where an increase in microbial activity is generallyassociated with higher CO 2emissions [ 18,19,54]. We postulate two reasons for this: (1) InJuly 2020, soil temperature spiked and soil moisture declined, potentially triggering astress response in soil microorganisms, thereby increasing the proportion of metabolicallydormant bacteria. Dormant bacteria do not respire. Since bacterial and fungal abundancewas measured as rRNA detection, abundances reÔ¨Çect presence of microorganisms, notmicrobial activity. (2) No-till promotes microbial communities that employ anaerobicrespiration. In Firth [ 45] it was found that NT plots had different bacteria communitycomposition and lower diversity than RT which was attributed to low O 2conditions inheavy clay soils. Because only CO 2Ô¨Çux was measured, we cannot determine if a microbialcommunity shift towards facultative anaerobes that favor different processes of alternativeterminal electron acceptors occurred. This would potentially result in increased methane ornitrous oxide emissions. It‚Äôs likely that both postulates are contributing to the observedrelationship of CO 2Ô¨Çux and microbial abundance. We conclude that NT management onMAV clay soils may help mitigate CO 2Ô¨Çux when %RH is high, but there is considerableuncertainty in the mechanism and alternative outcomes.5.2. Directional Change of C TurnoverMeasures of C turnover are more sensitive to temporal shifts in C pool compositionthan when assessing each pool individually. When examining directional change of C(or turnover), a positive slope, as seen in treatment combinations that included CCs (RYor RC), indicates that there are proportional shifts in C pools that are directional, that is,measured pools are reordering themselves through time towards compositions that areincreasingly dissimilar. Logically, the decomposition of an additional C resource will bedifferentially affected by climate conditions and resident soil microbial communities andthus rearrange C pools. While this is a somewhat obvious conclusion, the positive slopesEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109 13 of 16conÔ¨Årm that directional change is heading towards a dominate pool. Visualizations ofrelative abundances show RT-CC combinations favoring CO 2Ô¨Çux and NT-CC combinationsfavoriting %OC and CC biomass (Figure 8). The negative slope in RTxNC also conÔ¨Årms apattern in variable change, but one of stability, meaning that the relative abundances of Cpools cycle back to their original state towards a dominate CO 2Ô¨Çux pool. Interestingly, theneutral slope in NTxNC suggests no pattern in C turnover, or rather relative abundancesdo not change.It is important to note that directional change towards %OC accumulation does notmean C stabilization. Changes in environmental conditions, for example increased temper-atures, rainfall, or nitrogen addition, can quickly change the rate and mechanisms of %OCdecomposition [ 40,55]. Therefore, if accumulated %OC is in a labile form, it is still vulnera-ble to system loss if environmental conditions were to shift. Nevertheless, physiochemicaltraits of soil (clay fraction, CEC, and pH) are an equally important controlling factor to-wards C sequestration and stabilization [ 7,21,56]. Likewise, recalcitrant organic chemicals,such as soybean-derived phytotoxins, are also bound by soil particles and contribute to soilorganic carbon [ 57]. Cation exchange capacity is associated with available surface area ofsoil which reÔ¨Çects the sorption potential of %OC into soil aggregates, thereby protecting%OC from decomposition [ 58]. After controlling for the clay soil fraction, CEC was foundto be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in NT plots than those without [ 45], which is encouraging that atleast a fraction of accumulated %OC in NT-CC plots may be retained in a stable form.The advantage of this approach is that trends towards C loss or C accumulation canbe identiÔ¨Åed over short time periods with fewer parameters. The utility of C turnover liesin its ability to be swiftly translated into a metric evaluating conservation practice perfor-mance towards climate mitigation objectives. However, we recognize that only accountingfor %OC, CO 2Ô¨Çux and CC biomass neglects several important C pools, namely above-and-below ground plant biomass and methane. The inclusion of methane is particularlyimportant for interpretation of this study because of the postulate that NT treatments areshifting microbial communities towards facultative anaerobes. Including all C pools mayresult in a shift towards net C loss in those treatments that currently favor a dominating%OC pool (or %OC accumulation). Additionally, our results only account for growingseason. The proportional changes will likely Ô¨Çuctuate if fallow season measurements areincluded. However, we reason that while the relative abundances of %OC, CO 2Ô¨Çux andCC biomass will change with the incorporation of more C pools and time measurements,the relative ratios will remain the same and therefore still convey important informationabout C relationships, albeit incomplete.To illustrate this point, we compare measures of %OC to %OC:CO 2. Soil organic carbonwas greater in RTxRC than RTxNC, but there was no difference between these groups whenlooking at %OC:CO 2(Tables 1 and 3). If the management objective was to accumulate %OCin a RT system, RC would increase input costs but may not result in a detectable changein %OC over time. Likewise, NTxRY and NTxRC %OC was not signiÔ¨Åcantly differentthan RTxRC. However, RTxRC %OC:CO 2is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than NTxRY and NTxRC(Tables 1 and 3), meaning that despite having a similar %OC average, RTxRC is losingmore %OC from the system than NTxRY and NTxRC. This is an important observation fora producer that could result in a signiÔ¨Åcant economic return which would otherwise notbeen apparent if looking %OC independently. We encourage future studies to incorporatea more comprehensive assessment of major C pools to increase conÔ¨Ådence in identiÔ¨Åedtrends of C turnover and facilitate the translation of Ô¨Åndings to management action.6. ConclusionsLandscape-scale management directives for C storage are receiving global attentionand at the center of national policy discussion. Producers are challenged to adopt con-servation practices where successful implementation is often dependent on local weatherpatterns, land history and site-speciÔ¨Åc features that drive crop production and success.In this study we addressed changes in C following long-term application of CC and NTEnvironments 2022 ,9, 109 14 of 16management in a soybean cropping system in the mid-South. Conservation managementincreased %OC, showed no overall difference in CO 2Ô¨Çux between treatments, and CCbiomass increased with the number of species in the CC mix. Soil organic carbon waspositively affected by increases in microbial abundance, while CO 2Ô¨Çux was negativelyassociated with microbial abundance. We hypothesize that the combination of environ-mental conditions and lower O 2soils contributed to a decrease in microbial activity and ashift towards facultative microbial communities that favor alternative terminal electronacceptors, in turn lowering CO 2respiration. Carbon dioxide Ô¨Çux was also associated withincreases in %RH, supporting Thapa et. al.‚Äôs [ 53] notion that processed-based models ofdecomposition should be updated to include %RH.Finally, conceptualizing C as proportional pools that Ô¨Çuctuate over time is a moreholistic assessment of C dynamics that is easily transferred to public understanding. Usinga measure of C turnover to evaluate compositional changes in C pools shows trendstowards incremental shifts in C loss or accumulation. In this study, measures of C turnoversuggested that NT combined with CC resulted in C accumulation, while RT combined witha CC suggested C system loss which was not apparent when assessing %OC alone. Futureresearch should assess how other GHGs (i.e., methane, nitrous oxide) are affected by heavyclay soils in the mid-South, USA, as well include above and below-ground plant biomassas C pools in a directional model. Trends in C turnover can then be more conÔ¨ÅdentlyidentiÔ¨Åed and translated into swift management action.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at:https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/environments9090109/s1, Figure S1: Treatment plot map.Table S1: Percent Organic Carbon Mixed Model Results, Table S2: CO 2Flux Mixed Model Results,Table S3: Mixed Model Results of Soil Environmental Variables Relationship with %OC and CO 2Flux, Table S4: Cover Crop Biomass Mixed Model Results, Table S5: %OC to CO 2Flux MixedModel Results.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.G.F., M.A.L. and B.H.B.; methodology, A.G.F., J.P .B.,M.A.L. and B.H.B.; formal analysis, A.G.F.; investigation, A.G.F.; resources, J.P .B., M.A.L. and B.H.B.;writing‚Äîoriginal draft preparation, A.G.F.; writing‚Äîreview and editing, A.G.F., J.P .B., M.A.L., D.J.M.,A.B. and B.H.B.; supervision, J.P .B., B.H.B.; funding acquisition, J.P .B., M.A.L.
