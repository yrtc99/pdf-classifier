Recent studies have shown thattheEarthisbecomingmorevegetatedandthatbio-logical carbon sequestration is significant [ 3]. Sim-ilarly, individual countries (e.g. China) have seenSOC increases over the last three decades [ 4,5].In contrast to SOC, SIC is forming slowly and isconsidered temporally stable [ 6]. Therefore, littleattention has been paid to SIC pool dynamics.Nonetheless,themostrecentstudiesshowthatenvi-ronmentalchanges,suchastheuseofchemicalfertil-izers,globalwarmingandatmosphericaciddeposi-tion,havecausedsignificantglobalsoilacidification,especially in cropland [ 7,8], which may accelerateSICturnover[ 9,10],leadingtoSICsinks[ 11,12]orSIC sources [ 13,14]. Land use change may also in-fluenceSICcycling[ 15].Most SIC (up to 90%) contributes to the to-tal soil C stock in arid and semi-arid areas [ 15,16],whichaccountfor ∼41%oftheEarth’slandsurface[17,18].

Comparedwith the control plots in the 1980s, ∼56.5% ofthe pairs exhibited a declining trend (1299/2299).TheaverageSICDdecrementsacrossChina’scrop-land, forest and grassland were 0.34 kg C m–2,0.38kgCm–2and0.35kgCm–2,respectively.Themeandecliningratesforthesethreeecosystemswere11.33 g C m–2yr–1, 12.67 g C m–2yr–1and11.67 g C m–2yr–1, respectively (Fig. 2).

Thus, only the RF methodwas employed rather than an ensemble method[29,30]. To assess the prediction uncertainty, thespatialdistributionofthestandarddeviation(STD)of100simulationswasgenerated(Fig. 3bandSup-plementary Fig. S5b and d). High uncertainty interms of high STD was found in some areas withhigh SICD (Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. S5).The spatial pattern of SICD showed a clear patternin line with climatic and geological zones in the1980s and 2010s, and the mean SICD values were1.64±0.14 kg C m–2and 1.50 ±0.14 kg C m–2,respectively. High SIC values were mainly foundin the arid and semi-arid areas (North and North-westChina)(SupplementaryFig.S5).Inthe1980s–2010s, total SIC stocks within the topsoil (30 cm)decreasedby8.99 ±2.24%(1.37 ±0.37PgC),ap-proximatelyone-thirdofwhichwaslostinthenorth-westernzone(Fig. 3andSupplementaryTableS2).All agroecological zones except the northeasternzone(whereSICstocksincreasedby12.50 ±4.71%(0.09±0.03 Pg C)) have experienced net SIClosses. Specifically, the fastest loss of SIC wasfound in the south-central zone, with a value of26.47±4.03%(0.27 ±0.05PgC),possiblyduetothehighlithogeniccarbonateconcentrationsinthekarstareas.Three-dimensional (3D) soil mapping tech-niques were used to estimate total SIC stocks at asoil depth of 0–3 m in the 2010s (SupplementaryText). The depth functions accounted for 36%–89% of the vertical variations in SIC mass density(Supplementary Fig. S7), and thus, the missingSICD values were calculated down to a soil depthof 3 m. The RF model yielded the most accuratepredictions for the estimates at 0–1 m, 1–2 m andPage3of8Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/9/2/nwab120/6313293 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Natl Sci Rev ,2022,Vol.9,nwab12005 0 0  k mSICD (kg C m-2)-1.5    -1.0   -0.5  0     0.5   1.0   1.5   NANHAIZHUDAO0153045-3 0 3Frequency (%)NNANHAIZHUDAO0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  STD (kg C m-2)0100.1 0.2 0.3Frequency (%)b aFigure 3.

The average loss rate ofSIC in forestland (7.7 ±2.4 Tg C yr–1)w a sgreater than that of sequestrated SOC (4.0 ±4.1 Tg C yr–1), but the loss rates of SIC incropland (16.0 ±1.4 Tg C yr–1) and grassland(0.7±1.3Tg C yr–1)were lower than those ofse-questrated SOC (26.0 ±11.0 Tg C yr–1for crop-land and 6.0 ±1.0 Tg C yr–1for grassland). Theaverage SIC losses across China (46 Tg C yr–1)and in cropland (16 Tg C yr–1) (SupplementaryTableS2)accountfor ∼17.6%–24.0%oftheterres-trialCsink[ 4]and57.1%oftheSOCsinkincrop-land [5], respectively. In addition, the potential ofSOCaccumulationremainsunclear,buttheresultsinthenearfuturearenotveryoptimistic[ 31,32].Inconclusion,thenegativecontributionofSICtothesoil C pool is far from negligible. To maintain theglobalterrestrialcarbonbalance,thefeedbackofSICtoglobalchangesshouldbeconsideredintheongo-ingsixthassessmentreportoftheIntergovernmentalPanelonClimateChangeandthe‘4per1000’Initia-tiveStrategicPlan[ 33].LinkingSICdynamicstointensifiedreactiveNinputandglobalchangeThe main pathways of SIC cycling based on ourresults and meta-analysis were determined in thisstudy (Supplementary Text and Fig. 2). The path-way analysis showed that soil acidification maygreatly accelerate SIC turnover, and thus globalchange, in terms of climate change, atmosphericnitrogen (N) deposition and anthropogenic reac-tive N addition indirectly lead to the loss of SIC(Fig.2). Most of the lost SIC was converted toCO2andreleasedtotheatmosphere(maximumof89.22Tgyr–1).ThepathwayanalysisprovidednewPage4of8Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/9/2/nwab120/6313293 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Natl Sci Rev ,2022,Vol.9,nwab120insights into SIC pool dynamics and was helpfulfor understanding the spatial controls. Some non-essentialCflowswerenotlisted,suchassulfurdepo-sition,manureapplicationandplantuptakeofCa2+.The amount of manure application was much lessthanthatofchemicalfertilizerduringthe1980sand2000sinChina[ 4].TheatmosphericinputsofCa2+mainly control pedogenic carbonate formation inarid areas ( ∼1.0–3.5 g CaCO 3m–2yr–1)[34]. Wedidnotcalculateotherprocessesaffectingsoilacid-ification [14] but used clear evidence from numer-ous observations in agroecosystems ( n=8875 inRef. [7]) and natural ecosystems ( n=5598 inRef.[22];n=602inRef.[ 23]).Wealsoconductedadata-drivenanalysistoiden-tifythespatialcontrolsonSICloss.First,toranktheenvironmental controls, we measured relative vari-ableimportancethroughaMonteCarlosimulationofRFmodels(SupplementaryTextandSupplemen-tary Fig. S9). The results for the 1980s and 2010sshowed that climatic variables and N depositionmainly drove the spatial pattern of SICD, such asthemeanannualprecipitation(MAP),meanannualtemperature (MAT) and total NH xand NO yde-position.Furthermore,thecorrelationsbetweenthechangesinSICDandthoseinclimateandNdeposi-tionwereanalyzed.Despitetheabsenceofastrongcorrelation,thechangesinSICDindifferentecosys-temsvariedmarkedlywiththechangesinthesevari-ables ( P<0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S10). MuchSIC will be lost due to increasing MAP, NH xandNO y.However,theactualamountofnetCO 2emissionresultingfromcarbonatedissolutionwasdifficulttoaccount for, as Ca2+ions were not often recordedin either period. The exchangeable calcium (Exch.Ca) may increase due to the dissolution of car-bonates [35], some of which may leach downwardalong with NO 3–and HCO 3–[36]. Here, Exch.Ca data from four provinces, i.e. Hubei, Henan,Sichuan and Guangdong provinces, in the south-centralandsouthwesternzones,werecollected.Theresults of the unpaired t-test showed that Exch. Casignificantly increased by 2.12 cmol ( +)k g–1and1.72 cmol ( +)k g–1in cropland and forestland, re-spectively(SupplementaryTableS4).TheseresultssuggestedthatmoreCaCO 3wasdissolvedthanbe-fore, even if the increase in Exch. Ca in croplandcanbepartlyattributedtofertilization(e.g.calcium-magnesiumphosphate).In conclusion, global changes as aggravated bythe anthropogenic input of reactive N via director indirect pathways were the main drivers of SICloss according to three different methods: pathwayanalysis (Fig. 2), variable importance analysis(Supplementary Fig. S9) and correlation analysis(Supplementary Fig. S10). In theory, to achieve anet loss of SIC, the SIC input should be less thanthe output. Changes in Ca2+,H+and HCO 3–concentrations, soil water content and CO 2pressure can directly stimulate the equilibriumreaction of carbonate dissolution (equation inFig.2)[37]. Hence, the driving factors inferredabove could be briefly explained as follows. First,in the last three decades, intensified agricultureconsumed large amounts of chemical N fertilizer(∼0.135 ton ha–1yr–1) (Supplementary Fig. S11),andanthropogenicactivitiescausedarapidincreaseinatmosphericNdeposition[ 38].Thus,nationwidesoil acidification was observed. A decrease in SICstocks resulting from net H+input likely occurred[14,27]. Carbonate dissolution was greatly acceler-ated by neutralizing soil acidification, especially incalcareoussoilswithpH >6.5[14,22].Second,theincrease in atmospheric CO 2concentrations maydirectlyelevateCO 2intopsoil,andglobalwarmingis even expected to increase CO 2production fromentire soil profiles [ 39]. The average precipitationhas increased over mid-latitude land areas since1901 [40], leading to an increase in soil watercontent. Finally, the agroecosystem exhibited a netSOCsinkduetothefastincreaseincropproductionand return of crop residues to cropland [ 4]. TheChinese government has issued a series of laws,regulations and policies to alleviate environmentalproblems,such as the Natural ForestConservationProgramandGrainforGreenProgram[ 21].Thesestrategies are very effective. For example, Chinacontributed to 25% of the global increase in leafarea [3], and SOC was obviously sequestered(75.0–75.4TgCyr–1)inChina[ 5].TheterrestrialbiosphereCsinkmayoffset45%ofannualChineseanthropogenic C emissions [ 41]. Accordingly, theaccumulation of SOC may promote organic andcarbonicacidproduction,soilstructure,soilporos-ity, and heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration[37], which often neutralize base cations, enhanceCO2partial pressures and soil water content, andfacilitate the leaching and dissolution of carbonate[15]. Therefore, this study provides evidence of atrade-off between SOC and SIC stocks, which issimilar to the trade-off between plant biomass andSOCstocksresultingfromelevatedCO 2[42].FutureprojectionThe formation rates of both lithogenic and pedo-genicinorganiccarbonaregenerallylowerthantheneutralizing rates for increasing acidity [ 6,13,36].Under future climate scenarios, SIC stocks are ex-pected to continue decreasing if more protons arereleasedintosoils.WeevaluatedthepotentialriskofPage5of8Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/9/2/nwab120/6313293 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Natl Sci Rev ,2022,Vol.9,nwab120SIClossfrom2020to2100(SupplementaryText),in which the 2010s subset was taken as the base-line, mainly driven by land use and climate pro-jections from nine Coupled Model Intercompari-sonProjectPhase6(CMIP6)modelsunderSharedSocioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1–2.6 and 3–7.0[43].TotaltopsoilSICstocksbytheendofthiscen-tury were projected to be 11.33 ±1.47 Pg C and11.38±1.98PgCforSSP1–2.6andSSP3–7.0,re-spectively(Fig. 4).Comparedtothe2010s,SICwasestimatedtodecreaseby6.45%–40.05%and7.21%–52.37%forSSP1–2.6andSSP3–7.0,withmeanval-ues of 19.47% and 19.12%, respectively. As men-tionedabove,mostoftheSICmaybereleasedtotheatmosphereasCO 2(Fig.2).ThistrendwillcontinueundertwoSSPscenariosthrough2100(Fig. 4).Ap-proximately one-fifth of the SIC will be released totheatmosphereasCO 2.Theuncertaintyintheafore-mentioned ranges is approximately double (SSP1–2.6) or triple (SSP3–7.0) the mean values. This re-sult showed that different future climate scenariosmayleadtomoderateprojectionuncertainty.The SIC in cropland will decrease by 31.27%(SSP1–2.6) or 52.90% (SSP3–7.0), while the SICin natural ecosystems (forest and grassland) maydecreaseby12.82%(SSP1–2.6)or50.52%(SSP3–7.0). The projection shows that under SSP1–2.6,SIC is anticipated to stop decreasing in naturalecosystems (Supplementary Fig. S12b). This is apositivesignandindicatesthatstakeholdersandde-cisionmakerscantakeenvironmentallyfriendlyac-tionstoavoiddangerousanthropogenicinterferencewith the climate system. In this century, it is verylikelythatglobalclimatechangewillbegraduallyre-inforced[ 40].Linkingtheseresultstogether,itcanbeinferredthatglobalchangewillcontinuetofacili-tateSICloss.ThecommoncontinuouslossofSICisfarfromnegligibleandshouldbeconsideredintheglobalbiogeochemicalcyclingofcarbon.Although the RF model provided a robust pre-diction(SupplementaryFig.S6),uncertaintywasin-evitablypresentintheSICpoolestimation.Duetothe lack of accurate longitudinal and latitudinal in-formation on legacy points, the repeated samplinglocations in the 2010s were not completely identi-cal to those in the 1980s. In addition, differencesin the number and location of collected soil sam-ples (Supplementary Fig. S1)may have led to vari-ation in the results, as soils with carbonates weremainlyfoundinaridandsemi-aridregions,orinthekarstareas.Forexample,theobservedSICDvaluesin cropland (Fig. 1) were moderately greater thanthoseinRefs[ 14,45],andtheSICDvaluesingrass-land were slightly less than those in Ref. [ 46]. Theaverage loss rates of SIC in cropland were greaterthanthoseinRef.[ 14],andthoseingrasslandwere0510152010Y earSIC stock (Pg C)SSP1−2.6SSP3−7.05.07.510.012.515.02020 2040 2060 2080 2100YearNTot (Tg N)2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 2100Figure4.Trendintopsoil(0–30cm)SICstocksinChinaforthe 2010–2100 period under the SSP1–2.6 and SSP3–7.0scenarios.Thesolidlinesrepresentthemeanvalues,andtheshaded regions indicate all the predicted values from nineCMIP6models.Thepredictionuncertaintyforeachscenariowasnotassessedbecauseofthelargecalculationcost.ThechangesintotalNdeposition(N Tot)areillustratedinthein-set,andwereobtainedfromRef.[ 44].ThetimestepsfortheSICstocksmodelingarethedecadesfrom2010to2100,aim-ingtobetterquantifythecumulativeeffectofenvironmentalchangesonSIC.lessthanthoseinRef.[ 27].However,estimatedSICstocksatsoildepthsof0.3mand1m(Supplemen-taryTablesS2andS3)wereconsistentwiththepre-dictions of Refs [ 45] and [24,25,45], respectively.TheconclusionsofnetSIClossindifferentecosys-tems(Fig. 1andSupplementaryFig.S4)concurredwiththefindingsofstudiesconductedattheregionalscale [2,14,25–27], which can provide credible ob-servationalbenchmarks.Furthermore, the mechanism of carbonate dis-solution resulting from N input in various ecosys-temsandthepathwaysofCa2+ionsremainunclear(Fig.2). The dissolution, precipitation and leach-ingofcarbonatemaybejointlyresponsibleforSIClosses [35]. Therefore, CO 2emissions that are dueto acidifying processes need to be accurately quan-tified[13,14].Inaddition,thefutureprojectionsofSIC change in this study relied mainly on the pa-rameters of the baseline model in the 2010s anddynamicvariables(SupplementaryText).Thus,theprediction errors of the baseline model might havebeen propagated when incorporating future envi-ronmentalvariablesascovariates,whichwerechar-acterized by inherent errors from production anddownscaling. For example, although annual N de-positionmaymoderatelydecreaseinSSP1–2.6,thecumulativedecreaseintotalSICstocksissimilartothat in SSP3–7.0 (Fig. 4). Similar changes are alsofoundinagroecosystems(SupplementaryFig.S12).The uncertainty of the future projection was notassessedbecauseofthelargecalculationcost.How-ever, it can be inferred that the prediction un-certainty from 2020–2100 would be of the samePage6of8Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/9/2/nwab120/6313293 by National Cheng Kung University user on 10 April 2023Natl Sci Rev ,2022,Vol.9,nwab120magnitude as that in the 2010s (SupplementaryTableS2),whichisacceptable.CONCLUSIONAnetSIClossof0.046PgCyr–1isfoundinChinafromthe1980stothe2010s.SpatialanalysisshowsthatNdepositionandclimatechangehaveprofoundinfluences on SIC loss.
