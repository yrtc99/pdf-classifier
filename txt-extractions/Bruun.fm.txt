In this paper, we examine 3 different models used to estimate turnover of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractionsusing radiocarbon measurements: one conv entional carbon dating model and two bomb 14C models. One of the bomb 14Cmodels uses an atmospheric 14C record for the period 22,050 BC to AD 2003 and is solved by numerical methods, while theother assumes a constant 14C content of the atmosphere and is solved anal ytically. The estimates of SOC turnover obtainedby the conventional 14C dating model differed substantially from those obtained by the bomb 14C models, which we attributeto the simplifying assump tion of the conventional 14C model that the whole SO C fraction is of the sa me age. The assumptionsunderlying the bomb 14C models are more applicable to SOC fractions; therefore, the calcu lated turnover times are consideredto be more reliable. We used Monte Carl o simulations to estimate the uncertainties of the turnover times calculated with thenumerically solved 14C model, accounting not only for measurement erro rs but also for uncertainties introduced fromassumptions of constant input and uncertainties in the 14C content of the CO 2 assimilated by plants. Th e resulting uncertaintiesdepend on systematic deviations in the atmospheric 14C record for SOC fractions with a fa st turnover. Therefore, the use ofthe bomb 14C models can be problematic  when SOC fractions with a fast tur nover are analyzed, wh ereas the relativeuncertainty of the turnover estimates turned out to be smalle r than 30% when the turnover time of the SOC fractions analyzedwas longer than 30 yr, and smaller than 15% when the turnov er time was longer than 100 yr. INTRODUCTIONTwo distinct theoretical approaches have been take n in the use of radiocarbon to estimate turnoverof soil organic carbon (SOC) fract ions, namely, the conventional 14C dating model and the bomb 14Cmodel.According to Scharpenseel and Schiffmann (1 977), Paul et al. (1964) first began using 14C dating asa means to study SOC dynamics. Since then, a number of studies have used 14C dating to estimatethe turnover or mean residence time of SOC fract ions (Martel and Paul 1974; Jenkinson and Rayner1977; Gilet-Blein et al. 1980; Anderson and Paul 1 984; Bol et al. 1999). However, the determinationof the turnover time in these studies relies on the theory developed for age determination of archae-ological samples, with the prerequisite that the whole sample is of the sa me age (Libby 1952). Thisis probably true for the layers of  peat soils (Geyh et al. 1971), but obviously not for SOC fractionsin general. Therefore, conventional 14C dating leads to biased turnover estimates of SOC fractions.Some of the above-mentioned authors have therefor e introduced the terms “the apparent mean resi-dence time” or “equivalent age” for the values ob tained. However, interpretation of these valuesremains difficult (Perrin and Willis 1964; Geyh et al. 1971).Another model used to estimate  SOC turnover relies on the in creased level of atmospheric 14C as aconsequence of nuclear bomb activity in the 1950 s and 1960s (Balesdent 1987; Harkness et al.1991; Harrison and Broecker 1993; Hsieh 1996; Trum bore 1993; Trumbore et al. 1996; Bird et al.2002; Chen et al. 2002; Agnelli et al. 2002). Becau se of the recent appearan ce of the bomb peak, thismethod is used to estimate short-term carbon tu rnover. However, the method may also be used toestimate turnover of more resistant fractions of SO C by taking advantage of the natural decay of 14C. 1Department of Agricultural Sciences, The Royal Veterinary  and Agricultural University , Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871Frederiksberg C, Denmark. 2Corresponding author.

The SOC fractions can be isolated either fromspecific horizons or from the whole profile.  To be useful in the context of the 14C analyses, the iso-lated SOC fractions should be as homogeneous as  possible with respect to chemical compositionand physical protection, and therefore also with  respect to turnover (Trumbore and Zheng 1996).Examples of such SOC fractions that have been used in combination with 14C analyses are thehydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable fractions (e.g. Ca mpbell et al. 1967; Trumbore et al. 1996), dif-ferent density fractions (e.g. Bais den et al. 2002), and differently si zed organomineral fractions (e.g.Anderson and Paul 1984).The objectives of the current study were to criti cally analyze the possibilities of estimating turnoverof SOC fractions by 14C measurements, and to analyze the un certainties of the estimates caused bythe assumptions underlying the diff erent approaches. We review 3 different theoretical approachesto estimate SOC turnover by 14C-based methods, compare the result s, and determine the situationsin which they can be used to  obtain reliable estimates.METHODSThe Conventional 14C Dating ModelThe theoretical basis for 14C dating is the exponential decay of 14C. In a sample where all the carbonhas entered at the same time, the specific activity is described byA(t) = AI(t)exp(– λa)( 1 )where A(t) is the specific activity of the sample corr ected for fractionation during photosynthesis bythe 13C content (Stuiver and Polach 1977), AI(t) is the specific activity of the sample when it wasformed, λ is the decay rate constant of 14C, and a is the time since the sample was formed (i.e. itsage). Therefore, the age of the sample isln (2)In standard 14C dating, Aabs is used as the standard 14C content of new material, and the decay rateconstant is based on the Libby half-life of 14C (Stuiver and Polach 1977). Aabs is defined as 95% ofthe activity in 1950 of an oxalic  acid standard, which is estimated to be equal to the atmosphericsteady-state level of pre-bomb atmospheric activity. To correct the 14C age for changes in atmo-spheric 14C content (and therefore AI(t) ≠ Aabs), 14C calibrations have been constructed coupling realage with 14C age (Stuiver et al. 1998; Damon and Peristykh 2000). If it is assumed that the measured SOC fraction is in steady-state between inputs and decay, the turn-over time ( τ) is equal to the age or the mean residence time of the sample. Therefore, if we assumethat the activity of the input is equal to Aabs and that all the carbon in a sa mple entered the soil at thesame time, then the turnover time isln (3)a1λ---=AIt()At()------------τ1λ---=AabsAt()----------https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press14C Estimates of Soil Organic Carbon Turnover 101The Bomb 14C ModelSeveral models have been formulated that use the peak of 14C to estimate turnover of SOC fractions(Balesdent and Guillet 1982; Balesdent 1987; Hark ness et al. 1991; Cherkinsky and Brovkin 1993;Hsieh 1993; Trumbore et al. 1996). All the models  are fundamentally similar and make use of thesame basic assumptions. The 14C bomb models assume that the turnover of th e analyzed SOC fractions is well described byfirst-order kinetics. As SOC consists of carbon of ve ry varying degradability, this is not a plausibleassumption for total SOC. Therefore, the models ar e applied to SOC fractions . An important featureof these SOC fractions is that the isolated SOC ha s to be more homogeneous than the total SOC poolwith respect to chemical and phys ical protection. Other basic assump tions in the model are that theinputs to the SOC fractions are constant and that th e soil C level is at equi librium between input anddecay. Furthermore, we need to know the 14C content of the plant material entering the soil. Thesevalues are usually calculated from the atmospheric 14C content at the time of plant growth.The bomb 14C model can be formulated in both continuo us and discrete form. As soils receive con-tinuous inputs of organic matter in the form of lit ter fall and rhizodeposition, we chose to use thecontinuous form here. We introduce a distribution, ϕ(a, t), of SOC. This distribution is defined suchthat ϕ(a, t)da is the amount of organic carbon in a given fraction of SOC at time t, which has enteredthe soil between a and a + da . Thus, a can be conceived as the age of the organic carbon and ϕ(a, t)as an age distribution. A cohort of SOC of age a must have formed a years ago, i.e. at time t − a.Therefore, an assumption of first-order kineti cs means that the age distribution of age a at time t isgiven by ϕ(a, t) = I(t – a)exp(– ka)( 4 )where I(t) = ϕ(0, t) denotes the rate with which new material  enters the SOC fraction (the input) attime t, and k is the first-order decay constant for the SOC fraction.By similar arguments to the above and by  considering the exponential decay of 14C, the specificactivity [ A(a, t)] of a cohort of SOC of age a at time t is given byA(a, t) = AI(t – a)exp(– λa)( 5 )where AI(t) = A(0, t) is the specific activity of new material at time t, and λ is the decay constant of14C. This equation assumes that no isotopic fracti onation occurs during the decomposition process. As ϕ(a, t)da is the amount of SOC in the fraction of ages a to a + da , ϕ(a, t)da A(a, t) is the activityof 14C in the same age interval. Therefore, the specif ic activity of the whole SOC fraction is given by(6)Insertion of Equation 4 and Equa tion 5 into Equation 6 leads toAt()ϕat,() Aat,() ad0∞∫ϕat,() ad0∞∫-----------------------------------------------=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press102 S Bruun et al.(7)Defining the standardized input history as i(t) = I(t)/I, where I is the average input to the SOC frac-tion, and inserting this in Equation 7 results in(8)We see that the specific activity is independent of the mean input, but not the input history (i.e. thevariation in inputs that has occurred in the past). To be able to use Equation 8 to estimate k, we need to know the standardized input history. However,there is no apparent way to estimate the inputs to  SOC fractions. Furthermore, measurements of totallitter inputs are generally difficul t and rarely performed in long-term studies. If we assume that theinput to a SOC fraction is constant, ϕ(0, t) = I, and that the soil has reach ed steady-state, then Equa-tion 4 reduces toϕ(a) = I exp(−ka)( 9 )which is the age distribution at steady-state. To estimate the model parameters k and I, we use the measured amount of carbon in the SOC frac-tion, C, and the measured specific activity, A. The amount of C can be found by integrating over theage distribution(10)whereas the specific activity can be found by insertion into Equation 5(11)This is the equation that can be us ed to estimate the decomposition rate k of SOC fractions by track-ing the peak of 14C. We call this eq uation “the bomb 14C equation,” and it can only be solved for kby numerical integration and iteration. The value of k can then be used to derive I from Equation 10and the amount of carbon in the SOC fraction. If se veral samples have been taken, either at the sameor at different points in time, the value of k can be optimized by defini ng an optimization criterion.If we assume that the specific activity of inputs to the SOC fraction is constant ( AI), Equation 5reduces toAt()It a–() kλ+() a –[] AI exp ta–() ad0∞∫It a–() ka–() ad exp0∞∫---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- =At()it a–() kλ+() a –[] AI exp ta–() ad0∞∫it a–() ka–() ad exp0∞∫---------------------------- --------------------- -------------------- ----------------- =C ϕa()ad0∞∫Ik a –()exp ad0∞∫Ik-- == =At() kk λ+() a –[] AIta–() exp ad0∞∫=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press14C Estimates of Soil Organic Carbon Turnover 103A(a) = AI exp( −λa)( 1 2 )and the specific activity of the SO C fraction can be found by inserting Equation 12 into Equation 11(13)from which k can be isolated(14)The assumption of first-order kinetics means that the turnover time can be found as τ = k−1; there-fore, if the activity of the input s is assumed to be equal to Aabs, then(15)In most applications of bomb 14C models, the 14C is essentially used as a non-radioactive tracer forestimating turnover on relatively short time s cales. However, due to the radioactive decay of 14C,these equations can also be used to estimate dy namic parameters of SOC fractions with turnovertimes that are much longer. However, since the 14C content of the atmosphere has not been constant,the use of the bomb 14C model on SOC fractions of slow  turnover requires that the 14C recordextends several thousand years back, which is much  longer than has usually been used in applica-tions of the bomb 14C model.Construction of an Atmospheric 14C RecordWe used the data of Stuiver et al. (1 998) to construct a yearly atmospheric 14C record for theNorthern Hemisphere by cubic spline interpolation of ∆14C values for the period 22,050 BC toAD 1955. For the years between 1 955 and 1959, we calculated the average of the values observedfor each year in organic materials by Tauber  (1967), V ogel (1970), Baxter and Walton (1971),Barrette et al. (1980), Burchuladze et al. (1989), Olsson and Possnert (1992), and Goodsite et al.(2001). For 1959 until 1996, we used the average summer (May to September) atmospheric ∆14Cvalues observed by Levin et al. (1985) and Levi n and Kromer (1997) for central Europe. To extendthe record beyond 1996 , we extrapolated the ∆14C observations from 1975 to 1996 by anexponential model [ ∆14C = 375 exp( −0.0621 Y)] where Y is years after 1975). The resulting complete14C record is shown in Figure 1.Comparison of Turnover Estima tes by 3 Different MethodsThus, there are 3 different methods that can be us ed to calculate turnover times of SOC fractionsbased on 14C measurements: 1) the conventional 14C dating model using Equation 3; 2) the numeri-cal solution of the bomb 14C equation, by solving for k in Equation 11; and 3) the analytical solutionof the bomb 14C equation, Equation 15.To compare these different methods, we used all 3 methods to calculate the turnover time corre-sponding to values of the sp ecific activities of a theoreti cal sample taken in 2002.Ak AI kλ+() a –[]exp ad0∞∫AIkkλ+------------ ==kAλAIA–--------------=τAabs A–Aλ------------------- - =https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press104 S Bruun et al.Assessment of the Uncertainties of the Numerical Bomb 14C ModelTo determine the uncertainties associated with the assumptions of the nu merical solution of thebomb 14C equation (Equation 11), we used Monte Carlo simulations. We tested the uncertaintiesintroduced by the assumption of constant in puts and the use of regional data for the 14C content ofthe specific activity of the inputs  entering the SOC fraction. We used 10 different random input his-tories generated by drawing random numbers from a distribution with an interannual variation sim-ilar to that observed in natural ecosystems. Knapp and Smith (2001) observed that the coeffi cient of variation (CV) of the interannual netprimary production ranged from 3% to 33% for diff erent natural ecosystems, with a mean value of20.4%. Thus, the standardized input histories were generated by drawing random numbers from anormal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.204.The uncertainty of the 14C content of the inputs was assessed by  compiling data from a range of dif-ferent sources reporting 14C content of different plant-derived materials of known age (Figure 2a).The atmosphere is not completely mixed, and ther efore an offset exists between the 2 hemispheres.Furthermore, low and very high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere also seem to deviate some-what from the mid-latitudes (Dai and Fan 1986; Kr omer et al. 2001). Thus, only samples from sitesbetween 30°N and 60°N were selected. The values  from Baxter and Walton (1971) were originallyincluded in the analysis, but they exhibited considerably more variatio n than the rest of the data andwere therefore excluded.Figure 1 Record of ∆14C values used in the models to calculat e turnover of SOC fractions.

The standard deviation around the ∆14Cvalue in the jth age group was calculated as (16)where is the difference between the ∆14C value of the ith sample and the record of the sameyear and nj is the number of samples in the jth age group. The estimated standard deviation in thedifferent age groups is shown in Table 1.The differences between the ∆14C value of the sample and of the constructed 14C record ( )are shown in Figure 2b. The variat ion around the values in the record  appears to be random, but it isalso evident that the values measured at some si tes are systematically higher than at others. Thisindicates that specific sites may deviate systematically from the 14C record. Based on the estimatedvariation, we constructed 10 different ∆14C activity histories in 2 different ways, one representingrandom deviations and one representi ng systematic deviations from the 14C record. The random∆14C histories were generated by drawing 10 ra ndom numbers for each year from a standardizednormal distribution (i.e. µ = 0 and σ = 1). These values were multip lied by the standard deviation,σj, in Table 1 to obtain a deviation from the 14C record for the year in question. The obtaineddeviation was added to the ∆14C value in the 14C record to obtain a ∆14C value for the input that year.The systematic ∆14C histories were generated by drawing 10 random numbers from a standardizednormal distribution, one for each activity histor y. This value was multiplied by the standarddeviation, σj, in Table 1 and again added to the ∆14C value in the 14C record to obtain a ∆14C valuefor the input of the year in question.By combining the input histories with the activity hi stories, we obtained 2 sets of 10 input/activityhistories: 1) 10 input/activity histories with random  variation in size of the inputs and random vari-ation in the ∆14C values, and 2) 10 input/activity histories with random variation in the size of theTable 1 Standard deviation of organic mate rials (Figure 2) in age groups around the ∆14Cvalues from the 14C record (Figure 1).

Realistic input/activit y histories will probably liesomewhere between these two extremes. The 2 sets of input/activity histories were used to test the variation in turn over estimates by MonteCarlo simulation, using Equation 8 to calculate the decay rate constant, k, for each input/activity his-tory in the 2 sets. This was done for a range of different specific activities of a theoretical SOC frac-tion in order to determine the relationship between the measured activity of a SOC fraction and thevariation in the estimates of k.RESULTSComparison of Different MethodsThe results of the comparison of the different me thods for estimating the turnover of SOC fractionsare shown in Figure 3. Evidently, the invalid assumptions of the conventional 14C method cause it toproduce results that do not agree with the other methods. The analytical solution of the bomb 14C isexpected to result in better turn over estimates for all values of the specific activity and is just as easyto calculate. As the analytical solution to the bomb 14C equation encompasses one simplifyingassumption more than the num erical solution (constant 14C content of inputs), the numerical solu-tion is expected to be better than the analytical so lution. However, as seen in  Figure 3, the analyticalsolution produces results that are relatively clos e to the numerical solution for SOC samples of slowturnover. Because the 14C record long back in time shows ∆14C values considerably larger than 0‰(which is the value corresponding to  an input with sp ecific activity of Aabs), the analytical solutiondoes not approach the numerical wh en the turnover time becomes very slow. Of course, the analyt-ical method could be improved by using better values than Aabs for the pre-bomb atmospheric 14Cactivity. However, as this value varies in time, these corrections seem to o troublesome compared tofinding the numerical solution. This means that the analytical solution can be used when the turn-over time of the SOC fraction is sufficiently lo ng and the required precision is not very high.Uncertainties of Estimates by the Bomb 14C Equation Figure 4 shows the relationship between the turnov er time and the specific activity of the theoreticalsamples of 2002. In each figure, there are 10 lines, each correspond ing to a different input/activityhistory. Each of the 10 lines in the figures can be  thought of as a possible outcome within the varia-tion in the size of the input and its 14C content. Evidently, the differences between the activities ofSOC fractions of the 10 input/activity histories ar e much more extensive in the case of systematicvariation than in cases with random variation in the 14C content. In addition, as the bomb peak has2 flanks, certain values of the specific ac tivity can correspond to 2 turnover times.In Figure 5a, the relationship between the averag e estimated turnover time and the coefficient ofvariation (CV) of the estimated turnover time is given for the samples taken in 1964, 1966, 1983,and 2002 for the input/activity hi stories with random variation in 14C content. The coefficient ofvariation is less than 16%, which is acceptable co mpared with the uncertainties arising as a conse-quence of model assumptions, such as the first- order decay of SOC fractions. The uncertainties arequite small over the whole range of turnover times,  but are larger for short turnover times than forlong.The results of the random input histories with systematic variation in ∆14C values showed muchmore variability, with CVs larger than 50% for SO C fractions with turnover times smaller than 15 yr(Figure 5b). However, the estimates are quite reliable  even in the case of systematic variation in thehttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press108 S Bruun et al.activity history between the years, as long as the SOC fraction is not turning over too fast. For exam-ple, the relative uncertainty is smaller than 30% if the turnover time of the SOC fraction is longerthan 30 yr, and smaller than 15% when th e turnover time is longer than 100 yr.DISCUSSIONOur analysis helps to clarify the consequences of  the assumptions underlying the different methodsused to estimate kinetic parameters of SOC fractions based on 14C measurements. The conventional14C dating model effectively assumes that all the car bon in the SOC fraction is of the same age. AsSOC fractions contain carbon that has entered the so il continuously over a long period, this is aquestionable assumption. Therefore, the method shoul d only be used in special situations (e.g. thelayers of peat soils).The bomb 14C equation is based on a number of assumptions . First of all, it is assumed that the soilhas reached equilibrium between d ecomposition and inputs. This mean s that only soils fairly closeto equilibrium can be used. The requirement for lo ng periods without changes in climate and vege-tational composition may mean that the analysis can only be carried  out for soils with native vege-tation. Furthermore, because SOC fr actions of slow turnover need a long time to reach equilibrium,very slow or inert fractions may be impossible to analyze. The assump tion of equilibrium alsorequires that the inputs are constant and that the 14C content of the inputs are known. However, weallow variations in inputs and deviations from the 14C record as long as these errors average out andtherefore do not significantly influe nce the estimates. Hsieh (1993) showed that large random vari-ation in the inputs influenced estimates of SOC tu rnover only marginally. We also found only mar-ginal changes in SOC turnover estimates as a result of the variation of the inputs alone (results notshown here). However, variation in the 14C content had a more critical influence on the estimates.Most applications of bomb 14C models combine ∆14C values from atmospheric measurements andmeasurements of organic materials to construct a 14C record with supposedly representative valuesfor the hemisphere in question. Our results show th at the uncertainties of the estimates are still quiteFigure 3 Relationship between the 3 different method s of estimating turnover of SOC fractions: conventional14C dating (Equation 3), nume rical solution of the bomb 14C equation by solving for k in Equation 11, and theanalytical solution of the bomb 14C equation (Equation 15). https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200052231  Published online by Cambridge University Press14C Estimates of Soil Organic Carbon Turnover 109small if the variation of 14C content around the value in the record can be assumed to be random.However, as the SOC sample has received inputs fro m vegetation at the same site all the time, the14C content is likely to be offset from the record in  a systematic way. In ou r assessment of the vari-ability, we even limited the organic materials to la titudes between 30°N to 60°N. If systematic devi-ations from the record occur, th is could influence the estimates of SOC fraction turnover consider-ably. Thus, the estimates for fast SOC fractions can be uncertain depending on the reliability of the14C record. If we wish to estimate turnov er of fast SOC fractions, values of 14C content of materialsfrom sites closer to the site of sampling should be sought. Furthermore, the estimates of turnovertimes based on these methods should always be accompanied by an error estimate made by MonteCarlo simulations, based on the uncertainty of the 14C record for the sampling site. Most applications of bomb 14C models use a 14C record covering only the bomb 14C pulse andthereby assume the ∆14C value of the inputs before the pulse is 0‰. However, the record from the14C calibrations shows that this is invalid. We argue that in order to estimate turnover of SOC frac-tions of slow turnover, the 14C record has to be extended backwards at least 3 or 4 times longer thanFigure 4 Uncertainties of estima tes of the turnover time ( τ) caused by random variationin the inputs, and a) random variatio n, and b) systematic variation in 14C content fromyear to year.

Since this ex tended record is used to estimate SOC fractions ofslow turnover where the precision of the method is quite high even in the f ace of systematic errors,the record from the 14C calibrations can quite safely  be used to estimate SOC fractions of slow turn-over from everywhere in the world.Another assumption of the bomb 14C models is that the SOC fracti ons decay by first-order kinetics.If SOC fractions are uniform with respect to chem ical composition and physical protection, theyshould have a more uniform decomposition rate, wh ich will enable their description by first-orderkinetics. Therefore, researchers have endeavored to  isolate organic matter pools consisting of rela-tively homogeneous material (Trumbore and Zhen g 1996; Magid et al. 199 6; Sohi et al. 2001).Thus, the application of the theory presented here de pends on our ability to ob tain fractions that aredescribed well by first-order kinetics. The bomb 14C model also assumes that no isotopic fractio nation occurs during the decay of organicmatter. This is of concern because SOC gradua lly becomes enriched with the stable isotope 13C dur-ing decomposition (Balesdent et al. 1993; Bale sdent and Mariotti 1996). Balesdent and Mariotti(1996) and Ehleringer et al. (2000) review ed different hypotheses explaining the 13C enrichmentduring decomposition but were unable to determine their relative importance. As long as the mech-anistic basis of the enrichment has not been eluc idated, the hypotheses cannot be included in ourmodels. However, the increase in δ13C values is usually less than 4‰ (Balesdent and Mariotti 1996).If all of this enrichment is ascrib ed to fractionation, this means an  additional fractionation for theheavier 14C isotopes of less than 8‰, which is very sm all and on the order of the measurement error.CONCLUSIONSCompared to the numerical  solution of the bomb 14C equation, which is assumed to be the bestaccording to the underlying assumptio ns, the analytical solution is much easier to apply and can beused to obtain results that are sufficiently clos e to the numerical solution when the SOC fractionsanalyzed turn over relatively slowly. The uncertain ty of the estimates of the numerical solution ofthe bomb 14C equation is large for SOC fractions with fa st turnover due to the uncertainty of the 14Crecord of litter input at the sampling site, wher eas it appears to be neg ligible when SOC factionsturning over relatively slowly are analyzed. For example, the relative uncertainty is smaller than30% if the turnover time of the SOC fraction is longer than 30 yr, and smaller than 15% when theturnover time is longer than 100 yr.REFERENCESAgnelli A, Trumbore SE, Cor ti G, Ugolini FC. 2002.
