We quantitatively investigated crop yield sustainability through soil fertility andnutrients balance in 34-years long-term experiment under double rice cropping system in acidic paddy soil.Seven treatments were studied: CK (no fertilization); NPK (Chemical nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fer-tilizer); NPM (Chemical N, P and manure); NKM (Chemical N, K and manure); PKM (Chemical P, K and manure);NPKM (Chemical N, P, K and manure) and M (Manure). Manure was applied at the rate of 45,000 kg ha−1.Results showed that crop yield and sustainability yield index under combined application of manure and che-mical fertilizers was signi ﬁcantly higher than chemical fertilization and highest crop yield was under NPKMtreatment. Long-term combined manure and chemical fertilization improved soil fertility as compared to CK andNPK treatments. Soil organic C sequestration rates under NPM, NKM, PKM and NPKM treatments were in-creased, while decreased under CK and NPK over the fertilization years. The uptake of N, P and K was increasedover the fertilization years in all the treatments that received manure, compared with CK and NPK. Apparent Kbalance was negative in all the treatments. N balance (except CK and NPKM) and P balance (except CK) waspositive in all fertilization treatments. P balance was exceeded the environmental risk threshold under combinedapplication of chemical P fertilizer and manure. Boosted regression tree indicated that soil available N (AN),orgnaic carbon (OC) and total N (TN) were the most in ﬂuencing factors of crop yield, accounted 36.5 %, 17.8 %,13.4 % of variations of relative yield, respectively. Path analysis showed that long-term fertilizer inputs in-creased soil nutrient contents and C input directly a ﬀected soil OC. C input and soil pH indirectly inﬂ uenced therelative crop yield. This study concluded that long-term combined application of manure and inorganic ferti-lizers increased crop yield sustainability, organic carbon sequestration rate compared to the inorganic fertili-zation. But long-term combined application of manure and inorganic phosphorus fertilizer increased the Pbalance. Therefore, rate of P inputs should be reduced under combined application of manure and inorganic Pfertilizers in acidic paddy soil.1. IntroductionSustainable crop production in China as well as in the world isneeded to feed the ever-growing world population. Improvement in theﬁeld managing technologies has accounted a signi ﬁcant contribution toincrease the crop productivity ( Deryng et al., 2011 ;Doltra et al., 2019).In China, during 1970– 1990 the annual rice production was increasedby 3.37 % ( FAO, 2008 ), mostly due to the cultivation of high yieldingvarieties and high consumption of chemical fertilizers ( Tong et al.,2003 ;Yuan, 1996 ). However, yield growth rate was dropped by 0.6 %https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104569Received 18 June 2019; Received in revised form 12 December 2019; Accepted 27 December 2019⁎Corresponding authors at: National Engineering Laboratory for Improving Quality of Arable Land, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.E-mail addresses: gaojusheng@caas.cn (G.

This might be further chal-lenged by changes in global climate ( Lobell and Asner, 2003 ;Penget al., 2004) and scarcity of water resources ( Van Nguyen and Ferrero,2006 ). The fertilization approach is one of the best ﬁeld managementpractices to achieve high crop yield. Chen et al. (2014) from 153 ﬁeldstudies found that manure addition increased crop yield by 8.5to14.2 Mg ha−1without increasing N input. In another study, based on20 diﬀerentﬁeld trials, Hijbeek et al. (2017) found that inorganic fer-tilization increased the yield of crop by 2.0 Mg ha−1and yield did notincrease signi ﬁcantly by manure application. It is clear that the me-chanism of the yield response to di ﬀerent types of fertilization is notconsistent. Therefore, to achieve sustainable and high yield of crop, it isessential to know the in ﬂuence of long-term fertilization on crop pro-ductivity. Fertilizers application e ﬀects crop yield by changing soilchemical properties, such as soil pH and nutrient contents and C inputs.Soil organic carbon (OC) content is one of the main indexes of soilfertility ( Hijbeek et al., 2017 ). The sequestration of soil OC could beincreased by the application of di ﬀerent fertilizers which provides highcarbon inputs, such as manure application or incorporation of cropresidue ( Cai et al., 2015 ).Benbi and Chand (2007) have shown thateach Mg of OC in the soil layer (0 −15 cm) increased wheat pro-ductivity by 15− 33 kg ha−1under long-term organic fertilization.There is thus a strong need to increase OC density for sustainable cropproductivity. In another study, compared with the winter fallow, thegreen manure rotation under double cropping system increased the OCstock up to 24 % ( Yao et al., 2017 ).McDaniel et al. (2014) in theirstudy, found that cover crops signi ﬁcantly increased rate of OC se-questration as compared to no cover crops. Chemical fertilizers alsoinﬂuence the OC sequestration by returning residues of crop to ﬁeldsuch as roots and stubbles residues. For example, Zhang et al. (2012)found that inorganic fertilizers increased carbon inputs by 2.5 to 5.0 Mgha−1in southern China. Only the few studies have investigated theeﬀect of combined organic and inorganic fertilization on organic Csequestration and sustainable crop production. For example, Wanget al. (2019) has observed the high crop yield and organic C accumu-lation in soil under combined application of inorganic fertilizer andmnaure, compared to the alone application of orgnaic or inorganicfertilizer. However, the mechanism by which di ﬀerent fertilizers ap-plication in ﬂuence the crop yield by changing soil OC is not clear. Soilnutrients are main factors limiting crop yield, therefore, high crop yieldmainly depends on fertilizer (organic and/or inorganic fertilizers) ap-plication rates. Though, lower than half amount of total inputs fromchemical fertilizers e ﬃciently used and did not show surplus nutrientaccumulation in soil ( Galloway et al., 2008 ). Meanwhile, excessive useof chemical fertilizers not only increase the air and water pollution ( Luand Tian, 2013 ;Peñuelas et al., 2012 ), but also degrade the soil qualitysuch as acidi ﬁcation ( Lin et al., 2014).Acidiﬁcation of paddy soils has received signi ﬁcant attention due toits negative e ﬀects on soil fertility and crop production ( Cai et al., 2015;Guo et al., 2010 ). One of the main reasons of soil acidity is the excessiverates of chemical fertilizer application ( Zhu et al., 2018 ). However,China has achieved huge progress in attaining higher crop production,but most of the agricultural lands are still being a ﬀected by substantialacidiﬁcation since 1980s ( Guo et al., 2010 ). Nitri ﬁcation process in soilcan produce protons which may decrease soil pH ( Xu et al., 2006).Addition of manure to the agricultural soil can improve not only soil OCcontent but also can provide essential nutrients for plant uptake. Ap-plication of manure to the cropland can reduce the soil acidity by im-proving soil pH due to alkalinity of manure ( Mi et al., 2018 ;Rukshanaet al., 2013 ). Furthermore, after many years of manure application, itsresidual e ﬀects were observable, leading to availability of di ﬀerentnutrients for uptake by crop ( Demelash et al., 2014 ).The subtropical region of China is dominant with paddy soil underrice cultivation, playing a major role in national grain production ( Hui-min et al., 2009 ). However, soil acidi ﬁcation is a major problem thatlimit the soil fertility and sustainable crop production in that region(Cai et al., 2015). Therefore, we hypothesized that combined applica-tion of manure and inorganic fertilizer could be more e ﬀective fertili-zation practice to increase the yield sustainability and to reduce surplusnutrient accumulation in soil, compared to the inorganic fertilizationalone in acidic paddy soil. The speci ﬁc objectives of this study were toinvestigate the e ﬀects of diﬀerent combination of organic and inorganicFig. 1.

Site descriptionA long-term ﬁeld experiment was established at the national ob-servation and research station of farmland ecosystem (26°45 ′42″N,111°52 ′32″E) in south of China ( Fig. 1). This region obtains annualrainfall of 1290 mm and average temperature 17.8 °C. The rain fallduration is from April to end of June. The mean annual temperature(MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) during the experimentperiod is given in Fig. 2 The climate data (i.e., MAT and MAP) werecollected from county weather station, which was situated at less than8 km away from the experiental site, where weather data of dry- andwet-bulb temperature, minimum and maximum air temperature, andprecipitation were recorded daily at 0800 following the NationalStandard of Speci ﬁcations for Surface Meteorological Observations(1979). The soil type is Ferralic cambisol according to World ReferenceBase for soil resources (WRB) ( FAO, 2014 ) and also known as red soilaccording to Chinese soil classi ﬁcation ( Baxter, 2007 ). The initialproperties of topsoil were as follow: soil pH of 5.2; total N (TN) of 1.1 gkg−1; total P (TP) of 0.47 g kg−1; total K (TK) of 17 g kg−1; available N(AN) of 82 mg kg−1; available P (AP) of 4.7 mg kg−1; available K (AK)of 55 mg kg−1and soil organic carbon (OC) of 12.0 g kg−1.2.2. Experimental designThe study was designed with di ﬀerent organic and inorganic ferti-lization treatments. We selected seven treatments in this study(Table 1): (1) CK (no fertilizer); (2) NPK (inorganic nitrogen, phos-phorus and potassium fertilizer); (3) NPM (inorganic NP fertilizer andmanure); (4) NKM (inorganic NK fertilizer and manure); (5) PKM (in-organic PK fertilizer and manure); (6) NPKM (inorganic NPK fertilizerand manure) and (7) M (manure). The CK treatment was started from2001 while all the other treatments were randomly designed in 1982.Rate of manure application was same in all treatments receivingmanure ( Table 1). Each plot (1.8 m × 15.0 m) had three replications,which were separated from adjacent plot by 60-cm cemented barriers.Inorganic fertilizers were applied in the form of urea for N, calciumsuperphosphate for P and potassium chloride for K. Manure was freshcattle manure contained water content about 20 %. The average nu-trient contents of manure were; 400 g kg−1of carbon, 3.2 g kg−1of N,1.09 g kg−1of P and1.24 g kg−1of K. All the inorganic fertilizers andmanure were applied as basal application, before rice transplantation.Annual input rates of manure and inorganic fertilizers are given inTable 1 .2.3. Crop management and soil samplingThe cropping system was rice-rice rotation system. The experi-mental ﬁeld was disposed of for three years to con ﬁrm the same soilproperties. Extensive locally used rice varieties were selected for cul-tivation with transplanting 200,000 seedlings per hectare. The earlyrice was transplanted in end of April and harvested in July, while laterice was transplanted in end of July and harvested in October.Conventional management practices such as ploughing and raking ﬁeldat the depth of 15− 20 cm, intermittent irrigation and use of pesticidefor pest control were carried out following the farmer practices. Theearly rice was kept ﬂooding, and ﬁeld was drained at the ripening stageof late rice ( Yang et al., 2012 ;Zhang et al., 2017). Crop was manuallyharvested; stubbles and roots were remained in the ﬁeld. After the cropharvest, the straw and grain yields were air-dried and weighted. Soilsamples from the topsoil (0 −20 cm) were taken at ﬁve diﬀerent pointsof each replicated plot every year once within ﬁrst week after the laterice crop was harvested. Then, samples from each plot were thoroughlymixed to make homogeneous composite sample of each replication, air-dried and transferred to laboratory for analysis in clean polythene bags.Soil bulk density was estimated once in 2013 in undisturbed soil sam-ples, that were collected with cutting ring of 50.46-mm inner diameter,100 cm3volume and 50-mm depth of soil sampling ( Lu, 2000).2.4. Laboratory analysisAfter the crop harvest and air-dried, grain and straw samples wereoven-dried for 30 min at 105 °C then heated at 70 °C to a constantweight for determination of dry matter and nutrient contents. Oven-dried straw and grains were ground and digested with H 2SO4-H2O2at260–270 °C. The plant N and P contents were measured according tosemi micro Kjeldahl digestion and the vanadomolybdate yellowmethod, respectively ( Jackson, 1969 ;Nelson and Sommers, 1982).While K content in the plant was determined using ﬂame photometer.Nutrients uptake in plant were estimated by multiplying plant nutrientcontent with yield. To determine the chemical properties of soil, a partFig. 2.

Qaswar, et al.Soil & Tillage Research 198 (2020) 1045693from composite samples, subset of soil samples were crushed to passthrough 0.25-mm sieve. Soil OC was measured by oxidation methodusing vitriol acid potassium dichromate oxidation ( Pages et al., 1982 ).Soil total N, P and K contents were determined by procedures describedbyBlack (1965) ;Murphy and Riley (1964) andKnudsen et al. (1982)respectively. Soil available N, P and K were measured in accordancewith Lu et al., (2000), Olsen (1954) and Page et al., (1982), respec-tively.2.5. CalculationsSustainable yield index (SYI) is quantitative measure to assess thesustainability of agricultural practices ( Singh et al., 1990 ). Yield sus-tainability index was estimated using following equation ( Singh et al.,1990 ):=−SYIYmean σYmaxSustainable yield index ( )Where Y mean is mean yield of a treatment, σis treatment standard de-viation, and Y maxis maximum yield in the experiment over the years foreach treatment.Apparent nutrient balance is deﬁ ned as the di ﬀerence betweennutrient inputs entering the farming system and nutrient output leavingthe farming system ( OECD, 2013 ). Apparent nutrient balance (AB) (Kgha−1year−1) was measured using the following equation ( Ouyanget al., 2017):∑∑=− Apparentnutrientbalance N N input uptakewhere, N input is annual N, P or K input (kg ha−1year−1) to the ﬁeldthrough organic and inorganic fertilization. N uptake is N, P or K uptake(kg ha−1) by crop in above-ground biomass. The positive value of ABindicates the nutrient surplus and negative value of AB (nutrient de ﬁcit)indicates declining soil fertility ( OECD, 2013).The amount of total C input included returned manure plus plantresidues. The annual C input (C input, t ha−1) was measured from the Ccontent of belowground biomass (C root,th a−1), incorporated stubble(Cstubble ,th a−1) and the amount of applied manure (C manure ,th a−1).=+ +Cinput C C C bellowground stubble manur e=××−CR r CR10 bellowground3=××−CS R C s 10 stubble3Rr Residue of roots (t ha−1year−1) estimated as 30 % of above-ground rice biomass ( Kundu et al., 2007 ). CR is carbon content in riceplant (418 g kg−1). SR is stubble quantity of rice ﬁeld (t ha−1year−1)estimated as 5.6 % of rice straw yield ( Jing et al., 2015 ). Cs is carboncontent of rice straw (444 g kg−1).We estimated the annual organic carbon stocks (t ha−1year−1)using following equation:=× ××−SOC C BD H 101where, SOC is stock of OC (t ha−1year−1), C is soil C content (g kg−1),BD is soil bulk density (g cm−3) and H is soil depth (cm).Soil organic carbon sequestration rate (CSR, t ha−1year−1) wascalculated by following equation ( Zhang et al., 2012 ):=−CSR SOC SOC t () /T 0Where, SOC tand SOC 0is stock of OC (t ha−1) at the time t and in theinitial year (1982),respectively. t was duration of experiment(34 years).The relative yield (RY) was calculated for use in yield predictionthrough boosted regression tree model (BRT). Relative yield allow theyield data from individual treatment to be more comparable. The re-lative yield (RY) was estimated as follow:=−RYY Ytreatment controlWhere, Y treatment is the yield of fertilizer treatment (t ha−1) in a speci ﬁcyear and Y control is the yield (t ha−1) of control treatment in same year.2.6. Statistical analysisThe di ﬀerences among fertilization treatments for di ﬀerent para-meters were analyzed (1982 –2000; 2001 –2010 and 2011 –2016) byone-way ANOVA followed by Tukey ’s HSD test at P = 0.05 level ofsigniﬁcance using the software SPSS 19.0. The trends of change in soilOC content under di ﬀerent treatments were examined by simple linearregression. Boosted regression tree (BRT) model was conducted usingthe recommended indexes ( Elith et al., 2008 ) to predict the relativecrop yield by relative in ﬂuence of soil properties. The BRT was con-structed using gbm package in R version 3.3.3 ( Elith et al., 2008 ). Thestructural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the direct andindirect relationship between relative yield and soil fertility parametersusing Amos package. In SEM analysis, we used annual estimated Cinput, annual N,P and K inputs as exogenous variables. While, soil OC,pH, AN, AP, AK and relative yield used as endogenous variables. Thelong-term data from 1982 to 2016 was used for BRT and SEM analysis.3. Results3.1. Crop yields and sustainability yield indexLong-term di ﬀerent fertilization signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced the cropyield ( Fig. 3 andTable 2), which decreased in CK and NPK and in-creased in NPM, NKM, PKM, NPKM and M by increasing the fertiliza-tion periods ( Table 2). Among all the treatments, annual grain yieldduring di ﬀerent fertilization periods (1982 –2000. 2001 –2010 and2011 –2016) was highest in NPKM and was lowest in CK treatment(Table 2). Compared with 1982– 2000 period, the increase in annualgrain yield during period of 2011 –2016 in NPM, NKM, PKM and NPKMwas by 7.2 %, 9.6 %, 7.3 %, 7.5 % and 2.4 %, respectively andFig. 3. Early rice (a) and late rice (b) yield under various fertilization treat-ments of a long-term experiment in double rice cropping system.M. Qaswar, et al. Soil & Tillage Research 198 (2020) 1045694decreased in NPK by 3.2 %. Compared with 1982 –2000, the annualgrain yield during the period of 2001 –2010 was decreased in NPK andM treatment and was signi ﬁcantly increased in NPKM treatment.Compared with chemical fertilization, combined application of manureand chemical fertilizers increased sustainability yield index (SYI) forboth early and late rice (except NKM in late rice) ( Table 3). For bothearly and late rice SYI in CK was highest among all the fertilizationtreatments. SYI in early rice increased with NPM, NKM, PKM and NPKMby 10 %, 6.9 %, 4.3 % and 10 %, respectively and decreased by1.2 %with M treatment compared with NPK. SYI in late rice increased withNPM, PKM, NPKM and M by 7.3 %, 0.6 %, 6.1 % and 6.6 %, respec-tively and decreased with NKM by 0.01 % compared with NPK. Overall,the early rice yield was more sustainable compared with late rice crop.3.2. Nutrients uptake and apparent balancesNutrients uptake and apparent nutrients balance are shown inTable 2. Increasing the nutrient inputs by combined application ofmanure and chemical fertilizers, signi ﬁcantly increased nutrients up-take compared with chemical fertilization. Among all the fertilizationtreatments, highest uptake of N, P and K was under NPKM and lowestuptake was in CK during di ﬀerent fertilization periods. Compared withfertilization period of 1982 –2000, the uptake of N decreased in NPK,NPM, PKM and M treatment and increased in NPKM treatment duringperiod of 2001– 2010. P uptake decreased in all the treatments duringperiod of 2001 –2010, compared to period of 1982 –2000 and thehighest decrease was observed under NPK. K uptake during 2001 –2010increased in all the treatments compared with the period of 1982 –2000.The uptake of N, P and K during fertilization period of 2010 –2016 in alltreatments was greater than period of 1982 –2000.During all three fertilization periods, the annual apparent N balancewas ranged from −118 kg ha−1year−1in NPKM to 174 kg ha−1year−1in NKM and P balance was ranged from −12 kg ha−1year−1in CK to66 kg ha−1year−1in PKM. K balance in all the treatments was negativeduring all the three cropping periods. K balance was ranged from−300 kg ha−1year−1in NPKM to −36 kg ha−1year−1in CK. N, P andK balance in CK treatment was increased with the increase in fertili-zation period. Compared with 1982 –2000 period, N and P balanceduring 2001– 2010increased in all treatments except N balance in NKMand NPKM. N balance in NKM did not change and decreased in NPKMduring 2001 –2010 compared with 1982– 2000 period. During theperiod of 2010 –2016, N balance in NPM, NKM, PKM, NPKM and Mtreatments and P balance in NKM, PKM, NPKM and M treatments de-creased compared with 1982 –2000 period. K balance in all the treat-ments except CK decreased during period of 2001– 2010 and2011 –2016, compared to 1982– 2000 period.3.3. Changes in soil nutrients and organic carbon sequestration rate (CSR)Long-term fertilization signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced soil pH, nutrientsand organic carbon sequestration rate (CSR). During all three fertili-zation periods, the soil pH ranged from 4.6 in NPK to 6.5 in PKM(Table 4). Soil pH decreased under NPK but increased in NKM, PKM andM treatments during the period of 1982 –2000, compared to the initialsoil pH (5.2). During the period of 2001– 2010 and 2011 –2016, soil pHin all the treatments receiving manure was higher than initial soil pH.Soil pH in all treatments except NPK during 2001 –2010 and 2011 –2016was higher than soil pH during 1982 –2000. Soil pH under NPK de-creased by the increase of fertilization period. Soil TN, AN, TP, AP, TKand AK contents during all three fertilization periods were signi ﬁcantlyhigher than their initial values in all the treatments except CK ( Table 4).Soil AN content was lower but TP and AP contents were higher in CKduring periods of 2001 –2010 and 2011 –2016 compared with theirTable 2Annual nutrients uptake, balance and crop yield in acidic paddy soil for the period of 1982 –2000, 2001 –2010, and 2011 –2016 under di ﬀerent fertilization of long-term experiment in double rice cropping system.Year Treatments NU(Kg ha−1)PU(Kg ha−1)KU(Kg ha−1)N balance(Kg ha−1year−1)P balance(Kg ha−1year−1)K balance(Kg ha−1year−1)GrainYield (t ha−1)1982 –2000 NPK 98 ± 1.7 e 33 ± 0.7 d 107 ± 3.6 e 47 ± 1.7 c 16 ± 0.7 d −51 ± 3.6 a 10.3 ± 0.06 eNPM 124 ± 0.8 b 41 ± 0.9 b 133 ± 2.7 d 166 ± 0.8 b 57 ± 0.9 b −77 ± 2.7 c 11.2 ± 0.07 bNKM 116 ± 1.1 c 34 ± 0.8 d 173 ± 2.6 b 174 ± 1.1 a 15 ± 0.8 d −61 ± 2.6 b 10.6 ± 0.02 cPKM 104 ± 2.0 d 37 ± 0.8 c 163 ± 1.6 c 41 ± 2.0 d 61 ± 0.8 a −51 ± 1.6 a 10.4 ± 0.08 dNPKM 358 ± 4.0 a 46 ± 0.7 a 219 ± 3.7 a −68 ± 4.0 e 52 ± 0.7 c −107 ± 3.7 d 11.7 ± 0.03 aM 99 ± 0.3 de 33 ± 0.2 d 125 ± 2.4 d 46 ± 0.3 cd 16 ± 0.2 d −69 ± 2.4 c 10 .2 ± 0.03 e2001 –2010 CK 42 ± 0.7 f 12 ± 0.1 f 40 ± 4.7 f −42 ± 0.7 e −12 ± 0.1 g −40 ± 4.7 a 6.1 ± 0.11 gNPK 78 ± 0.2 e 25 ± 0.8 e 129 ± 2.6 e 67 ± 0.2 c 24 ± 0.8 d −73 ± 2.6 b 9.1 ± 0.07 fNPM 123 ± 1.4 b 37 ± 0.3 b 207 ± 5.5 c 167 ± 1.4 b 61 ± 0.3 b −151 ± 5.5 e 11.0 ± 0.06 bNKM 116 ± 2.6 c 33 ± 0.6 c 236 ± 3.7 b 174 ± 2.6 a 16 ± 0.6 f −124 ± 3.7 d 10.5 ± 0.02 cPKM 96 ± 0.3 d 32 ± 0.8 c 213 ± 9.5 c 49 ± 0.3 d 66 ± 0.8 a −101 ± 9.5 c 9.7 ± 0.06 dNPKM 384 ± 5.2 a 45 ± 0.4 a 302 ± 9.8 a −94 ± 5.2 f 53 ± 0.4 c −190 ± 9.8 f 12 .0 ± 0.03 aM 93 ± 0.7 d 30 ± 0.4 d 177 ± 0.8 d 52 ± 0.7 d 19 ± 0.4 e −121 ± 0.8 d 9.5 ± 0.03 e2011 –2016 CK 32 ± 0.6 f 10 ± 0.1 f 36 ± 6.6 f −32 ± 0.6 e −10 ± 0.1 f −36 ± 6.6 a 5.1 ± 0.04 gNPK 81 ± 2.2 e 23 ± 1.2 e 177 ± 9.9 e 64 ± 2.2 c 26 ± 1.2 d −121 ± 9.9 b 9.9 ± 0.26 fNPM 134 ± 2.6 b 41 ± 0.3 b 281 ± 7.4 c 156 ± 2.6 b 57 ± 0.3 b −225 ± 7.4 d 12.0 ± 0.07 bNKM 122 ± 2.0 c 35 ± 0.3 d 314 ± 4.5 b 168 ± 2.0 a 14 ± 0.3 e −202 ± 4.5 cd 11.6 ± 0.02 cPKM 107 ± 3.0 d 38 ± 1.0 c 295 ± 11 bc 38 ± 3.0 d 60 ± 1.0 a −183 ± 11.4 c 11.2 ± 0.17 dNPKM 408 ± 9.0 a 48 ± 0.2 a 412 ± 11.9 a −118 ± 9.0 f 50 ± 0.2 c −300 ± 11.9 e 12.6 ± 0.04 aM 105 ± 2.2 d 34 ± 0.7 d 252 ± 15.1 d 40 ± 2.2 d 15 ± 0.7 e −196 ± 15.1 c 10.4 ± 0.12 eNote: Values are means (n = 3) ± standard deviations.

Combined application ofchemical fertilizers and manure signi ﬁcantly increased soil total andavailable nutrient contents compared with chemical fertilization.Among all treatments, AN, TP, AP, TK, AK contents were highest underNPKM treatment compared with all other fertilization treatmentsduring di ﬀerent fertilization periods. TN during 2001 –2010 was highestunder NPM treatment compared with all other treatments. Soil TN didnot show signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between NPM and M treatment, andbetween NKM and NPKM treatment during 1982– 2000. NKM, PKM andM during 2001 –2010 and NPM, NKM, NPM and M during period of2011 –216 did not show signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences for TN.

Mechanisms of relative yield in response to long-term fertilizationThe results of BRT analysis suggested that for acidic paddy soils, AN,OC and TN contents could be the most in ﬂuencing factors for relativeyield of the crop among eight di ﬀerent variables ( Fig. 6). The pathanalysis indicated that N, P and K inputs directly a ﬀected the AN, APand AK,respectively ( Fig. 7). Soil C input indirectly a ﬀected the relativeyield by directly a ﬀecting OC content. N input showed signi ﬁcant directeﬀect on soil pH and soil pH indirectly a ﬀected the relative yield bydirectly a ﬀecting soil P availability. AN also had a direct e ﬀect on APand AK and RY. While, AK had indirect e ﬀect on RY. The path analysisexplained 86 % of variance of relative yield (R2= 0.86).4. DiscussionIn our results, during the long-term experiment, grain yield de-creased in NPK treatment from 1982 to 2000 to 2001– 2010 and2011 –2016. Grain yield increased in NPM, NKM, PKM, NPKM and Mtreatments from 1982 to 2000 to 2011 –2016 period, while grain yieldof CK treatment was decreased over the years ( Table 2 andFig. 3).

Soil & Tillage Research 198 (2020) 1045698be due to continuous supply of reserve nutrients by addition of manureto the soil ( Cai et al., 2019). Therefore, combined application of manureand chemical fertilizers signi ﬁcantly increased sustainability yieldindex (SYI) for both early and late rice, compared with chemical fer-tilization alone ( Table 3). These results were consistent with the ﬁndingofChoudhary et al. (2018) for wheat-soybean rotation in the Indianmid-Himalayas, who observed that long-term chemical fertilizationdecreased the crop yield and SYI by due to soil acidity. In another study,Xie et al. (2016) observed that replacing chemical N with green manurein paddy soil increased the SYI under double rice cropping system. Thecrop yield could be sustained for many years after manure applicationceases, due to residual e ﬀect of manure ( Demelash et al., 2014 ). Inprevious studies positive residual e ﬀects on crop yield under di ﬀerentlong-term experiments ( Cai et al., 2018; Manna et al., 2005; Tirol-Padreet al., 2007; Xu et al., 2008 ) were also observed. One of the mainreasons for decreased crop yield under CK and NPK could be the soilacidiﬁcation, because continuous application of chemical fertilizersassists to degrade the soil quality by lowering soil pH ( Sarkar et al.,2018 ). In previous studies a high reduction of crop yield was observedunder chemical fertilization in paddy soils over the time ( Zhu et al.,2018 ).Cai et al. (2019) , also found that there was no yield increase dueto decreasing in soil pH after 12 years of chemical N fertilization. Theyield reduction in CK and NPK could also be attributed to low nutrientsuptake under CK and NPK compared with combined application ofmanure and chemical fertilizers ( Table 2). Imbalanced fertilizationmight have in ﬂuenced the nutrients uptake from soil, which may di-rectly a ﬀect the crop yield ( Zhang et al., 2010). In our results, K deﬁ -ciency was observed in all treatments in the form of negative K balance.Our results were consistent with Zhang et al. (2010) , who observednegative K balance under long-term chemical and manure fertilizationin rice-wheat and rice-rice based cropping systems. In the present study,K input was lower, compared with K uptake ( Table 1 and 2), whichresulted in negative K balance. In fact in paddy soils AK could be ﬁxedwith 2:1 type clay mineral which may create negative K balance. Im-balanced fertilization not only a ﬀects the crop yield but also could berisk of nutrient losses to the soil, water and air environment ( Das et al.,2014 ;Katzenberger et al., 2009 ;Sims et al., 2013 ). In our results,combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure increased N, Pand K uptake compared with NPK and CK ( Table 2), which were con-sistent with previous studies ( Hui-min et al., 2009). But due to excessivefertilization of N and P under combined application of manure andfertilizers, we observed positive N balance in all treatments except CKand NPKM and positive P balance in all the treatments except CK underdiﬀerent fertilization periods. The negative N balance under NPKMtreatment might be due to high crop yield which increased the N up-take, compared with N inputs. We applied chemical fertilizer N, P and Kwith manure which increased N uptake, it could be attributed to mutualnutrients interaction, which enhanced N uptake and created negative Nbalance ( Ågren, 2008 ;Prasad, 2009). Nutrients interaction and theirstoichiometry in soil a ﬀect the nutrient cycling in soil plant system(Delgado-baquerizo et al., 2013), which may in ﬂuence their uptake. Incontrast, the positive N balance in NPK, NPM, NKM, and M was due tolower uptake of N. The main reason could be imbalanced fertilization,which might decrease the N use e ﬃciency and decreased the N uptake.Diﬀerent studies reported that inappropriate fertilization decreased thenutrient use e ﬃciency (NUE) and increased nutrient balance and nu-trient loses ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Similarly, P balance in all the treat-ments except CK was positive, and we observed that under most of thetreatments under combined application of manure and chemical ferti-lizers increased P balance during di ﬀerent cropping periods above thethreshold level of 35 kg ha−1year−1P(Bai et al., 2013), therefore, riskof P pollution appears in this paddy ﬁeld. In previous studies, ( Bashkiniet al. (2002) in the Republic of Korea, estimated the N budget for1994 –1997 and observed that excessive nitrogen inputs from both or-ganic and inorganic fertilization caused surplus N accumulation inlandﬁlls and ground water. In another study, Hong et al. (2019) alsofound positive P balance under chemical fertilization in acidic paddysoil under double rice cropping system, but P balance in his study wasnot exceeding the risk of threshold level of P losses, reason could beparticularly lower P inputs rate compared to our study.Soil total and available nutrient contents and C input rates, undercombined application of chemical fertilizers and manure were muchhigher than NPK ( Table 4), which increased the organc C sequestrationrates and soil OC contents over the time ( Fig. 4). Tian et al. (2015) in ameta-analysis study reported that continuous manure application in-creased the soil OC content and sequestration rates by increasing cropyield and organic matter (OM) return from stubbles and roots.Majumder et al. (2007) observed the C input of 1.95 to 4.1 t ha−1,i nthe current study C input ranged 1.1 to 17.3 t ha−1year−1(Table 4),this high C inputs increased organic C sequestration rate and nutrientavailability over the time under combined application of manure andchemical fertilizers. Hijbeek et al. (2017) andCai et al. (2019) reportedthat C input increased the nutrient availability by improving soil phy-sical and chemical properties such as soil aeration, porosity and soil pH.Chemical fertilization increased soil acidi ﬁcation by decreasing soilpH. While, addition of manure combined with chemical fertilizersprevented soil acidi ﬁcation by improving soil pH ( Table 4). Many stu-dies reported the soil acidi ﬁcation by long-term chemical fertilization(Lin et al., 2014 ;Zhu et al., 2018). Plant generally release the net H+ions; on the other hand, when uptake of anions exceeds the cationsuptake, they release net excess of OH−or HCO 3-(Tang et al., 2011).Chemical N fertilization decreases the base cations in soil, which re-duces the soil pH. Moreover, in previous studies, it was observed thatchemical N application shifted the soil in to Al3+buﬀering stage. Alreleased in soil solution by hydrolysis of Al-hydroxides on the surface ofclay minerals at the soil pH below 5, which decrease the saturation ofbase cations, therefore increases the soil acidi ﬁcation ( Stevens et al.,2009 ). Alkalinity of manure neutralizes the protons in acidic soil andimproves the soil pH ( Rukshana et al., 2013 ). The alkaline nature ofmanure is mainly due to decarboxylation of organic anions and am-moniﬁ cation of organic N. However, nitri ﬁcation process can producethe protons to some degree, which can reduce soil pH ( Xu et al., 2006).As manure signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced the crop yield ( Fig. 6),the main rolein improving plant growth, by regulating the soil nutrient inputs, im-proving soil physical and biochemical properties ( Fließbach et al.,2007 ). Additionally, long-term manure application can also increasethe soil microbial biomass which provides better soil conditions for cropgrowth ( Peacock et al., 2001). Path analysis also indicated fertilizationinputs directly in ﬂuenced nutrients availability. Long-term C inputsindirectly a ﬀected the AN and RY by directly a ﬀecting OC. While, Ninput had direct e ﬀect on soil pH. Soil pH indirectly in ﬂuenced relativeyield by directly a ﬀecting AP ( Fig. 7). These results indicated that inacidic paddy soil, nutrient availability is regulated by soil OC and soilpH, which may limit or promote the crop growth. Moreover, thecombined application of manure and chemical fertilizers could be abetter fertilization management for regulating crop yield, but the ratesof N and P inputs should be reduced to prevent the nutrient losses in tosoil, air and water environment.5. ConclusionCombined application of manure and chemical fertilizers sig-niﬁcantly increased crop yield, SYI, soil nutrients availability and or-ganic carbon sequestration rate,compared with chemical fertilization.Soil available N, OC and total N were the main driving factors of cropyield under long-term combined application of manure and inorganicfertilization. Soil pH, which was directly a ﬀected by N input, showeddirect e ﬀect on AP and indirect e ﬀect on relative crop yield. While,long-term C input indirectly in ﬂuenced relative crop yield by directaﬀecting soil OC content.Furthermore, apparent P balance under combined application ofmanure and chemical fertilizer exceeded the environmental riskM.

Therefore, duing the long-term combined application ofmanure and inorganic fertilizer in acidic paddy soil, the rate of P inputshould be reduced to avoid surplus P accumulation in soil. While, ne-gative K balance indicates K deﬁ ciency of acidic paddy soil Therefore,combined application of inorganic and organic fertilizer is a betterapproach to enhance the crop yield sustainability but rate of P inputunder combined manure and inorganic fertilization should be reducedto save the fertilizer resources as well as to reduce the environmental Plosses.Declaration of Competing InterestAll authors con ﬁrmed that there is no con ﬂict of interest for thismanuscript.AcknowledgementsWe appreciate all the managers for the long-term experiment.
