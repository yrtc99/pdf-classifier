Reducing the carbon footprint andincreasing energy use ef ﬁciency are two important sustainability issues of the modern agriculture.Realizing the implications of energy and carbon use, the present study was conducted to compare pearlmilletemustard production system in conventional and conservation agriculture practices. The resultsshowed that zero tillage with 4 t ha/C01crop residue increased grain yield of pearl millet and mustard by22.3 and 24.5% respectively in comparison to conventional tillage without residue which ultimatelyhelped to maintain higher net returns (1270 US$ ha/C01). Mulching of crop residue consumed considerableenergy and carbon. It comprised 72.3 e87.1% of the total energy consumption. Thick residue cover(4 t ha/C01) noticed signi ﬁcantly higher energy output and energy intensiveness in both conventional andzero tillage whereas energy-use ef ﬁciency (11.5), net energy return (201,977 MJ ha/C01) and energy pro-ductivity (0.32 kg MJ/C01) was highest under no-residue cover. Carbon foot print value was increased withintensity of residue cover and found least under no-residue treatment. Therefore, crop residue should bejudiciously used in arid and semi-arid region where livestock mainly depends on it for their fodderrequirement.©2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionEnergy, economics, and the environment are mutually depen-dent [1]. There is a close relationship between agriculture andenergy. While agriculture uses energy, it also supplies it in the formof bio-energy [2]. At the present time, the productivity and prof-itability of crop production depend upon energy consumption. Theamount of energy used depends on the mechanization level,quantity of active agricultural work and cultivable land [2,3] . In allproduction systems, increasing the productivity ratio is a mainconcern. Energy input eoutput relationships in cropping systemsvary with the crops grown in a sequence, type of soils, type oftillage operations, nature and amount of organic manure andchemical fertilizers, plant protection measures, harvesting andthreshing operations, yield levels, and biomass production [4,5] .Modernization is, in general, tied with increasing inputs of energyand carbon in crop production. The energy and carbon use ef ﬁ-ciencies are declining [6]. As energy and carbon inputs in agricul-ture rapidly increased and accrued several bene ﬁts to farmers, atthe same time, these also adversely in ﬂuence the environment [7]by deteriorating water and land resources, contributing to globalwarming through increased GHGs emissions [8]. Increasing GHGsconcentration is causing weather ﬂuctuations which ultimatelyreducing agricultural productivity [9].Conventional agriculture has largely been characterized bytillage which leaves soil vulnerable to erosion [10]. The objectives oftillage include, soil loosening and levelling for seed bed prepara-tion, mixing fertilizer into soil, weed control, and crop residuemanagement [11]. Tillage helps to modify soil physical, chemicaland biological properties [12e14], which improves conditions forcrop growth by enhancing the availability of nutrients [15],resulting in higher crop yields [16]. Zero tillage (ZT) is the majorcomponent of conservation agriculture (CA), requires less fuelresulting in lower CO 2emissions, one of the gas responsible for*Corresponding author.

Crop yield potential with CA in rainfed sys-tems is often greater than with conventional tillage (CT) systems,particularly where sub-optimal rainfall limits crop yields [18]. Useof crop residue as mulch is a viable approach to retain soil moistureand nutrients under such situations because mulch is considered aspoor conductor of heat that effectively moderates soil temperature,maintains soil pro ﬁle moisture and increases soil fertility [13,19] .I nspite of these advantages, crop residue as mulch is not being usedby farmers as it has competing uses like fodder in rainfed areasbecause of dominance of livestock [20]. Further, costs are alsoinvolved in their application. Therefore, it is necessary that suitableamount should be applied to enhance crop productivity in a cost-effective manner.Pearl millet emustard has been most important cropping systemof arid and semi-arid regions of Indian sub-continent and Africa.Pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum L.) is a staple diet for the vastmajority of poor farmers and also forms an important fodder cropfor livestock population in arid and semi-arid regions of the globe[21]. From quality point of view, it is nutritionally better than manycereals, as it is a good source of iron, protein and fat [22]. This cropis mostly con ﬁned to low fertile water de ﬁcit soils. Because of itsremarkable ability to withstand and grow in harsh environment,reasonable and nearly assured harvests are obtained. Therefore, it isgetting more attention due to increasing evidence of erratic sea-sonal rainfall, terminal heat, and frequent occurrence of extremeweather events coupled with scanty water resources [23]. Mustard[Brassica juncea (L.) Czern and Coss.] is an important oilseed crop,cultivated for edible oil but used as condiments, spices, leafyvegetable and as fodder for livestock. Generally mustard cultivationis dependent on the residual soil moisture from previous monsoonseason. Such residual moisture quickly dries up with mustardgrowth that caused limitation of soil moisture during reproductivestage which is one of the major causes for the poor yield of mustard[24].The enhanced energy and carbon use ef ﬁciencies in crops andcropping systems have de ﬁnite role in overall environmental sus-tainability in terms of lowering carbon foot print values. However,the information on the energy and carbon budgeting of pearl mil-letemustard cropping system under conservation agriculturepractices is very limited in India as well as in other semi-arid tropicsof Asia and Africa. Therefore, the present experiment was plannedto study energy and carbon use in pearl millet emustard croppingsystem under conventional and conservation agriculture practices.This paper identi ﬁes key farm operations, budgets farm resourcesused in pearl millet dmustard cropping system and compares en-ergy and carbon ef ﬁciencies through energy and carbon indicators.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study site and climateAﬁeld experiment was conducted during 2013 e2015 at theIndian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, situated at28/C14380N latitude and 77/C14090E longitude at an altitude of about228.6 m above mean sea level (Arabian Sea). The region has a semi-arid climate with hot dry summers and severe cold winters. Itreceived an average (mean of last 30 years) annual rainfall of652 mm (70 e80% of which received during July eSeptember) withthe mean annual evaporation of 850 mm. Rainfall received duringthe experimental period is depicted in Fig. 1 . The soil (TypicHaplustept, Inceptisol) was sandy loam (65.3% sand, 15.0% silt and19.7% clay) in texture having pH 7.8, EC 0.31 dS m/C01, 4.5 g organiccarbon kg/C01soil, 62.3 mg KMnO 4oxidizable N kg/C01soil, 6.8 mg0.5 N NaHCO 3extractable P kg/C01soil and 79.8 mg 1.0 N NH 4OAcexchangeable K kg/C01soil in the top 15 cm soil.2.2. Experimental detailsThe experiment was laid out in randomized complete blockdesign with three replications. The treatment consisted of ﬁvetillage and crop residue management practices viz.conventionaltillage without crop residue (CT-CR0), CT with 2 and 4 t ha/C01res-idue (CT-CR2 and CT-CR4), zero tillage with 2 and 4 t ha/C01residue(ZT-CR2 and ZT-CR4). The plot size was 20.0 m /C23.6 m and wasﬁxed throughout the experimentation. The CT involved oneploughing with disc plough followed by two pass of disc harrowand planking in the last to have a uniform seed bed of ﬁne tilth. InZT, crops seeds were direct drilled using ZT planter. The technicalproperties of tillage implements is provided in SupplementaryTable 1 . Residues of previous season crop (mustard and pearl mil-let) were applied in succeeding crop by spreading the materialuniformly on the ﬁeld just after sowing as mulch to reduce evap-oration of moisture from soil surface.2.3. Crop establishment and managementPearl millet composite variety ‘Pusa-443 ’was sown with seedrate of 5 kg ha/C01during ﬁrst fortnight of July. The pearl millet cropwas harvested in the ﬁrst fortnight of October in both the years. Themustard ( ‘Pusa Mustard-28 ’) was sown with a seed rate of 5 kg ha/C01in the second fortnight of October at a row spacing of 0.45 m in thesame ﬁeld. Pearl millet received a common fertilizer dose of60 kg N þ60 kg P 2O5þ30 kg K 2O per hectare and mustard wasfertilized with 80 kg N þ40 kg P 2O5þ30 kg K 2O per hectare. Inboth the seasons, 2/3rd N and whole phosphorus and potassiumwere applied as basal at sowing, while remaining 1/3rd N was topdressed by broadcasting urea at 25 e40 days after sowingdepending on soil moisture. For managing weeds, Glyphosate 41 SLwas sprayed @ 2.0 L ha/C01in the ZT plots about 7 e10 days beforesowing of each crop. However, Atrazine 50 WP @ 1.0 kg ha/C01as pre-emergence (PE) in pearl millet and Pendimethalin 30 EC @2.5 kg ha/C01as PE in mustard were also applied uniformly. Inaddition to chemical weed management, one hand weeding wasalso done in all the conventional tilled plots at 25 e35 days aftersowing. Pearl millet crop was raised as rainfed and subsequentmustard crop on conserved soil moisture. Pearl millet and mustardwere harvested manually in ﬁrst fortnight of October and March,respectively in both the years. The cultural practices adopted isgiven in Supplementary Table 2 .2.4. Energy input-output relationshipThe energy inputs include both operational (direct) and non-operational (indirect) energy. Operational energy comprisedmanual work, fuel, machinery, etc., whereas non-operational en-ergy consisted of seed, manure, and chemical fertilizers and pes-ticides. The primary data on various inputs and managementpractices were used for computation of energy consumption on thebasis of energy. Energy output from the product (grain and stover)was calculated by multiplying the amount of production and itscorresponding energy equivalent as given in Table 1 . The energy useindices were calculated as per the procedure given by Devasena-pathy et al. [25] and Mittal and Dhawan [26].Net Energy ¼Energy output/C16MJ ha/C01/C17/C0Energy input/C16MJ ha/C01/C17M.

Carbon budgetingCarbon equivalent (CE) was estimated by multiplying the input(diesel, chemical fertilizer and pesticides) with its correspondingemission coef ﬁcient as given by Lal [8]and West and Marland [29].However the emission coef ﬁcient for each individual pesticide andherbicide are unavailable, so it was assumed that the emissionduring the processes of production, transportation, storage, andﬁeld application are same for the pesticides within a class [8].

Economic analysisThe economic analysis was done by considering the variableproduction costs only. The variable costs included human labour,use of machinery (tractor, plough, planter etc.), the input cost (seed,fertilizer and pesticide), harvesting and threshing. The productioncost however did not include the value of the land. Net returns (NR)were calculated by deducting the total cost (TC) from gross returns(GR) (NR ¼GReTC). Bene ﬁt to cost (B:C) ratio was calculated bydividing net returns by total cost (B:C ¼NR/TC).2.7. Statistical analysisAll the data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA)using the general linear model procedures of the Statistical AnalysisSystem (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The F-test was used to determinesigniﬁcant effects of the tillage systems and least signi ﬁcant dif-ference (LSD) was used to compare means.Fig. 1.

Crop productivityThe different tillage practices had signi ﬁcant (P <0.05) effect onmean pearl millet grain, stover and biomass yields ( Table 2 ) andwas recorded highest in CT-CR4 (2302, 7589 and 9891 kg ha/C01,respectively). The grain, stover and biomass yield with CT-CR4 wereincreased signi ﬁcantly by 24.6, 16.5 and 18.3% compared to CT-CR0,respectively. Application of higher level of residue (4 t ha/C01) hadsigniﬁcant (P <0.05) effect on grain yield under both the tillagesystem. However, at same residue level, CT yielded at par with ZT.Based on the analysis of variance, mustard yield values werefound to be different in different tillage systems at the 5% level ofsigniﬁcance ( Table 2 ). ZT-CR4 had the highest yields, with a meanseed yield of 2184 kg ha/C01, by-product mean of 6900 kg ha/C01andmean biomass yield of 9084 kg ha/C01. The lowest yield (1754 kg seedyield, 5504 kg by-product yield and 7258 kg biomass yield ha/C01)was observed in CT-CR0. Furthermore, seed yield of mustard wassigniﬁcantly (P <0.05) higher by 9.1% in ZT and 10.1% in CT plantingwith thick residue cover (4 t ha/C01) compared to low residue(2 t ha/C01). However, irrespective of mulching intensity conven-tional tilled plots yielded at par with ZT.3.2. Energy use patternThe source and operation-wise energy use pattern werecomputed for pearl millet emustard cropping system ( Figs. 2 and 3 ).The mean total energy of 77,613 MJ ha/C01was consumed in thecropping system. Overall, renewable energy through crop residuescontributed highest input energy followed by non-renewable re-sources viz. diesel, fertilizers, chemicals and machineries. Contri-butions of renewable and non-renewable energy sources in thesystem were about 79% and 21%, respectively. Diesel and electricityare direct non-renewable energy sources, contributed about 6.0%.Of the inputs for the different operations, mulching of crop residueconsumed the bulk of the energy in all tillage practices in pearlmillet-mustard cropping system ( Table 3 ). It comprised 72.3 e87.1%of the total energy consumption. Furthermore, fertilizer applicationwas the second major input that accounted for around 52.6% oftotal energy in no residue plots to 8.5% in CT-CR4. Field preparationalso consumed a considerable amount of energy. The energyconsumed for ﬁeld preparation in conventional tilled plots were4662 MJ ha/C01, however no-energy consumed in ZT plots for thisoperation. Among various tillage practices total energy require-ment was the highest for CT-CR4 (119,413 MJ ha/C01), followed by ZT-CR4 (115,074 MJ ha/C01)>CT-CR2 (69,349 MJ ha/C01)>ZT-CR2(65,010 MJ ha/C01)>CT-CR0 (19,225 MJ ha/C01) tillage practices.3.3. Energy input-output relationshipOn an average, the highest amount of energy was accumulatedin the biomass of mustard (126.6 GJ ha/C01), where 39% of the energyis accumulated in seeds and 61% in straw ( Fig. 4 ). However theenergy accumulated in seeds of pearl millet was 25.7% and rest instraw. The total cropping system output bio-energy produced bypearl millet emustard rotation ranged from 221,200 MJ ha/C01(CT-CR0) to as high as 268,817 MJ ha/C01(ZT-CR4) ( Table 4 ). Conventionaltillage without residue produced signi ﬁcantly least energy output(221,200 MJ ha/C01) and energy intensiveness (31 MJ US$/C01) howeverenergy-use ef ﬁciency (11.5), net energy return (201,977 MJ ha/C01)Table 2Yield of pearl millet and mustard crop under different tillage and residue management practices (average of two years).TreatmentaGrain yield (kg ha/C01) By-product yield (kg ha/C01) Biomass yield (kg ha/C01)Pearl millet Mustard Pearl millet Mustard Pearl millet MustardCTeCR0 1848d1754d6511b5504c8359b7258cCTeCR2 2110bc1890d7196a5918bc9306a7808bcCTeCR4 2302a2062b7589a6362ab9891a8424abZTeCR2 2079c1984bc7082ab6222b9161a8206bZTeCR4 2261ab2184a7578a6900a9839a9084aMeans followed by a superscripted similar lowercase letter within a column are not signi ﬁcantly different (at P <0.05) according to LSD test.aCTeconventional tillage; ZT ezero tillage; CR0 eno crop residue; CR2 ecrop residue at 2 t ha/C01; CR4ecrop residue at 4 t ha/C01Fig. 2.

Carbon budgetingAmong the various conservation agriculture practices, fertilizersconsumed 61.4% of the total carbon input in no-residue conven-tionally tilled plots ( Table 5 ). Whereas, its contribution in residueapplied plots ranged from 5.4 to 10.1%. The residue used as mulchconsumed bulk of carbon (83.9 e92.5% of total carbon input) indifferent tillage practices. Diesel used in ﬁeld preparation, sowingand threshing activities also consumed the considerable amount ofthe total carbon input (95.4 kg CE in CT plots and 29.6 kg CE ha/C01inZT plots). The highest carbon consumption was recorded in CT-CR4(3857 kg CE ha/C01) followed by ZT-CR4 (3806 kg CE ha/C01). Leastamount of carbon (337 kg CE ha/C01) was consumed in CT-CR0 thanthat of consumed by other tillage practices. Surprisingly, 6 e12times increase in the carbon consumption was observed in residueapplied plots. Among all the tillage practices, ZT-CR4 maintainedsigniﬁcantly the highest carbon outputs (8326 kg CE ha/C01) followedby CT-CR4 >ZT-CR2 >CT-CR2 >CT-CR0. Unlike, CT-CR0 maintainedsigniﬁcantly the highest carbon ef ﬁciency (20.4) and the least car-bon footprint (0.05 kg CE kg/C01grain of pearl millet). CT-CR4maintained the least carbon ef ﬁciency (2.1) and highest carbonfootprint values (0.52 kg CE kg/C01grain of pearl millet) than othertillage practices.3.5.

In general, the production cost ofmustard crop was higher than pearl millet however in no residuetreatment production cost is almost similar in both crops. Theproduction cost of pearl millet emustard cropping sequence variedfrom minimum with CT-CR0 (625 US$ ha/C01) to maximum under CT-CR4 (940 US$ ha/C01). The maximum net returns were calculated inZTeCR4 (1270 US$ ha/C01) and minimum in CT-CR0 (1087 US$ ha/C01).Beneﬁt to cost ratio was calculated by dividing the net returns valueto the production cost in order to determine the economic ef ﬁ-ciency. Unlike returns, highest bene ﬁt to cost ratio was calculated inZT-CR2 (1.84) followed by CT-CR0 (1.74) and lowest in CT-CR4 (1.16).4. Discussion4.1. Crop productivity and pro ﬁtabilityResults from the study revealed that peal millet and mustardgrain yields were higher to the tune of about 17 e24% in residue(4 t ha/C01) applied plots than that of yield obtained under no-residue plot (CT-CR0) ( Table 2 ) chie ﬂy because of favourable ef-fect of crop residue on soil moisture and nutrient availability[31e33]. As the experiment was carried out under rainfed situationof semi-arid tropics and moisture is the major limiting factor ofyield in these areas [34]. In pearl millet, CT recorded slightly highergrain yield than ZT (but not statistically signi ﬁcant) while vice-versa in mustard. This might be due to more weed infestation inkharif (rainy) season under ZT which caused reduction in yield [35].The effectiveness of thick residue (4 t ha/C01) was noticed in both thetillage system. This could be attributed to residue effect on soilsurface characteristics. It is likely that applying the same amount ofresidue in both tillage regimes (4 t ha/C01in ZT and CT) have assistedthe soil with the same bene ﬁts in terms of developing favourablesoil surface [36].The higher cost of cultivation of pearl millet emustard croppingsystem for CT-CR4 can be attributed to cost involved in thick res-idue cover (8 t ha/C01year/C01),ﬁeld preparation and labour requiredfor manual weeding. CT-CR4 maintained lower bene ﬁt to cost ratio(1.16) due to the higher cost of cultivation. Ozpinar and Ozpinar [37]reported high production cost with conventional tillage usingplough compared with shallow tillage unburied crop residues un-der semi-arid conditions, in a wheat-vetch/maize rotation. In pearlmillet and mustard the total cost of conventional tilled plots wasaround 10 e14% higher than the zero tillage treatments at corre-sponding residue level. In mustard, cost of cultivation of residueapplied plots was much higher than no-residue plots due to highercost of pearl millet residue (50 e53 US$ t/C01residue). Lower bene ﬁtto cost ratio under ZT with 4 t ha/C01crop residue in comparison to2th a/C01crop residue mainly because of proportionate returns fromresidue was less in comparison to cost involved.4.2. Energy requirements and input eoutput relationshipTotal energy input used in CT-CR4 was 119,413 MJ ha/C01, which isabout six times more than that of CT-CR0 (19,225 MJ ha/C01). Themain factor resulting in excessive energy use in CT-CR4 was thickresidue cover. Also the amount of energy used in different agro-nomic practices and inputs such as machinery, diesel and weedingin CT-CR4. However the ratio of energy use of total energy fordiesel, seed, machinery and labour were higher in CT-CR0. Con-ventional tillage practices were regarded to be energy-intensive[37] and poor in resource utilization [38]. About 25 e30% of en-ergy was required to ﬁeld preparation and crop establishment [39].Zero tillage practices reduced the energy requirement due to savingof energy in land preparation and weeding operations [40]. How-ever, ZT and CT practices with residue increased the input energyrequirement. The effect of energy saving by zero tillage was nulli-ﬁed by heavy energetic crop residues. This is in conformity with theﬁndings of Chaudhary et al. [41]. In a study conducted at Indo-Gangetic Plain Zone, Parihar et al. [38] observed that crop residueconsumes the bulk of input energy (71 e89%) in maize basedcropping system. ZT-CR4 recorded higher productivity which ulti-mately helped to maintain higher energy output and energyintensiveness. Energy-use ef ﬁciency, net energy return and energyproductivity was higher in CT-CR0 because of lowest energy inputas there was no application of crop residues as mulch.4.3. Carbon sustainabilityAmong tillage practices highest share of C input was from cropresidue followed by fertilizers and fossil fuel (Diesel). In no-residueapplied plots, fertilizer was major consumer of carbon. The highercarbon input in residues applied plots, mainly due to application ofcrop residue contains 44% carbon. Gan et al. [42] and Goglio et al.[43] observed similar increase in C input with increase in quantityof residues. In CT and ZT carbon emitted through fossil fuel was 95.4and 29.6 CE ha/C01, respectively. This difference in fossil fuel indifferent tillage treatment was due to savings in fossil fuel fromreduced number of passes and also emissions associated with en-ergy consumed in manufacture, transport, repair and use of ma-chines [37,44] . Carbon output was higher in ZT-CR4 followed by CT-CR4 and least in CT-CR0 ( Table 5 ). This increase in C output is due tohigher biomass yields of pearl millet and mustard. The highercarbon ef ﬁciency in CT-CR0 (20.4) can be explained by the lower Cinput in this treatment mainly due to absence of residue. Signi ﬁ-cantly, the highest carbon footprint value was observed in CT-CR4(0.52 kg CE kg/C01pearl millet grain equivalent yield) and least inCT-CR0 (0.05 kg CE kg/C01pearl millet grain equivalent yield). At thesame residue, lower carbon footprint value was calculated in zerotilled plots than conventional tilled. This is because of lower Cemission in the form of fossil fuel in ZT.5. ConclusionsThe study evaluated economics, energy, and environmentalperformance of different tillage and residue management practicesin pearl millet-mustard crop sequence. It was observed that ZT withTable 6Economic ef ﬁciency of different tillage practices in pearl millet dmustard rotation (average of two years).TreatmentaCost of cultivation (US$ ha/C01) Gross returns (US$ ha/C01) Net returns (US$ ha/C01) Bene ﬁt:Cost ratioPearl millet Mustard Total Pearl millet Mustard Total Pearl millet Mustard Total Pearl millet Mustard SystemCTeCR0 309 316 625 721 991 1712 412 675 1087 1.33 2.14 1.74CTeCR2 356 433 789 811 1068 1878 454 635 1089 1.27 1.47 1.38CTeCR4 397 543 940 871 1163 2034 474 620 1094 1.20 1.14 1.16ZTeCR2 297 380 677 798 1121 1919 502 741 1242 1.69 1.95 1.84ZTeCR4 337 490 827 862 1235 2097 525 744 1270 1.56 1.52 1.53aCTeconventional tillage; ZT ezero tillage; CR0 eno crop residue; CR2 ecrop residue at 2 t ha/C01; CR4ecrop residue at 4 t ha/C01.M.

However, highenergy and carbon input were noticed in thick residue applied plotsin both tillage practices which reduced the energy and carbon ef-ﬁciency in comparison to no-residue applied plot. Therefore,farmers have to strike a balance among the amount of crop residueused as mulch, fodder for livestock and other industrial uses.AcknowledgementTheﬁrst author is grateful to Indian Grassland and FodderResearch Institute, Jhansi, India and Indian Agricultural ResearchInstitute, New Delhi, India for carrying out this research work underPh.D. programme.Appendix A.
