ARTICLEGlobal subsoil organic carbon turnover timesdominantly controlled by soil properties rather thanclimateZhongkui Luo1,3, Guocheng Wang2& Enli Wang1Soil organic carbon (SOC) in the subsoil below 0.3 m accounts for the majority of total SOCand may be as sensitive to climate change as topsoil SOC. Here we map global SOC turnovertimes ( τ) in the subsoil layer at 1 km resolution using observational databases. Global mean τis estimated to be 10151414729yr (mean with 95% con ﬁdence interval), and deserts and tundrashow the shortest ( 146188114yr) and longest ( 385456222651yr)τrespectively. Across the globe, meanτranges from 9 (the 5% quantile) to 6332 years (the 95% quantile). Temperature is themost important factor negatively affecting τ, but the overall effect of climate (includingtemperature and precipitation) is secondary compared with the overall effect of assessed soilproperties (e.g., soil texture and pH). The high-resolution mapping of τand the quanti ﬁcationof its controls provide a benchmark for diagnosing subsoil SOC dynamics under climatechange.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 OPEN1CSIRO Agriculture & Food, GPO Box 1700, Canberra 2601 ACT, Australia.2LAPC, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing100029, China.3Present address: College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058 Zhejiang, China.

Under-standing how SOC dynamics respond to and providefeedbacks on climate change is vital for climate change mitigationas well as for sustaining ecosystem services important to agri-culture intensi ﬁcation and biodiversity conservation3–5. Themajority of studies paid more attention to the dynamics of SOCin the topsoil above 0.3 m6. Nonetheless, world subsoils below0.3 m store two times more SOC than top 0.3 m soils7, which mayalso actively respond to climate change6but is to date poorlyunderstood. Main challenges are that subsoil SOC dynamics aremore dif ﬁcult to detect in situ. Although several site-speci ﬁcstudies have been conducted extending to deep soil layers8,9,i ti sdifﬁcult to extrapolate the results to other places due to the largespatial variability of soil conditions which may affect SOCdecomposition differently.The turnover time of SOC is a good indicator of soil carbonstability. By assessing the underlying drivers of SOC turnovertime, we can gain insights into the dynamics of SOC under cli-mate change and other soil disturbances, which otherwise aredifﬁcult to be obtained by conducting manipulation experiments.Most Earth-system models indeed rely on the regulation ofclimate-related variables (predominantly temperature andmoisture) on turnover times of different carbon pools to predictsoil carbon budgets both in the absence or presence of climatechange10–12. Although several studies have estimated ecosystemcarbon turnover times at the global scale13, subsoil SOC turnovertimes have not been explicitly quanti ﬁed based on observationaldata, nor the mechanisms controlling the turnover. A detailedobservation-based quanti ﬁcation of subsoil SOC turnover timesand their association with climate and soil properties represents akey step towards reliable predictions of carbon cycle-climatefeedbacks.In a soil at the steady state, carbon turnover times ( τ, yr) can beestimated as the ratio of total SOC pool size (SOC total) to carbonoutputs or inputs (inputs =outputs under the steady stateassumption). Inputs are equal to the net primary production(NPP, i.e., the difference between gross primary production andautotrophic respiration) that is allocated to the soil (NPPsoil, i.e.,belowground NPP) at the steady state, and thus τcan be esti-mated as: τ¼SOCtotalNPPsoil:This calculation implicitly assumes SOC asa single homogenous cohort, and estimates the average residencetime of carbon in the soil. In reality, however, few soils are at thestrict steady state because of natural and anthropogenic dis-turbances (e.g., ﬁre and land use change) and climate variability.The strict steady-state assumption has to be liberalized, becausetemporal monitoring of SOC with belowground NPP input pre-sents a signi ﬁcant measurement challenge, making it dif ﬁcult, ifnot impossible, to estimate real-time SOC turnover in situ.However, if the disturbances and/or environmental ﬂuctuationsare regular (e.g., management activities, and ﬁre and droughtregimes) and there is no long-term temporal directional trend,the soil could be considered to be in a quasi-steady state. Here wefocus on τin the 0.3 –1 m soil layer in which SOC is much morestable than that in the topsoils. We call τthe apparent turnovertime (Methods), which enables an evaluation of the spatialvariability of SOC turnover times and an assessment of whetherand how the turnover time correlates with climate and soilproperties.We estimate τin the 0.3 –1 m soil layer across the globe at theresolution of 0.0083° × 0.0083° (~1 km near the Equator) by com-bining global, spatially-explicit and observation-based SOC data inthat layer [Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) version 1.2]and the Terra/MODIS NPP product14at the same spatial resolutionof SOC data. The NPP product reports the annual NPP from 2001to 2015, and we calculate the average NPP over this period.Depending on the global biome distribution, a comprehensiveglobal data set is compiled to fractionate total NPP to below- andabove-ground NPP (Supplementary Data and SupplementaryTable 1). The belowground NPP is further allocated to the subsoil(i.e., the 0.3 –1 m soil layer) according to root biomass distributionin this layer in different biomes (Supplementary Table 2) by syn-thesising the ORNL DAAC dataset of global distribution of rootproﬁles in terrestrial ecosystems15,16(https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id =660). The uncertainty in derived τis estimatedtaking into account the uncertainties in NPP and its allocation tothe 0.3 –1 m soil layer.ResultsSpatial pattern of τand its uncertainty . Figure 1shows theestimated τin the 0.3 –1 m soil layer and its uncertainty across theglobe at the resolution of 0.0083°. Great spatial variability exists inτ, ranging from less than a decade to more than thousands ofyears (Fig. 1). For the upper limit of the 95% con ﬁdence interval(CI, see Methods section) of τ, its 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%quantiles across the globe are 9, 78, 182, 609, and 6332 yr,respectively (Fig. 1a). These quantiles for mean τare 7, 60, 137,450, 4574 yr, respectively (Fig. 1b), and for the lower limit of τare5, 46, 104, 332, 3,303 yr respectively (Fig. 1c). It is general that τincreases with latitudes, particularly in the northern hemisphere(Fig. 1and Supplementary Fig. 2). Another apparent pattern isthat, τpositively correlates to SOC stock (Pearson ’s correlationcoefﬁcient r=0.76, Fig. 2a) and negatively correlates to NPPallocated to the 0.3 –1 m soil layer ( r=−0.68, Fig. 2b), as a resultof the way τis estimated (see details in Methods section).Averaging across the globe, the global grand mean τin the0.3–1 m soil layer is 10151414729yr (mean with its 95% CI, Table 1).Among biomes, τgenerally re ﬂects the temperature regime ofbiomes: biomes under colder climate have higher τ(Table 1). Thegrand mean τis longest in two cold biomes: tundra (385456222651yr)and boreal forests (201727581466yr, Table 1). In other biomes, averageτis less than 1000 years, and two hot biomes —deserts andtropical/subtropical forests —have the shortest τ(146188114and168215131yr, respectively). In line with the latitudinal pattern of τshown in Supplementary Fig. 2, these results suggest thattemperature may play an important role in controlling τat theglobal scale (see detailed assessment below).Percentage uncertainty . Figure 3shows the percentage uncer-tainty (the ratio of the difference between the upper and lowerlimit of the 95% CI of τin each pixel to the mean, see Methodssection) in τinduced by NPP and its allocation to the subsoil.Similar to the spatial pattern of τshown in Fig. 1, the percentageuncertainty of τalso shows great spatial variability, ranging from<30% to >100%. The 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% quantiles ofthe percentage uncertainty across the globe are 45%, 51%, 58%,65%, and 77%, respectively (Fig. 3). Averaging across the globe,the percentage uncertainty is 59% and comparable among biomes(Table 1). However, it is apparent that there is larger percentageuncertainty in higher northern latitudes, particularly in Tundra(>70% on average, Table 1and Fig. 3).Controls of τat the local scale . After mapping τin subsoilsacross the globe, we assessed the relative in ﬂuence (RI) of climatevs. soil properties on τat local (~100 km × 100 km) and globalscales. We focus on two climate variables [mean annual tem-perature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP)] and 10 soil variables[pH, clay, silt and sand content, electrical conductivity (ECE),sodicity (ESP), gypsum (CaSO4), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3),ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-92 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3688 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationstotal exchangeable bases(TEB), and base saturation (BS)] in theassessment.At the local scale, using localized boosted regression trees(BRT) taking into account potential interactions and non-linearrelationships between variables (see Methods section), we ﬁndthat the RI of climate (i.e., MAT and MAP together, see Methodssection) is location-speci ﬁc, ranging from zero to 100% (Fig. 4).Figure 4shows the distribution of the RI of climate and soil.Averaging across the globe, climate represented by MAT andMAP together contributes 22% [i.e., model performance-weightedaverage RI (RI w), see Methods section] to the BRT model for τ(Fig. 4a), while soil represented by 10 soil variables togethercontributes 78% (Fig. 4b). In 23% of the area (at the scale of100 km × 100 km grid) of the globe, MAT is the most importantindividual variable, followed by TEB (16%), clay (13%), BS (12%),sand (10%), MAP (8%), and other soil properties (SupplementaryFig. 3). We also quanti ﬁed the fraction of locations (i.e., the100 km × 100 km grids) where climate is more important thansoil properties in controlling τ(i.e., RI 50in SupplementaryTable 3), and ﬁnd that climate is only more important in 26% ofglobal locations (Supplementary Table 3).It must be noted that the performance ( R2) of the localizedBRT varies substantially with the location of interest (Fig. 5andSupplementary Fig. 4). The BRT model can on average explain73% of the variances of τat the local scale of 100 km × 100 kmgrid ranging from <5% to >95% across the globe (Fig. 5andSupplementary Fig. 4). In order to detect the average pattern ofthe relationship between model performance and variableimportance, we grouped R2(i.e., model performance) into 10groups from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0.1, i.e., [0 –0.1),[0.1,0.2), …… , [0.9,1]. For each R2group, we then calculatedthe average RI of both climate and soil. The result indicates thatthe average RI of climate decreases with model performance(Fig. 5a), while the average RI of soil increases with modelperformance (Fig. 5b). Overall, these results suggest that soiland climate had distinct overall effects on SOC turnover andother local scale variables may be also very important at thelocal scale.−150 −100 −50 0 50 100 150−60−40−20020406080Latitude0−2020−4040−6060−8080−100100−120120−140140−160160−180180−200200−500500−1000>1000/afii9848 (yr, upper limit)a−150 −100 −50 0 50 100 150−60−40−20020406080Latitude0−2020−4040−6060−8080−100100−120120−140140−160160−180180−200200−500500−1000>1000/afii9848 (yr, mean)b−150 −100 −50 0 50 100 150−60−40−20020406080Latitude0−2020−4040−6060−8080−100100−120120−140140−160160−180180−200200−500500−1000>1000/afii9848 (yr, lower limit)cLongitudeFig. 1 Spatial pattern of subsoil organic carbon turnover times. a,bandcrespectively show the upper limit (i.e., the 97.5% quantile), mean, and lower limit(i.e., the 2.5% quantile) of subsoil (0.3 –1 m) organic carbon turnover times based on 200 bootstrapping simulations considering uncertainty in carboninput in each pixel at the resolution of 0.0083°NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3688 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3Controls of τat the global scale . At the global scale, we ran-domly selected 10,000 pixels (at the resolution of 0.0083° ×0.0083°) to conduct the BRT (see Methods section). The BRTresults suggest that MAT is much more important than MAP(36% vs. 5% in terms of relative in ﬂuence, Fig. 6a). Soil pH andtotal exchangeable bases (15% and 13% in terms of their relativeinﬂuence respectively) are the two most important soil variables.The relative individual in ﬂuence of other soil properties is small(<10%), but the total relative contribution of soil variables to τis57%, overriding the 43% of climate (Fig. 6a).

In addition, we ﬁnd that climate indirectlyaffects τvia its effect on soil properties (Fig. 6c). However, it isnoteworthy that the overall performance of the path model ( R2=0.6) in explaining the variability of τis smaller than that of theBRT ( R2=0.95, Fig. 6b, c), suggesting that more complexinteractions and non-linear relationships than that considered bythe path analysis may exist to regulate SOC turnover.DiscussionIn this study we quanti ﬁed spatially explicit turnover times ofsubsoil SOC at the global scale by integrating availableobservation-based databases. The global average turnover time ofSOC in the 0.3 –1 m soil layer was estimated to be 10151414729yr.Previous studies mainly focus on topsoil layers17or do notexplicitly distinguish NPP allocation in different soil depths whenestimating turnover times11,18. Using Earth system models(ESMs), for example, global average SOC turnover times in thetop 1 m soil were estimated to be in the range of 10.8 –39.3 yr11.This estimation considered SOC in the top 1 m soil as a cohortand did not take NPP allocation into account, making it dif ﬁcultto infer SOC turnover times in subsoils. The credibility of thosemodel estimations has been widely debated due to lack ofobservation-based veri ﬁcation19,20. Analysis of radiocarbon datasets from 157 soil pro ﬁles down to 1 m across the globe alsochallenged the estimates by ESMs and found that ESMs under-estimate SOC turnover times by a factor of more than six21.Although less studies have assessed subsoil SOC turnover times,site-speci ﬁc studies have indicated that subsoil SOC may be quitestable with turnover times of hundred and thousand years22–24,which is generally within the range estimated in this study. Ourestimation of turnover times of subsoil SOC provides a referenceto diagnose turnover times predicted by ESMs and by otherempirical approaches.To our knowledge, this study presents the ﬁrst global maps ofthe spatial pattern of subsoil SOC turnover times and theiruncertainty induced by carbon input into the subsoil. The resultssuggest that the uncertainty induced by uncertain carbon input islarge (Table 1and Fig. 3). This uncertainty is mainly due to thelimited data availability and quality for estimating carbon input attheﬁne scale across the globe. In the approach presented in thisstudy, a key parameter is the fraction of NPP allocated to subsoil.However, above- and belowground allocation of NPP remainsone of the poorest understood attributes of terrestrial ecosystems.When further looking into the NPP allocation to different soillayers, the data becomes even scarcer and we have to indirectlyinfer NPP allocated to the 0.3 –1 m soil using the information ofroot biomass distribution in the soil pro ﬁle (see Methods section).Synthesizing the available datasets, we found that both plant NPPallocation to above- and belowground components (Supplemen-tary Table 1) and root biomass distribution along the soil pro ﬁle(Supplementary Table 2) are highly variable even in the samebiome type, inevitably resulting in high uncertainty in the esti-mation of turnover times at the global scale. This variabilityreﬂects that plant community composition and structure andcarbon allocation strategies adapt to local environmental condi-tions. In addition, accurate measurement of belowground pro-cesses such as belowground NPP allocation and rooting depthand biomass is also a big challenge, and the same process mea-sured by different approaches also have large discrepancy25,26.These challenges make it dif ﬁcult, if not impossible, to obtainlarge-scale measurements of rooting depth and belowgroundcarbon allocation in situ. In addition, subsoil SOC turnover timesare strongly associated with NPP allocated to the subsoil layer(Fig. 2b), implying that accurate partitioning of total NPP into thelayer of interest is critical for robust estimation of SOC dynamicsin different soil layers. To achieve this accuracy, we need inno-vative approaches to ef ﬁciently obtain data on belowground soilprocesses taking into account the high spatial variability of soilproperties that regulate root growth and plant ’s carbon allocationstrategies.At the global scale, our results demonstrate the larger overalleffect of soil properties on subsoil SOC turnover than the effectof climate. This result may attribute to two reasons relating tocarbon inputs to and outputs from the soil respectively. First, soilconditions have prominent effect on plant growth therefore thequantity and quality of soil carbon inputs. It is general thatbelowground resource availability (e.g., nutrients and water) haspredominant effect on plant growth27,28, while the actual avail-ability of those resources for plant growth is largely controlled bysoil physiochemical environment. In terms of carbon outputs,soil physical (e.g., soil texture and porosity) and chemicalproperties (e.g., pH) directly determine carbon outputs via theireffects on the transformation and stabilization of carbon inputsas well as the activity of decomposer community29–31.I na d d i -tion, soil carbon can be protected from decomposition viaocclusion with soil aggregates and binding with minerals9,32,33,and soil physiochemical characteristics determine the protectivecapacity of soil34. These physiochemical protection processesresult in soil-dependent stabilization/destabilization of differentsoil carbon pools34–36. Overall, our BRT modelling and pathanalysis (Fig. 6) demonstrate the dominant role of soil physicaland chemical characteristics in regulating SOC turnover at theglobal scale. We need novel approaches to derive metricsrepresenting soil heterogeneity across the globe that can gen-erally describe the effects of various soil properties on SOCdynamics.At the local scale (i.e., 100 km × 100 km grid), there are someintriguing points about the importance of climate and soil, BRTmodel performance and their correlations (Figs. 4and 5). Onaverage, the model performance-weighted average importance(RIw) of climate at the local scale is much smaller than that at theglobal scale (22% vs. 43%), while the RI wof soil at the local scaleis higher than that at the global scale (78% vs. 57%). This result isreasonable as climate is generally much less variable at the localthan at the global scale, while a greater part of soil variabilityobserved at global scale can be observed at a ﬁner scale. Con-sidering that soil properties in HWSD are estimated by taxo-transfer rules based on soil units (i.e., the same soil unit usuallyshares the same soil properties)37,38, the spatial variability of soilproperties in HWSD at the local scale is underestimated at thelocal scale thereby the importance of soil properties. These resultssuggest that soil condition would be much more important thanclimate for regulating SOC turnover times at the local scale. TheBRT model performance at the local scale, as well as theimportance of climate and soil, is highly variable depending onthe location. Areas with very low model performance imply thatother local scale variables such as land use and topography39,40may also have signi ﬁcant effect. In addition, we found that theperformance of the BRT model has clear but distinct relationshipswith the RI of climate and soil, highlighting complex inter-connections among soil, climate and other local scale variables inregulating SOC turnover times. Overall, our results suggest thatthe effect of soil properties and climate on local SOC turnover ishighly variable depending on local conditions, although soilproperties on average has greater effect than climate. Localinformation such as land use and management and terrainARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-96 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3688 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsattributes are also required in order to more robustly predict SOCdynamics at the local scale.Although the overall dominant role of soil properties, tem-perature exerts the most important individual in ﬂuence on τamong all assessed variables, implying that subsoil SOC may besensitive to temperature change and thus provides strong feed-backs on climate change under warming climate. However, ourBRT modelling and path analysis imply that the temperatureresponses of SOC turnover may be highly variable, and stronglydepend on the integrated effects of temperature on ecosystemprocesses that affect carbon inputs into and output from soil. Ourlocal scale assessment, for example, indicates that temperature isnot necessarily the most important variable everywhere (Sup-plementary Fig. 3). A recent site-speci ﬁc study evidenced thatsubsoil SOC is very sensitive to warming and can signi ﬁcantlycontribute to accelerated CO 2efﬂux under warming6. We musttake care when extrapolating these site-speci ﬁcﬁndings to largescales or to other locations. As the effect of warming on someecosystem processes may be site-speci ﬁc, nonlinear over time oronly manifest after a long time41, long-term observations will becritical for robust estimation of SOC balance under warmingclimate.In this study, we have took particular care to the data sourcesand conducted a comprehensive literature review to synthesizeavailable data sources, but there are still several limitations/uncertainties in the datasets propagating into the estimation of τand the assessment on underlying controls. First, our data did nottake into account any historical geological activities (e.g., volcanicexplosion and glacier drift) that may dramatically change SOCdynamics. For these situations, SOC dynamics would be morerelevant to those historical geological events rather than climateor soil conditions. However, this kind of geological activities isusually rare and may have limited effect on the spatial pattern ofSOC turnover times across the globe. Second, we have to adoptthe quasi-steady state assumption and do not have the global datato quantify the temporal variability of soil properties. In reality,some soil properties, particularly chemical variables like pH, mayactively respond to external disturbance including human activ-ities such as the utilization of synthetic fertilizers. If a system isnot at the quasi-steady state, τmay be under- or over-estimated.Third, an important uncertainty source in this study is that ageneric root distribution in the soil pro ﬁle is used to estimatecarbon allocation to the subsoil for the same biome type.Although this simpli ﬁcation is required for the application at theglobal scale and its consequences on turnover time estimation hasbeen considered via uncertainty assessment, it has to be notedthat it does not explicitly consider the potential effects of local soilenvironment such as soil depth and other constraints that affectroot distribution in the soil pro ﬁle and thus the estimation of τ.Fourth, we do not consider the effect of potential uncertainties insubsoil SOC stocks on the estimation of SOC turnover times. Thisuncertainty of SOC in the HWSD database may be large as thestrong correlation between SOC stock and its turnover time(Fig. 2a), and is particularly important in high northern latitudes(e.g., tundra and boreal forest areas) as the HWSD relies very fewobservations for SOC estimation in these areas42–44. Although theHWSD database reports soil information at the resolution of1 km, at last, it is generated based on soil units37,38. That meansadjacent 1 km × 1 km pixels may have the same soil unit and thusshare the same soil properties including SOC, which would lar-gely underestimate the spatial variability of soil properties.However, NPP and climate data are not based on soil units, andare produced at the resolution of 1 km. This kind of resolutionmismatch between different databases may bias the estimation ofSOC turnover times as well as the relative importance of climateand soil properties. We acknowledge that all these limitationsshould be overcome to provide more robust predictions on τandits controls, which is particularly important for regions experi-encing signi ﬁcant human-dominant land management and shiftof land use and cover.In conclusion, we have presented the ﬁrst spatially explicitquanti ﬁcation of SOC turnover times in world subsoils (0.3 –1m )using observation-based databases at the resolution of 0.0083°and by integrating published datasets. We ﬁnd that SOC turnovertime in the 0.3 –1 m soil layer on average is ~1000 yr ranging fromless than a decade to more than thousand years across the globe,providing a reference to judge the credibility of predictions ofcurrent Earth-system models11,17as well as to compare withestimations using other empirical approaches. Our resultsdemonstrate that the overall effect of climate (including tem-perature and precipitation) on subsoil SOC turnover is secondarycompared with the overall effect of soil properties at both globaland local scales, albeit the great variability of the importance ofclimate at the local scale. The effects of individual soil variablesare relatively small, but they work together involving complexinteractions and non-linear relationships with each other as wellas with climate to regulate SOC dynamics9,32,45,46. For this rea-son, soil physiochemical conditions may signi ﬁcantly shape thedirection and magnitude of the response of subsoil SOC dynamicsto climate change, and thus should be explicitly considered inorder to reliably predict soil carbon-climate feedbacks. In con ﬂictwith our ﬁndings on the dominant importance of soil propertiesin controlling subsoil SOC turnover, prevailing soil carbon andEarth system models are primarily driven by climate and builtupon knowledge of topsoil SOC dynamics11. Here we argue that aspeciﬁc subsoil module should be developed to properly simulatesubsoil SOC dynamics taking into account the potential distinctsub- and top-soil environment, otherwise the subsoil SOCdynamics would be unreliably predicted. However, in all assessedvariables, we ﬁnd that temperature in general is the most in ﬂu-ential individual variable on subsoil SOC turnover, highlightingthe potential sensitivity of subsoil SOC to warming. The mappingof SOC turnover times and their uncertainty and the assessmenton their drivers will facilitate screening regions sensitive to cli-mate change and guide site-speci ﬁc policy-making for effectivecarbon management.MethodsSOC data and soil properties . The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)version 1.2 ( http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/ ) reports global SOC content in the top0–0.3 m (topsoil) and 0.3 –1 m (subsoil) soil at the resolution of 30 arc-second (i.e.,~0.0083° degrees or ~1 km near the Equator). In brief, the HWSD is generatedbased on measurements of thousands of soil pro ﬁles across the globe37,38. For each~1 km grid, a soil unit was determined ﬁrst. Then, if measured data of a typical soilproperty is available for the soil unit, it was derived directly based on the measureddata attached to the soil unit; if not, taxonomy-based pedotransfer rules were usedfor estimation37,38. This database combines existing regional and national updatesof soil information worldwide and represents the most comprehensive soil databaseto present. With the SOC content, a series of other soil physical and chemicalproperties are also reported for both topsoil and subsoil in each pixel (0.0083° ×0.0083°).In this study, we focus on subsoil SOC. In each pixel, we estimated total SOCstocks (SOC, kg C m–2) in the subsoil as: SOC ¼OC100/C1D/C1BD/C11/C0G100/C0/C1;where OCis the SOC content reported as the percentage of soil weight in the HWSD, Dthethickness of the soil layer being considered (i.e., 0.7 m), BDthe soil bulk density,andGthe gravel content reported as the percentage of soil volume. Except thosesoil variables for calculating SOC stocks, we also extracted other soil properties inthe subsoil including pH, clay, silt and sand content, electrical conductivity (ECE),sodicity (ESP), gypsum (CaSO4), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), total exchangeablebases (TEB) and base saturation (BS). The association of SOC turnover times withthese variables were assessed (see details in the subsection: Drivers of τat the localand global scales).Net primary productivity (NPP) and biomes . The NPP data produced by theNumerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG)/University of MontanaNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 ARTICLENATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3688 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7(UMT) was obtained14. This NPP product was generated by analysing satellite datafrom the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The globalMODIS NPP algorithm14,47was used to estimate annual NPP from 2001 to 2015.Basic inputs into the algorithm include the fraction of photosynthetically activeradiation and leaf area index data from the MODIS sensor collected at 8-day timeinterval and at the resolution of 1 km. The average annual NPP in the period2001–2015 was calculated.The amount of NPP allocated to the subsoil (i.e., NPP allocated to the 0.3 –1msoil layer) is a key variable for the estimation of SOC turnover times. In this study,we assumed that the same biome shares the same allocation strategy of total NPP.First, we generated a global map of biome types by merging two land cover maps:the MODIS land cover map48and the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) map of theTerrestrial Ecoregions of the World49(https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world ). The two maps are aggregated to generate abiome map having the same resolution of SOC and NPP databases and includingnine biomes: tropical/subtropical forests, tropical/subtropical grasslands/savannas,temperate forests, temperate grasslands, Mediterranean/montane shrublands,boreal forests, tundra, deserts, and croplands.The allocation of NPP . In order to calculate τ, NPP has to be allocated into thesubsoil. To do so, we ﬁrst compiled a comprehensive database of NPP and itsabove- and belowground allocation by conducting a thorough literature search. Atotal of 471 observations of fBNPP—the fraction of belowground NPP in total NPP—were obtained from 54 papers in which fBNPP was directly reported or can becalculated (Supplementary Data 1). In addition, the ORNL DAAC NPP data col-lection ( https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p =13) was also screened,and the data sets that enable the calculation of fBNPP were included. Finally, weobtained a NPP database with 848 ﬁeld observations of fBNPP covering all the ninebiomes across the globe (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Data 1).Based on the estimated fBNPP (Supplementary Data 1 and Table 1), we canpartition total NPP (i.e., the average NPP during the period 200 –2015) toaboveground and belowground NPP based on biome types (SupplementaryTable 1)27. The belowground NPP was then partitioned into the 0.3 –1 m subsoilbased on the vertical root biomass distribution in the soil pro ﬁle (SupplementaryData 2)16. An empirical model (i.e., the logistic dose –response curve) was used tointerpolate root distribution in the soil pro ﬁle:15rD¼Rmax1þDD50/C16/C17c;ð1Þwhere rDis the total amount of roots above soil depth D(m), Rmaxis an estimatefor the total amount of roots in the whole soil pro ﬁle,D50is the depth (m) at whichrD=0.5·Rmax, and cis a dimensionless shape parameter and is calculated as:c¼/C01:27875log10D95/C0log10D50, where D95is the depth (m) at which rD=0.95 ·Rmax. Accordingto Eq. ( 1), the fraction of roots in the 0.3 –1 m soil layer (fr 0.3–1) can be estimated as:fr0:3/C01¼r1Rmax/C0r0:3Rmax¼11þ1D50/C16/C17c/C011þ0:3D50/C16/C17c:ð2ÞSchenk and Jackson15had complied a comprehensive dataset of root distribution in564 soil pro ﬁles across the globe (this data is publically available at ( https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id =660), Supplementary Fig. 1) to train theinterpolation model, and also compared different interpolation models and foundthat the logistic dose –response curve is the most robust. Here we used this rootproﬁle dataset including the interpolated D50andD95by Schenk and Jackson toestimate fr 0.3–1in each soil pro ﬁle. The Schenk and Jackson dataset does notinclude crops. For crops, we used the estimation of D50reported by Fan et al.50whoused the same logistic dose –response curve to interpolate the distribution of rootproﬁles of different crops by synthesising 96 root pro ﬁles of crops across worldcroplands. However, the data of the 96 crop root pro ﬁles used by Fan et al. is notavailable for us, and thus we cannot directly estimate the variance of crop rootdistribution as that in other biomes (Supplementary Table 2). When conductinguncertainty assessment (see the subsection: Estimation of SOC turnover times andits uncertainty), we reassigned the standard error of D50as 10% of its mean. Theestimated fr0.3-1based on those global databases was then grouped into the ninebiomes. Coupling with the estimated fBNPP, the amount of total NPP allocated tothe 0.3 –1 m soil layer (BNPP 0.3-1) can be calculated as:BNPP0:3/C01¼NPP /C1fBNPP/C1fr0:3/C01: ð3ÞThis estimation of BNPP 0.3–1takes into account the root residues and exudates/rhizodeposition, but assumes that net vertical physical transportation of carbon(e.g., dissolved organic carbon washed into the subsoil from upper layers and/orleached into deeper layers) is neutral. We acknowledge that information on themovement of dissolved organic carbon in the soil pro ﬁle may improve the relevantestimations.Estimation of SOC turnover times ( τ) and its uncertainty . SOC turnover time(τ) is the average time between when a carbon atom enters the soil until it exists thesoil. For a soil at the steady state, carbon output equals to input and thus τcan beestimated as the ratio of the total SOC pool size to carbon output or input ( Cin):τ¼SOCCin:Under the steady state assumption, the Cincan be estimated as theamount of NPP allocated to the soil if assuming neutral vertical physical trans-portation of organic carbon. In this study, we focus on τin the 0.3 –1 m subsoillayer as the steady state assumption would be more valid in this layer, and τcan beestimated as:τ¼SOC0:3/C01BNPP0:3/C01¼SOC0:3/C01NPP /C1fBNPP/C1fr0:3/C01: ð4ÞAlthough we can estimate τin the topsoil, topsoils may more frequently suffer fromdisturbances and aboveground plant residues may be also a large contributor to theoverall carbon input into the topsoil, resulting in the dif ﬁculty to adopting thesteady state assumption. We note some characteristics of τand the four variables inEq. ( 4). First, previous studies tracing the cycling of carbon isotopes estimated thatτmay range from several decades to centuries depending on ecosystems even in thetopsoil21,51. That means, in Eq. ( 4), the magnitude of SOC is much greater than themagnitude of BNPP 0.3–1, and thus τwill be more sensitive to the denominatorBNPP 0.3–1. Second, SOC would be much more stable at the inter-annual scalecompared with NPP. For these reasons, we focused on the uncertainty in τinducedby BNPP 0.3–1.It is straightforward that there are three uncertainty sources in BNPP 0.3–1induced by NPP, fBNPP, and fr 0.3–1, respectively. For the uncertainty in NPP, thereis no concrete assessment to date on the uncertainty in the MODIS NPP productbecause of the limited available ﬁeld data for validation and the mismatch in scalesbetween ground-based NPP measurements and the resolution (1 km) of the NPPproduct14,47. Here, we used an empirical Monte Carlo approach to bring theuncertainty in NPP into the estimation of BNPP 0.3–1. First, we assumed a normaldistribution of NPP in each 1 km pixel with a mean estimated by the 15-yearMODIS NPP product in that pixel and standard deviation (SD) assigned as the10% of the mean, i.e., NPP~N(mean, SD). Then, 200 Monte Carlo samples wererandomly drawn from the normal distribution to obtain 200 NPP estimates. At thesame time, a non-parametric bootstrapping approach was used to quantify theuncertainty in τinduced by the other two variables via randomly sampling 200bootstrap combinations of these variables. Speci ﬁcally, 200 bootstrap estimates offBNPP and fr 0.3–1were also generated by randomly sampling the derived datadescribed above, respectively, depending on the biome type which the pixel belongsto. For fr 0.3–1in croplands, it was estimated by randomly sampling a normaldistribution of D50with the mean reported by Fan et al. and the SD as 10% of themean. Putting these sampling estimates together, we obtained 200 ensembles ofNPP, fBNPP, and fr 0.3–1and thus 200 estimates of τfor each pixel. Based on the 200estimates of τ, then we calculated the mean and 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI, i.e.,2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the 200 bootstrapping samples) of τ. The 95% CIrepresents the uncertainty in τinduced by carbon input (i.e., NPP· fBNPP·fr0.3–1).Although subsoils would be more stable than topsoils, we acknowledge thatrarely do soils stay at the strict steady state and τestimated by Eq. ( 4) may sufferfrom bias in reality. We have to relax the strict steady state assumption. Here, wecall τthe apparent turnover time and interpret it as an emergent diagnosticaccording to ref.13. The estimation of τin the subsoil makes it possible to quantifythe spatial variability of SOC turnover times in the subsoil at the global scale,providing a reference and benchmark for assessing whether, how, where and towhat extent the SOC turnover in the subsoil may respond to climate andmanagement changes. Based on the best available information, our approachprovides the ﬁnest observation-derived estimation of global SOC turnover times inthe subsoil at the resolution of 0.0083°. The estimations can be aggregated to andused for uncertainty assessment at coarser scales. The estimated τcan be obtainedby contacting the authors and all other data sets are publicly available.Climate data . In order to test the correlation between SOC turnover times andclimate variables, we obtained the global mean precipitation and temperaturereported in WorldClim version 2.0 ( http://worldclim.org/version2 )52. TheWorldClim version 2 reports the mean annual temperature (MAT) and pre-cipitation (MAP) for the period 1970 –2000 at the same spatial resolution of theHWSD and NPP data. The time frame of the climate data is not consistent withthat of the NPP data. However, this is the most comprehensive data sets we canobtain, and its resolution is also consistent with the HSWD and NPP databases,facilitating the assessment of the effect of climate on SOC turnover times. As wefocus on the long-term average conditions of climate, the effect of this discrepancybetween the time frames would have limited effect on the relevant statistical results.Drivers of τat local and global scales . In this study, SOC turnover times ( τ) arecalculated based on SOC stock and NPP. As such, any factors potentially correlatedto or in ﬂuencing SOC and/or NPP may to some extent affect SOC turnover times.Here, we assessed the relative importance (RI) of climate (i.e., MAT and MAP) andsoil properties (i.e., the 12 soil variables collated from the HWSD) in controlling τ(focusing on mean τ) at local and global scales. For each 0.0083° × 0.0083° pixel forthe local scale assessment, we trained a BRT model using a common 10-fold cross-validation strategy8,53based on the data in a window of 101 by 101 pixels (i.e., thewindow size is ~100 × 100 km) centred at the target pixel to explore the localvariability of the relationships between covariates (i.e., climate and soil properties)and the response variable τ. Considering that not all pixels have data, the BRTmodel was only trained if the number of pixels with data in a window is >50. TheARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-98 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:3688 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11597-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsBRT analysis involves a type of data-mining (machine-learning) algorithm thatcombines the advantages of a regression tree (decision tree) algorithm andboosting53. It can analyse different types of variables and interaction effectsbetween variables and are applicable to nonlinear relationships, and identify the RIof predictor variables (i.e., climate and soil variables in this study). The RI ofindividual variables for climate and soil properties are summed respectively toindicate the overall relative importance of climate and soil. Using this approach, weintended to yield a global map of the RI of climate and soil properties in controllinglocal τvariability at the same resolution of τ. However, the computing timerequired to complete this job is huge (4 months assuming 1000 modern computercores), making it impossible to generate such map. For this reason, we used aMonte Carlo approach by randomly selecting 10,000 ~100 × 100 km windows toconduct the BRT. Based on the BRT results at the local scale, we calculated theweighted average relative importance (RIw) of both climate and soil at the localscale across the globe as well as in the nine biomes:RIw¼Pni¼1RIi/C1R2i/C0/C1Pni¼1R2iðÞ; ð5Þwhere RIiandR2iare the relative importance of climate (or soil) and model per-formance (i.e., the coef ﬁcient of determination R2in this study) in the ithMonteCarlo simulation, respectively. For the global scale assessment, we randomlyselected 10,000 pixels with the relevant data to train a BRT model.In addition to the relative and overall importance of climate and soil identi ﬁedby the BRT analysis, we used path analysis to quantitatively partition the directfrom indirect effects of climate and soil on τ. We conducted the path analysis usingthe data from the 10,000 randomly selected pixels focusing on the global scaleresults. To simplify the path model, the signi ﬁcant variables identi ﬁed by the BRTanalysis were used to indicate two latent variables: climate and soil. For the latentvariable climate, the two potential indicators were: MAT and MAP. Soilgeochemical properties including pH, soil texture (i.e., clay, silt and sand content),ECE, BS, CaCO3, CaSO 4, ESP, and TEB reported in the HWSD database wereconsidered as potential indicators for the latent variable soil. We considered thefollowing potential paths in a hypothesis-oriented path model. First, wehypothesized that both latent variables have direct effect on τ. Second, climate mayalso indirectly affect τthrough its effect on soil properties. The partial least squares(PLS) approach was used for the path analysis54. In the PLS path analysis, theloading of each indicator variable is the key to estimate latent variable scores andcalculated as the correlation between a latent variable and its indicators. Aniterative algorithm is used to estimate the loadings until the convergence of theloadings is reached to maximize the explained variance of the dependent variables(both latent and indicator variables). A non-parametric bootstrapping (200resamples in this study) was used to estimate the precision of the PLS parameterestimates. The 95% bootstrap con ﬁdence interval was used to judge that whetherthe estimated path coef ﬁcients are signi ﬁcant. To ease interpretation, if an indicatorhas a negative loading, its opposite was used in the model to ensure a positiveloading, and all indicators were standardized. The BRT analysis and path analysiswere performed using the package gbm and dismo, and plspm, respectively, in R3.3.1 (R Core Team 2016).Data availabilityAll the data used in this study can be publically accessed through the correspondinglyprovided website links in the text.
