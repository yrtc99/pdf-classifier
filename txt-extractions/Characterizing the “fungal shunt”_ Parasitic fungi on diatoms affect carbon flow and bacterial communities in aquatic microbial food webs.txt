DeLong, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, and approved March 26, 2021 (received for review February 3, 2021)Microbial interactions in aquatic environments profoundly affectglobal biogeochemical cycles, but the role of microparasites hasbeen largely overlooked. Using a model pathosystem, we studiedhitherto cryptic interactions between microparasitic fungi (chytridRhizophydiales ), their diatom host Asterionella, and cell-associatedand free-living bacteria. We analyzed the effect of fungal infectionson microbial abundances, bacterial taxonomy, cell-to-cell carbontransfer, and cell-specific nitrate-based growth using microscopy(e.g., fluorescence in situ hybridization), 16S rRNA gene ampliconsequencing, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Bacterial abun-dances were 2 to 4 times higher on individual fungal-infecteddiatoms compared to healthy diatoms, particularly involvingBurkholderiales. Furthermore, t axonomic compositions of bothdiatom-associated and free-living bacteria were significantly differ-ent between noninfected and fungal-infected cocultures. The fungalmicroparasite, including diatom-associated sporangia and free-swimming zoospores, derived ∼100% of their carbon content fromthe diatom. By comparison, transfer efficiencies of photosyntheticcarbon were lower to diatom-associated bacteria (67 to 98%), witha high cell-to-cell variability, and even lower to free-living bacteria(32%). Likewise, nitrate-based growth for the diatom and fungi wassynchronized and faster than for diatom-associated and free-livingbacteria. In a natural lacustrine system, where infection prevalencereached 54%, we calculated that 20% of the total diatom-derivedphotosynthetic carbon was shunted to the parasitic fungi, which canbe grazed by zooplankton, thereby accelerating carbon transfer tohigher trophic levels and bypassing the microbial loop. The hereintermed “fungal shunt ”can thus significantly modify the fate ofphotosynthetic carbon and the nature of phytoplankton –bacteriainteractions, with implications for diverse pelagic food webs andglobal biogeochemical cycles.eukaryotic microparasites |phytoplankton –fungi –bacteria interactions |carbon fluxesParasitism is one of the most common consumer strategies onEarth (1 –3). Recently, it has also been identified as one ofthe dominating interactions within the planktonic interactome(4, 5), and yet parasites remain poorly considered in analyses oftrophic interactions and element cycling in aquatic systems (6, 7).The foundation of trophic interactions in plankton communitiesis set by single-cell phytoplankton, which contributes almost halfof the world ’s primary production (8). According to our commonunderstanding, the newly fixed carbon (C) is channeled eitherthrough the microbial loop, classical food web, or viral shunt,which supports the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and nano-flagellates, zooplankton and higher trophic levels, or viruses,respectively (9). However, fungi, particularly fungal microparasites,are rarely considered as contributors to C and nutrient cycling, al-though they are present and active in diverse aquatic environments(10–12).Members of the fungal division Chytridiomycota, referred toas chytrids, can thrive as microparasites on phytoplankton cells infreshwater (11, 13, 14) and marine systems (15 –17), infecting upto 90% of the phytoplankton host population (18 –21). A recentconcept, called mycoloop, describes parasitic chytrids as an in-tegral part of aquatic food webs (22). Energy and organic matterare thereby transferred from large, often inedible phytoplanktonto chytrid zoospores, which are consumed by zooplankton (23 –27).Hence, parasitic chytrids establish a novel trophic link betweenphytoplankton and zooplankton. Our understanding of elementcycling and microbial interactions during chytrid epidemics, how-ever, remains sparse. For instance, the cell-to-cell C transfer fromsingle phytoplankton cells to their directly associated chytrids hasn o tb e e nq u a n t i f i e dt od a t e .M o r e o v e r ,t h er e l a t i o n s h i pb e -tween parasitic chytrids and heterotrophic bacteria is largelyundescribed.SignificancePlanktonic microorganisms interact with each other in multi-farious ways, ultimately catalyzing the flow of carbon andenergy in diverse aquatic environments. However, crucial linksassociated with eukaryotic microparasites are still overlookedin planktonic networks. We addressed such links by studyingcryptic interactions between parasitic fungi, phytoplankton,and bacteria using a model pathosystem. Our results demonstratethat parasitic fungi profoundly modified microbial interactionsthrough several mechanisms (e.g ., transferring photosyntheticcarbon to infecting fungi, stimulating bacterial colonization onphytoplankton cells, and altering the community composition ofbacteria and their acquisition of p hotosynthetic carbon). Hence,fungal microparasites can substantially shape the microbiallymediated carbon flow at the base of aquatic food webs andshould be considered as crucial members within planktoncommunities.Author contributions: I.K., S.V.d.W., and A.E.D. designed research; I.K., S.V.d.W., A.E.P.,N.A.-G., and M.J.W. performed research; H.-P.G. and A.E.D. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; I.K. analyzed data; and I.K. and A.E.D. wrote the paper with the input fromall coauthors.The authors declare no competing interest.This article is a PNAS Direct Submission.This open access article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0(CC BY) .1Present address: Department of Biological Oceanography, Leibniz Institute for Baltic SeaResearch, 18119 Rostock, Germany.2To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Thus, bacterial com-munities are intimately linked to phytoplankton abundances andproduction (33). Phytoplankton –bacteria interactions are particu-larly strong within the phycosphere, the region immediately sur-rounding individual phytoplankton cells (33 –35), where nutrientconcentrations are several-folds higher compared to the ambientwater (36, 37), and nutrient assimilation rates of phytoplankton-associated bacteria are at least twice as fast as those of their free-living counterparts (38, 39). Importantly, parasitic chytrids maydistort these phytoplankton –bacteria interactions within and out-side the phycosphere since they modulate substrate and nutrientavailabilities and presumably also bacterial activity and communitycomposition. The effects of this distortion are virtually unresolved,but the few available data indicate that chytrid infections alter thecomposition and concentration of DOC (40), while abundances offree-living bacteria increase (25, 40) or remain unchanged (24).To disentangle phytoplankton –fungi –bacteria interactions at amicrospatial single-cell scale —the scale at which phytoplankton,fungi, and bacteria intimately interact —we used one of the fewexisting model pathosystems, composed of the freshwater diatomAsterionella formosa , the chytrid Rhizophydiales sp., and coen-riched populations of heterotrophic bacteria. Our methodologyincluded dual stable-isotope incubations (13C-bicarbonate and15N-nitrate), single-cell –resolution secondary ion mass spec-trometry (SIMS) (IMS 1280 and NanoSIMS 50L), 16S rRNAgene/16S rRNA sequencing, microscopy (e.g., fluorescence insitu hybridization [FISH]), and nutrient analyses. We particularlyfocused on the initial C transfer from the phytoplankton host toparasitic chytrids, which we term the “fungal shunt, ”as part ofthe mycoloop. The objectives were twofold: 1) quantifying thetransfer of photosynthetic C from phytoplankton cells to infec-tious chytrids, cell-associated bacteria, and free-living bacteriaand 2) characterizing the effect of parasitic fungi on bacterialpopulations, considering bacterial abundances, bacterial –diatomattachment, single-cell activity rates, and community composi-tion. The obtained data challenge the common perception ofaquatic microbial food webs by demonstrating the significant rolethat parasitic fungi can play in microbial community structure,interactions, and element cycling during phytoplankton growth.ResultsCharacterization of the Cocultures. Our experiments includedstable-isotope incubations of noninfected and chytrid-infecteddiatom cocultures —referred to as noninfected and infected treat-ment, respectively. Both cultur es included the colony-formingfreshwater diatom A. formosa (star-like colonies composed of 4to 10 individual cells) and mixed populations of cell-associated andfree-living bacteria (Fig. 1). On day 0, the designated infectedtreatment was inoculated with the chytrid Rhizophydiales sp., whichwas present as sessile Asterionella -associated sporangia and free-living zoospores, both being part of the asexual life cycle of chy-trids (Fig. 1 A)( 4 1 –43). The noninfected treatment remainedwithout chytrid inoculum. Both cultures were subsampled on day 0,2, and 6, during which Asterionella abundances increased to 1.5 ±0.2×105and 1.3 ±0.4×105cells·mL−1in noninfected and in-fected cultures, respectively ( P=0.50, SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1a n dTable S1 ). In the infected treatment, up to 27% of the Asterionellapopulation was infected by day 6. S ince infection prevalence wash i g h e s to nt h a td a y ,w ep r e s e n t data from day 6 herein, unlessstated otherwise.Chlorophyll aconcentrations ( ∼30 to 90 ng ·mL−1) weresimilar in both treatments throughout the entire 6-d period, butphaeopigments ( ∼2t o1 5n g ·mL−1) were significantly higheron day 6 in the infected treatment (see SI Appendix , Table S2 forstatistics). Nutrient conditions were replete in both treatments(350 to 420 nmol ·mL−1nitrate and ∼35 nmol ·mL−1solublereactive phosphorous [SRP]). Concentrations of dissolved silica(∼0.2 to 1.6 nmol ·mL−1) were comparable on day 0 and 2 butsignificantly higher in the infected treatment on day 6. TotalDOC concentrations ( ∼70 to 140 nmol ·mL−1) were equal inboth treatments on all sampling days, but on day 6, the13C en-richment in the DOC pool was significantly higher in the infectedtreatment (4.0 ±0.4 versus 4.9 ±0.013C atom percent [atom%]excess, P=0.0001). DOC production rates were similar in bothtreatments ( ∼20 nmol C ·d−1·mL−1,SI Appendix , Table S2 ).Bacterial Abundances, Community Composition, and Potential Activity.Using fluorescence microscopy, we classified bacteria as 1) free-living bacteria and diatom-associated bacteria based on their at-tachment to different types of Asterionella cells, including 2)noninfected, 3) infected, 4) postinfected, and 5) decaying cells(Fig. 1). Noninfected Asterionella were recognized as healthy, in-tact cells; infected Asterionella showed ongoing infections with amature epibiotic zoosporangium (herein sporangium); post-infected Asterionella displayed remains of chytrid-related chitinstructures as a sign of previous infections after zoospore discharge;and decaying cells showed low levels of autofluorescence but nosigns of previous infections, and thus they were most likely notinvolved in chytrid infections. The abundance of diatom-associated bacteria was lowest in conjunction with noninfectedAsterionella (9.2±7.6 bacteria diatom−1) and increased on in-fected, postinfected, and decaying Asterionella (22.4 ±16.7, 34.1 ±17.4, and 38.7 ±19.2 bacteria diatom−1, respectively, Fig. 2 A).Moreover, in the infected treatment, we distinguished betweennoninfected colonies (zero infections, Fig. 1 B) and infected colo-nies (at least one infected Asterionella cell in addition to nonin-fected cells, Fig. 1 C). Noninfected Asterionella cells within infectedcolonies were more heavily colonized by bacteria than noninfectedAsterionella cells within noninfected colonies (15.2 ±9.7 versus9.2±7.6 bacteria diatom−1). In total, bacteria associated withpost/infected Asterionella comprised 43% of the diatom-associatedpopulation although only 27% of the Asterionella population waspost/infected. In the free-living community, bacterial abundanceswere not significantly different between treatments ( ∼9×106bacteria mL−1,P=0 . 9 5 ,F i g .2 A). See SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 1 fordetailed numbers and statistics of diatom and bacterial abun-dances (including FISH-identified cells, described below).Bacterial communities of Asterionella -associated and free-living bacteria (size-fractionated after gentle filtration and ana-lyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were composed mostly ofBacteroidetes, (59 to 86%), followed by Gammaproteobacteria(11 to 26%) and Alphaproteobacteria (2 to 15%, ranges reflectthe variability across both Asterionella -associated and free-livingpopulations, Fig. 2 C). By contrast, 16S rRNA reads [a proxy forpotential protein synthesis (i.e., potential activity) (44)] weredominated by Gammaproteobacteria (42 to 88%) and to a lesserextent by Bacteroidetes (4 to 52%) and Alphaproteobacteria(2 to 19%). On a genus level, Allorhizobium –Neorhizobium –Pararhizobium –Rhizobium (Alphaproteobacteria) was propor-tionally overrepresented in diatom-associated bacteria ( ∼9% ofthe 16S rRNA gene reads) compared to free-living bacteria(0.5%). Contrariwise, the genera/families Sediminibacterium(Bacteriodetes), Sandarakinorhabdus (Alphaproteobacteria),Methyloversatilis ,Oxalobacteraceae ,Limnohabitans ,Caenimonas ,and Polaromonas (all Gammaproteobacteria) were present inthe free-living population (0.4 to 12% of the 16S rRNA genereads) but virtually absent in the diatom-associated population (0to 0.3%, ranges reflect different genera/families).The bacterial community composition in infected cultures hadsignificantly diverged from that in noninfected cultures 6 d afterchytrid inoculation ( P≤0.025), whereas potential activities werenot statistically different ( P≥0.07, PERMANOVA based onweighted UniFrac distances, Fig. 2 Cand SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ).Several taxa demonstrated statistically significant differences2o f1 1 |PNAS Klawonn et al.https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102225118 Characterizing the “fungal shunt ”: Parasitic fungi on diatoms affect carbon flow andbacterial communities in aquatic microbial food websDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY on April 9, 2023 from IP address 140.116.25.141.(P<0.01) in their relative abundances and potential activitiesbetween treatments, including Lacihabitans ,Flavobacterium ,Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes), and Caulobacter (Alphap-roteobacteria), which all showed an increase in their ampliconsequence variant (ASV) counts upon chytrid infection, andBrevundimonas (Alphaproteobacteria), whose ASV counts de-creased (Fig. 2 CandSI Appendix , Table S5 ).Based on the 16S rRNA gene –derived bacterial communitycomposition, we chose three previously designed FISH probes todetermine abundances of Bacteriodetes (probe CF319a), Gam-maproteobacteria [probe BONE23A targeting Burkholderiales,formerly Betaproteobacteria (45)], and Alphaproteobacteria(probe ALF968). These FISH-identified classes showed rathersimilar relative abundances (22 to 46%, Fig. 2 B, statistics aregiven in SI Appendix , Table S1 ), whereas 16S rRNA gene readsindicated substantially higher proportions of Bacteriodetescompared to Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria (see above).FISH-identified Gammaproteobacteria were more abundant onpost/infected and decaying Asterionella cells (43 to 46% relativeabundance) compared to noninfected Asterionella (25 to 32%,P<0.05, ranges reflect different Asterionella types in bothtreatments). A similar trend was observed for Bacteroidetes as-sociated with post/infected and decaying Asterionella cells (32 to36%) and noninfected Asterionella (28 to 31%), but this trendwas not statistically significant ( P>0.05). In contrast, Alphap-roteobacteria were more abundant on noninfected Asterionellacells (37 to 45%) than on post/infected and decaying cells (31 to38%). In the free-living community, Bacteroidetes were mostabundant (33% relative abundance), with no statistically signif-icant difference between treatments, while Alphaproteobacteriaand Gammaproteobacteria were less abundant in the infectedversus noninfected culture (22 versus 26% and 28 versus 31%,respectively, Fig. 2 B, statistics are included in SI Appendix ,Table S1 ).Cell-Specific C Transfer and Nitrogen-Based Growth Rates. Usingstable-isotope tracer incubations (13C-dissolved inorganic C [i.e.,13C-DIC] and15N-nitrate) in combination with SIMS, wequantified the cell-to-cell transfer of photosynthates and cell-specific N-based growth rates. We did not detect any sequences ofautotrophic cyanobacteria in the 16S rRNA gene dataset or anyautofluorescent bacteria under the microscope. Moreover, hetero-trophic CO2assimilation is unlikely or minimal under nutrient-replete conditions (46). Asterionella was thus expected to representthe only C-fixing organism that utilized the supplied13C-DIC, whileany13C enrichment in fungal and bacterial cells was due to sec-ondary C transfer from Asterionella . In contrast,15N-nitrate wasbioavailable to all cells via direct uptake. Therefore,15N-enrichmentsA BCDEFGFig. 1. Cell types in the model pathosystem.

For free-living bacteria, we distin-guished cells as Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, andBacteroidetes by prior identification with FISH.In infected cultures,13C enrichments were higher for nonin-fected and infected diatoms, their associated sporangia, andzoospores (7.2 ±1.1, 8.2 ±1.2, 8.4 ±1.3 and 7.8 ±1.1 atom%excess, respectively) than for bacteria (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix ,Table S3 ). Among cell-associated bacteria,13C enrichments werelower in bacteria that were involved in chytrid infections (colo-nizing infected and postinfected Asterionella cells and fungalsporangia; 5.5 ±3.6, 5.9 ±3.9, and 2.9 ±0.6 atom% excess,respectively) compared to bacteria not involved with fungal in-fections (colonizing noninfected and decaying Asterionella ; 6.5±3.3 and 8.0 ±4.0 atom% excess, respectively). Moreover, thepresence of chytrids induced a split in bacterial subpopulations.That is, in the noninfected treatment, bacteria on decaying dia-toms displayed a uniform data distribution across the range of13C enrichments (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, in the infected treatment,bacteria on post/infected and dec aying diatoms showed a bimodaldata distribution, with the over-re presentation of one bacterial sub-population of low13C enrichment on post/infected Asterionella andone subpopulation of high13C enrichment overrepresented ondecaying Asterionella .T h el o w e s t13Ca n d15N enrichments were foundin free-living bacteria (range of means: 1.8 to 2.613C atom% excessand 1.0 to 1.515N atom% excess), of which GammaproteobacteriaCBAFig. 2.

N-based growth rates decreasedfrom bacteria associated with noninfected and decaying diatoms(0.17 to 0.19 d−1) to those associated with post/infected diatoms(0.12 to 0.15 d−1). For Asterionella , cell-specific N-based growthrates (0.19 to 0.23 d−1, derived from SIMS) compared well withtheir population-specific growth rates (0.21 to 0.24 d−1, derivedfrom cell counts). The population-specific growth of free-livingbacteria was 0.26 to 0.27 d−1(i.e., faster than implied by onlynitrate assimilation). The population-specific growth of sporan-gia was 0.64 d−1, exceeding the growth of Asterionella .In some instances, we were able to analyze13C and15N isotoperatios in host cells ( Asterionella or sporangia) and their directhost-associated cells (sporangia or bacteria). The13C atom%excess in Asterionella and their associated sporangia followed atrend close to a 1:1 ratio, with a slope of linear regression beingsignificantly different from zero ( R2=0.57, P=8×10−6,Fig. 5 A). The13C atom% excess of Asterionella and their asso-ciated bacteria also scattered close to a 1:1 ratio, but the linearregression was not significant ( P=0.52). Sporangia were sparselycolonized by bacteria, and thus we could only analyze six spo-rangia and their associated bacteria. Nevertheless, these few cellsindicated that sporangia were more enriched in13C than theirassociated bacteria. The15N atom% excess of all host –associatepairings followed a trend close to a 1:1 ratio, with significantlinear regression ( R2=0.38 to 0.86, P≤0.008, Fig. 5 B).C Transfer within the Model Pathosystem. By quantifying cell-specific13C incorporation, we were able to track the C transferfrom phototrophic Asterionella to cogrowing chytrids and bacteria.As an index of C transfer efficiency, we calculated the percent of13C enrichment in a given cell type (i.e., sporangia, bacteria, or theDOC pool) relative to the13C enrichment in its source cell(i.e., diatoms or sporangia). The C transfer efficiency from dia-toms to sessile sporangia was 102%, to free-swimming zoospores95%, to Asterionella -associated bacteria 67 to 98%, to free-livingbacteria 28 to 32%, and to the DOC pool 58 to 68% (Fig. 6 A,t h epercentage for sporangia exceeding 100% might be explained bythe high cell-to-cell variability in13C enrichments within cellpopulations). The transfer efficiency from sporangia to their as-sociated bacteria was 34%. Bacteria associated with healthyAsterionella cells acquired, on average, relatively more photosyn-thetic C than those associated with chytrid-infected Asterionella(90 to 98% versus 67% C transfer efficiency, Fig. 6 A). We furtherfollowed the fate of diatom-derived C within individual nonin-fected versus chytrid-infected Asterionella and its associated cells(not including any transfer to the ambient water). In noninfectedAsterionella cells, 99% of the diatom-derived C was maintained intheAsterionella cell, while 1% was transferred to its associatedbacteria. By comparison, in infected Asterionella cells, the diatomcell maintained only 45% of its C biomass, 53% was directed tothe infecting sporangia, and 2% to associated bacteria.C Transfer within a Natural Plankton Population. To extrapolate thepartitioning of photosynthetically derived C between microplank-ton groups in a natural community, we applied our quantitativesingle-cell data to literature-derived data of a chytrid-infectedAsterionella population ( Asterionella abundance and infectionprevalence) in Lake Maarsseveen (Netherlands) during spring2009 (47). For this natural Asterionella population, we estimate that20% of the photosynthetically derived C was transmitted to thechytrid population at the prevalence peak (54% infection preva-lence, Fig. 6 B).

In contrast, in a scenario without chytrid in-fections, Asterionella populations would have retained 75% ofthe photosynthetic C, 1% would have been incorporated byAsterionella -associated bacteria, and 24% released as DOC.DiscussionThe first Asterionella –chytrid pathosystem was discovered in themid-20th century in British Lakes (48). Since then, numerousrecords of parasitic chytrids have been made on a wide range ofphytoplankton taxa in freshwater (49 –52) and coastal marinewaters across various climate zones (16, 17, 53 –56). Neverthe-less, fungal –phytoplankton parasitism remains poorly consideredin microbial networks —owing to the limited availability of em-pirical data and model systems (11). To shed light on theseenigmatic interactions, we studied tripartite cross-kingdom inter-actions between parasitic fungi, phytoplankton, and cogrowingbacteria. As discussed in the following, these interactions sub-stantially impact microbial communities and the fate of photo-synthetic C, as C is channeled through the fungal shunt.Parasitic Fungi Modulate Bacterial Abundances and CommunityCompositions. Asterionella cells infected by fungi were 2 to 4 timesmore heavily colonized by heterotrophic bacteria, particularly byBurkholderiales and also Bacteroidetes, as compared to nonin-fected Asterionella cells. This promotion in bacterial colonizationimplies that post/infected cells represented hotspots of leakingnutrient plumes, which commonly encourage bacterial chemotaxis(37, 57 –59). As a result, post/infected Asterionella showed a moresimilar colonization pattern to decaying diatoms than to healthydiatoms (Fig. 2). The preferential colonization of FISH-identifiedBurkholderiales and Bacteroidetes on post/infected and decayingAsterionella is consistent with their ability to chemotax towardlysing cells (60, 61). Additionally, those bacterial classes areknown as competitive taxa during phytoplankton blooms in lakesand marine systems (62 –65), with a copiotrophic, often particle-associated lifestyle (66).The 16S rRNA gene –derived community compositions ofAsterionella -associated and free-living bacteria significantly di-verged between noninfected and chytrid-infected cultures, asinfection prevalence reached 27%, but overall taxonomic compo-sitions remained rather similar, even at the genus level (Fig. 2 C).Recently, saprotrophic chytrids (as opposed to the parasitic chytridsstudied here) were shown to shape field-sampled bacterial com-munities on artificial chitin beads at the order level within 1 d ofinoculation (67), demonstrating that rapid taxonomic shifts are notunprecedented. Abundances of free-living bacteria were similar inABCFig. 4.

Thus, at the hereinstudied epidemic stage, the presence of chytrids affected abun-dances and taxonomy of Asterionella -associated bacteria and thetaxonomy for free-living bacteria. Abundances and taxonomiesmight have continued to diverge b etween noninfected and infectedcommunities as the epidemic progressed.C Transfer within the Phycosphere during Fungal Infections. In ad-dition to physical attachment, microbial interactions typicallyinclude the exchange of nutrients. Since infected Asterionella andepibiotic sporangia showed equal13C enrichments (Figs. 4 –6),we conclude that fungal sporangia efficiently siphoned C fromthe host cell, thereby deriving their entire C content from thediatom host. Thus, fungal rhizoids functioned as direct pipelinesof nutrients from the host ’s interior to the sporangium on thehost’s exterior. Individual sporangia received approximately one-half (53%) of the host ’s C biomass. Hence, on average, twosporangia per Asterionella cell may develop to its full capacity inthe herein-investigated pathosystem. More than two infectionsmay instead lead to smaller sporangia, which were previouslyfound to produce fewer zoospores during late epidemic stageswhen host abundances are limiting (68). Zoospores also received∼100% of their cellular C content from diatom-derived photo-synthesis. This finding supports the hypothesis that zoospores relyentirely on their endogenous reserves and do not feed after beingdischarged from the sporangium and while foraging for a new host(69). The efficiency of C transfer from Asterionella to their asso-ciated bacteria was higher (67 to 98%) than for sporangia-associated bacteria (34%), similar to free-living cells (32%). Theincorporation of photosynthates was thus at least twice as efficientat the diatom –water interface as compared to the sporangium –water interface, indicating that chitinous cell walls were effectiveseals for nutrient leakage, and/or the sporangia-associated bacteriawere poor in incorporating fungal-derived C.The acquisition of photosynthates by Asterionella -associatedbacteria was highly dependent on the infection status of the di-atom cell and colony (Fig. 4 B). Bacterial colonization and13Cincorporation tended to be higher on noninfected Asterionellacells within partly infected colonies than on noninfected cells inentirely noninfected colonies, demonstrating that infections af-fected adjacent seemingly healthy Asterionella cells within the samecolony, likely due to enhanced enzymatic activity and nutrientprovisioning. Bacterial attachment was also promoted on post/in-fected diatoms; however, those bacteria acquired, on average,fewer photosynthates compared to bacteria on healthy Asterionellacells during the 6-d incubation period (67 versus 90 to 98% Ctransfer efficiency). The cell-to-cell variability in13C incorporationbyAsterionella -associated bacteria was high, implying differentpatterns in C utilization of those bacteria and/or different resi-dence times on their diatom host. We propose that chytrid-inducedcell lysis of diatoms —as indicated by, for example, high concen-trations of phaeopigments as a degradation product of chlorophylla—promoted bacteria that grew opportunistically on the lysingAsterionella cells. Healthy Asterionella cells and their associatedbacteria may instead have engaged in mutualistic relationships.Considering the bimodal distribution of13C enrichments in bac-teria that were associated with post/infected Asterionella (Fig. 4 B),we hypothesize that high13C enrichments were related to mutu-alistic bacteria, which resided on their diatom host on longer termsand thus received photosynthetic C from Asterionella effectivelyduring the entire or most of the incubation period. In contrast, low13C enrichments were likely linked to opportunistic bacteria, whichcolonized Asterionella cells during and/or after infection and thuswith shorter residence times. Hence, chytrid infections potentiallyshifted the nature of phytoplankton –bacteria interactions frommutualism to opportunism within the phycosphere, which remainsto be confirmed in future studies. We expect that, compared to theherein-used nutrient-replete culture system, the observed shifts inmicrobial interaction and also taxonomy are even more pro-nounced in field populations, where microbial communities are morediverse and microbial interactions especially crucial to sustaininggrowth under in situ, often low-nutrient conditions [e.g., byexchanging N (70), iron (71), sulfur (72), or vitamins (73)].The nutritional linkage between Asterionella and fungal spo-rangia was the strongest observed due to the most efficient Ctransfer (Fig. 6 A) and their synchronized C and N growth (Fig. 5).By contrast, the transfer of photosynthates from Asterionella totheir associated bacteria was weakly correlated despite synchro-nized N-based growth rates, likely due to the above-mentionedhigh cell-to-cell variability. N-based growth rates of Asterionella -associated bacteria were up to twice as fast as for their free-livingcounterparts, although nitrate was replete in the medium for bothfree-living and cell-associated bacteria. We therefore presume thatthe growth of diatom-associated bacteria within the phycospherewas promoted by the provision of, for example, sulfur, tracemetals, and detoxifying byproducts, besides C and N, as commonin diatom –bacteria interactions (72, 74 –78).The Potential Impact of Parasitic Fungi on DOC. The Asterionellapopulation investigated here released 18% of its newly fixed C asDOC, within the range of 2 to 50% previously reported forphytoplankton in various habitats (28). Population-level DOCproduction rates were equal with and without infection, but in-terestingly, the DOC pool was significantly more enriched in13Cin the infected culture. We interpret this finding as an enhancedliberation of recently fixed13C into the DOC pool and/or as ashift in DOC composition and bioavailability upon chytrid infec-tions. Indeed, chytrid infections have been demonstrated to leadto less labile (tryptophan-like substances) and more semilabilematerial (humic-like substances) in the DOC pool (40). In ourincubations, DOC concentrations exceeded the bacterial C de-mand, and thus bacteria could be selective in their DOC-compoundassimilation. If we assume that chytrid-infected Asterionella re-leased C substrates that were less bioavailable than those releasedby healthy Asterionella , bacteria might have discriminated againstthose less-bioavailable substrate s, potentially leading to the ob-served higher13C-DOC enrichment in chytrid-infected versusnoninfected cultures. This sugges tion, however, remains to be val-idated in future studies.B AFig. 5.

For a natural lacustrine system, we esti-mated that 20% of the photosynthetically derived C was directedto chytrids during an epidemic with 54% infection prevalence(Fig. 6 B). This percentage conforms with data derived fromlarge-scale food web modeling, suggesting that 19 to 21% ofprimary production is transferred from phytoplankton to para-sitic chytrids (79, 80). In the model, the authors used a mesoscalemass balance approach, while we provide empirical data directlyquantifying cell-to-cell C transfer rates between phytoplankton,parasitic chytrids, and bacteria. Remarkably, the fungi-mediatedC flow is similar in magnitude to those through the microbialloop or viral shunt. The microbial loop shuttles 10 to 50% ofphotosynthetic C from primary producers to heterotrophic bac-teria, which can be subsequently grazed by flagellates or ciliates,recycled as DOC, or respired back to inorganic C (32). The viralshunt has been estimated to liberate 2 to 10% of photosyntheticC to the DOC pool during viral-induced cell lysis (81), therebystimulating C transfer from phytoplankton to free-living bacteria(82) and thus microbe-mediated remineralization (83, 84). Asopposed to the viral shunt, we suggest that parasitic chytridsshunt photosynthetic C to the particulate organic C pool since wedemonstrated that C is most efficiently transferred to attachedsporangia, and the therein developed zoospores, which, as shownpreviously, are grazed by micro- and mesozooplankton (23 –27).Moreover, chytrid infections accelerated diatom decay, stimu-lating bacterial colonization (by potentially opportunistic bacte-ria that thrive on decaying organic particles). However, chytridsreduced the overall photosynthetically active biomass and thusalso the phytoplankton-derived contribution to the DOC pool.For instance, at an infection prevalence of 54%, this contributiondecreased from 24 to 19%. We term this fungal-induced diver-sion of photosynthetic C from the microbial loop to parasiticchytrids the fungal shunt, as part of the previously describedmycoloop (22). In this vein, we propose that the fungal shuntpromotes zooplankton-mediated over microbe-mediated remi-neralization (Fig. 7).Our results demonstrate that parasitic fungi modulatephytoplankton –bacteria interactions and divert significant fractionsof photosynthetically derived C from the classically understoodmicrobial loop. Hence, given that parasitic chytrids are distributedin highly relevant aquatic systems, such as areas impacted byABFig. 6.

The model pathosystem comprised the diatom host A.formosa and the parasitic chytrid Rhizophydiales sp., isolated from LakeStechlin (Northern Germany) in December 2016. Bacteria were coisolatedwith the diatom –chytrid system and maintained in coculture in nutrient-replete medium for several months, which likely selected for copiotrophictaxa. Batch cultures, comprising Asterionella , the chytrid, and bacteria, weregrown in CHU-10 medium at constant temperature (17 °C). The light regimewas 16:8 h, providing 40 μE·s−1·m−2during the 16-h light phase. Aster-ionella was pregrown until entering the early exponential phase ( ∼3.6×104cells·mL−1) and thereafter split as 8 ×650 mL into 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks. Ofthose, 6 ×650 mL were amended with isotope tracers, while 2 ×650 mLwere left without isotope amendments, serving as controls for later isotopeanalyses. Isotopes were added as predissolved13C-DIC and15N-nitrate (bothSigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, half of the incubation flasks (3 ×with isotopeaddition/1 ×without) were inoculated with an Asterionella –Rhizophydialescoculture —referred to as infected treatment. The onset infection prevalencewas 2%, including infected diatom cells (with encysted zoospore or maturesporangia) and postinfected cells (with rhizoid remains). The inoculum volumewas minor with 8 mL, equal to ∼1% of 650 mL. The additional 4 ×650 mL (3 ×with isotope addition/1 ×without) were left without Rhizophydiales —referredto as noninfected treatment —but we added 8 mL of nonlabeled medium toaccount for the isotope dilution in the infected treatment. Each replicate wassubsampled on day 0 and after 2 and 6 d, except for samples for raw fluo-rescence, which were taken daily.Culture Characterization. Subsamples were taken for the following parame-ters and analyses: 1) raw fluorescence and pigment analyses (chlorophyll aand phaeopigments) via fluorometry, 2) enumeration of diatoms, zoospores,sporangia, and bacteria via microscopy, 3) bacterial community analyses by16S rRNA gene/16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and FISH, 4) single-cell isotopeanalyses via SIMS, 5) bulk isotope analyses (13C-DIC,13C-DOC,13C-particulateorganic C/15N-particulate organic N, and15N-nitrate) using mass spectrometry,and 6) nutrient analyses by flow analysis and spectrometry (nitrate, SRP, anddissolved silica) or combustion catalytic oxidation (DOC, SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 6 ).Detailed information on each sampling, analytical procedure, and calculation,as well as complementary data are presented in the SI Appendix , while in thefollowing we provide only a short methodological description.Nucleic Acid Extraction and Amplicon Sequencing of Bacterial Communities.Bacteria associated with large diatom colonies ( >5μm) were collectedonto 5.0- μm polycarbonate (PC) filters, while free-living bacteria were col-lected onto 0.2- μm PC filters from the 5.0- μm filtrate (i.e., the water thatpassed through the 5.0- μm filters). This separation of cell-associated andfree-living bacteria may be seen as a snapshot of cell association since somebacteria may alternate between attachment and detachments. DNA andRNA were extracted, and the RNA converted to complementary DNA (cDNA)as previously described (87, 88). The 16S rRNA –encoding DNA and cDNAwere amplified using the primer set 515F/926R (V4 to V5 region) (89) fol-lowing ref. 90. Illumina Sequencing (MiSeq PE250) was performed at theUniversity of California, Davis Genome Center. Amplicon sequences wereanalyzed following ref. 91 in R (version 3.6.1) (92). The SILVA 138 SSU (smallsubunit) database was used for assigning taxonomy to each ASV.Abundances of Diatoms, Zoospores, Sporangia, and Bacteria. Samples for di-atom, sporangium, and zoospore enumeration were preserved with Lugoland analyzed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TiE, 400 ×magnification). Chitinous cell walls of sporangia were visualized with wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488) (93) (Fig. 1 C). Samplesfor bacterial enumeration were preserved with paraformaldehyde (1.5%final concentration) and filtered onto PC filters (0.2 μm). Bacterial abun-dances were determined on filters that were WGA- and 4 ′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained, using fluorescence microscopy (1,000 ×). Fur-thermore, we conducted catalyzed reported deposition-FISH (CARD-FISH)following refs. 90 and 94 to quantify the major bacterial taxa, as inferredfrom the sequencing analyses. The probes included: ALF968 (Alphaproteo-bacteria), CF319a (Bacteroidia), and BONE23A (specific to the gammapro-teobacterial order Burkholderiales, formerly Betaproteobacteria). Thoseprobes covered well the entire bacterial community since the FISH-identifiedcells represented 102 ±12% of the DAPI-stained bacteria ( n=9 different celltypes, range: 83 to 117%).SIMS. To quantify the incorporation of13C-DIC and15N-nitrate into singlecells ( Asterionella , sporangia, zoospores, and bacteria), cells were collectedonto PC filters and analyzed with two types of CAMECA ion microprobes,the IMS 1280 (at the Natural History Museum, Stockholm) and the Nano-SIMS 50L (at the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities). The NanoSIMS offers ahigher spatial resolution ( ∼100 nm) than the IMS 1280 (1,000 nm), but thelatter allows for a higher sample throughput, and its higher primary ionbeam current facilitates the removal of silica frustules in diatoms. Ac-cordingly, we analyzed diatoms (l ×w×h=20×5×5μm) and sporangia(d=5μm) preferentially (but not excl usively) on the IMS 1280, whereasbacteria (d =1t o2 μm) and zoospores (d =2μm) were exclusively analyzedon the NanoSIMS. Analyses were done on cells sampled on day 6, exceptfor some diatoms and sporangia, which were also analyzed from day 2(data of diatoms and sporangia from day 2 are only included in Fig. 5 toprovide a wider range of isotope enrichments, otherwise the data pre-sentation and interpretation are based entirely on cells sampled on day 6).Free-living bacteria were differenti ated as Alphaproteobacteria, Gam-maproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia using CARD-FISH in combination withNanoSIMS (FISH –SIMS) but we did not target any diatom-associated bac-teria via FISH –SIMS since the differentiation between hybridized andnonhybridized cells was ambiguous on the final SIMS images due to anuneven topography of diatom frustules. SIMS analyses were conducted asdescribed previously (90, 95).Isotope Ratios, C Transfer, and N-Based Growth Rates. Single-cell isotope ratioswere defined based on the collected ions as:15N/14N=15N12C−/14N12C−(IMS1280 and NanoSIMS),13C/12C=13C14N−/12C14N−(IMS 1280), or13C/12C=12C13C−/12C2−×0.5 (NanoSIMS). In the latter, the factor 0.5 is explained bythe probability of generating12C2−and12C13C−ions from12C−and13C−. Dueto reasons of instrument tuning and higher ion yields, we used the diatomic12C2−and12C13C−ions instead of the monoatomic12C−and13C−ions forcalculating NanoSIMS-derived13C/12C ratios ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ). Ratioswere corrected for instrumental mass fractionation using control cells (96)and for isotope dilution during sample preparation using herein-determineddilution factors (97 –99) and finally converted to atom% excess (96). The CFig. 7. Scheme of C transfer pathways within planktonic food webs. Thefungal shunt (solid, turquoise arrows) diverts phytoplankton-derived C tochytrid sporangia and their free-swimming zoospores, promoting C transferto higher trophic levels and bypassing the microbial loop (schematicallyshown as dashed ellipse) and viral shunt. The fungal shunt together with thesubsequent consumption of zoospores by micro- and mesozooplankton aredescribed as the mycoloop. The solid arrows indicate pathways investigatedin this study. For simplicity purposes, the scheme does not embrace the fullcomplexity of C transfer pathways between the shown plankton groups.Klawonn et al.

To determinecell-specific N-based growth rates, we calculated the fraction of newly in-corporated N by single cells relative to their initial N content following ref.100. For comparison, we also calculated growth rates for entire cell pop-ulations (i.e., population-specific growth rates, based on cell counts).Extrapolating C Transfer in a Natural System. To budget C flows in a naturalplankton community during a chytrid epidemic, we used data on Asterionellapopulations ( Asterionella and chytrid abundances) in Lake Maarsseveen(Netherlands) in spring 2009 (47) and combined those data with the herein-determined cell-specific diatom-derived C contents, absolute C contents,DOC production rates, and abundances of diatoms-associated bacteria.Data Availability.
