Experimentswere performed on partial nitri ﬁcation sludge with di ﬀerent inﬂ uent matrices, and optimal experimental op-erational conditions were established. The carbon ﬁxation pathway of ammonia-oxidizing sludge was de-termined via13C isotope tracers and qPCR. The denitri ﬁcation eﬀ ect was better when the NH 4+-N, HCO 3–,C a2+,Mg2+, and microbial accelerant concentrations were 15, 250, 113, 100 and 1 mL/L, respectively. The nitriteaccumulation rate reached 96.95%.13C isotope tracing showed that13C abundance in sludge increased sig-niﬁcantly. The results showed that IC added into the in ﬂuent participated in the carbon metabolism of micro-organisms. The functional gene cbbL, which follows the Calvin cycle carbon sequestration pathway, was iden-tiﬁed in the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and the eﬀ ect of inﬂ uent NH 4+-N on the gene abundance was greaterthan that of other substrates.1. IntroductionAnaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), a relatively new auto-trophic denitri ﬁcation method, has developed into an e ﬃcient, eco-nomical, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional deni-triﬁcation processes ( Okabe et al., 2011 ). In this biological process,nitrite and ammonium are directly converted to nitrogen and waterwithout oxygen and organic carbon. Anammox has the advantages ofhigher nitrogen removal rates, lower operation costs, lower surplussludge yields, and lower space requirements ( J Gijs, 2008; Ma et al.,2016; Meng et al., 2017 ). Full-scale anammox has been successfullyapplied to the treatment of high-nitrogen wastewater, includinghttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122101Received 15 July 2019; Received in revised form 29 August 2019; Accepted 31 August 2019⁎Corresponding author.E-mail address: 2010053@glut.edu.cn (W.

All rights reserved.Tdigested sludge, land ﬁll leachate, and pharmaceutical wastewater ( Jin& Zhang, 2016; Lackner et al., 2014; Strous et al., 1998; Yamamotoet al., 2007).Partial nitri ﬁcation is a preprocess in anammox and uses ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to oxidize a proportion (about 56%) of NH 4+-N in wastewater to NO 2–-N under aerobic conditions ( Wei et al., 2018 ).It is a necessary pretreatment, because anammox depends on the con-centration ratio of NH 4+-N to NO 2–-N in in ﬂow water. Anammox bac-teria convert NO 2–-N and residual NH 4+-N to nitrogen under anaerobicconditions, thus shortening the redox process from NH 4+-N to N 2(Kartal et al., 2010). Therefore, partial nitri ﬁcation is key to the suc-cessful operation of anammox to e ﬃciently produce NO 2–-N fromsludge. The key microorganisms in the combined process of anammoxand partial nitri ﬁcation are AOB and anammox bacteria, which arechemoautotrophic microorganisms ( Strous et al., 1999a ). They can useinorganic carbon (IC) as a carbon source for their own cell synthesis, sothey have a certain carbon sequestration capacity ( Wang et al., 2018 ),so that the process of anammox and partial nitri ﬁcation does not needadditional organic carbon sources ( Jetten et al., 2002). In partial ni-triﬁcation, IC is not only an important carbon source for bacterial as-similation but also plays an important role in the regulation of bio-chemical reactions, e.g., microbial activity ( Guisasola et al., 2006 ).Therefore, AOB activity can be promoted by the addition of IC, andNO2–-N can consequently be e ﬃciently produced during partial ni-triﬁcation.Hitherto, ﬁve CO 2ﬁxation pathways have been identi ﬁed, namelythe pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle), reductive acetyl coenzymeA pathway, 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, reductive tricarboxylic acidcycle, and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydro-xybutyrate cycles ( Benson & Calvin, 1950; Buchanan & Arnon, 1990;Ragsdale, 1991; Shively et al., 1998; Sylvia et al., 2002 ). The Calvincycle is the main CO2-ﬁxation pathway in photoautotrophic micro-organisms and chemoautotrophic bacteria ( Ragsdale, 1991). Ribulose1,5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is the key enzyme controllingthe cycle rate. The properties of the enzyme are directly related to theﬁxation rate of atmospheric CO 2.Rubisco and its coding gene cbbL have been extensively studied inlaboratory environments. By using isotope tracing and determiningenzymatic activity, Stefan (2004) inferred that di ﬀerent AOB couldhave the same carbon ﬁxation pathway, possibly the Calvin cycle oracetyl coenzyme A pathway. Strous et al. (1999b) , by using macrogenomic technology, found that the genome of Candidatus Kuenenstuttgartiensis contained all the genes encoding the key enzymes of theacetyl coenzyme A pathway, showing that anaerobic AOB immobilizedcarbon through the acetyl coenzyme A pathway.However, few studies have been done on the carbon sequestrationpotential of partial nitri ﬁcation sludge in the anammox process, espe-cially in terms of the mechanism. In this study, AOB in partial ni-triﬁcation during anammox were simulated and sampled in real timefrom di ﬀerent substrates at various concentrations to establish the op-timal reaction conditions. IC in in ﬂuent water was labeled with13Cisotope tracers,13C isotope abundance in sludge was detected via stableisotope mass spectrometry, and the AOB carbon ﬁxation pathway wasdetermined via microbial molecular qPCR technology.2. Materials and methods2.1. Inoculated sludge and test waterThe in ﬂuent water was arti ﬁcially simulated wastewater. Matrixconditions with di ﬀerent substrates were divided into four groups:NH4+-N, IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant (RuichengEnvironmental Protection Consulting Company, Weifang, Shandong,China), named groups A to D, respectively. The microbial accelerantwas based on enzymatic enhancers, which can enhance the activity ofbiological reactions and promote proliferation ( Wang et al., 2019).These four groups were subdivided into four more groups ( Table 1). Theinﬂuent pH was adjusted by 0.5 mol/L NaOH and 0.5 mol/L H 2SO4buﬀer solutions ( Zhang & Jin, 2017). The inoculated sludge in the ex-periment was a partial nitri ﬁcation sludge domesticated and cultured inthe laboratory ( Jin et al., 2015). Partial nitri ﬁcation performance wastested by using the nitrite accumulation rate (NAR). The closer the NARis to 100%, the better the partial nitri ﬁcation e ﬀect is ( Dong et al.,2013 ). The NAR in this study was > 99%.2.2. Experimental setupThis study used a sequencing batch reactor, and the material wasplexiglass ( Ma et al., 2019). Three groups of parallel reaction deviceswere used. The volume of the reactor was 0.5 L, the hydraulic retentiontime was 1.5 h, and the temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen weremaintained at 32 ± 1 °C, 7.5 –7.8, and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, viawater bath heating ( Jin et al., 2015 ).Fig. 1 schematically illustrates thedevice and experimental setup.The siphon method was used for the test water intake and outlet. Tolet water in, one end of the intake pipe (silica gel tube) was connectedto the intake of the device and the other end to the arti ﬁcial waste-water. When the water was discharged, the silica gel tube was placed inthe supernatant, and the outlet was sealed during the operation of thereactor. When the in ﬂuent water was replaced, all the previouslytreated water was removed and replaced with ready-made arti ﬁcialwastewater.2.3. Analytical methodsThe eﬄuent and in ﬂuent of each reactor was stored in a 50 mLsampling bottle after passing through a 0.45 μmﬁlter membrane. Aftersampling, the samples was detected immediately or placed in a re-frigerator at 4 °C for testing ( Wenjie et al., 2014 ). Partial nitri ﬁcationsludge was stored in a refrigerator at −20 °C for molecular experi-ments. The water quality indexes were determined in this experimentusing NH4+-N, NO 2–-N, total nitrogen, and IC. NO 2–-N and NH 4+-N viathe colorimetric method according to standard methods ( Jin et al.,2016b ), and total nitrogen via alkaline potassium persulfate ultravioletTable 1Composition of wastewater used in the experiments.Groups Components A B C DA1 A2 A3 A4 B1 B2 B3 B4 C1 C2 C3 C4 D1 D2 D3 D4 (mg/L)(NH 4)2SO4 10 15 20 30 15 15 15NaHCO 3 250 150 250 500 750 250 250CaCl 2·2H2O 110 110 55 110 170 200 110MgSO 4·7H2O 100 100 50 100 150 175 100Microbial accelerant (mL/L) 1 1 1 0.5 1 1.5 1.75Na2S2O3 20 20 20 20KH2PO4 50 50 50 50X.

IC was detected via the totalorganic carbon analysis method with a total organic carbon analyzer(Multi N/C 3100, Analytik Jena, Germany) ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). ThepH/temperature was determined by PHS-3C acidity meter (Lei Ci,Shanghai Instrument and Electrical Science Instruments Co.,Ltd.,China) and DO was determined by portable dissolved oxygen meterHQ30d (Hach, USA).2.4. Analysis of CO2gasCO2gas was collected via a gas sampling bag at the exhaust valve atthe top of the gas collection barrel ( Jin et al., 2016a ). The CO 2contentin gas samples was determined via gas chromatography (ShanghaiJingke GC-112A, China) developed by the N(VI)2000 ChromatographyData Workstation (Institute of Intelligent Information, Zhejiang Uni-versity, China). The concentration of CO 2standard gas (produced byShanghai Shenkai Gas Co., Ltd., China) was 4.92%, and the equilibriumgas was argon. Chromatographic conditions were as follows: The carriergasﬂow rate was 4.0 mL/min, injector temperature was 70 °C, columnbox temperature was 35 °C, detector temperature was 120 °C, detectorcurrent was 110 mA, and injection volume was 1 mL. The CO2contentin the sample was calculated using equation (1). Each gas sample wasmeasured at least three times to obtain an average value.×=CCAA / CO s CO s22 (1)where CCO2is the CO 2content of the gas sample (mL), ACO2is the peakarea of CO 2in the gas sample ( μV·s−1),Csis the CO 2content in standardgas (mL), and Asis the peak area of CO 2in standard gas ( μV·s−1).Carbon sequestration rate was calculated by Formula (2).=−−×× ρCarbon sequestration rateIC IC 0.273 COICinf. eff. 2 COinf.2(2)where ICinf.is the input IC during 24 h, mg; ICeﬀis the output IC during24 h, mg; CO 2is the CO 2production during 24 h, mL; ρCO2is the densityof CO 2, g/L; The CO 2density is approximately 1.781 mg/mL underconditions of 30 °C and 101 kPa.2.5.13C abundance detectionThe13C isotope-labeled NaHCO 3was used as the IC source in theintake water. The experimental devices were composed of BLK, E, F,and G groups. E, F, and G were three groups of parallel reaction devicesusing NaHCO3as the in ﬂuent IC source, and BLK was a reaction deviceusing ordinary NaHCO 3as the in ﬂuent IC source. The treated isotopesludge was analyzed via stable isotope mass spectrometry (Delta VAdvantage, Thermo, German). The C isotope value of the sample was13C (VPDB). The13C abundances of the sample were calculated ac-cording to equation (3):= ∗ ∗+ ∗+ +CδCR R δCR R13 (%)100 ( 13 1000 ) / ( 13 1000 1000 ) rr rr(3)where R rrepresents13C/12C = 0.0112372 in the VPDB standardsample, and δ13C is the measured carbon isotope value (VPDB).2.6. DNA extraction and quantitative PCRThe initial sludge and groups A –D were frozen at −20 °C. TotalDNA was extracted from the granular sludge using the Power Soil ®DNAIsolation Kit (MoBio 12888 –50, USA). The concentration and purity ofextracted DNA were determined via micro-ultraviolet spectro-photometry (Q5000, Quawell, USA) ( Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,2016 ).Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using primer pairs cbbLR1-F/cbbL R1-R (forward primer was AAG GAY GAC GAG AAC ATC andreverse primer was TCG GTC GGS GTG TAG TTG AA) for the red-typeRubisco form I cbbL gene for the Calvin cycle ( Selesi et al., 2005). Thepuriﬁ ed PCR products were ligated into T-vectors using the pEASY ®-T3Cloning Kit (TransGen Biotech, China) and then transformed into Trans1-T2 Phage Resistant Chemically Competent Cells. Positive clones(white colonies) were randomly selected, and the plasmid DNA wasextracted using the Plasmid DNA Mini-Preps Kit (Sangon Biotech,China). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the plasmid DNA with a known copynumber were used to plot a standard curve.Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of partial nitri ﬁcation reactor.

Results and discussion3.1. Nitrogen removal performanceFig. 2 shows the changes in nitrogen in the groups A –D. The in-oculated sludge was obtained from the partial nitri ﬁcation sludge do-mesticated and cultured in laboratory and had a NAR of 99.4%.Therefore, each group of sludge had a good NAR. Fig. 2A shows thenitrogen changes in groups A1, A2, A3, and A4 under di ﬀerent in ﬂuentNH4+-N concentrations. With increased in ﬂuent NH 4+-N, the highestNH4+-N conversion and NO 2–-N accumulation rates (57 and 95.65%,respectively) occurred in A2. The e ﬄuent NH 4+-N, NO 2–-N, and NO 3–-N concentrations were 0.86, 14.34, and was 0.65 mg/L, respectively.Increasing the NH4+-N concentration of in ﬂuent may decrease thepartial nitri ﬁcation activity. The conversion rate of NH 4+-N in A1 washigher than the accumulation rate of nitrous nitrogen, which may bedue to the low concentration of in ﬂuent NH 4+-N, the conversion ofsome NH 4+-N into NO 2–-N, and the volatilization and escape of someNH4+-N. The relatively high concentration of e ﬄuent NO 3–-N in A4may be due to excessive aeration and dissolved oxygen. Therefore, thehighest nitrogen accumulation rate of partial nitri ﬁcation sludge was95.65%, when the in ﬂuent concentration of NH 4+-N was 15 mg/L ingroup A.IC is a substrate for autotrophic bacteria and has an important im-pact on their normal metabolism; it therefore also impacts AOB. Fig. 2Bshows the changes in nitrogen in B1 –B4 under di ﬀerent in ﬂuent ICconcentrations. In B1, the conversion rate of NH 4+-N was 69.57%, andthe eﬄuent NH 4+-N concentration was 4.65 mg/L. The low conversionrate under this condition may be due to the low concentration of HCO3–in the in ﬂuent. The conversion rates of NH 4+-N in B2, B3, and B4 weresimilar at 93.26, 93.25, and 93.12%, respectively. The NAR in B2 –B4was 96.95, 96.60, and 96.69%, respectively. The NAR was therefore thelowest in B1, but the NO3–-N concentration in B1 e ﬄuent was thehighest. Based on the NH 4+-N conversion rate, it is further speculatedthat the low IC concentration in the in ﬂuent may be the result of theinhibition of partial nitri ﬁcation. There was almost no change in theNAR value of the B2-B4 group. Therefore, when the inﬂ uent IC con-centration was 250 mg/L, su ﬃcient carbon source could be supplied forthe ammonia oxidizing bacteria to utilize itself, and the NAR is 96.95%.Ca2+and Mg2+are indispensable elements for the growth of mi-croorganisms and a ﬀect microorganism activity and immobilization(Macêdo et al., 2019 ).Fig. 2C shows the changes in nitrogen underdiﬀerent in ﬂuent Ca2+and Mg2+concentrations. The Ca2+and Mg2+concentrations in C1 were too low, and the NH 4+-N conversion ratewas also relatively low at 89.04%. With increased Ca2+and Mg2+concentrations, the conversion rate of NH 4+-N in C1 increased corre-spondingly, but that in C2– C4 were maintained at around 92.99, 92.78,and 93.19%, respectively. The NAR in C1– C4 was 91.03, 96.65, 97.51,and 97.03%, respectively. The highest accumulation rate occurred inC2 but did not di ﬀer much from that in C3 and C4. The results showedFig. 2. Changes in nitrogen under di ﬀerent inﬂ uent matrix conditions.

Bioresource Technology 293 (2019) 1221014that the concentration of Ca and Mg had little e ﬀect on partially ni-triﬁcation when they reached 110 mg/L and 100 mg/L respectively.Therefore, these concentrations of Ca2+and Mg2+were suitable for thegrowth of partial nitri ﬁcation sludge and the NAR was 96.65%.Fig. 2D shows the changes in microbial accelerants. Therefore, themicrobial accelerant concentration a ﬀected microbial activity. Whenthe microbial accelerant concentration increased from 0.5 to 1 mL/L,the NH 4+-N conversion rate increased from 82.91 to 92.97%. Withincreased microbial accelerant concentration, the NH 4+-N conversionrate did not change signi ﬁcantly in the D3, D4 (92.98 and 93.05%,respectively). In the experiment, the accumulative rate of NO 2–-N wasabove 90%. Except for the slightly lower accumulative rate of NO 2–-N ingroup D1, the accumulative rate of the other three groups was almostthe same. The NH4+-N conversion rate and NAR were relatively stablewhen the microbial accelerant concentration increased to 1 mL/L andthe NAR was 96.92%. According to the NAR of each experimentalgroup, the partial nitri ﬁcation sludge had a good conversion rate, andonly NaHCO3was added as IC source during the experiment. AccordingtoWang et al. (2018) , IC can be used as a carbon source for AOB cellsynthesis, which has a certain carbon sequestration capacity. Therefore,this process did not require additional organic carbon sources to pro-vide energy for AOB.3.2. E ﬀect of matrix amount on carbon sequestrationFig. 3 shows the relationship between carbon sequestration anddiﬀerent in ﬂuent matrix concentrations in groups A and B. Carbon se-questration was determined by subtracting the in ﬂuent IC content fromthe eﬄuent IC content and carbon content of the CO2emissions. Asshown in Fig. 3A, the in ﬂuent NH 4+-N content increased from 10 to30 mg/L, and the average carbon sequestration rate of IC increasedaccordingly from 3.42 to 7.91%. Therefore, the relationship betweeninﬂuent NH 4+-N and carbon sequestration rate was ﬁtted ( Fig. 3a) anddescribed by Eq. (3):=+ + =yxx R 0.000834 0.19496 1 0.9805 222(3)where yis carbon sequestration, and ×is the in ﬂuent NH 4+-N content.There was a positive correlation between the in ﬂuent NH 4+-N contentand carbon ﬁxation rate from equation (3): The carbon ﬁxation rateincreased with increasing in ﬂuent NH 4+-N. However, excessive in-ﬂuent NH 4+-N led to the release of CO 2into the system. Consideringthe NH 4+-N conversion rate and NAR, the optimum in ﬂuent NH 4+-Nconcentration was 15 mg/L.Fig. 3B shows the relationship between the carbon sequestrationrate and IC content in group B. With increasing in ﬂuent IC content, theaverage carbon sequestration rate decreased gradually from 6.59 to1.75%. Therefore, the ﬁtting of the relationship between in ﬂuent ICA1 A2 A3 A402468101210 15 20 25 30 353456789B1 B2 B3 B4510152025305 1 01 52 02 53 01234567) g m (  t n e t n o c  C IGroupA3456789Carbon sequestration Rate (%)Carbon sequestration Rate (%)y =  0.000834 x2 + 0.19496 x + 1        R2 = 0.9859Inf.

Therelationship between IC in in ﬂuent water and average carbon seques-tration rate was negatively correlated. The lower IC concentration caninhibit the partial nitri ﬁcation. An increased IC concentration can im-prove the NH 4+-N conversion rate and NAR, but too much IC may leadto increased release of CO 2into the system. When enough IC is added,the carbon sequestration rate of the system is relatively stable. In thisexperiment, 250 mg/L HCO3–met the normal operation of partial ni-triﬁcation.The relationship between Ca2+and Mg2+concentrations andaverage carbon sequestration rate is shown in Fig. 4C. The averagecarbon sequestration rate of C1 increased from 5.04 to 5.31%, whereasthose of C2– C4 were relatively stable at 5.31, 5.25, and 5.31%, re-spectively. Although Ca2+and Mg2+are essential elements for mi-crobial growth, they had no signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on the denitri ﬁcationperformance and carbon sequestration rate of the system. Therefore, tomaintain normal operation of the system, the Ca2+and Mg2+con-centrations should be 113.12 and 100.14 mg/L respectively.The eﬀect of microbial accelerants on the carbon sequestration rateis shown in Fig. 4D. When the microbial accelerant concentration in-creased from 0.5 to 1 mL/L, the average carbon sequestration rate of thesystem increased from 4.69 to 5.29%. However, with the continuousincrease of microbial accelerant concentration, the average carbon se-questration rate remained relatively stable between 5.24 and 5.23%,respectively. The microbial accelerant concentration had little impacton the operation of the system; a concentration of 1 mL/L was suitablefor the normal operation of partial nitri ﬁcation.Fig. 4.

The data were analyzed via the Student ttest. Comparedwith the blank sample, the NH 4+-N conversion, NO 2–-N accumulation,and average carbon sequestration rates of IEG were relatively stable,and there were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences (p-value > 0.05). In terms ofisotope detection in sludge, there were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences be-tween the carbon content of the blank sample and IEG (p-value >0.05). However, the abundance of δ13C and13C% content (VPDB) weresigniﬁcantly lower than those of the blank sample (p-value < 0.01).Furthermore, the isotope content in the sludge samples was greater inthe IEG after NaH13CO3labeling than it was in the blank sample. Thestandard deviation between parallel samples was small, indicating thatthe test results had good reproducibility. The results further showedthat the IC source was e ﬀectively metabolized by the microorganisms inpartial nitri ﬁcation sludge, and a carbon ﬁxation pathway gene waspresent.3.4. qPCRThe Calvin cycle is a major CO2ﬁxation pathway in nearly allecosystems. Rubisco is regarded as a key functional enzyme in theCalvin cycle and exists in multiple natural forms (such as forms I, II, III,and IV) ( Hanson & Tabita, 2001 ). The cbbL gene is commonly used toencode a large subunit of form I Rubisco ( Kusian & Bowien, 1997 ). Inthis study, cbbLR1 was used as the marker gene of the red-type Rubiscoform I cbbL gene ( Selesi et al., 2005; Wahlund & Tabita, 1997 ). AOBDNA was analyzed via qPCR to explore the carbon sequestrationpathway in partial nitri ﬁcation. DNA extraction and analyses werecarried out by thawing the stored sludge of every group at the end ofthe experiment. The purity of the extracted DNA was good and met therequirements of subsequent experiments. Therefore, qPCR was per-formed on the samples.Fig. 5 shows the average abundance of the cbbLR1 gene, and thecontrol group consisted of pre-treatment sludge samples. The copynumber of cbbLR1 before partial nitri ﬁcation sludge treatment was7.50 × 108. The average number of gene copies a ﬀected by NH 4+-N,IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant were 1.27 × 109,1.07 × 109, 1.04 × 109, and 1.10 × 109, respectively. The number ofcbbLR1 gene copies increased after treatment, and increased most underthe inﬂuence of nitrogen. The variation range of the gene copy numberin partial nitri ﬁcation sludge under the in ﬂuence of NH 4+-N was largerthan that under the in ﬂuence of the other three substrates.The correlations between cbbLR1 gene abundance in partial ni-triﬁcation sludge under di ﬀerent conditions and in ﬂuent substrates(nitrogen concentration, IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant)are shown in Table 3. The response of cbbLR1 gene abundance to ni-trogen was slightly greater than its response to the other three sub-strates. Therefore, functional gene cbbLR1, which follows the Calvincycle carbon sequestration pathway, is likely present in the partial ni-triﬁcation sludge. The response of cbbLR1 gene abundance to nitrogenin AOB was greater than that to IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbialaccelerant. There was a signi ﬁcant correlation between cbbLR1 andNH4+-N concentration, IC concentration.4. ConclusionsThe following conclusions could be drawn from batch simulationexperiments of partial nitri ﬁcation reaction: carbon sequestration rateof partial nitri ﬁcation was positively correlated with in ﬂuent NH 4+-Nand negatively correlated with IC. In wastewater containing IC, AOBcan immobilize IC into microorganisms through the cbbL gene in Calvincycle and become the carbon source needed for their growth. Finally,AOB released a small amount of CO2into the air, so that partial ni-triﬁcation doesn ’t need additional organic carbon source to provide theenergy for microorganism growth. CbbL gene was signi ﬁcantly corre-lated with the changes of in ﬂuent NH 4+-N and IC.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancialinterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂ u-ence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China [grant numbers 51668013, 51638006]; GuangxiScience and Technology Planning Project under Grant No. GuiKe-AD18126018; Special Funding for Guangxi “BaGui Scholar ”Construction Projects.ReferencesBenson, A.A., Calvin, M., 1950.
