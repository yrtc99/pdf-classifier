One measure that can contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 is "enhanced weathering" through application of ground silicates. Here we propose that mycorrhizal fungi may critically contribute to the success of en -hanced weathering in agricultural systems. Fundamental lab-based experiments now need to go hand in hand with real-world field trials, with the goal to optimize both decarbonization and environmental sustainability of agricultural ecosystems.SummaryArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have significantly contributed to weathering of the earth's surface since their evolutionary origin 400–500  million years ago. They have been a key player in the global carbon cycle over geological timescales. In order to reach the global warming targets as agreed at the Paris summit in 2015, implementa -tion of negative emission technologies is necessary. Among the options, one of the simplest is "enhanced weathering", where silicate rock is ground into small particles to enhance weathering rate. Here we synthesize the ways by which mycorrhizal fungi interact with these particles when applied to agricultural fields, and suggest they may stimulate weathering by various direct and indirect mechanisms. We conclude that because the intensity with which mycorrhiza interact with soil is tightly related to plant provisioning of photosynthates in exchange for soil-derived nutrients, weather -ing rates and hence carbon sequestration are likely to increase with agricultural activ -ities that stimulate plant reliance on and investment in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.KEYWORDSclimate change mitigation, enhanced weathering, geo-engineering, mycorrhizal fungi, sustainable agriculturePlants, People, Planet. 2021;3:445–453.  445|VERBRUGGEN Et al.will unlikely suffice to limit warming to well below 2°C (Gasser et al., 2015). Safe and scalable negative emission technologies (NETs), which actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere and en -sure long-term sequestration, will therefore be needed in addition to conventional mitigation measures.A potentially important NET is "enhanced weathering" (EW) of silicate minerals (e.g. Beerling et  al., 2020; Fuss et  al., 2018; Hartmann et al., 2013; Schuiling & Krijgsman,  2006; Strefler et  al., 2018). By EW we mean the application of ground silicates with the goal to speed up weathering and hence C sequestration . When silicates weather, CO2 is bound in aqueous form that eventually precipitates as carbonate, sequestering carbon for millennia. In nature, silicate rocks weather very slowly (geological time scale), mainly because of the limited sur -face area. The idea behind EW is to speed up this natural process by grinding silicate rocks to fine grains, hence increasing the surface area, and applying it to places where weathering potential is high (Schuiling & Krijgsman,  2006; Hartmann et  al., 2013; see also Box  1). Nonetheless, the carbon sequestration rate and potential of this relatively new NET measure remain uncertain (Amann et  al., 2020; Kelland et  al., 2020) and therefore require urgent further experimen -tal verification.Silicate weathering depends on both abiotic and biotic influences (Box  1). While much work has been done on the abiotic influences on carbon sequestration potential of EW for different rock types and grain sizes (Haque et  al., 2019; Hartmann et  al., 2013; Strefler et al., 2018), the role of biota such as plants and microbes in EW has so far rarely been considered (but see: Kelland et  al., 2020). Nonetheless, biota currently play and have previously played an im -portant role in determining weathering rates at ecological and evo -lutionary timescales, respectively (Burghelea et  al., 2015; Dontsova et al., 2020; Hoffland et  al., 2004). They may thus be crucial for speeding up C sequestration through EW and resolving their influ -ence can crucially aid in selecting the most promising settings and approaches.2 | THE IMPORTANCE OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN "ENHANCED WEATHERING"Mycorrhizal fungi are thought to have significantly increased mineral dissolution rates at evolutionary timescales, as well as in current (unground) rock weathering experiments (e.g. BOX 1  Principles of Enhanced Weathering (EW).Silicate weathering is controlled by abiotic factors such as precipitation, temperature, CO2, and pH of the (soil) water, as well as bi -otic interactions (Figure  1). Increases in precipitation, temperature, and CO2 typically stimulate weathering rate, while the effect of H+ depends on the soil pH: at a low pH ( < 4.5) an increase in H+ concentration can increase mineral dissolution, while up to a pH of about 8 the effect is neutral (Drever,  1994). In the rhizosphere however, H+ release due to uptake of base cations can locally reduce pH by multiple units compared to bulk soil (e.g. Gómez-Suárez et  al., 2020), and thus still increase mineral dissolution even in case of higher bulk soil pH. The weathering process involves the dissolution of silicates which consumes H+, releases geogenic nutrients such as P, Ca, Mg, K, and Si (depending on the source material) and increases the alkalinity of the environment. In response, the chemical equilibrium between dissolved CO2 and bicarbonate shifts slightly towards the latter, so additional CO2 can be taken up from the atmosphere. Weathering products can precipitate in the soil, sequestering carbon in secondary carbonate minerals. The geogenic nutrients can also be taken up by plants and microbes. Weathering products can leave the system when they are transported to inland waters and the ocean. Bicarbonates entering the ocean can counter ocean acidification (Hartmann et  al., 2013; Meysman & Montserrat,  2017). On the other hand, the slow process (Renforth & Henderson,  2017) of carbonate precipitation in the ocean will eventually release some (max. 50%) of the initially sequestered CO2 back into the atmosphere (Hartmann et  al., 2013).Many silicate sources can be used for EW. Mafic and ultramafic rocks (like basalt) are two of the most logical choices, as they are ubiquitous, have a relatively fast weathering rate, and have the highest content of silicate minerals. They also have higher cation contents than other silicate rocks such as granite or rhyolite, making them more interesting for application in agriculture (Hartmann et al., 2013). Besides these natural silicates, also artificial silicate-containing compounds such as steel slag and concrete demolition may be used for EW (Beerling et  al., 2018). According to Renforth (2019), 7 Gt alkaline materials are produced globally each year as a (by-)product of industrial activity. Between 2020 and 2,100, about 560  Gt artificial silicate material could become available, with a theoretical C sequestration potential of 2.9–8.5  Gt CO2 y−1. Although not all of that waste material may be useful for application in agriculture (due to contaminants), they have the advantage that they do not require mining and their use for EW could be embedded in a circular economy (Beerling et  al., 2020).The global carbon sequestration potential of EW has been estimated at 0.5–5 Gt CO2 per year in a synthesis study (Fuss et  al., 2018) and at 0.5–2 Gt CO2 per year in a recent nation-by-nation quantitative analysis, including various costs involved (Beerling et  al., 2020). However, these estimates are subject to large uncertainties, among others because they are almost exclusively based on extrapo -lations from lab experiments. Field experiments including interaction with soil and biota are a key research gap that needs urgent attention to verify the true C sequestration potential of EW (Fuss et  al., 2018).|     446 25722611, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10179 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023].

Upon the arrival of early land plants, terrestrial weathering is known to have greatly increased. It is thought that the partnering with mycorrhizal fungi aided spread of early land plants (Field et  al., 2015). First fossilized fungal spores and hyphae indistinguishable from current arbuscular mycorrhi -zal fungi date back to 470 million years before present (Redecker et al., 2000), whereas true symbiotic structures such as arbuscules are found in fossil plants approximately 70 million years younger (Remy et  al., 1994; Strullu-Derrien et  al., 2018). From around that time and onwards, the advent of true roots associated with mycor -rhizal fungi is known to have substantially enhanced global car -bon cycling, massively increased productivity, and led to greatly ramped up weathering rates (Field et  al., 2015; Quirk et  al., 2015). The causal influence of mycorrhizas on rock weathering from that time is evident from the mineral weathering tunnels that re -main present in the rocks afterwards (Koele et  al., 2014; Quirk et al., 2012; Van Schöll et  al., 2008).The extent to which mycorrhizal fungi contribute to weathering may however be context-dependent (Smits & Wallander,  2017). For instance, the mycorrhizal contribution to weathering of apatite, a P-rich mineral, was suggested to depend on the occurrence of P limitation in plants and fungi (Smits et  al., 2012), with P limitation stimulating enhanced weathering. Along similar lines, in soils with a high soil organic matter (SOM) content, fungi may preferably scav -enge for nutrients in OM and interact less with mineral fractions of soil (Hodge & Fitter,  2010). This may reduce their weathering potential, and dissolved organic carbon originating from SOM may even retard mineral weathering rates (Smits & Wallander,  2017). Thus far, however, most research on the contemporary influence of mycorrhizal fungi on weathering has focused on forests and ectomycorrhizas, while agricultural land where arbuscular mycor -rhizas (AM) dominate is expected to be the primary place for EW application.Here we focus on the role of AM and list key mechanisms through which they are likely key to influence weathering rates and dynamics when crushed silicates are applied to agricultural soils. These include direct effects via exudation and physical weathering, as well as in -direct effect by altering abiotic conditions and through their effect on plants.2.1  | DirectArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts of most land plant species (Brundrett & Tedersoo,  2018). They colonize roots and extend into the soil where they scavenge for nutri -ents such as PO42-, NH4+, K, and Zn, while relying on their host plant for carbon and energy (Smith & Read,  2008). Their finely branched hyphae (1–10  µm diameter) greatly increase the bioac -tive surface area compared to roots, meaning that a plant that invests its C in fungal biomass instead of roots greatly expands its root-depletion zone. These traits of AM fungi are likely to in -fluence rock weathering. The mechanisms by which they do are diverse. AM fungi can cover and tunnel into mineral surfaces and serve as efficient sinks for ions released from the minerals (Quirk FIGURE 1  Illustration of the interaction between biota and silicate weathering. Silicate weathering involves the reaction of the silicate rocks with CO2 (which can be produced by plants, mycorrhizal fungi or microbes, or be directly drawn from the atmosphere) and water. Plant roots and AM hyphae produce exudates and H+, which stimulate silicate weathering. AM hyphae can further influence the weathering rates by stimulating soil aggregation. When silicate materials such as basalt weather, geogenic nutrients are released which can be taken up by plants, AM fungi and microbes    |447 25722611, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10179 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023].

This activity creates chemical disequilibria across large areas of rock surface fueling its weathering (e.g. Taylor et  al., 2009). Furthermore, exuded sugars, and organic acids by AM hyphae (Hooker et  al., 2007; Toljander et  al., 2007) or the rich diversity of bacteria living on their surfaces (Agnolucci et  al., 2015), can act as chelators that destabilize mineral surfaces increasing weathering poten -tial. Moreover, turnover of organic compounds, hyphae, and bacteria associated with them increases respiration (Olsson & Johnson,  2005) on rock surfaces, which further stimulates sili -cate weathering. Other mechanisms by which AM fungi stimu -late weathering are acidification related with preferential NH4+ uptake (Cheng et  al., 2012), and enhanced soil aggregation (Rillig et al., 2015). The latter can create local anoxia and steep micro-environmental gradients (Sexstone et  al., 1985) that can increase weathering (Zaharescu et  al., 2020). Simultaneously however, lock-up of minerals and reduced respiration inside aggregates may retard weathering rates.2.2  | IndirectPlants invest substantial amounts of carbon belowground to obtain nutrients and other resources. Especially in agricultural settings, root-derived C will be a substantial fraction of total soil C inputs and thus a major driver of EW. Plant roots release CO2 and organic acids, creating physicochemical conditions that accelerate the dis -solution of silicate minerals (Dontsova et  al., 2020). AM fungi can have a strong effect on these belowground plant processes. Ven et al. (2019) found, for example, that AM fungi stimulated plant growth and increased the total belowground carbon flux in an exper -iment with maize plants. Burghelea et al. (2018) even suggested that AM fungi can enhance root exudation especially in substrates that are difficult to weather. These results align with a generally positive effect of AM fungi on plant growth (Lekberg & Koide,  2005) which, despite a trend towards decreased root to shoot ratio (Veresoglou et al., 2012) is likely to increase the total amount of C entering soil (Figure  2).3 | WILL AM FUNGI CONTRIBUTE TO "ENHANCED WEATHERING" IN AN AGRICULTURAL SETTING?As indicated above, there are numerous ways by which AM fungi can increase weathering of minerals. However, most studies on the influence of biota on mineral weathering measure effects of plant roots and their symbionts on a relatively large piece of mineral that is inserted into growth media (e.g., Bonneville et  al., 2011), or use pure basalt growth media (e.g., Burghelea et  al., 2015), where nutri -ent availability and physicochemical properties are dictated by the mineral itself. In contrast, in the practice of EW, ground silicates are added to the soil, creating a very different setting than what is simu -lated in those growth media. For instance, available nutrient levels are generally larger in soils than in primary minerals, due to agricul -tural fertilization and general accrual of SOM during pedogenesis FIGURE 2  Path-diagram for the anticipated interactions between silicate application, AM fungi, and weathering in agricultural soils. Blue arrows indicate anticipated positive effects, with dashed arrows indicating crucial paths to be resolved.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseVERBRUGGEN Et al.(e.g., Menge et  al., 2012). While application of silicates holds poten -tial to replace (some of) the fertilizer that is typically required for sustained agricultural productivity, can we expect AM fungi to also stimulate weathering in an agricultural setting? In other words, is the biotic and abiotic context conducive to silicate weathering by AM fungi?3.1  | AM fungi in agriculture: can a stronger alliance be forged?AM fungi are often suppressed in terms of abundance and diver -sity under conventional agricultural practices compared to natu -ral systems (Banerjee et  al., 2019; Verbruggen et  al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2014), which imposes serious limits on their weathering po -tential. Extraradical hyphal densities (those hyphae that extend into the soil from roots) may be particularly suppressed (Verbruggen & Kiers,  2010), with field studies reporting 2.49  m/g under barley (Thirkell et  al., 2019), average of 2.65  m/g across 50 maize fields in northern China (Xiang et  al., 2014), and active hyphae ranging from approximately 2.5 to 10  m/g under maize (Miller et  al., 1995). This contrasts with values >10 m/g typically found in non-agricultural set -tings (Antoninka et  al., 2011). However, large variation exists under both settings and extraradical mycorrhizal density is expected to in -crease with elevated CO2 (Antoninka et  al., 2011; Quirk et  al., 2015). Given the large variation, agriculture does offer a unique opportu -nity to control and optimize conditions that stimulate AM-mediated weathering rates. If negative effects of conventional agricultural practices on AM fungi can be ameliorated, agricultural systems may be the ideal systems to practice EW, as they offer the opportunity to manipulate e.g., plant species and variety, tillage, or fertilization rate and type, all of which are known to strongly affect AM fun -gal performance (e.g. Field et  al., 2020). While densities on par with natural systems may not be reached, the tractability of man-made agricultural systems can help tune weathering rates and AM fungal activities in ways impossible in other ecosystems, once we know the important gears to turn.Apart from tractability, organic matter contents of agricultural soil are usually low compared to the forests where most research on mycorrhizal weathering has been performed thus far (Finlay et al., 2009), stimulating interaction of AM fungi with the mineral soil component (Smits et  al., 2014). Furthermore, the unbalanced re -moval of biomass and nutrients that is intrinsic to most agricultural systems, holds potential to stimulate the interactions with soil when AM fungi explore it in search of nutrients. For instance, the relative limitation of N versus P can greatly affect the plant growth response to AM fungi (Hoeksema et  al., 2010) and productivity of AM fungi themselves (Johnson et  al., 2015).Thus, apart from the opportunity offered by agricultural fields in terms of area and accessibility, optimization of agricultural practices could foster AM fungi to help maximize CO2 removal from the air using silicate materials. This may not only benefit climate, but could also improve crop yields and nutritional value as well as their pest and drought resistance, all of which can be promoted by AM fungi (Lekberg & Koide,  2005; Verlinden et  al., 2018; Rillig et  al., 2019; but see Ryan & Graham,  2018), the availability of Si (e.g. Epstein,  2009), and by application of ground silicates (Beerling et  al., 2018; Haque et al., 2019). Intriguingly, Frew et  al. (2017) found the effect of AM fungi on pest resistance of sugarcane crops to be intricately related to soil Si availability: under low Si conditions, soil AM fungi reduced root palatability to an important root herbivore by increasing root concentration of Si. Agricultural soils are often strongly depleted in biogenic soil Si, promoting the need for plants to acquire Si directly from mineral weathering sources (Vandevenne et  al., 2015). New experiments are needed to explore the potential of plant-AM opti -mization for maximizing C sequestration by EW, while also assessing important side-effects and especially the relation to crop yield.3.2  | How will AM fungi respond to ground silicate applications?Until now we have especially focused on the effects of AM fungi on EW, and we argue it requires specific agricultural practices to stimu -late their activity in order to maximize weathering and carbon up -take. Could application of ground silicates be a step in this process? How can we expect AM fungi to respond to application of a large quantity of ground minerals such as basalt rock? First of all, silicate addition will increase pH, which may affect AM fungal abundance and diversity. When moving from acidic to neutral or slightly alka -line pH, AM fungal root colonization (Frater et  al., 2018) and spe -cies richness (Verbruggen et  al., 2012) generally increase. A common agricultural practice that is most analogous to silicate application is the application of ground limestone (liming). Liming can significantly increase root colonization by AM fungi, due to its increase in pH and/or immobilization of phosphate (Heyburn et  al., 2017). In a long-term fertilization study of grassland, liming was found to increase AM fun -gal extraradical hyphal density, which was reduced when P was co-applied, indicating pH and P availability can have opposing effects (Sochorová et  al., 2016).What can we expect for silicate application? Studies are few, but a recent study by Kelland et  al. (2020) showed that AM fungi actively colonize basalt-filled root-excluding mesh bags under Sorghum. Similar mesh bags filled with basalt under AM trees have likewise been shown to result in more than twofold AM fungal densities com -pared to mesh bags filled with granite or quartz (Quirk et  al., 2012). Another recent test found that ground concrete demolition and dolerite can increase root AM fungal colonization, dependent on its mixing ratio with sand (Son et  al., 2020). Therefore, limited data sug -gest that AM fungal growth may be positively affected by these ap -plications. It is known that organic and slow-release fertilizers often benefit abundance and diversity of AM fungi, probably by increasing plant reliance on the fungi for nutrient procurement, whereas min -eral fertilizers tend to have a negative effect (Gryndler et  al., 2006; Van Geel et  al., 2016). Ground silicates such as basalt will be a source for some nutrients but can be an (initial) sink for others by formation     |449 25722611, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10179 by Readcube-Labtiva, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseVERBRUGGEN Et al.of organo-mineral complexes and chemical adsorption. Ground sili -cates can adsorb a variety of ions such as ammonium and phosphate, although the efficiency strongly depends on type of rock (Landis & Craw,  2003; Witter & Kirchmann,  1989). While initially reducing nutrient availability, then, the additions may act like slow-release fertilizers and focus biological activity such as nutrient scavenging by mycorrhizal hyphae on their surfaces. Such effect is analogous to applications of biochar or expanded clay, for instance, whose surfaces are highly attractive to AM fungi thereby stimulating their abundance (Bukovská et  al., 2016; Hammer et  al., 2014).4 | CONCLUSIONSGiven the clear potential that silicate addition holds with respect to climate change mitigation, and the important role mycorrhizas are likely to play in the process, we push for more research on this excit -ing subject. We here argue that explicit consideration of the biota involved in the weathering process, among which AM fungi are key players, will be essential to understand the drivers of weathering rates in the field and to maximize climate gains from this technique. In line with recent calls (e.g., Yona et  al., 2020), aside from calculat -ing theoretical weathering rates, greenhouse gas fluxes and in situ weathering should be followed-up to determine the true effects of the implementation of mitigating practices. In field and lab settings, research is now needed to measure the response of AM fungi and weathering rates to high quantities of silicates, and especially their co-dependence on soil characteristics and agricultural practices such as fertilization and tillage. In doing so, we may be able to (a) prioritize the most promising sites for application of silicates, (b) op -timize agricultural practices for EW, sustainability, and yield, and (c) accurately estimate greenhouse gas emission responses to ground silicate application that may be far apart from initial assumptions.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe want to thank Ivan Janssens for previous inspiring conversations that contributed to the ideas presented here.
