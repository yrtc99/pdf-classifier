Carbon sequestrationRattan Lal *Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USADeveloping technologies to reduce the rate of increase of atmospheric concentration of carbondioxide (CO 2) from annual emissions of 8.6 Pg C yr–1from energy, process industry, land-useconversion and soil cultivation is an important issue of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Of the three optionsof reducing the global energy use, developing low or no-carbon fuel and sequestering emissions, thismanuscript describes processes for carbon (CO2) sequestration and discusses abiotic and biotictechnologies. Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO 2into other long-lived globalpools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase inatmospheric CO2. Engineering techniques of CO 2injection in deep ocean, geological strata, old coalmines and oil wells, and saline aquifers along with mineral carbonation of CO 2constitute abiotictechniques. These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakagerisks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques arenatural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary beneﬁts, are immediately applicablebut have ﬁnite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have speciﬁc nitches, arecomplementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.Keywords: climate change; greenhouse effect; soil management; geological sequestration;chemical sequestration; oceanic sequestration1. INTRODUCTIONGlobal surface temperatures have increased by 0.8 8Csince the late nineteenth century, and 11 out of the12 warmest years on record have occurred since 1995(IPCC 2007 ). Earth’s mean temperature is projectedto increase by 1.5–5.8 8C during the twenty-ﬁrstcentury ( IPCC 2001 ) .T h er a t eo fi n c r e a s ei ng l o b a ltemperature has been 0.15 8C per decade since 1975.In addition to the sea-level rise of 15–23 cm duringthe twentieth century ( IPCC 2007 ), there have beennotable shifts in ecosystems ( Greene & Pershing2007 ) and frequency and intensity of occurrence ofwild ﬁres ( Running 2006 ;Westerling et al. 2006 ).These and other observed climate changes arereportedly caused by emission of greenhouse gases(GHGs) through anthropogenic activities includingland-use change, deforestation, biomass burning,draining of wetlands, soil cultivation and fossil fuelcombustion. Consequently, the concentration ofatmospheric GHGs and their radiative forcing haveprogressively increased with increase in humanpopulation, but especially so since the onset ofindustrial revolution around 1850. The concen-tration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by31% from 280 ppmv in 1850 to 380 ppmv in 2005,and is presently increasing at 1.7 ppmv yrK1or0.46% yrK1(WMO 2006 ;IPCC 2007 ). Concen-trations of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O)have also increased steadily over the same period(IPCC 2001 ,2007 ;Prather et al. 2001 ;WMO 2006 ).Total radiative forcing, externally imposed pertur-bation in the radiative energy budget of the Earth’sclimate system ( Ramaswamy et al. 2001 ), of allGHGs since 1850 is estimated at 2.43 W mK2(IPCC2001 ,2007 ).There is a strong interest in stabilizing the atmos-pheric abundance of CO 2and other GHGs to mitigatethe risks of global warming ( Kerr 2007 ;Kintisch 2007 b;Kluger 2007 ;Walsh 2007 ). There are three strategies oflowering CO 2emissions to mitigate climate change(Schrag 2007 ): (i) reducing the global energy use,(ii) developing low or no-carbon fuel, and (iii)sequestering CO 2from point sources or atmospherethrough natural and engineering techniques. Between1850 and 1998, anthropogenic emissions are estimatedat 270G30 Pg by fossil fuel combustion and at136G30 Pg by land-use change, deforestation and soilcultivation ( IPCC 2001 ). Presently, approximately7P gCy rK1is emitted by fossil fuel combustion(Pacala & Socolow 2004 )a n d1 . 6 P g C y rK1bydeforestation, land-use change and soil cultivation. Ofthe total anthropogenic emissions of 8.6 Pg C yrK1,3.5 Pg C yrK1is absorbed by the atmosphere,2.3 Pg C yrK1by the ocean and the remainder by anunidentiﬁed terrestrial sink probably in the NorthernHemisphere ( Tans et al. 1990 ;Fanet al. 1998 ).The objective of this paper is to discuss the processand technological options of CO2–C sequestration inone of the long-lived global C pools so as to reduce thenet rate of increase of atmospheric concentration ofCO2. While CO 2–C sequestration is discussed ingeneral, speciﬁc attention is given to the terrestrial Csequestration in forests and soils.2.

Understand-ing the global C cycle and its perturbation byanthropogenic activities is important for developingviable strategies for mitigating climate change. Therate of future increase in atmospheric CO2concen-t r a t i o nw i l ld e p e n do nt h ea n t h r o p o g e n i ca c t i v i t i e s ,the interaction of biogeochemical and climate pro-cesses on the global C cycle and interaction amongprincipal C pools. There are ﬁve global C pools, ofwhich the largest oceanic pool is estimated at38 000 Pg and is increasing at the rate of2.3 Pg C yrK1(ﬁgure 1 ). The geological C pool,comprising fossil fuels, is estimated at 4130 Pg, ofwhich 85% is coal, 5.5% is oil and 3.3% is gas.Proven reserves of fossil fuel include 678 Pg of coal(3.2 Pg yrK1production), 146 Pg of oil (3.6 Pg yrK1of production) and 98 Pg of natural gas (1.5 Pg yrK1of production; Schrag 2007 ). Presently, coal and oileach account for approximately 40% of global CO 2emissions ( Schrag 2007 ). Thus, the geological pool isdepleting, through fossil fuel combustion, at the rateof 7.0 Pg C yrK1. The third largest pool is pedologic,estimated at 2500 Pg to 1 m depth. It consists of twodistinct components: soil o rganic carbon (SOC) poolestimated at 1550 Pg and soil inorganic carbon (SIC)pool at 950 Pg ( Batjes 1996 ). The SOC pool includeshighly active humus and relatively inert charcoal C. Itcomprises a mixture of: (i) plant and animal residuesa tv a r i o u ss t a g e so fd e c o m p o s i t i o n ;( i i )s u b s t a n c e ssynthesized microbiologic ally and/or chemically fromthe breakdown products; and (iii) the bodies of livemicro-organisms and small animals and their decom-posing products ( Schnitzer 1991 ). The SIC poolincludes elemental C and carbonate minerals such ascalcite, dolomite and gypsum, and comprises primaryand secondary carbonates. The primary carbonatesare derived from the weathering of parent material. Incontrast, the secondary carbonates are formedthrough the reaction of atmospheric CO2with CaC2and MgC2b r o u g h ti nf r o mo u t s i d et h el o c a lecosystem (e.g. calcareous dust, irrigation water,fertilizers, manures). The SIC is an importantconstituent in soils of arid and semi-arid regions.The fourth largest pool is the atmospheric poolcomprising 760 Pg of CO2–C, and increasing at therate of 3.5 Pg C yrK1or 0.46% yrK1.T h es m a l l e s tamong the global C pools is t he biotic pool estimatedat 560 Pg. The pedologic and biotic C pools togetherare called the terrestrial C pool estimated atapproximately 2860 Pg. The atmospheric pool isalso connected to the oceanic pool which absorbs92.3 Pg yrK1and releases 90 Pg yrK1with a netpositive balance of 2.3 Pg C yrK1. The oceanic poolwill absorb approximately 5 Pg CK1yrK1by 2100(Orret al. 2001 ). The total dissolved inorganic C inthe oceans is approximately 59 times that of theatmosphere. On the scales of millennia, the oceansdetermine the atmospheric CO2concentration, notvice versa ( Falkowski et al. 2000 ).

The annual rateof photosynthesis is 120 Pg C, most of which isreturned back to the atmosphere through plant andsoil respiration. The terrestrial C pool is depleted byconversion from natural to managed ecosystems,extractive farming practices based on low externalinput and soil degrading land use. The pedologic poolloses 0.4–0.8 Pg C yrK1to the ocean through erosion-induced transportation to aquatic ecosystems. Theterrestrial sink is presently increasing at a net rate of1.4G0.7 Pg C yrK1. Thus, the terrestrial sink absorbsapproximately 2–4 Pg C yrK1and its capacity mayincrease to approximately 5 Pg C yrK1by 2050(Cramer et al. 2001 ;Scholes & Noble 2001 ). Increasein the terrestrial sink capacity may be due to CO 2fertilization effect and change in land use and manage-ment. The biotic pool also contributes to increase inatmospheric CO 2concentration through deforestationand biomass burning.3. CARBON SEQUESTRATIONEmission rates from fossil fuel combustion increasedby 40% between 1980 and 2000 ( Wofsy 2001 ). Yet,the amount of CO 2accumulating in the atmosphereremained the same over this period because the excessCO2released is being removed by oceans, forests, soilsand other ecosystems ( Battle et al. 2000 ). AtmosphericCO 2increased at a rate of 2.8–3.0 Pg C yrK1duringthe 1980s and 1995, and between 3.0 and3.5 Pg C yrK1during 1995–2005.

Of the 136 Pg, 78 Pg isemitted from world soils consisting of 26 Pgfrom erosion and 52 Pg from mineralization.Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration willenhance NPP by CO2 fertilization effect.Restoration of degraded ecosystems andcoupling of C with N and P cycles alsoenhances the terrestrial C pool.atmospheric  C pool =  760  Pg  (+3.5  Pg yr–1)restorationofdegradedecosystemscouplingofCwithNandPcyclescarbondioxidefertilizationhiddenCcostsofinputdrainigofwetlandsacceleratederosionbiomassburningsoilcultivationdeforestationFigure 2. The atmospheric C pool is increasing at the rate of 3.5 Pg C yrK1. The terrestrial C pool contributes approximately1.6 Pg C yrK1through deforestation, biomass burning, draining of wetlands, soil cultivation including those of organic soils,accelerated erosion and hidden C costs of input (e.g. fertilizers, tillage, pesticides, irrigation). Terrestrial C pools are presentlysink of 2–4 Pg C yrK1. Conversion to a judicious land use and adoption of recommended practices in managed ecosystems canmake these important sinks especially due to CO 2fertilization effects.Carbon sequestration R. Lal 817Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 2.8–3.5 Pg yrK1, implies the existence of large globalterrestrial sinks ( Fung 2000 ;Pacala 2001 ).Fanet al.(1998) estimated a mean annual uptake of 1.7 G0.5 Pg C yrK1in North America, mostly south of518N. In comparison, the Eurasia–North Africa sinkwas relatively small. This process of transfer andsecure storage of atmospheric CO2into other long-lived C pools that would otherwise be emitted orremain in the atmosphere is called ‘carbon sequestra-tion’. Therefore, in this context, C sequestration maybe a natural or an anthropogenically driven process.The objective of an anthropogenically driven Csequestration process is to balance the global C budgetsuch that future economic growth is based on a ‘C-neutral’ strategy of no net gain in atmospheric C pool.Such a strategy would necessitate sequestering almostall anthropogenically generated CO2through safe,environmentally acceptable and stable techniques withlow risks of leakage. Lackner (2003) estimated that if aC-neutral strategy is based mainly on sequestrationrather than emission reduction, total C storage duringthe twenty-ﬁrst century will exceed 600 Pg withresidence time of centuries to millennia. However,even a small leakage of 2–3 Pg C yrK1from the Csequestered in one of the pools can adversely impactthe strategic planning for future generations. Pacala &Socolow (2004) outlined 15 options of stabilizing theatmospheric concentration of CO2by 2050 atapproximately 550 ppm. Of the 15 options, threew e r eb a s e do nCs e q u e s t r a t i o ni nt e r r e s t r i a lecosystems.There are several technological options for seques-tration of atmospheric CO2into one of the other globalpools ( ﬁgure 3 ). The choice of one or a combination ofseveral technologies is important for formulatingenergy policies for future economic growth anddevelopment at national and global scales. Theseoptions can be grouped into two broad categories:abiotic and biotic sequestration.(a)Abiotic sequestrationAbiotic sequestration is based on physical and chemicalreactions and engineering techniques without inter-vention of living organisms (e.g. plants, microbes). Theabiotic strategy of C sequestration in oceanic andgeological structures has received considerable atten-tion ( Freund & Ormerod 1997 ) because theoreticallyabiotic sequestration has a larger sink capacity thanbiotic sequestration. Rapid progress is being made indeveloping/testing technologies for CO2capture,transport and injection ( Kerr 2001 ).(i)Oceanic injectionInjection of a pure CO 2stream deep in the ocean is apossibility that has been widely considered by engineersfor about three decades. Following the initial proposalin the late 1970s, there has been considerable progressin oceanic injection of CO2. To be stable and minimizeoutgassing, CO 2must be injected at great depths.Therefore, liqueﬁed CO 2separated from industrialsources can be injected into the ocean by one of thefollowing four techniques: (i) it is injected below1000 m from a manifold lying at the ocean ﬂoor, andbeing lighter than water, it rises to approximately1000 m depth forming a droplet plume; (ii) it isalso injected as a denser CO2–seawater mixture at500–1000 m depth, and the mixture sinks into thedeeper ocean; (iii) it is discharged from a large pipetowed behind a ship; and (iv) it is pumped into adepression at the bottom of the ocean ﬂoor forming aCO2lake. Liqueﬁed CO 2injected at approximately3000 m depth is believed to remain stable ( O’Connoret al. 2001 ). The oceanic sink capacity for CO 2sequestration is estimated at 5000–10 000 Pg C,decreasing net CO2 emission into the atmosphere and creating a C-neutral economycarbon sequestrationabiotic bioticnaturalorganic carbonmanagedbiofuel offsetinorganic carbonleachingcarbon burialsecondary carbonatesoceanic injectiongeologic sequestrationchemical scrubbingwetlandschar andhumus soilswoody plantssecondary carbonatesH2 cellCH4 gasbio-dieselbioethanolminerali- zationseeding ocean with FeFigure 3. A wide range of processes and technological options for C sequestration in agricultural, industrial and naturalecosystems.818 R. Lal Carbon sequestrationPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 exceeding the estimated fossil fuel reserves (Herzoget al. 1997 ,2002 ). However, CO 2injection may alsohave some adverse effects on deep sea biota ( Auerbachet al. 1997 ;Caulﬁeld et al. 1997 ;Seibel & Walsh 2001 ).In addition to the economics, the issue of stability ofsuch an injection must be addressed owing to theincreased stratiﬁcation of the ocean water column andits turn over through natural processes.(ii)Geological injectionThis involves capture, liquefaction, transport andinjection of industrial CO2into deep geological strata.The CO 2may be injected in coal seams, old oil wells (toincrease yield), stable rock strata or saline aquifers(Tsang et al. 2002 ;Klara et al. 2003 ;Baines & Worden2004 ;Gale 2004 ). Saline aquifers are undergroundstrata of very porous sediments ﬁlled with brackish(saline) water. In general, saline aquifers are locatedbelow the freshwater reservoirs with an impermeablelayer in between. Industrial CO2can be pumped intothe aquifer, where it is sequestered hydrodynamicallyand by reacting with other dissolved salts to formcarbonates. Carbon dioxide is injected in a supercriticalstate that has much lower density and viscosity than theliquid brine that it displaces. In situ , it forms a gas-likephase and also dissolves in the aqueous phase, creatinga multiphase multicomponent environment. InjectingCO2into reservoirs in which it displaces oil or gas couldbe an economic strategy of enhanced oil recovery(EOR). Production from oil and gas ﬁelds, which hasbeen in decline, is raised by CO2-enhanced recovery(Klusman 2003 ). This strategy of CO 2sequestration isused in Texas, USA, to inject 20 million Mg ofCO2yrK1at a price of $10–$15 MgK1(Lackner2003 ). The technique is also used in offshore oil wellsin Norway. In a strict sense, however, this is notsequestration when the CO2injected is extracted fromunderground wells. The CO 2can also be injected intounmineable coal seams where CH 4is absorbed.Injected CO 2is absorbed onto coal twice as much asCH 4, and the process enhances the gas recovery of coalbed CH 4(CBM). Principal concerns about geologicalsequestration, similar to that of the oceanic, are(Kintisch 2007 a;Schrag 2007 ): (i) reliability of storageof vast quantities of CO2in geological strata and (ii) thecost. Some have argued that risks of leakage are low.However, to date, a few direct injection of CO 2havebeen made on a commercial scale although theRegional Carbon Sequestration Partnership project ofUS DOE is planning for several demonstrations during2008–2009. Similar to oceanic injection, cost andleakage are principal issues of geological sequestrationwhich need to be resolved. Owing to the low densityand viscosity and injection under supercritical con-ditions, the risks of CO2leakage through conﬁningstrata may be higher than currently injected liquidwastes ( Tsang et al. 2002 ). In addition, the chemicalinteractions of CO 2with the geological formations mayhave to be considered in formulating guidelines forappropriate regulatory and monitoring controls.(iii)Scrubbing and mineral carbonationMineral carbonation is achieved through mimicry ofnatural inorganic chemical transformation of CO2(Fan & Park 2004 ). It involves transformation ofindustrial strength CO 2emissions into CaCO 3,MgCO 3and other minerals in the form of geologicallyand thermodynamically stable mineral carbonates. It isa two-stage process: scrubbing and mineral carbona-tion. Scrubbing, the process of chemical absorption ofCO2using an amine or carbonate solvent, is the mostwidely used method of carbon capture. The CO 2ispuriﬁed by passing through an absorption columncontaining amine solvent. Other solvents used areK2CO 3, lithium silicate, ceramic and nickel-basedcompounds. Pure CO 2gas, recovered by heating theCO 2-rich amine, is re-precipitated through mineralcarbonation. Carbonates thus formed are stable rock inwhich CO2is sequestered forever. Aqueous mineralcarbonation reactions leading to the formation ofmagnesite (MgCO 3), olivine (Mg 2SiO 4) and serpen-tine (Mg 3Si2O5(OH) 4) are as follows ( Gerdemannet al. 2003 ):2 MgSiO 4CCO 2ðgÞC2H2O/Mg 3Si2O5ðOH Þ4CMgCO 3ð16 :5 KCal Þ;Mg 2SiO 4C2C O 2ðgÞ/2 MgCO 3CSiO 2ð10 :3 KCal ÞandCaSiO 3CCO 2/CaCO 3CSiO 2ð10 :6 KCal Þ:All these reactions occur in nature and can bereplicated in industrial settings. The industrial processof mineral carbonation has been described by Lackneret al. (1996 ,1997) andO’Connor et al. (2000) . Theprocess uses a slurry of ﬁne particle-sized mineral inwater, at solid concentrations of 15–30%. Dissolutionof the mineral and subsequent carbonation occur in asingle operation as per the following theorized reactions(O’Connor et al. 2000 ;Gerdemann et al. 2004 ):CO2CH2O/H2CO 3/HCCHCOK3;Mg 2SiO 4C4HC/2MgC2CH4SiO 4or SiO 2C2H2Oa n dMgC2CHCOK3/MgCO 3CH2:Geological studies have shown that reserves ofultramaﬁc (ultrabasic) m inerals are sufﬁcient toprovide raw materials for mineral carbonation ofindustrial emissions for long time ( Goff et al. 1997 ,2000 ). However, these are geological reactions andoccur at slow rate. The challenge lies in increasing therate of reaction by decreasing the particle size,increasing temperature and pressure and using catalyticagents ( Fan & Park 2004 ). Increasing the rate ofreactions, however, requires energy and is expensive.(b)Biotic sequestrationBiotic sequestration is based on managed interventionof higher plants and micro-organisms in removing CO2from the atmosphere. It differs from managementoptions which reduce emission or offset emission.Increasing use efﬁciency of resources (e.g. water,energy) is another option for managing the terrestrialC pool ( table 1 ). Some biotic sequestration options arebrieﬂy described below.Carbon sequestration R. Lal 819Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 (i)Oceanic sequestrationThere are several biological processes leading to Csequestration in the ocean through photosynthesis.Phytoplankton photosynthesis is one such mechanism(Rivkin & Legendre 2001 ), which ﬁxes approximately45 Pg C yrK1(Falkowski et al. 2000 ). Some of theparticulate organic material formed by phytoplanktonis deposited at the ocean ﬂoor and is thus sequestered(Raven & Falkowski 1999 ). Availability of Fe is one ofthe limiting factors on phytoplankton growth in oceanicecosystems. Thus, several studies have assessed theimportance of Fe fertilization on biotic CO2sequestra-tion in the ocean ( Martin & Fitzwater 1988 ;Falkowski1997 ;Martin et al. 2002 ;Boyd et al. 2004 ). It is alsoargued that incremental C could be sold as credits inthe developing global C marketplace. Similar to deepinjection, ocean fertilization may also change theecology of the ocean ( Chisholm et al. 2001 ). However,with the current state of knowledge, the topic of oceanfertilization remains a debatable issue ( Johnson &Karl 2002 ).(ii)T errestrial sequestrationTransfer of atmospheric CO2into biotic and pedologicC pools is called terrestrial C sequestration. Of the8.6 Pg C yrK1emitted into the atmosphere, only3.5 Pg or 40% of the anthropogenically emitted CO 2remains in the atmosphere primarily owing to unspe-ciﬁed terrestrial sinks which sequester atmosphericCO2and play an important role in the global C cycle.Terrestrial ecosystems constitute a major C sink owingto the photosynthesis and storage of CO2in live anddead organic matter. Owing to its numerous ancillarybeneﬁts (e.g. improved soil and water quality, restor-ation of degraded ecosystems, increased crop yield),terrestrial C sequestration is often termed as win–winor no-regrets strategy ( Lalet al. 2003 ). It offersmultiple beneﬁts even without the threat ofg l o b a lc l i m a t ec h a n g e .T h e r ea r et h r e ep r i n c i p a lcomponents of terrestrial C sequestration: forests,soils and wetlands.Forest ecosystems store C as lignin and other relativelyresistant polymeric C compounds. Presently, the netrate of C sequestration in forest ecosystems (otherthan those being deforested) is 1.7 G0.5 Pg C yrK1(Fanet al. 1998 ). The forest C is sequestered not onlyin the harvestable timber, but also in woody debris,wood products and other woody plants encroachingupon grasslands ( Wofsy 2001 ). The terrestrial NPP isnot saturated at the current CO 2concentration andmay increase with increase in atmospheric CO 2concentration through the CO 2fertilization effect.The NPP may be saturated at 800–1000 ppm of CO 2concentration ( Falkowski et al. 2000 ). Thus, the forests i n km a yi n c r e a s eb yC O 2fertilization effect(Krishnamurthy & Machavaram 2000 ). The potentialCO 2fertilization effect may peak during the middle ofthe twenty-ﬁrst century ( Kohlmaier et al. 1998 ).However, at increasing CO 2concentration, the NPPmay be limited by the deﬁciency of N, P, H 2O and otherfactors. Interaction between cycles of C, N, P and H 2O,if moderated through judicious management, mayenhance terrestrial C sequestration.Afforestation is one of the viable options of Csequestration in terrestrial ecosystems ( IPCC 1999 ;Fang et al. 2001 ;Lamb et al. 2005 ). The potential of Csequestration through afforestation is estimated at3T gCy rK1in Norway, 6 Tg C yrK1in New Zealand,9T gCy rK1in Sweden, 107 Tg C yrK1in Russia and117 Tg C yrK1in the USA ( IPCC 1999 ). The rate of Csequestration in US forests, considering all com-ponents, is 0.3–0.7 Pg C yrK1(Pacala et al. 2001 ).Restoration of degraded tropical forest is anotherimportant option ( Lamb et al. 2005 ). It is estimatedthat 350 Mha of tropical forest have been converted toother land uses, and another 500 Mha of forests havebeen degraded to varying extent ( Lal 2005 a,b,c). Thus,establishment of productive and monoculture planta-tions of Pinus, Eucalyptus andAcacia can enhance theterrestrial C pool in these ecosystems. There is also apotential for improving the management of secondaryor regrowth forests in degraded tropical landscapes.Fang et al. (2001) estimated that in China, between1970 and 1998, C sequestration in forests increased atan average rate of 21 Tg C yrK1mainly due toafforestation and growth. The total C pool in Chineseforest decreased from 5.1 Pg in 1949 to 4.3 Pg in 1977–1981. Subsequently, it progressively increased during1980s and 1990s to 4.7 Pg in 1998 ( Fang et al. 2001 ).Townsend et al. (2002) suggested a sizeable CO2Table 1.

Their data showed a possibleexistence of a large equatorial terrestrial CO 2sink.Pacala & Socolow’s (2004) estimated managementof temperate and tropical forest is one of the 15 optionsto stabilize atmospheric CO 2concentration at 550 ppmby 2050. They estimated that 0.5 Pg C emission wouldbe avoided if the current rate of clear cutting of primarytropical forest were reduced to zero over 50 years by2050. Another 0.5 Pg C yrK1would be sequestered byreforesting or afforesting approximately 250 Mha in thetropics or 400 Mha in the temperate zone. Anadditional 0.3 Pg C yrK1can be sequestered by estab-lishing approximately 300 Mha of plantations ofnon-forested lands ( Pacala & Socolow 2004 ). Theafforestation may account for a total of 25 Pg Csequestration between 2000 and 2050.However, afforestation on a large scale can impactwater resources. Jackson et al. (2005) documentedsubstantial losses in stream ﬂow, and increased soilsalinization and acidiﬁcation, with afforestation. Theyobserved that establishment of tree plantationsdecreased stream ﬂow by 227 mm yrK1globally(52%), with 13% of streams drying completely for atleast one year. Thus, any plans of large-scale afforesta-tion for C sequestration must consider the possibleadverse impact on availability of water.Bunker et al. (2005) addressed the concern ofdecline in tropical forest biodiversity due to expansionof monoculture plantations. Thus, resulting effects ofmonoculture plantations on key ecosystem services(e.g. biodiversity, water resources, elemental cycling, Csequestration) must be critically assessed. There is astrong need for developing regulatory policies, includ-ing the transaction costs of trading C credits andobtaining the permits. The cost of C sequestration vis-a`-vis the opportunity cost must also be considered(McCarl & Schneider 2001 ).Wet lan d s and the associated soils or histosolsconstitute a large pedologic pool estimated at approxi-mately 450 Pg ( Gorham 1991 ;Warner et al. 1993 ).Wetland soils may contain as much as 200 times moreC than the associated vegetation ( Milne & Brown1997 ;Garnett et al. 2001 ).Gorham (1991) andKobaket al. (1998) estimated that C sequestration in wet-lands/peatsoils since the post-glaciation period resultedin the C accumulation at the rate of 0.1 Pg C yrK1over10 000–18 000 years. However, drainage of peatlandsand their subsequent cultivation made these ecosys-tems a net source of CO 2. Large areas of wetlands havebeen drained worldwide for agriculture ( Armentano &Menges 1986 ) and forestry ( Paavilainen & Paivanen1995 ). Drained wetland soils decompose and subsideat the rate of approximately 1–2 cm yrK1primarily dueto oxidation ( Rojstaczer & Deverel 1995 ;Hillman1997 ;Wosten et al. 1997 ). Restoration of wetlands canlead to reversal of the process and make restoredwetlands once again a sink of atmospheric CO2.However, there is a long time lag after the restorationuntil processes in restored wetlands become similar tothose of natural wetlands.Soil C sequestration . Implies enhancing the concen-tration/pools of SOC and SIC as secondary carbo-nates through land-use conversion and adoption ofrecommended management practices (RMPs) inagricultural, pastoral and forestry ecosystems andrestoration of degraded and drastically disturbedsoils. Formation of charcoal and use of biochar as afertilizer is another option ( Fowles 2007 ). In contrastto geological sequestration that implies injecting CO2at 1–2 km depth, the SOC sequestration involvesputting C into the surface layer of 0.5–1 m depththrough the natural processes of humiﬁcation. Mostsoils under the managed ecosystems contain a lowerSOC pool than their counterparts under naturalecosystems owing to the depletion of the SOC pool incultivated soils. The most rapid loss of the SOC pooloccurs in the ﬁrst 20–50 years of conversion of naturalto agricultural ecosystems in temperate regions and5–10 years in the tropics ( Lal 2001 ). In general,cultivated soils normally contain 50–75% ofthe original SOC pool. The depletion of the SOCpool is caused by oxidation/mineralization, leachingand erosion.Strategies for increasing the SOC pool are outlinedinﬁgure 4 . There is a wide range of degraded soils witha depleted SOC pool. Important among these are thosedegraded by erosion, nutrient depletion, acidiﬁcationand leaching, structural decline and pollution/contami-nation ( ﬁgure 4 ). Restoring degraded soils andecosystems is a strategy with multiple beneﬁts forwater quality, biomass productivity and for reducingnet CO2emission. Grainger (1995) estimated thatthere are approximately 750 Mha of degraded lands inthe tropics with potential for afforestation and soilquality enhancement. With a sequestration potential ofapproximately 0.5 Mg haK1yrK1as SOC and anadditional 1.0 Mg haK1yrK1as biomass, a terrestrialC sequestration potential of 750 Mha is approximately1.1 Pg C yrK1.Lal (2001) estimated the SOC seques-tration potential of 0.4–0.7 Pg C yrK1through deserti-ﬁcation control in soils of arid and semi-aridregions. Similar estimates were provided by Squireset al. (1995) .West & Post (2002) assessed SOC sequestration rateupon conversion of plough tillage to no-till farmingthrough analyses of data of 67 long-term experimentsfrom around the world. They reported the mean rate ofSOC sequestration of 570 G140 Kg C haK1yrK1,which may lead to the new equilibrium SOC pool in40–60 years. Lal (2004 a,b) estimated the global SOCsequestration potential, 0.4–1.2 Pg C yrK1or 5–15%,of the global fossil fuel emissions. Pacala & Socolow(2004) estimated that conversion of plough tillage tono-till farming on 1600 Mha of cropland along withadoption of conservation-effective measures could leadto sequestration of 0.5–1 Pg C yrK1by 2050.Integrated nutrient management (INM) is alsoessential to SOC sequestration. The humiﬁcationprocess can be severely constrained by the lack of N,P, S and other building blocks of soil humus ( Himes1998 ). The efﬁciency of C sequestration is reducedwhen C and N are not adequately balanced ( Paustianet al. 1997 ). Therefore, the SOC sequestration rate isenhanced by an increase in the application of biomassC(Campbell et al. 1991 ;Janzen et al. 1998 )a n dN(Halvorson et al. 1999 ,2002 ).Liebig et al. (2002)observed that high N rate treatments increased SOCCarbon sequestration R. Lal 821Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 sequestration rates by 1.0–1.4 Mg C haK1yrK1compared with unfertilized controls. Similar obser-v a t i o n sw e r em a d eb y Dumanski et al . (1988 ),Schjonning et al. (1994) ,Gregorich et al. (1996) ,Bowman & Halvorson (1998) ,Studdert & Echeverria(2000) ,a n d Jacinthe et al. (2002) .Malhi et al. (1997)reported that SOC sequestration depended both on therate and the source of N application. In Victoria,Australia, Ridley et al. (1990) observed that applicationof P and lime increased the SOC pool in the 0–10 cmlayer by 11.8 Mg haK1over a 68-year period at anaverage rate of 0.17 Mg C haK1yrK1.Application of manures and other organic amend-ments is another important strategy of SOC sequestra-tion. Several long-term experiments in Europe haveshown that the rate of SOC sequestration is greaterwith application of organic manures than with chemicalfertilizers ( Jenkinson 1990 :Witter et al. 1993 ;Chris-tensen 1996 ;Korschens & Muller 1996 ;Smith et al.1997 ). Increase in the SOC pool in the 0–30 cm depthby long-term use of manure compared to chemicalfertilizers was 10% over 100 years in Denmark(Christensen 1996 ), 22% over 90 years in Germany(Korschens & Muller 1996 ), 100% over 144 years atRothamsted, UK ( Jenkinson 1990 ) and 44% over 31years in Sweden ( Witter et al. 1993 ). The data fromMorrow plots in Illinois indicated that manured plotscontained 44.6 Mg haK1more SOC than unmanuredcontrol ( Anderson et al. 1990 ). In Hungary, Arends &Casth (1994) observed an increase in SOCconcentration by 1.0–1.7% by manuring. Smith et al.(1997) estimated that application of manure at the rateof 10 Mg haK1to cropland in Europe would increasethe SOC pool by 5.5% over 100 years. In Norway,Uhlen (1991) andUhlen & Tveitnes (1995) reportedthat manure application would increase SOC seques-tration at the rate of 70–227 Kg haK1yrK1over 37–74-year period.Soils under diverse cropping systems generally havea higher SOC pool than those under monoculture ( Dicket al. 1986 ;Buyanoski et al. 1997 ;Drinkwater et al.1998 ;Buyanoski & Wagner 1998 ). Elimination ofsummer fallow is another option for minimizing lossesof the SOC pool ( Delgado et al. 1998 ;Rasmussen et al.1998 ). Growing a winter cover crop enhances soilquality through SOC sequestration. In the UK, Fullen &Auerswald (1998) reported that grass leys set asideincreased SOC concentration by 0.02% yrK1for 12years. In Australia, Grace & Oades (1994) observed thatthe SOC pool in the 0–10 cm layer increased linearlywith increase in frequency of pasture in the crop rotationcycle. In comparison with continuous cropping, incor-poration of cover crops in the rotation cycle enhancedSOC concentration in the surface layer by 15% inSweden ( Nilsson 1986 ), 23% in The Netherlands(Van Dijk 1982 ) and 28% in the UK ( Johnston 1973 )over 12–28-year period. Similar results were reported byLalet al. (1998) for the US cropland.The rate of sequestration ranges from negative orzero under arid and hot climates to approximatelystrategies of SOC sequestrationrestoration of soil degraded byconverting surplus agricultural land for nature conservancy and environmental improvementserosionsalinization andalkalizationnutrient depletionacidification andleachingcompetition, crusting andstructural declinepollution andcontaminationrestoring physical, chemical andbiological quality of degraded soilsadoption of RMPs on agricultural and forest soilsintegrated nutrient management (INM)no-till farming with residue mulch and cover cropsdiverse crop rotations,agroforestryand charcoalprecision farming andfertilizationintegrated pest management (IPM)agricultural intensification toincrease productivityFigure 4. Management strategies for soil carbon sequestration through restoration of degraded soils and adoption of RMPs onagricultural soils.822 R. Lal Carbon sequestrationPhil. Trans. R. Soc.

Normal rates ofSOC sequestration on agricultural soils are 300–500 Kg C haK1yrK1. High rates are obtained withno-till farming, crop residue retention as mulch,growing cover crops in the rotation cycle and adoptingcomplex farming systems including agroforestry, INMincluding manuring and through restoration ofdegraded soils by afforestation.Adoption of RMPs on agricultural and forest soils is awin–win strategy ( Follett 2001 ;Lalet al. 2003 ;L a l2004 a,b,2006 ). While improving soil quality andagronomic productivity, agricultural intensiﬁcationthrough adoption of RMPs also improves water quality,reduces non-point source pollution by decreasingdissolved and sediment loads, and reduces net rate ofCO2emission through SOC sequestration. It is a verynatural process ( Morris 2006 ). However, for the SOCsequestered to be stabilized, it is important to understandthe stabilizing mechanisms ( Sixet al.2002 ), limitations ofbiophysical ecosystems in C sequestration ( Schlesinger1999 ;Sauerbeck 2001 ), and relevant economic andpolicy issues ( McCarl & Schneider 2001 ). Trading of Ccredits may require several permits (at federal, state andlocal levels) and marketing procedures.(iii)Secondary carbonatesSoil C sequestration may also occur in SIC assecondary carbonates, and leaching of bicarbonatesinto the ground water. Secondary carbonates occur invarious forms as ﬁlms, threads, concretions andpedants. They also occur as laminar caps, caliche andcalcrate ( Gile 1993 ). In skeletal soils with high gravelconcentration, secondary carbonates occur as coatingson lower surfaces of stones and pebbles. There are fourprincipal mechanisms of formation of secondarycarbonates ( Monger 2002 ;Mermut & Landi 2006 ).Marion et al. (1985) proposed that secondary carbon-ates are formed through dissolution of CO2in thesurface layer followed by translocation and re-precipi-tation with CaC2and MgC2in the subsoil. In contrast,Sobecki & Wilding (1983) described the secondmechanism based on capillary rise of CaC2fromshallow ground water and its re-precipitation in thesurface layer. The third mechanism of in situdissolution and re-precipitation was proposed byRabenhorst & Wilding (1986) .Monger (2002)observed that pedogenic/secondary carbonates are ofbiogenic origin and are formed by activity of soil fauna(e.g. termites). Chemical reactions describing thedissolution of CO2are shown in the followingequations described by Mermut & Landi (2006) :CO 2ðgas ÞCH2O%CO 2ðaqÞCH2O;CO 2ðaqÞCH2O%H2CO 3;H2CO 3%HCCHCOK3;HCOK3%HCCCO2K3;H2CO 3%2HCCCO2K3andCa2CðaqÞC2 HCOK3ðaqÞ%CaCO 3ðcalcite ÞCH2OCCO 2:Secondary carbonates are formed in the soil pHrange of 7.3–8.5. There must, however, be sufﬁcientquantity of CaC2and MgC2present in the soilsystem. Decreasing water content, decreasing partialpressure of CO 2or HCOK3in soil air, and increasingthe products of CaC2or HCOK3in soil favour theprecipitation of secondary carbonates.In contrast to SOC, the rate of formation ofsecondary carbonates is low. In the deserts of south-western USA, Marion et al. (1985) estimated thatduring the Pleistocene the rate of deposition ofsecondary carbonates was 1.2–6 Kg C haK1yrK1.I nanother study for the same region, Schlesinger (1985)estimated the rate of formation of secondary carbonatesas being between 1.2 and 4.2 Kg C haK1yrK1.A l s oi nthe southwestern USA, Monger & Gallegos (2000)reported the rates of formation of secondary carbonatesat 1–14 Kg C haK1yrK1. In Saskatchewan, Canada,Landi (2002) estimated the rate of deposition ofsecondary carbonates ranging between 9.9 and13.4 Kg C haK1yrK1. For a non-calcareous parentmaterial, Machette (1985) estimated the rate of depo-sition ranging between 1.7 and 6.1 Kg C haK1yrK1,a n dconcluded that rates are generally highin calcareous soils.Leaching of biocarbonates into ground water isa n o t h e rm e c h a n i s mo ft r a n s f e ro fS I Ci n t oal e s sactive pool, especially in soils irrigated with goodquality water ( Nordt et al. 2000 ) .T h er a t eo fleaching of HCO 3-in irrigated soils may be as muchas 0.25–1.0 Mg C haK1yrK1(Wilding 1999 ). Thereare 250 Mha of irrigated land area globally. Thepotential of leaching of HCOK3in these soils may be62.5–250 Tg C yrK1. With the exception of irrigatedsoils, there are not many technological options toenhance the rate of deposition of secondarycarbonates. Use of organic amendments (e.g. cropresidue mulch, manure and other biosolids) mayenhance activity of termites and other soil fauna,and also increase the formation of secondarycarbonates through biogenic processes. Use ofgood quality irrigation water to enhanceleaching of HCOK3is another relevant option forirrigated soils.4. BIOFUELSConverting biomass-derived sugars to ethanol andplant-derived oils and fats into bio-diesel is a viablestrategy to reduce use of fossil fuels and developalternate/sustainable sources of energy ( Himmel et al.2007 ;Stephanopoulos 2007 ;Wald 2007 ). Of theworld’s total primary energy supply of 11.2 Pg of oilequivalent in 2004, 35.03% came from oil, 24.6% fromcoal, 20.44% from gas, 6.33% from nuclear and13.61% from renewable sources ( Goldemberg 2007 ).Of the renewable sources, 2.48% was contributed bythe traditional biofuels (e.g. animal dung, cropresidues, wood products), and 1.91% by modernbiofuels. Only 3.22% of the primary energy wascontributed by hydro, solar, wind and geothermalsources.Biofuels, high on the political and scientiﬁcagenda, are related to C sequestration in twodistinct but interrelated aspects ( ﬁgure 5 ): (i) soilCarbon sequestration R. Lal 823Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 C sequestration through restoration of the depletedSOC pool, especially when agriculturally degraded/marginal soils are converted to energy plantations,and (ii) recycling of atmospheric CO2into biomass-based biofuels. With choice of the appropriatespecies and prudent management, biofuels producedfrom energy plantations established by dedicatedcrops (e.g. poplar, willow, switch grass, miscanthus,karnal grass, Andropogan ,Pennisetum ) can sequesterC in soil, offset fossil fuel emissions and reduce therate of abundance of atmospheric CO2and otherGHGs. In contrast to the beneﬁcial impacts, somehave argued that there will be in increase incompetition for land and water to establish energyplantations.With the long-term goal of producing 1 Pg oflignocellulosic biomass in the USA and 4–5 Pg in theWorld, crop residues (e.g. corn, wheat, sorghum,millet, barley) are increasingly being considered assource of the biomass ( Somerville 2006 ;Graham et al.2007 ). It is also argued that using corn grain-basedethanol instead of gasoline reduces GHG emissionsonly by 18% ( Service 2007 ). Thus, ethanol producedfrom cellulosic biomass rather than grains is apreferred alternative. Furthermore, the price of corngrains has increased to more than $330 MgK1in theUSA, which has a snowballing impact on food pricesin Mexico and elsewhere. Some countries (e.g. USA,China, India) are planning to use 300–400 million Mgof crop residue per annum as a source of renewableenergy, which may have severe adverse consequenceson soils and the environment. Indeed, indiscriminateremoval of crop residues can severely jeopardize soilquality ( ﬁgure 6 ). For example, it has been theperpetual removal of crop residues for numerouscompeting uses (e.g. fodder, household fuel, construc-tion material) and use of animal dung for cooking fuelwhich have caused widespread and severe problems ofsoil degradation, low crop yields, and hunger andmalnutrition in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa(Lal 2006 ).Crop residues are not a waste. They are preciouscommodities and their use as soil amendments isessential for preserving soil quality ( Wilhelm et al.2004 ). Adverse impacts of residue removal on soilquality must be objectively and critically reviewed priorto installing large-scale cellulosic ethanol plants. Thus,cellulosic biomass must be produced on speciﬁcallyestablished energy plantations. It is also possible toprocure biomass from low-input high-density (LIHD)mixtures of native grassland perennials ( Tilmanet al. 2006 ).5. FARMING CARBONCarbon sequestered in soils and trees can be traded,just as any farm produce (e.g. corn, milk, meat).Trading C credits is a rapidly growing industry(Gressel 2007 ;McGowan 2007 ). The market is wellestablished in Europe ( Johnson & Heinen 2004 ;Brahic 2006 ) and the USA through ChicagoClimate Exchange ( Breslau 2006 ). The ‘cap andtrade’ movement is gaining momentum in the USA(Schlesinger 2006 ;McGowan 2007 ). The discussionon this topic is now being focused on policy optionsfor slowing emissions of GHGs ( Kerr 2007 ;Kintisch2007 b). Important among these options are: (i)imposing tax on C emissions called C tax, (ii)providing government subsidies, and (iii) trading Ccredits. The cap and trade system would ensure theachievement of environment goals. While the marketfor trading C sequestered in soils and biota is beingdeveloped in North America and Europe, the strategymay be extremely beneﬁcial to the resource-poor andsmall land holders of developing countries of Asia andAfrica. Trading C credits can provide a much neededincome stream for the farmer, and an essentialincentive to invest in soil restoration (e.g. erosioncontrol, irrigation, fertilizers), break the agrarianstagnation and advance food security.6. MERITS AND LIMITATIONS OF BIOTIC VERSUSABIOTIC CARBON SEQUESTRATIONBiotic C sequestration, based on removal of atmos-pheric CO2through photosynthesis, is a naturalprocess. The magnitude of CO 2removal throughphotosynthesis, in woody plants of managed andnatural ecosystems, is likely to increase in the futuredue to the CO2fertilization effect. The process can bemanaged through input of essential nutrients (e.g. N, P,K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Mo) and management of water.There are numerous ancillary beneﬁts of terrestrial/biotic C sequestration. Important among these are:(i) improved quality of soil and water resources,(ii) decreased nutrient losses from ecosystems,(iii) reduced soil erosion, (iv) better wildlife habitat,(v) increased water conservation, (vi) restoreddegraded soils, and (vii) increased use efﬁciency ofinput. Soil C sequestration, both as SOC and SIC, isalso a natural process essential for recycling of elementsand water. Similar to the terrestrial pool, increase in theSOC pool also has numerous ancillary beneﬁtsaffecting local, regional and global processes. Principalbeneﬁts of SOC sequestration to soil quality are:(i) improvement in soil structure, (ii) reduction in soilerosion, (iii) decrease in non-point source pollution,(iv) increase in plant-available water reserves,(v) increase in storage of plant nutrients, (vi)denaturing of pollutants, (vii) increase in soil quality,(viii) increase in agronomic productivity of foodsecurity, (ix) moderation of climate, and (x) increasemodern biofuels from energy plantationsreduction in net CO2 emissionsrecycling of atmospheric CO2mitigation of climate changedecline in net rate of CO2 increaseimprovement in soil qualitysoil carbon sequestrationFigure 5.

Therefore,the process of biotic C sequestration strengthens andenhances ecosystem services while enhancing agro-nomic production. The process is cost-effective, andRMPs for adoption on agricultural and forest soils/ecosystem are available for most ecoregions of theworld ( IPCC 1999 ). However, the total sink capacityfor biotic C sequestration especially that in terrestrialecosystems is low at 50–100 Pg C over 25–50-yearperiod ( Lal 2004 a,b). Further, C sequestered in soila n db i o t ac a nb er e - e m i t t e dw i t hc h a n g ei ns o i lmanagement (e.g. ploughing) and land use (e.g.deforestation) ( table 2 ).In contrast to biotic sequestration, abiotic seques-tration is an engineering process. The technology fordeep injection in the ocean, geological strata, coalmines and oil wells, etc. are being developed and maybe routinely available by 2025 and beyond. At present,these techniques are expensive and injected CO2isprone to leakage. In addition to high cost, the issues ofmeasurement and monitoring, adverse ecologicalimpacts and regulatory measures need to be developedand implemented. However, the sink capacity of abiotictechniques is extremely large at thousands of Pg C, andoften estimated to exceed the fossil C reserves. Bioticand abiotic systems are complimentary to one another.Table 2.

B (2008) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 May 2023 Depending upon ecosystem characteristics, there maybe site-speciﬁc ecological niches for biotic and abioticsequestration options. Biotic sequestration options areimmediately available. Use of such options buys ustime, while C-neutral energy production technologiesof alternatives to fossil fuels and techniques of abioticsequestration take effect.7. CONCLUSIONSAlthough natural terrestrial and oceanic sinks arepresently absorbing approximately 60% of the8.6 Pg C yrK1emitted, natural sink capacity and rateare not large enough to assimilate all the projectedanthropogenic CO2emitted during the twenty-ﬁrstcentury or until the C-neutral energy sources takeeffect. The sink capacity of managed ecosystems (e.g.forest, soils and wetlands) can be enhanced throughconversion to a judicious land use and adoption ofRMPs of forestry, agricultural crops and pastures.Purposeful manipulation of biological processes canaccelerate the CO2sequestration process with adoptionof regulatory measures and identiﬁcation of policyincentives. However, for these management systems tobe effective, there is a strong need for an integratedsystems approach. While the global C cycle is affectedby human activities, it is also coupled with cycles ofH2O and other elements (e.g. N, P, S) and effectivenessof biotic/terrestrial sequestration depends on scientiﬁcunderstanding of these coupled cycles.Abiotic sequestration of anthropogenically emittedCO2through direct injection in oceanic and geologicalstrata has a large sink capacity. Mineral carbonation ofCO 2into stable carbonates of Ca and Mg is anotheroption with a large capacity. These engineeringtechniques are being developed and may be availablefor routine use by 2025 and beyond. Additionalresearch is needed to make these technologies cost-effective, reduce leakage risks, minimize any adverseimpacts on the environment and enhance safety. Inaddition to economics, the human dimension issuesneed to be objectively and critically addressed for bothbiotic and abiotic CO2sequestration options. Appro-priate policy and regulatory measures need to bedeveloped, especially with regards to measurement,monitoring, residence time and trading of carboncredits. While carbon sequestration is an importantstrategy, the signiﬁcance of reducing emissions throughdevelopment of carbon neutral technologies cannot beoveremphasized. The latter may involve efﬁcient energyproduction and usage measures, and ﬁnding alterna-tives to fossil fuel. Biofuels (e.g. bioethanol, bio-diesel,methane gas from biodigester and H2cell frombiomass) are an important component of alternativesources of energy.REFERENCESAnderson, S. H., Gantzer, C.
