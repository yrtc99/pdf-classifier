REVIEW Open AccessInfluence of trees and associated variableson soil organic carbon: a reviewAngom Sarjubala DeviAbstractThe level of soil organic carbon (SOC) fluctuates in different types of forest stands: this variation can be attributedto differences in tree species, and the variables associated with soil, climate, and topographical features. Thepresent review evaluates the level of SOC in different types of forest stands to determine the factors responsible forthe observed variation. Mixed stands have the highest amount of SOC, while coniferous (both deciduous-coniferousand evergreen-coniferous) stands have greater SOC concentrations than deciduous (broadleaved) and evergreen(broadleaved) tree stands. There was a significant negative correlation between SOC and mean annual temperature(MAT) and sand composition, in all types of forest stands. In contrast, the silt fraction has a positive correlation withSOC, in all types of tree stands. Variation in SOC under different types of forest stands in different landscapes canbe due to differences in MAT, and the sand and silt fraction of soil apart from the type of forests.Keywords: Coniferous, Deciduous, Evergreen, Sand, SiltIntroductionSoil organic carbon (SOC) is an essential component ofenvironmental quality assessment. Atmospheric CO 2istransferred into long-lasting pools, such as soil organicmatter (SOM), thus reducing the atmospheric concen-tration of CO 2(McBratney et al. 2014 ). SOC is vital forsoil fertility, plant growth, and production (Janzen 2006 ).The total amount of carbon (C) stored in soil globally isestimated to be 1500 Pg C, with soil containing more Cthan the atmosphere (800 Pg C) and vegetation (500 PgC) combined (FAO & ITPS 2015 ). A small variation inSOC concentrations can significantly affect the globalcarbon cycle (Walter et al. 2016 ).Climate, land cover, soil texture, and soil order allaffect SOC storage (Batjes 2016 ): Entisols and Aridisolsstore low amounts of SOC, whereas Histosols naturallystore high amounts. When CaCO 3is present in the soil,typically at pH 6.5 or higher, soil inorganic carbon (SIC)is formed (Lal et al. 1995 ). Histosols, Andisols, Spodo-sols, Oxisols, and Ultisols do not contain SIC, but Arido-sols may store high amounts of SIC. On average,Inceptisols store the lowest amount of total C (SOC andSIC) and Histosols store the highest amount of total C(mostly SOC) (Eswaran et al. 2000 ). Global SOC concen-trations range from low to high in soils of arid and tem-perate regions, respectively, and extremely high inorganic or peat soils (Lal 2004 ).Vegetation community structure may also affect thesize of the SOC pool by altering both the microenviron-ment and soil characteristics (You et al. 2014 ). Globally,forest soil is a much more important C sink than liveforest biomass, with concentrations two to four timeshigher in the upper 30 cm, and three to six times higherin the upper 50 cm (Calvode et al. 2020 ). Worldwide,forests cover 4.03 billion ha, approximately 30% of theearth ’s surface: of the total C stock in forest biomes, 37%occurs in low latitude forests, 14% in mid latitudes and49% in high latitudes. A large part of the total SOC oc-curs in soils of tundra, pre-tundra, and taiga regions(Wyse 2012 ). Forests with different tree species vary inlitter quality and root exudates, generating a divergencein soil properties, which may influence the soil microbialcommunity (Chandra et al. 2016 ). SOC dynamics alsodiffer due to variations in local vegetation types (Saizet al. 2012 ; Gruba et al. 2015 ).© The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you giveappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate ifchanges were made.

Tree species are one of several factors thatinfluence soil C and nitrogen (N) inputs and outputs.Comparative studies of tree species grown under differ-ent conditions are beneficial in determining their effect(Binkley 1995 ), and the influence of tree species dependson the differences in soil conditions, such as parent ma-terial or land use (Vesterdal et al. 2008 ). Zhou et al.(2020 ) observed mixed forest stands of Cunninghamialanceolata and Phyllostachys heterocycla have 3.33% ofSOM compared with pure stands of C. lanceolata(1.77%) indicating mixed forest stands are better forstoring SOM. Marler et al. ( 2016 ) have also indicatedmixed deciduous tree stands can store more SOC (130.0mgg−1) than pure forest stands of Leucaena leucophela(73.7 mgg−1). Mixing of Acacia tree species in Eucalyptusplantations in sandy and nutrient-poor soils involved soilC and N accretion after 7 years in the Republic of Congo(Koutika et al. 2019 ). Similar observations of mixed for-est stands recording more SOC than pure stands werealso reported by Yao et al. ( 2019 ). While, deciduous for-ests, with large C pools in the forest floor, store less car-bon in soil (Oostra et al. 2006 ), and more C has beenfound in soils under mixed spruce forest in central west-ern Europe (Berger et al. 2002 ). According to Guedeset al. ( 2016 ), coniferous tree stands of Pinus taeda re-corded 135 Mg/ha of SOC compared with deciduoustree stands of Miombo (87 Mg/ha). Adivia et al. ( 2016 )have provided consistent evidence of greater buildup offorest floor humus leading to more SOC in coniferousforest soils. Therefore, vegetation type is the most im-portant variable driving the spatial pattern of SOC (Shiet al. 2012 ). Trees may influence the properties of soilsbeneath them, with a number of species affecting factorssuch as pH (Finzi et al. 1998 ), C and N levels, and thecomposition of the microbial community (Mitchell et al.2010 ).In this review, the author sought to determine whethervariation in tree species is the only factor regulating theamount of SOC, or if other variables are involved. Theeffect of mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annualprecipitation (MAP), tree age, elevation, soil pH, and therelative composition of sand, silt, and clay were selectedfor analysis as these have been commonly reported inthe literature. The aim of this review is to determinewhat effect these variables have on SOC.MethodologyFor this review, a literature survey was carried out usingthe following search engines and academic platforms:ResearchGate ( https://www.researchgate.net ), GoogleScholar ( www.googlescholar.com ), Science Direct(https://www.sciencedirest.com ), Springer ( www.springer.com ), and Taylor and Francis ( https://www.taylorandfrancis.com ). Research published prior to Janu-ary 2020 was considered for the present study. The key-words used were “SOC in different tree stands ”and“influence of trees on SOC. ”Numerous studies have re-ported SOC from different forest types; however, thespecific tree species and the level of SOC in the forestsare less reported. Therefore, literature on “litter decom-position, ”where soil characteristics have been reported,were also collected. In numerous studies, SOC has beengiven in the form of C-storage. This is difficult to con-vert into SOC without knowing the bulk density valueand weight of soil particles ≥2 mm, therefore these stud-ies were not included.The most widely reported procedure for SOC estima-tion is the wet digestion method of the Walkley-Blacktechnique (Walkley 1947 ), which uses the heat from asulfuric acid reaction to oxidize SOC by hot chromicacid. In recent studies, a CHN-elemental analyzer is usedfor SOC estimation. In many studies, a conversion factorof 1.2 has been applied for the SOC levels determinedby the Walkley-Black method; in the present review,however, no conversion factor was applied as DeVoset al. ( 2007 ) have pointed out sandy soils with conifersshowed 6% higher recoveries than broadleaved specieson heavier textured soils. For each laboratory and typeof soil, they recommended that specific recovery factorsneed to be determined in order to standardize the re-sults. Studies that reported only SOM were converted toSOC by dividing by 1.72 as SOM contains 58% SOC. Inmost of the studies, SOC levels were given in g kg−1,which was converted into percentage by dividing by afactor of 10.The composition of sand, silt, and clay were deter-mined either by the micro-pipette method (Miller andMiller 1987 ), the sieve method, or the hydrometermethod (Day 1965 ). Studies that measured soil pH usinga 1:1 or a 1:2.5 soil to water ratio were selected, as manystudies have also reported the pH as the soil to KCl ra-tio. The soil sampling depths were variable (Adekunleet al. 2011 ; Guedes et al. 2016 ; Zhou et al. 2020 ); how-ever, the most common depth was 0 –20 cm, therefore,the present review was limited to reports from thisdepth. In all the selected studies, soil sampling was doneby removal of the organic layer prior to sampling. Asmany as 60 tree species were recorded. Among the con-iferous trees, the number of deciduous-conifer was veryless compared with evergreen-conifers; therefore, theywere grouped together as coniferous trees. Thebroadleaved-deciduous and broadleaved-evergreen treeswere simply classified as deciduous and evergreen trees.Altogether the trees were broadly classified into four cat-egories: coniferous, deciduous, evergreen, and mixedtypes.Devi Journal of Ecology and Environment            (2021) 45:5 Page 2 of 14Table 1 Soil organic carbon (SOC) and associated variables (age, mean annual temperature [MAT], mean annual precipitation [MAP],soil type, altitude, depth, % sand, % silt, % clay, and pH) in different types of tree stands, C: coniferous; D: deciduous; E: evergreen;and M: mixed.

The Pearson ’s correlationcoefficient was used to find associations between SOCand the following variables: MAT; MAP; sand, silt, andclay composition; age; elevation, and soil pH. A Stu-dent ’sttest was performed to determine the significancelevel ( p< 0.05) for these correlations. A one-way analysisof variance was performed on the SOC levels in the dif-ferent categories of trees using SPSS (IBM, version 16.0).Results and discussionSOC under different tree standsSOC was found in very high concentrations unders p e c i f i ct r e es t a n d s .T a b l e 1shows that the max-imum level of SOC (11.02%) was found in mixedstands of the coniferous trees Picea abies and Pinuscembra (Margesin et al. 2016 ), followed by mixedconiferous stands of Picea abies and Larix decidua(9.44%) (Zehetgruber et al. 2017 ). Mixed deciduousstands of Betula platyphylla and Populus davidiana(Sun et al. 2019 ), deciduous stands of Fagus sylvatica(Kooijman et al. 2009 ), mixed coniferous stands ofPseudotsuga menzeisii ,Pinus lambertiana and Pinusponderosa (Heckman et al. 2013 ), deciduous standsofBetula utilis (Shedayi et al. 2016 ), and evergreenstands of Leuceana leucocephala (Marler et al. 2016 )had SOC concentrations of 9.03%, 8.4%, 8.3%, 7.57%,and 7.37%, respectively. The lowest concentrationamong the higher group was found in coniferousand deciduous mixed stands of Quercus aliena andPinus armandi (7.01%) (Sun et al. 2019 ).The results show that, out of the top eight treestands that recorded the highest SOC level, threewere from mixed coniferous tree stands: one frommixed deciduous trees, one from mixed coniferousand deciduous tree stands. The mixed stands re-corded an average SOC of 4.62% ± 2.08%, with arange of 0.9% to 11.02% ( p< 0.058). The average SOCof mixed tree stands was higher than the overall aver-age of all trees (3.70%) (Table 2). These results indi-cate that mixed tree stands are common and canstore the most SOC.Within the coniferous tree stands, an average SOC of3.63% ± 1.49% was recorded: Larix principallis fromNortheast China had the maximum (6.16%) (Miao et al.2013 )a n d Juneperus excelsa from Northern Pakistan,had the least (0.70%) (Shedayi et al. 2016 ). In deciduoustree stands, which had an average SOC of 3.14% ± 1.70%,Fagus sylvatica had the maximum (8.4%) (Kooijmanet al. 2009 ) followed by Betula utilis (7.57%) (Shedayiet al. 2016 ),Quercus mongolica (6.9%) (Chae et al. 2016 ),Betula platyphylla (6.8%) (Miao et al. 2013 ) and Diptero-carpus tuberculatus had the least (0.2%) (Yadava andDevi 2007 ). In evergreen tree stands, the maximum SOClevel was 7.37% in Leuceana leucocephalla (Marler et al.2016 ), followed by 6.8% in Castanopsis fargesii (Si et al.2018 ), and the minimum level was 0.32% in Casuarinaequisetifolia (Panda 2020 ); the average was 3.28% ±1.66%.The analysis of variance showed variation of SOCamong the four types of stands (F 3,106= 2.56; P<0.058). SOC levels were most commonly reportedfrom deciduous tree stands, with 35 concentrationsrecorded from different locations, followed by 34 re-cordings from coniferous tree stands.

As shown in Fig. 1, mixed tree standscan store the highest concentrations of SOC. Conifer-ous tree stands recorded higher amounts of SOC thandeciduous trees, while ever green tree stands recordedthe lowest SOC level; however, this could also be dueto fewer observations.Coniferous species generally accumulate greater SOCconcentrations in the forest floor layer than deciduousTable 1 Soil organic carbon (SOC) and associated variables (age, mean annual temperature [MAT], mean annual precipitation [MAP],soil type, altitude, depth, % sand, % silt, % clay, and pH) in different types of tree stands, C: coniferous; D: deciduous; E: evergreen;and M: mixed.

Soil C reserves in the for-est floor are generally greater under conifers than underbroadleaved species (Vesterdal et al. 2013 ). As the nee-dles of conifers take more time to decompose subse-quent buildup of the litter can lead to more SOC,moreover conifers commonly occur in colder regionscontributing to the delayed rate of decomposition. Dis-turbance due to human activities leading to erosion ofsoil is also an important factor in lowering SOC, whichcan be relatively lower in cold regions compared withwarmer regions. Another factor can be attributed to thelow amount of precipitation passing through a denseand low canopy in coniferous forests that preventednutrient loss from the soil organic horizons (Lukinaet al. 2019 ). Combining different tree species can have aprofound effect on C accumulation ratios and SOC dis-tribution within the soil profile (Chapin 2003 ), and com-pared with monospecific stands, the establishment ofmixed forests promotes soil C sequestration. In mixedNorway spruce and European beech tree stands, theNorway spruce favored SOC accumulation in the forestfloor whereas C incorporation into the uppermost min-eral soil was promoted by root turnover of Europeanbeech. Therefore, conversion of monospecific planta-tions into mixed stands enhance SOM accumulation andstabilization in the mineral layers and, hence, the long-Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the four categories of tree stands.

The mixed typeof tree stands provides a different composition in the in-put litter, regulating growth and survival of differenttypes of soil macro- and microorganisms.Soil typeThe main soil type was found to be Cambisol, along withdifferent subcategories, followed by Oxisol. Cambisolshave a number of important characteristics that enablethem to occur in widely differing environments: theycontain weatherable minerals in the silt and sand frac-tions, have good water holding capacity, and have a neu-tral to weakly acidic soil reaction that promoteschemical fertility and an active soil fauna (Driessen2001 ). Oxisols occur in the hot and humid conditions oftropical regions, where the B horizon is enriched withiron, aluminum oxides, and kaolinite (Beinroth et al.1996 ).Role of MAT and MAPFor all the tree types, SOC was significantly correlatedwith MAT ( p< 0.05) (Table 3), with a lower airtemperature resulting in a higher SOC content (Fig. 2).This correlation was also significant in deciduous andmixed tree stands. Sun et al. ( 2019 ) observed an averagerate of reduction in SOC was 1.87% with 1 °C increase inMAT in monospecific stands and mixed tree stands.However, annual litter fall (input) and soil microbialFig. 3 Relationship of soil organic carbon (SOC) with age ( N= 38) for all the recorded tree speciesFig. 4 Relationship of soil organic carbon (SOC) with sand ( N= 50), silt ( N= 47), and clay ( N= 51) for all the recorded tree speciesDevi Journal of Ecology and Environment            (2021) 45:5 Page 9 of 14respiration (output) increased with MAT, indicating thata decrease in SOC concentration did not result fromchanges in either organic matter input or output, butfrom the balance between them. Chandra et al. ( 2016 )had recorded a significant higher concentration of mi-crobial biomass C in temperate forests having a max-imum MAT range of 18 –30 °C than dry deciduousforests having 28 –42 °C. Liu et al. ( 2016 ) also recorded anegative correlation of SOC and MAT in different for-ests at separate provinces, citing lower temperaturesslow down decomposition and respiration allowing SOCto accumulate.The correlation between SOC and MAP was not sig-nificant for all tree types, as well as for different treestands ( P> 0.05). This result was in contrast to the re-sults of Yost and Hartemink ( 2019 ) who reported thatSOC generally increased with increasing rainfall. Theyfound that, on average, SOC exceeded 2% in soils fromcold and temperate zones, and increased to 4% whenMAP was between 500 and 750 mm, and 11% whenMAP was between 800 and 1000 mm. In the tropics,SOC was < 0.5% when MAP was between 500 and 700mm, and increased to 2% when MAP was between 800and 1000 mm. Calvode et al. ( 2020 ) also stated thatMAP was the variable most predictive of SOC, followedby lithology, land use, and soil pH.Age and altitudeTree age showed a significant and positive correlationwith SOC for all tree types ( p< 0.05): C storage in thesoil increased with tree age. Singh and Sharma ( 2007 ) re-ported greater SOC and available macronutrients inolder plantations of Populus deltoides compared withyounger plantations. In Gmelina arborea stand, thehighest percentage of SOM with 4.78% was recorded inthe oldest stand of 20 years while the least 0.7% was re-corded in the youngest stand of 10 years (Adekunle et al.2011 ). However, it was not significant for the differenttypes of tree stands ( p> 0.05). Edmondson et al. ( 2014 )reported there was no effect of tree size on soil C stor-age, especially for oaks where the largest individualswere 1.6 to 2.0 m dbh. The correlation of SOC with alti-tude was not significant overall ( p> 0.05); however, itwas significant in the deciduous tree stands ( p< 0.05).Shedayi et al. ( 2016 ) demonstrated that organic C has aTable 3 Correlation coefficient between soil organic carbon (SOC) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature(MAT), sand, silt, clay, age, altitude, and pH for all tree species and the four categories of tree standsAll tree species Coniferous Deciduous Evergreen MixedR2(%) r R2(%) r R2(%) rR2(%) rR2(%) rMAP 0.9 0.09 13.0 0.36 3.3 −0.18 48.6 0.69 0.1 0.03MAT 13.6 −0.37* 0.4 −0.06 27.2 −0.52* 1.7 −0.13 21.4 −0.45*Sand 36.7 −0.61* 40.8 −0.63* 27.7 −0.52* 88.0 −0.93* 35.7 −0.59*Silt 33.6 0.58* 22.1 0.47 11.3 0.33 96.0 0.97* 52.6 0.72*Clay 1.2 0.11 31.2 0.56* 2.4 0.15 37.0 0.60 4.8 −0.21Age 27.0 0.52* 3.3 0.18 23.5 0.48 1.6 0.13 2.6 −0.16Altitude 2.0 0.14 0.1 0.04 25.0 0.50* 100 1.0 14.0 0.37pH 3.7 −0.20 6.2 −0.25 8.2 −0.28 1.7 0.13 10.8 −0.32*Significant at p< 0.05 (using ttest)Table 4 Mean and standard deviation for the mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), sand, silt, clay, age,altitude, and pH in evergreen and mixed tree standsEvergreen MixedMax Min Mean SD N Max Min Mean SD NMAP (mm) 1749 950.0 1366 305.0 6 2542 73 1159.76 509.24 21MAT (oC) 27.00 19.0 19.65 0.77 5 25.00 7.4 15.57 5.38 22Sand (%) 92.44 37.29 74.53 20.51 5 71.40 2.6 32.09 18.38 14Silt (%) 43.55 1.87 12.62 12.84 5 86.20 8.0 46.08 17.40 14Clay (%) 25.69 5.69 12.44 7.98 5 58.30 5.78 24.31 14.48 15Age (yrs.) 600.00 6.0 161.75 219.12 4 400.0 20.0 81.87 113.42 7Altitude (m asl) 410 100 255 155 2 2650 157.0 931.18 519.66 22pH 7.15 4.08 5.11 0.77 12 6.58 3.3 5.21 0.93 17Devi Journal of Ecology and Environment            (2021) 45:5 Page 10 of 14strong positive correlation with elevation in differenttypes of tree stands.TextureThe sand fraction showed a significant negative cor-relation with SOC for all trees (Fig. 4), as well as forthe different types of tree stands (Table 3). The siltfraction demonstrated a significant positive correlationfor all trees and for evergreen and mixed types oftree stands: the average silt fraction was highest inmixed tree stands (46.08%) (Table 4) .T h ec l a yf r a c -tion did not show a significant correlation with SOC,except for in coniferous tree stands ( p< 0.05). Thenegative correlation of SOC with the sand fractionhas been reported previously (Tiessen & Stewart1983 ; Liu et al. 2016 ; Zhong et al. 2018 ), however, apositive correlation with the silt fraction is less welldocumented, although Riestra et al. ( 2012 )r e p o r t e dapositive correlation of SOC content with clay plus siltcontent in forest soils. Loam soils are 40% sand, 40%silt, and 20% clay, which is ideal for plant growth dueto the desirable characteristics of these mineral parti-cles (Sun et al. 2019 ). Therefore, silt composition ofup to 40% is beneficial for maintaining a stable SOClevel in forest ecosystems.Sand content is affected by soil erosion; therefore,it can be used as an indicator for evaluating soildegradation under different land-use systems (Ayeleet al. 2013 ). There is only limited information onhow physical fractions and the chemical structuresof SOC relate to climate and vegetation types, espe-cially for forest soil (Watson et al. 2000 ). C storageis affected by soil texture and aggregation: the high-est amount of soil C is found in the silt- and clay-sized fractions, while the sand-sized fraction is lowin soil C (Galeote et al. 2015 ). Vegetation character-istics may be a local modifi er of clay content undersimilar climatic conditions. Therefore, the correlationbetween SOC concentrations and clay content maybe localized and climate-dependent, and regulated bythe large moisture difference that plays an essentialrole in driving the significant positive correlation ofS O Ca n dt h ec l a yf r a c t i o n( Z h o n ge ta l . 2018 ).pHThe average pH of all the tree stands was 5.23 (Table 5),with the lowest pH found in coniferous trees (4.84)(Table 6). The correlation of SOC with pH was not sig-nificant; however, a negative trend was observed (Table3). Negative relationships between SOC and soil pHhave been found in all soil groups, except the soil group,which has the highest SOC level (Zhang et al. 2020 ). Ingeneral, pH values in the topsoil were lower becausetopsoil is rich in organic matter, which decomposes,leading to the production of more organic acids and thuslowering the pH (Hong et al. 2019 ).ConclusionsThis review demonstrates that variation in tree species isan important factor in the amount of SOC: mixed foreststands store more SOC than simple pure forest stands.Processes associated with individual trees, such as stemTable 5 Mean and standard deviation for the mean annualprecipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), sand, silt,clay, age, altitude, and pH in all types of tree speciesMax Min Mean SD NMAP(mm) 4000.00 73.00 1210.00 588.00 74MAT(oC) 27.00 −1.00 15.49 7.10 71Sand (%) 94.70 2.60 43.20 23.74 50Silt (%) 86.20 1.87 34.89 19.91 47Clay (%) 60.60 3.50 23.51 14.31 51Age (yrs.) 110.00 6.00 41.46 23.41 37Altitude (m asl) 3440.00 6.00 1065.00 700.00 71pH 8.33 3.30 5.23 1.02 89Table 6 Mean and standard deviation for the mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), sand, silt, clay, age,altitude, and pH in coniferous and deciduous tree stands.

Conifer-ous tree stands have a greater SOC storage capacity thandeciduous tree stands. A common variable that regulatesor reduces the level of SOC could not be established forthe different categories of forest stands except the sandfraction. However, the silt fraction and MAT were foundto have positive and inverse relationships respectively, inall forest stands, as well as in the category of mixed for-est stands. As highlighted by Mayer et al. ( 2020 ), furtherresearch is necessary to tease apart the influence of spe-cies and sites. Combining a network of common gardenexperiments, at greater spatial scales, could identifywhere and how certain tree species could be beneficialto C soil sequestration, and in which forms and soillayers. The important influencing factors of spatial varia-tions in SOC concentration in different forest stands areMAT, sand, and silt fractions of soil.AbbreviationsC:Carbon; SOC: Soil organic carbon; SIC: Soil inorganic carbon; SOM: Soilorganic matter; MAT: Mean annual temperature; MAP: Mean annualprecipitation; C: Coniferous; D: Deciduous; E: Evergreen; M: MixedAcknowledgementsThe author would like to acknowledge JournalEdit (http://www.journaledit.com) for editing and reviewing the manuscript for Englishlanguage.DeclarationThe author declares that the manuscript has not been published orsubmitted for publication elsewhere.Author ’s contributionsThe author has done the review of literatures.
