It is being considered as apotentially signiﬁcant means of storing carbon for long periods tomitigate greenhouse gases ( Laird, 2008 ). Much of the interest inbiochar comes from studies of Amazonian soils that appear to havebeen amended with biochar, with signiﬁcant improvements in soilquality and positive effects on crop yields ( Lehmann et al., 2004 ).These changes have persisted for hundreds, if not thousands, ofyears. It is not yet known how long it takes for biochar to integratewith the soil and express its beneﬁts. However, biochar representsa stable form of carbon and thus provides an intriguing potentialcarbon storage strategy as a soil amendment ( Mathews, 2008 ).This study assesses the potential value of the use of biochar asa soil amendment from potential dual beneﬁts of increased cropyields and returns from carbon sequestration, under a set ofassumed conditions. We consider the effect of biochar in improv-ing crop productivity by ameliorating the soil acidity. Next, weevaluate and aggregate emissions avoided and carbon seques-tered when biochar replaces lime usage in the ﬁeld. We thencalculate the value of carbon offsets using a low and high pricerange of $1 and $31/MT CO2, assuming a carbon trading mechan-ism exists for biochar soil application. As a case study, we focuson wheat production in Washington State and examine farmproﬁtability with and without the application of biochar. Ourﬁndings suggest that it may be proﬁtable to apply biochar as a soilamendment under some conditions if the biochar market price islow enough and/or a carbon offset market exists.The existing literature will be reviewed in detail below. As willbe discussed, some of these studies focus on the properties andapplication rates of biochar and their impacts on agriculturalproductivity, and some examine biochar’s potential in sequester-ing carbon. However, this is the ﬁrst study to our knowledge thatlinks farm proﬁtability with the economic value of biochar as asoil additive and as a source of carbon offset credits.The following two sections provi de a review of existing studies ofthe impacts of biochar soil application to crop productivity and tocarbon (C) sequestration. We rely on the results of these studies inour analysis of the economic value of biochar as a soil amendment.Section 4 describes our methodology, and Section 5 presentsestimated costs and returns in crop production for the case of wheat,with and without the application of biochar. Section 6 concludes.2. Impacts of biochar on crop productivity —related studiesA number of studies have investigated the response of crops tobiochar application. Table 1 presents summaries of a limitedsample of these studies showing the impacts of biochar on cropresponse in terms of yield or plant biomass. Observed impactsvary depending on interactions between the types of biocharused, crop studied, soil type, local conditions, among others. Somestudies have observed increased crop productivity from usingbiochar alone ( Baum and Weitner, 2006 ;Chan et al., 2008 ). Otherstudies found a more positive crop response when biochar isContents lists available at ScienceDirectjournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/enpolEnergy Policy0301-4215/$ - see front matter &2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, Kishimoto and Sugiura (as cited inChan and Xu, 2009 ) reported reductions in soybean yields withhigher application rates of biochar. Collins (2008) found a declinein the root–shoot ratio of wheat in Quincy sand soil amendedwith peanut hull biochar and softwood bark biochar compared tounamended soil.1An increase in the root–shoot ratio of wheat,however, was found in Hale silt loam soil amended with softwoodbark biochar. Collins (unpublished data) also found a signiﬁcantincrease in soil water holding capacity on silt loam soils but noton sandy soil. This could potentially increase crop yields in adryland production region that is often water-limited for yield.Lehmann et al. (2006) discussed a greenhouse study in Columbiawhere biochar application led to low N availability to crops.Leguminous crops were found to compensate for this due tobiological N 2ﬁxation induced by biochar application. On the otherhand, non-legume crops were found to require additional Nfertilizers due to low N availability. The above studies arecontrolled, small-scale experiments. At this point, it is notpossible to draw conclusions on the effect of biochar that canbe broadly applied, especially in temperate regions with youngerTable 1Summary of studies on biochar used as a soil amendment.Author(s) Location Soil type Type of biochar Biochar application rate CropKishimoto andSugiura(1985)a,bJapan Volcanic ash soil,loamUnknown wood 0, 0.5, 5.0, and 15.25 t/ha SoybeanCrop response: at 0.5 t/ha, increased yield by 51%.

Furthermore, biochar itself will not contributemeaningful amounts of nutrients given its high stability. Forexample, Granatstein et al. (2009) found that biochar did notsigniﬁcantly increase the cation exchange capacity on the Quincysand in their study, the one soil where an increase would be mostlikely seen; but biochar did increase soil C. In Collins (2008) , totalnitrogen in the soil increased (although at small amounts) afteraddition of biochar. This does not, however, imply that a lesseramount of N fertilizer may be needed when biochar is added tothe soil. The study found that N in biochar is not available toplants; rather, it is fused in the C matrix. Therefore, the potentialfor biochar to reduce chemical fertilizer requirements remainsunclear. Nonetheless, the evidence from available studies doesshow that soil application of biochar often affects crop produc-tivity and can be beneﬁcial in some situations. Highly weatheredsoils, such as those found in humid tropics and the southeasternUS, may experience more soil chemical and biological beneﬁtsfrom biochar additions (e.g., improved pH, cation exchangecapacity, and overall nutrient status) than the young soils typicalof Washington State, the source of the soils for the studyreported here.One consistent effect of biochar amendment has been change insoil pH (most frequently raising it), which implies a liming value ofbiochar. Collins (2008) found nearly a unit increase in soil pH withbiochar derived from herbaceous feedstocks (switchgrass, digestedﬁber) and 0.5–1 unit increase in the soil pH with biochar derivedfrom woody sources (softwood bark, wood pellets) ( Table 2 ).Van Zwieten et al. (2007) also reported an increase in the soil pHand 30–40% increase in the height of wheat when biochar wasapplied to an acidic soil. Rondon et al. (2007) credited the improve-ment of bean productivity due to the elevation of soil pH and othersoil nutrients as a consequence of biochar use. Biochar may beconsidered a potential substitute fo r agricultural lime, especially inagricultural regions that have acidic soils. However, a unit change inthe soil pH would require 1.35 metric ton (MT) to 9.78 metric tonsper hectare (ha) of agricultural lime, depending on the soil type(CPHA, 2002 ). For example, a sand soil type requires 1.35 MT/ha ofl i m et oi n c r e a s et h es o i lp Hb yau n i ta sc o m p a r e dt oa b o u t4 2 . 5M T /ha biochar2needed to achieve the same desired change in soil pH(Collins, 2008 ). Thus, it may not be economically feasible for farmersto use biochar in crop production solely for pH adjustment since itwould entail a relatively higher cost compared to agricultural lime.On the other hand, other potential beneﬁts from adding biochar tothe soil such as avoided emissions of lime and the capacity ofbiochar to sequester carbon (to be discussed in the next section)should be considered. It is possible that the economic returns fromusing biochar may be higher than that from using lime afteraccounting for any other non-pH related plant growth beneﬁts orcarbon offset credits, were they to be available to farmers.3. Biochar carbon sequestration —related studies, policy,and programsBiochar is produced through the process of pyrolysis. The threemain products of pyrolysis: liquid (bio-oil), biochar, and gas, caninﬂuence the global carbon (C) cycle in two ways. First, all threepyrolysis products may be used as an energy source that candisplace fossil energy use. Second, if the carbon-rich and stablebiochar is produced from a biomass feedstock that removes carbondioxide (CO 2) from the air via photosynthesis, which wouldotherwise have decomposed, then char-amended land becomes acarbon sink for more intensive and long-lasting carbon storage.Lehmann et al. (2006) estimated an annual sequestration of0.2 Pg C (200 million metric tons) through slash-and-char (instead ofslash-and-burn) and biochar application to the soil. Furthermore,the study reported that low-temperature pyrolysis of biomasscombined with the capture of gas a nd liquid products for bioenergyproduction and soil application of biochar, could sequester theequivalent of about 10% of the annual US fossil-fuel emissions.Laird (2008) proposed a national system of distributed fastpyrolyzers for converting biomass into bio-oil, gas, and char.Similar to Lehmann et al. (2006) , he assumed that bio-oil andgas are used as energy sources that can displace fossil fuel use,while char was applied to agricultural soils. Assuming the UnitedStates can produce 1.1 billion metric tons of biomass per yearfrom harvestable forest and crop lands, the implementation ofLaird’s proposal could displace 25% of the nation’s fossil fuel oilconsumption per year. The study also estimated the aggregatecarbon credit for fossil fuel displacement and biochar C seques-tration to be 10% of the average annual US CO2–C emissions.The carbon content of biochar varies depending on the feed-stock. Collins (2008) showed biochar carbon content (from slowpyrolysis) ranging from 61% to 80%, the highest being from woodpellets ( Table 2 ). Woody feedstocks (bark, wood pellets) tended tohave a higher carbon content compared to herbaceous feedstocks(switchgrass, digested ﬁber). Based on these ﬁgures, approxi-mately 0.61–0.80 MT of carbon (or 2.2–2.93 MT of CO 2)3issequestered for every ton of biochar applied to the soil.Incentives for greenhouse gas mitigation such as carbonmarket offset credits may tip the scale in favor of biochar as asoil amendment rather than as a renewable energy source. At theinternational level, the Kyoto Protocol under the United NationsFramework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) only allows C seques-tration from afforestation and reforestation in the trading pro-gram established under the Clean Development Mechanism(CDM) ( UNFCCC-CDM, 2009 ). Carbon sequestration in agriculturalcrops and soils is not currently eligible under CDM ( Lehmannet al., 2006 ;FAO, 2009 ). In the United States, the Chicago ClimateExchange (CCX) has developed standardized rules for soil carbonmanagement offsets in the agricultural sector. Eligible projectsare conservation tillage and grass planting, which have to beenrolled with a CCX-registered Offset Aggregator.Table 2Selected characteristics of six biochars (slow pyrolysis at 500 1C) used in thelaboratory analyses.Source :Collins (2008) .Source of biochar Biochar characteristicsC (%) N (%) S C:N C:S pHSwitchgrass 60.5 2.06 0.20 30 350 9.4Digested ﬁber 66.7 2.23 0.30 30 228 9.3Peanut hull 70.6 1.74 0.04 41 1203 9.6Bark (UGA) 74.5 0.34 0.03 220 2833 7.6Softwood bark 77.8 0.44 0.06 176 1482 8.4Wood pellets 80.0 0.14 0.04 588 1855 7.4Activated charcoal 87.3 0.47 0.80 186 114 9.1Note : activated charcoal is included as a standard analysis and comparison tobiochar.2This refers to Quincy sand soil type. The biochar requirement to raise the pHby a unit depends on the type of char used, e.g., switchgrass, digested ﬁber, bark,etc. Assuming an average pH increase across the chars of 0.058 pH unit/ton ofbiochar, it would require about /C2417.24 tons of biochar to increase the soil pH by1 unit.3To convert from carbon to carbon dioxide, multiply by 44/12 ( /C243.67)(Blasing et al., 2004).S.P. Galinato et al. / Energy Policy 39 (2011) 6344–6350 6346In 2008, prices of traded CO 2offsets on the Chicago ClimateExchange were volatile, ranging from $1 to $7.40/MT CO 2(CCX,2008 ). During the same year, the market prices of CO 2offsets inthe European Climate Exchange varied between $17 and $31/MTCO2(ECX, 2008 ). The differences in price across markets are inpart due to the fact that participation in the CCX is currentlyoptional; no entity is legally required to participate in thisexchange. However, recent policy discussions at the national levelsuggest increased momentum toward a binding national carbonmarket. In the following section, we estimate the value of biocharas an input in crop production and as an instrument in Csequestration. We assume that a carbon market exists for avoidedemissions and C sequestration due to use of biochar as soilamendment. Also, for the value of potential CO 2offset, we use alow and high value of $1 and $31/MT CO 2.4. Estimated costs and returns for using biochar as a soilamendmentIn this section, we estimate the value of biochar as a soilamendment and the economic returns to farmers under a set ofassumed conditions. The calculation is done in two stages. First,we assess: (a) the avoided emissions from the soil application ofbiochar instead of agricultural lime, excluding the energy andemissions from transporting and spreading the material; and(b) the amount of carbon sequestered from biochar application.Combined, the emissions avoidance and sequestration effects arecounted as CO 2offsets that can be sold under an assumed set ofcarbon offset prices. Second, we calculate the proﬁt of cropproduction given two scenarios —without biochar but with limeapplication to the soil, and with biochar application as a sub-stitute for lime. We focus on dryland wheat production in thestate of Washington as a case study.4.1. Estimates of avoided emissionsGaunt and Lehmann (2008) and McCarl et al. (2009) estimatedthe avoided greenhouse gas emissions of applying biochar toagricultural land in terms of reduced agricultural input require-ments due to a crop’s improved use of nutrients. This translates toreductions in both fertilizer use and nitrous oxide emissions infertilized ﬁelds. However, the dynamics of the relationship betweenfertilizers and biochar are not included in our analysis since theeffects of biochar on the utilization intensity of fertilizers depend onvarious factors like the type of crop studied, soil type, soil quality,and biochar type. On the other hand, there is strong consensusabout biochar’s positive effects on soil pH that is similar to limingeffects, as exempliﬁed by studies discussed in Section 2 .Agricultural lime is commonly applied to soils to amelioratethe soil pH. The recommended rates of lime application inwestern Washington range from 2.28 to 11.35 MT/ha every 3–5years, roughly.4Less or no lime is needed in Washington east ofthe Cascades because the native soil pH is high.5However, somesoils in eastern Washington with a long history of urea orammonium-based nitrogen fertilizers have experienced a reduc-tion in pH to a low enough level to justify the need for lime. Whenthere is a soil acidity problem, lime applications range from 2.28to 6.8 MT/ha.6West and McBride (2005) estimated the net CO 2emission fromapplication of agricultural lime at about 0.059 MT C (or 0.22 MTCO2) per ton of limestone, based on the chemical reaction of limein the soil and transportation of lime-derived bicarbonates to theocean (via leaching and precipitation). This is the amount ofemissions that can potentially be avoided by replacing lime withbiochar. Using the CO 2offset price range of $1 to $31/MT CO 2, thevalue of avoided emissions amounts to $0.22–$6.82/MT lime.4.2. Estimates of biochar carbon sequestrationBiochar from herbaceous and woody feedstock sources arefound to have a carbon content of 60.5–66.7% and 74.5–80%,respectively. We can assume from these ﬁgures that for every tonof biochar applied to the soil, 0.61–0.80 ton of carbon (equivalentto 2.2–2.93 ton of CO 2) can be sequestered ( Collins, 2008 ). Usingthe highest carbon content of the wood-based biochar (i.e., 80%)and the CO 2offset price range, the approximate value of biochar Csequestration is $2.93–$90.83/MT biochar.4.3. Costs and returns of crop productionWe examine the potential economic returns to farmers if theyutilize biochar as a substitute for agricultural lime under threeprice scenarios: (a) $114.05/MT based on the energy content of awood-based biochar; (b) $87/MT; and (c) $350.74/MT. The ﬁrstvalue represents the opportunity cost of the foregone use ofbiochar as energy source. A wood-based biochar has an averageenergy content of 12,500–12,500 BTU/lb ( Dynamotive EnergySystems, 2007 ). The energy content of Central Appalachiancoal is 12,500 BTU/lb and its price is $116.38/MT as of 2008(EIA, 2009 ). Using the energy content as basis, the combustionvalue of biochar is 98% that of Central Appalachian coal, or$114.05/MT. The latter two prices are adopted from the estimatedbreak-even prices of biochar in Granatstein et al. (2009) .Wheat, a key economic crop in Washington that covers about930,000 hectares of land ( NASS, 2010 ), belongs to a group ofcrops that can tolerate slightly acidic (i.e., 6.0–6.5) soil pH ( CPHA,2002 ). In general, wheat tends to favor soil pH between 6 and 7(Beegle and Lingenfelter, 2005 ). Eastern Washington has experi-enced a decline in soil pH due to the use of ammonium-basedfertilizers. We focus on changes in winter wheat yield in easternWashington given changes in the soil pH as a case study,hypothesizing that if biochar could be used to address the pHproblem and to sequester carbon, these combined values mightjustify its use on a large agricultural area. The crop yieldis estimated through the following equation adopted fromMahler (1986) :Winter Wheat Yield ¼/C02960 :56þ1530 SOILPH ð1Þwhere winter wheat yield is in kg/ha, and SOILPH refers to thevalue of the soil pH of Palouse silt loam. Assuming the base soilpH of 4.5 for this soil type from Collins (2008) , increasing the soilpH to 6 would require 6.48 MT of limestone per hectare ( CPHA,2002 ) or 76.53 MT of biochar per hectare (Collins, unpublisheddata).7Using Eq. (1) with soil pH of 4.5, wheat yield is estimated atabout 3924.44 kg/ha. On the other hand, with a soil pH of 6, theestimated wheat yield is about 6219.44 kg/ha. Proﬁts from winter4Data from personal communication with Craig Cogger, Washington StateUniversity, 2009.5Data from personal communications with Richard Koenig, Craig Cogger andJoan Davenport, Washington State University, 2009.6Data from personal communication with Joan Davenport, Washington StateUniversity, 2009.7Note that the impact of char on soil pH depends on the soil type and the typeof char. For the Palouse silt loam soil type, an average pH increase across the charsis/C240.0196 pH unit/ton of biochar per hectare. Based on this, it would requireabout 76.53 tons/ha to increase the soil pH from 4.5 to 6 (i.e., increase by1.5 units).S.P.

Total Cost denotesthe sum of ﬁxed cost and variable cost of winter wheat cropproduction based on the Eastern Whitman County 2008 Enter-prise Budget ( Painter et al., unpublished ), exclusive of lime orbiochar cost.Table 3 shows the estimated proﬁts given the addition ofagricultural lime or biochar to the soil and different pricescenarios. As discussed above, the yield of wheat is higher whenthe soil pH improves; hence, the revenue is higher with theapplication of lime or biochar than without.A farmer will gain a proﬁt even when there is an additionalcost of agricultural lime. When biochar replaces agricultural lime,on the other hand, getting a proﬁt or a loss will depend on theprice of biochar and value of sequestered carbon. Without acarbon offset market (COFFSET is zero in Eq. (4)), the price ofbiochar has to be about $9.19/MT in order for a farmer to breakeven (proﬁt ¼0)10and about $4.82/MT for proﬁt to be equal tothat of agricultural lime scenario, excluding the transportationand application costs of biochar.Suppose now that a carbon offset market exists. At $1/MT CO 2,the farmer loses income given any of the biochar price scenarios;and at $31/MT CO 2, losses are also incurred if the price of biocharis high, i.e., at $351 or $114/MT. This means that the income fromoffsets is not enough to support the adoption of biochar inagricultural production. If, however, the price of biochar goesdown to $87/MT and the carbon offset is priced at $31/MT CO2,a proﬁt is gained and it is higher than the case where agriculturallime is used instead. This implies that when the price of biochar islow enough, the income derived from carbon offsets can outweighthe cost of biochar. It should be noted that the production costdoes not include the cost of transporting and applying lime orbiochar to agricultural land (machinery and labor cost). Includingthese would likely further drive up the estimated losses ordecrease any proﬁt earned.The differences in potential proﬁt given varying prices ofbiochar and carbon offset are further illustrated in Fig. 1 . Proﬁtdeclines as the price of biochar increases, holding other thingsconstant. When the carbon offset price is $31/MT CO 2,t h ef a r m e rwill break even if the price of biochar is approximately $100.73/MT.The farmer’s estimated proﬁt with biochar application will beequal to the proﬁt with agricultural lime application ($369/ha) ifthe price of biochar is about $95.91/MT. On the other hand, at acarbon offset price of $1/MT CO 2, a proﬁt of about $163.70/hais gained when the price of biochar is $10/MT. At this loweroffset price, the farmer will break even if the price of biochar isapproximately $12.14/MT.Another issue to consider is that the carbon price ( Pcarbon )based on a cap and trade system may be correlated in varyingways to different energy sources, depending on the carboncontent of the energy source ( Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007 ;Koenig, 2011 ). Given this potential relationship between the twoprices, it is worthwhile considering a breakeven relationshipbetween them. We rely on coal and coal price ( Pcoal) as the basisTable 3Comparison of proﬁts from winter wheat productiona(US$ per hectare), with and without biochar application.Scenario Revenue CO 2offset valuebTotal costcCost of ag limedCost of biochardProﬁteWithout biochar or agricultural lime application $1099 – $1038 – – $61With ag lime application $1741 – $1038 $334 – $369With biochar application, when offset price is $1 /MT CO 2and the price of biochar (PB)isPB1¼$350.74/MTf$1741 $226 $1038 – $26,842 /C0$25,913PB2¼$114.05/MTg$1741 $226 $1038 – $8728 /C0$7799PB3¼$87/MTf$1741 $226 $1038 – $6658 /C0$5729With biochar application, when offset price is $31 /MT CO 2and the price of biochar (P B)i sPB1¼$350.74/MTf$1741 $6995 $1038 – $26,842 /C0$19,144PB2¼$114.05/MTg$1741 $6995 $1038 – $8728 /C0$1030PB3¼$87/MTf$1741 $6995 $1038 – $6658 $1040Figures for the revenue, CO 2offset value, cost and proﬁt are rounded to the nearest whole number.aThe assumed base soil pH is 4.5.

To illustrate the estimation of a farmer’s proﬁts withand without ag lime or biochar application, we chose Eastern Whitman County as example based on Mahler et al. (1985) . The study found that the pH of soils in easternWashington had signiﬁcantly declined. By 1980, more than 65% in Whitman County had a soil pH less than 6.dExcludes the cost of applying lime or biochar to agricultural land (machinery and labor cost).eProﬁt ¼Revenue þCO2offset value /C0Total Cost /C0Ag Lime Cost /C0Biochar Cost.

Galinato et al. / Energy Policy 39 (2011) 6344–6350 6348for our biochar energy value calculations. Based on Eq.

If these two prices arepositively correlated, then the price of carbon would have toincrease (or decrease) $0.33 per dollar increase (or decrease) inthe coal price in order to ensure positive proﬁts. If proﬁts arenegative (as in Table 3 with biochar price based on energy content),then co-movement in the two prices may mean that biocharapplication may be unproﬁtable for large ranges of these prices.Perhaps surprisingly, Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) ﬁnd nostatistical relationship between the rate of change in coal andcarbon prices, which suggests that our ceteris paribus comparisonsare not unreasonable to pursue. However, if a positive relation-ship between these two prices were to exist, then a positive proﬁtmay be received even if energy prices increase.5. ConclusionsOur quantitative analyses focus on using biochar as a soiladditive and its potential carbon sequestration beneﬁts foragricultural uses. We ﬁnd that biochar soil application can beeconomically feasible given the following scenarios:/C15If there exists a carbon market that recognizes the avoidedemissions and carbon sequestration due to the application ofbiochar to agricultural soils. This is a necessary condition if biocharwill be promoted as a technology for carbon sequestration; and/C15If the market price of biochar is low enough so that a farmerwill earn a proﬁt after applying biochar to the crop ﬁeld (i.e., inour case study, lower than $12.14 and $100.73/MT when theprice of carbon offset is $1 and $31/MT CO 2, respectively).It is clear that biochar has potential as a soil amendment andits value as such would likely increase as social and regulatoryinterest in carbon sequestration increases because of the long-evity of carbon in the soil. However, more substantial increases incrop production need to be documented across a range of cropsand soils that can add value to the farm at a level beyond theestimated value of biochar for carbon sequestration. Under thecurrent economic situation, growers are unlikely to adopt biocharuse without greater payback. Also at this time, even if growersfound biochar beneﬁcial, they could face difﬁculty in sourcingquantities large enough for farm application.Many niche opportunities for biochar use are also possible,including soil amendment and compost use outside of agriculturesuch as urban gardens, lawns, parks, and ball ﬁelds. Biochar canbe suitable as a precursor to activated carbon commonly utilizedin industrial ﬁltration process ( Azargohar and Dalai, 2006 )like municipal wastewater treatment (e.g. Bansode et al., 2003 ;Ng et al., 2003 ) and other water and air ﬁltering systems ( Kearns,2008 ;Lima et al., 2008 ). Biochar can also be used as an energysource; as combustion fuel to power the pyrolysis process; as agasiﬁer feedstock ( Boateng, 2007 ;Polagye et al., 2007 ); or forwater heating and cooking ( IBI, 2009 ;Johannes, 2008 ). The extentof developing these markets, of course, depends on many factorsassociated with the cost of biochar production relative to existingalternatives, as well as the relative effectiveness of biochar frompyrolysis for intended uses. The question is whether or not itwould be more economically valuable to use biochar as a soilamendment rather than for energy production or other alterna-tive uses. For instance, it may be more economically attractive toburn it to generate energy (i.e., as a substitute for coal) if theenergy content of biochar is high. However, the process loses theadded beneﬁts of applying biochar to soils, such as gains inagricultural productivity due to soil quality improvement andpayments for carbon sequestration.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Washington State Department of EcologyBeyond Organic Waste to Resources Project for funding the study,‘‘Use of Biochar from the Pyrolysis of Waste Organic Material as aSoil Amendment’’ (Interagency Agreement C0800248).
