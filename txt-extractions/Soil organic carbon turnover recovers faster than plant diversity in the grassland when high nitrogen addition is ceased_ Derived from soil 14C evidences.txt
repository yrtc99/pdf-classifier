Soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover is an important parameter inthe terrestrial ecosystem model and ecosystem management. However, how SOC turnoverresponds to decreased N deposition has not yet been evaluated. Here we addressed thisissue by the comparison of the SOC turnover in the treatment that receiving high Naddition for 4 years and then none for 6 years (48 g N $m/C02$yr/C01, N48-cessation) with thatderived from the control treatment (0 g N $m/C02$yr/C01, N0) in Inner Mongolia grassland,China. In this study,14C isotope technology was used to directly reveal SOC turnover time.Our results showed that SOC turnover time in the N48-cessation treatment had no sta-tistical difference compared with that in the N0 treatment after 6 years of N cessation,indicating that its SOC turnover had recovered from high N enrichment. The reduction ofSOC storage (274 g/m2) in N48-cessation treatment from 2010 to 2014 also proved thisrecovery. Moreover, we also found that the species richness and Shannon diversity index inthe N48-cessation treatment were signi ﬁcantly lower than those in the N0 treatment. Itindicated that the recovery of SOC turnover was faster than plant diversity in the grasslandwhen high N addition was ceased. This study suggested that the grasslands experiencedhigh N deposition should reduce grazing and mowing in order to increase soil carbon inputand offset the negative effect of the rapid recovery of SOC turnover on soil C storage whenN deposition was decreased.©2020 The Authors.

IntroductionNitrogen (N) deposition has brought profound effects on terrestrial ecosystems ( Galloway et al., 2008 ). However, due tothe enforcement of environmental policy and the transformation of economic structure, the increasing trend of N depositionhas been slowed down ( Yu et al., 2019 ). And even in some regions, such as Europe and North America, scientists haveobserved a decrease in N deposition ( Gilliam et al., 2019 ;Schmitz et al., 2019 ). Thus, the potential changes of ecosystemprocesses with reduced N deposition have received considerable attention ( Clark and Tilman, 2008 ;Gilliam et al., 2019 ;Schmitz et al., 2019 ). Soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover is a key parameter in the terrestrial ecosystem model and ecosystemmanagement ( Tan et al., 2020 ), and SOC pool is the largest terrestrial C reservoir ( Amundson, 2001 ). Thus, the changes in SOCturnover caused by decreased N deposition might signi ﬁcantly affect global C cycle and further exerted an impact on climatechange. However, how SOC turnover will respond when N input declines, to our knowledge, has not yet been evaluated,although some scholars mentioned this issue in their articles ( Stevens et al., 2012 ;Gilliam et al., 2019 ).Previous studies mainly used the manipulative experiment with N cessation to explore the responses of ecosystemprocesses to decreased N deposition, and their results showed that plant diversity and species composition would takedecades or more to recover from N enrichment ( Isbell et al., 2013 ;Stevens, 2016 ). Since SOC turnover has been found to beinhibited by high N addition ( Tan et al., 2017 ;Zak et al., 2017 ), thus, we are eager to know whether the recovery of SOCturnover from high N enrichment would also take decades or more. To address this question, we conducted a N manipulativeexperiment that receiving high N addition for 4 years and then none for 6 years in Inner Mongolia Grassland, China.Many previous ﬁeld and lab experiments evaluated SOC turnover by measuring CO 2efﬂux, however, this could only re ﬂectthe turnover of labile C pools in soil, which is just a small part of SOC stock ( Luo et al., 2001 ). In the present study, we used14Cisotope technology to directly reveal the turnover rate of SOC.14C isotope technology was thought to be a perfect tool toresearch SOC turnover on yearly to millennial timescales, because soil14C content, when combined with mathematic model,can be well used to calculate the turnover time of bulk SOC including all soil C pools ( Trumbore, 2009 ).2. Materials and methodsThisﬁeld experiment was carried out in a semiarid temperate steppe (42/C14020N, 116/C14170E), which was fenced off since2001. Prior to this, it was grazed, and after that no grazing was allowed. Mean annual temperature and mean annual pre-cipitation are 2.1/C14C and 386 mm. Dominant species are Agropyron cristatum, Leymus chinensis and Stipa krylovii (Fig.S1 ). Thesoil is classi ﬁed as a Calcic Luvisol.The N addition experiment was started since 2005. Urea was added in 2005, and then NH 4NO3was added after 2005. Thisexperiment consisted of two treatments with ﬁve replicates: 0 g N $m/C02$yr/C01(N0) and 48 g N $m/C02$yr/C01(N48-cessation). Eachplot is 5 /C25 m. N48-cessation treatment received N input from 2005 to 2008, and then ended since 2009 to observe thepossible restoration of grassland ecosystem ( Hao et al., 2018 ). To reduce the cost of soil14C measurements, sampling wasconducted in only three of the ﬁve (randomly selected) replicates in the N0 and N48-cessation treatments.Soil and plant sampling were ﬁnished in late August of 2014. A quadrat of 1 m2(1/C21 m) was randomly set in each plot. Theplants at ground level were clipped and mixed as the aboveground plant samples. The roots (i.e. belowground plant samples)were collected to depth 50 cm using a 5-cm diameter core. We collected soil samples using soil auger (3.5 cm diameter,0e5 cm depth). Soil14C content, soil pH, SOC content, soil microbial composition and the lignin content and C and N con-centrations in plants were analyzed in this study. Details on analytical methods of soil and plant samples could refer to Tanet al. (2018) . The calculation of SOC turnover time (TT) followed Cherkinsky and Brovkin (1993) andHerold et al. (2014) . Dataon species richness and Shannon diversity index were obtained from our previous study ( Hao et al., 2018 ). One-way ANOVAs(p<0.05) were conducted to compare the differences in soil and plant properties between N0 and N48-cessation treatments.And the effect size (ES) of these comparisons were also recorded. To further examine the SOC dynamics when high N additionwas ceased, we calculated the SOC storage of the N48-cessation treatment in the years of 2010 and 2014 according to themethod reported in Tan et al. (2020) . Then we conducted Paired-Samples T Test to compare the difference in SOC storage ofthe N48-cessation treatment between 2010 and 2014. All statistical analyses were conducted using software SPSS 20.0.3. Results and discussionThe difference in SOC TT between N0 and N48-cessation treatments was statistically insigni ﬁcant (ES ¼0.083 and p>0.05)(Fig. 1 a and Table S1 ). The species richness and Shannon diversity index in the N48-cessation treatment were signi ﬁcantlylower than that in the N0 treatment (ES ¼0.910 and p<0.05 for species richness and ES ¼0.188 and p<0.05 for Shannondiversity index) ( Fig. 1 b and c and Table S1 ). The SOC storage of the N48-cessation treatment in 2014 was basically lower thanthat in 2010 ( p¼0.06) ( Fig. 2 ). Soil pH and the abundances of total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and bacteria PLFAs in theN48-cessation treatment were signi ﬁcantly lower than that in the N0 treatment (ES ¼0.967 and p<0.05 for soil pH,ES¼0.749 and p<0.05 for total PLFAs and ES ¼0.861 and p<0.05 for bacteria PLFAs) ( Table 1 andTable S1 ), whereas SOCcontent and the abundance of fungi PLFAs showed no statistical difference between them (ES ¼0.266 and p>0.05 for SOCcontent and ES ¼0.150 and p>0.05 for fungi PLFAs) ( Table 1 andTable S1 ). The lignin content and C/N ratio in abovegroundand belowground parts had no statistically signi ﬁcant differences between N0 and N48-cessation treatments (ES ¼0.045 andp>0.05 for the lignin content of aboveground part, ES ¼0.379 and p>0.05 for the C/N ratio of aboveground part, ES ¼0.094Q. Tan et al. / Global Ecology and Conservation 24 (2020) e01229 2and p>0.05 for the lignin content of belowground part and ES ¼0.013 and p>0.05 for the C/N ratio of belowground part)(Table 2 andTable S1 ).Previous studies had found that SOC turnover was suppressed by high N addition ( Tan et al., 2017 ;Zak et al., 2017 ).However, this study showed that the difference in SOC TT between N0 and N48-cessation treatments was statisticallyinsigni ﬁcant ( Fig. 1 a), indicating that after six years of stopping fertilization, the SOC turnover rate could return to the levelFig. 1.

The comparison of the SOC storage of the N48-cessation treatment between 2010 and 2014also provided an indirect support for this possibility, because the SOC storage of the N48-cessation treatment in 2014 waslower than that in 2010 ( Fig. 2 ). The decrease in SOC storage between these two years was 274 g/m2. The change in SOCstorage should be controlled by two processes: the plant litter input and the SOC decomposition. Given that the time thataboveground biomass in grassland changes from live plant to soil organic matter is usually one year, we compared the dif-ference in aboveground biomass of the N48-cessation treatment between 2009 and 2013. The aboveground biomass in 2013was 53 g/m2less than that in 2009 ( Hao et al., 2018 ). Thus, the decrease in SOC storage between 2010 and 2014 was 5 times ofthe decrease in aboveground biomass between 2009 and 2013. Hence, the decrease in SOC storage should be largely due tothe accelerated SOC turnover after high N cessation. Furthermore, our previous work had reported that the plant diversity (i.e.species richness and Shannon diversity index) in the N48-cessation treatment was signi ﬁcantly lower than that in the N0treatment ( Fig. 1 b and c) ( Hao et al., 2018 ). This meant that the recovery in plant diversity showed limited response to thecessation of high N addition. Therefore, our results suggested that SOC turnover recovered faster than plant diversity in thegrassland when high N addition was ceased.Microbial composition and plant litter quality have been suggested to be the main factors regulating SOC turnover ( Tanet al., 2018 ). Thus, the rapid recovery of SOC turnover observed in this study could also be associated with these two fac-tors. Lignin content and C/N ratio are two key indicators of plant litter quality. The lignin content and C/N ratio in bothaboveground and belowground parts in the N48-cessation treatment showed no statistical difference from those in the N0treatment ( Table 2 ). Thus, the observed quick recovery in SOC turnover after stopping high N addition could be partiallyexplained by plant litter quality. Although the total PLFAs and the bacteria PLFAs in the N48-cessation treatment were foundto be signi ﬁcantly lower than that in the N0 treatment, the fungi PLFAs did not showed statistical difference between the twotreatments after six years of the cessation of N fertilization ( Table 1 ). Fungi is mainly responsible for the decomposition of thelignin in SOC ( De Boer et al., 2005 ), and lignin is passive in the dynamic of SOC ( Melillo et al.,1982 ). Hence, the recovery of SOCturnover could also be associated with the undifferentiated fungi PLFAs between the two treatments after stopping high Naddition.Recovery of SOC turnover after the decrease of N deposition will weaken the function of C sink of soil. Thus, based on ourresults, it should be considered in the climate prediction model that the relatively rapid recovery of SOC turnover as high Ndeposition lowered would exert a negative effect on soil C storage, which might affect global C cycle and climate change. Inaddition, Storkey et al. (2015) suggested that grassland ecosystem needed some good management to maintain their benignturnover. Hence, for those grasslands experienced high N deposition, we recommend reducing grazing and mowing in orderto increase soil carbon input and offset the negative effect of the rapid recovery of SOC turnover on soil C storage when high Ndeposition was decreased.4. ConclusionThis study found that SOC turnover recovered faster than plant diversity in the grassland when high N addition wasceased. Fungal activity and plant litter quality mainly regulated the recovery of SOC turnover. Our results indicated thatdecreased high N inputs might have a negative effect on soil C storage, which should attract the attention of scientists workingon climate prediction models. Furthermore, future N cessation experiments should explore the effects of N addition rates andecosystem types on the recovery of SOC turnover when N addition was ceased.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could haveappeared to in ﬂuence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41772171) and the In-ternational Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program 2019 (No. 20190044).Appendix A.
