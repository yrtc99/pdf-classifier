Such mechanisms havebeen well studied in Cyanobacteria , but much remains to be learned about their activityin other phyla. Novel multisubunit membrane-spanning complexes capable of elevatingintracellular DIC were recently described in three species of bacteria. Homologs of thesecomplexes are distributed among 17 phyla in Bacteria and Archaea and are predictedto consist of one, two, or three subunits. To determine whether DIC accumulation is ashared feature of these diverse complexes, seven of them, representative of organismsfrom four phyla, from a variety of habitats, and with three different subunit con ﬁgura-tions, were chosen for study.

In addition, the presence of an ionophore preventedthe accumulation of intracellular DIC, suggesting that these complexes may couple pro-ton potential to DIC accumulation.IMPORTANCE To facilitate the synthesis of biomass from CO2, autotrophic organisms usea variety of mechanisms to increase intracellular DIC concentrations. A novel type ofmultisubunit complex has recently been described, which has been shown to generatemeasurably elevated intracellular DIC concentrations in three species of bacteria, raisingthe question of whether these complexes share this capability across the 17 phyla ofBacteria and Archaea where they are found. This study shows that DIC accumulation isa trait shared by complexes with various subunit structures, from organisms with diversephysiologies and taxonomies, suggesting that this trait is universal among them.Successful expression in E. coli suggests the possibility of their expression in engineeredorganisms synthesizing compounds of industrial importance from CO2.KEYWORDS autotroph, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide-concentrating mechanism,carbon ﬁxation, dissolved inorganic carbonChemolithoautotrophs link redox and carbon cycles by ﬁxing dissolved inorganiccarbon (DIC; CO21HCO321CO322) while using reduced inorganic compounds aselectron donors.

In these habitats, re-dox substrate and DIC availability may vary spatially and temporally, as it does athydrothermal vents (5, 6).Many autotrophic microorganisms adapt to low availability of DIC in their environ-ment with a variety of mechanisms to elevate intracellular DIC concentrations, in orderto facilitate CO2ﬁxation (7 –9). To date, there are ﬁve known mechanisms for elevatingintracellular DIC concentrations. These include three evolutionarily independent typesof HCO32transporters: ATP-hydrolyzing ABC transporter BCT1 (10), and sodium-bicar-bonate symporters BicA (11) and SbtA (12). Some Cyanobacteria also use modi ﬁedNADH dehydrogenase complexes to convert intracellular CO2into HCO32to preventdiffusion of DIC out of the cell (13).The most recently described means of elevating intracellular DIC concentrations isby a family of multisubunit complexes, whose mechanism of action has yet to bedetermined. These DIC-accumulating complexes (DACs) were ﬁrst described in hydro-thermal vent chemolithoautotroph Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus (8, 14), Staphylococcusaureus (15), and Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (16). In these organisms, DACs consist oftwo subunits; one subunit is a membrane-spanning protein (M subunit; Pfam00361),another is a cytoplasmic protein belonging to a family of unknown function (C subunit;Pfam10070), and both subunits are required for DACs to function (8, 16). Disruptingthe genes encoding these complexes impairs growth under low-DIC conditions, andintracellular DIC concentrations are measurably elevated when DACs are expressedeither in their native hosts or in Escherichia coli (8, 14 –16). Heterologous expression ofDACs from Vibrio cholerae and Bacillus anthracis in a high-CO2-requiring strain of E. colirestores its ability to grow under low-DIC conditions, suggesting that these two DACsalso elevate intracellular DIC concentrations (16). The protonophore carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) inhibits DIC accumulation by DACs from H. crunoge-nus,S. aureus , and H. neapolitanus (8, 14, 16), indicating that activity may be coupled toproton motive force. These studies suggest that DACs may all function similarly to ele-vate intracellular DIC concentrations.However, the evidence for shared function is compromised by the limited diversity ofDACs that have been studied, which include ﬁve DACs representing mesophiles andneutrophiles from two phyla, all with two-subunit structure. This sample does not repre-sent DACs adequately; genes encoding DACs are present in organisms from 16 phyla ofBacteria (Acidobacteria ,Actinobacteria ,Aquiﬁcae,Bacteroidetes ,Chlamydiae ,Chloro ﬂexi,Deinococcus ,Firmicutes ,Gemmatimonadetes ,Nitrospinae ,Nitrospirae ,Planctomycetes ,Proteobacteria ,Rhodothermaeota ,Spirochaetes ,Verrucomicrobia ) and one phylum ofArchaea (Euryarchaeota ) (Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database[https://img.jgi.doe.gov], accessed 15 June 2021), which thrive at a broad range of tem-peratures, osmolarities, and pH values. DACs also are predicted to have a diversity ofsubunit structures beyond the two-subunit DACs that have already been studied. Insome organisms, e.g., Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans ,Ca n dMp r o t e i n sa r ef u s e di n t oas i n -gle protein with domains belonging to Pfam10070 and Pfam00361. In other organisms,a third tiny subunit (T subunit) is encoded by a small gene that is found between thoseencoding the M and C subunits (Fig. 1 ). Some organisms carry genes for more thanone DAC (9); for example, H. neapolitanus has a two-subunit DAC (characterized in refer-ence 16), and a three-subunit DAC whose activity has not been characterized. Given thisbreadth in taxonomy and structure, assuming shared function seems unwise.The substrate for DACs (CO2or HCO32) is also unclear. In S. aureus , this complexwas predicted to be a Na1:HCO32cotransporter (15), while in H. neapolitanus , theresponse of DIC accumulation to pH provided evidence that this complex uses CO2asa substrate (16).Clarifying the function and substrate of DACs is relevant to understanding theirubiquity in 17 phyla of microorganisms with every imaginable lifestyle, from autotro-phic extremophile to deadly pathogen. DACs have been suggested to facilitate CO2Schmid et al. Journal of BacteriologyDecember 2021 Volume 203 Issue 23 e00377-21 jb.asm.org 2ﬁxation by autotrophic bacteria in the many, sometimes extreme, habitats where theyform the base of the food web (8, 9, 14). They have also been suggested to facilitatepathogenesis under conditions where boosting anapleurotic CO2ﬁxation could pro-vide an advantage (15, 16).The objectives of this study were to con ﬁrm whether (i) DACs from a variety of organ-isms can indeed raise concentrations of intracellular DIC, (ii) all subunits (including T,when present) are necessary for activity, and (iii) DACs use the same substrate (CO2orHCO32) and are similarly sensitive to disruption of proton motive force. Seven complexeswere selected, with amino acid sequence identities ranging from 31 to 73%, to spanDAC diversity (Table 1): four phyla are represented, as is a full range of pH preferencesfor growth (acidophilic to alkaliphilic) and subunit compositions predicted from genomedata (1 subunit, 2 subunit, and 3 subunit).RESULTSConstruction of plasmids and an E. coli host strain for expressing DACs. Genesencoding DACs from seven species of bacteria (Table 1) were synthesized and clonedinto plasmids with weak (pENTR; native), moderate (pBAD202; araBp), and strong(pET28; T7) promoters. A strain of E. coli was constructed for expressing DACs, in whichgenes encoding carbonic anhydrase ( yadF and cynT ) were knocked out [ E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT ]. This strain requires a headspace enriched in CO2for growth (seeFig. S1 in the supplemental material). Its ability to grow under ambient air was restoredvia heterologous expression of genes encoding DACs (see below).LC-MS/MS con ﬁrmation of expression of DACs. Liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of cell proteins con ﬁrmed the expression of genesencoding C subunits from DACs (Table 2). Peptides derived from C subunits were moreabundant when cells were cultivated in the presence of inducer than when cells werecultivated in the presence of repressor, except for Thermocrinis ruber , where the numberof peptides increased in the presence of repressor, as did the intensity of the signal. Itshould be noted that the intensity of signal from C subunits overall was low for this par-ticular construct. M-subunit peptide abundance and signal intensities followed the samegeneral pattern, though peptides derived from M subunits were less abundant and theirFIG 1 Models for structure and function of DACs. Possible con ﬁgurations of 1-, 2-, and 3-subunitforms of DACs are depicted on the left. Both T and M subunits are predicted by TMHMM (32) to havemultiple membrane-spanning alpha helices and are accordingly shown spanning the membrane. Onthe right, two possible models for DAC function are shown, one in which DACs couple protontranslocation to the conversion of intracellular CO2to HCO32and one in which DACs carry outsymport of CO2and protons and this CO2is converted to HCO32during or upon translocation to thecytoplasm. In autotrophic cells, this HCO32is consumed by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB)via carboxysomes (c ’some) or the reductive citric acid cycle (rCAC).

This may be due to the dif ﬁculty of solubi-lizing and digesting membrane proteins, and it was observed previously for the DACfrom H. crunogenus (14).Growth of E. coli constructs expressing DACs. E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynTcarrying plasmids encoding complete DACs were able to grow under low-CO2condi-tions. When driven by native promoters, expression of DACs facilitated growth on solidmedia under low-CO2conditions, despite likely weak expression in E. coli from pro-moters originating from organisms from different phyla (Fig. S1). When E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT with DAC gene expression controlled by either the T7 promoter oraraBpwere cultivated in liquid media, response to repressors and inducers variedamong the DACs, potentially due to toxic effects of the higher levels of expression.Four of the DACs were expressed successfully from pBAD202 vectors; the presence ofarabinose (inducer) stimulated growth (e.g., shorter lag times, more high growth rates,or higher yield) (Fig. 2), while glucose (repressor) inhibited it. For the remaining threeDACs, expression in pET vectors was successful: growth was stimulated by the pres-ence of IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside; inducer) and inhibited by rham-nose (repressor, via induction of T7 lysozyme [17]). Constructs without the gene encod-ing either the C or T subunit were unable to grow under low-CO2conditions,regardless of the inclusion of an inducer (Fig. 3). These constructs were able to growonly when provided with a high-CO2environment.Intracellular DIC concentrations in E. coli expressing DACs. To prepare for meas-uring intracellular DIC concentrations, E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT carrying plas-mids encoding complete or incomplete DACs was cultivated under a 5% CO2head-space before harvesting. The concentration of intracellular DIC in E. coli Lemo21(DE3)DyadF DcynT expressing DACs was measured via silicone oil centrifugation, whichassayed [14C]DIC accumulation in the cells (8). Six of the seven DACs were able to gen-erate measurably elevated intracellular DIC concentrations when cells were cultivatedin the presence of inducer to stimulate expression of DAC genes (Fig. 4).

For eachDAC, intracellular DIC concentrations measured for each of the following four sampleswere compared: complete DAC with inducer, complete DAC with repressor, incom-plete DAC with inducer, and incomplete DAC with repressor. Only two samples (com-plete DAC with inducer and complete DAC with repressor) were compared for con-structs from Am. ferrooxidans because this DAC consists of a single subunit (Table 3).Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to determine which factors resulted in statisticallydistinguishable differences in intracellular DIC concentrations. When constructs withthe complete DACs were grown with inducer, intracellular DIC was higher than that ofall constructs grown with repressor except the T. ruber construct ( P=1.0). Constructsthat contained only the M subunit or were missing the T subunit did not have appreci-ably elevated intracellular DIC concentrations.DAC substrate: HCO32or CO2.Three DACs, representing one-subunit ( Am. ferrooxi-dans ), two-subunit ( H. crunogenus ), and three-subunit forms ( Sulfurovum sp. strain AR),were chosen to clarify the form of DIC used as a substrate, by providing CO2or HCO32out of chemical equilibrium. When E. coli expressing these DACs was provided withCO2, intracellular DIC concentrations were higher than when it was provided withHCO32(Fig. 5). A two-way ANOVA was used to compare DIC species (CO2and HCO32)and media (with inducer or with repressor). As described above, Bonferroni post hoctests were used to determine which variables resulted in statistically distinguishableFIG 2 Growth curves of E. coli expressing complete DACs under low-CO2conditions.

For all three DACs, intracellular DIC con-centrations were signi ﬁcantly higher when their expression was induced and the cellswere provided with CO2instead of HCO32(Table 4). E. coli carrying genes encodingDACs from H. crunogenus and Sulfurovum sp. strain AR did not have a signi ﬁcant differ-ence in intracellular DIC concentration when provided with HCO32in the presence ofinducer or repressor. When grown in the presence of inducer, they did have measura-ble accumulation of DIC when HCO32was provided, though this amount was farsmaller than when CO2was provided (Fig. 5). This may be due to small amounts of CO2present in incubations in which HCO32was provided as the dominant form of DIC.Use of proton potential for DIC accumulation. ForE. coli expressing the threeDACs selected for further study, the addition of protonophore CCCP diminished intra-cellular DIC concentrations (Fig. 6). The difference between intracellular DIC concentra-tions in E. coli provided with CCCP (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) and thosesupplied with DMSO only (solvent control) was signi ﬁcant ( ttesta= 0.05) when DACsfrom Am. ferrooxidans (P,0.001) and H. crunogenus (P,0.001) were expressed butnot for the DAC from Sulfurovum sp. strain AR ( P=0.07).The effect of CCCP on the intracellular DIC concentration was likely due to its effect onthe proton motive force. Cells incubated with CCCP had lower intracellular pH values(Table 5). Furthermore, cells treated with CCCP also had lower intracellular ATP concentra-tions than those in the control medium (Table 5), as expected if ATP synthase was inhib-ited by a diminishment in proton motive force. Interestingly, DMSO itself also affectedFIG 3 Growth curves of E. coli expressing DACs with missing subunits under high-CO2(red) and low-CO2(blue)conditions.

This may explain why intracellular DIC concentrationsare lower for solvent control experiments (Fig. 6) than when DMSO was absent (Fig. 6).Relative abundance of genes encoding DACs and Sbt transporters in metagenomesfrom alkaline and acidic environments. The presence of DAC genes compared to thoseencoding Sbt-type HCO32transporters appears to be dependent on the pH of the envi-ronment from which the samples were collected. The abundance of DAC relative tothat of Sbt increases as pH decreases from very alkaline to acidic (Table 6). The analysisof both clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) and Pfams showed the same trend.FIG 4 Intracellular DIC concentrations measured in E. coli expressing DACs from seven species (Am. fer.,Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans ; At. fer., Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ; At. thio., Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans ;H. cru., Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus ;H .n e a . , Halothiobacillus neapolitanus ;S .A R , Sulfurovum sp.

Journal of BacteriologyDecember 2021 Volume 203 Issue 23 e00377-21 jb.asm.org 8DISCUSSIONDACs have been identi ﬁed in 17 phyla to date, and the results here suggest thatthey can all facilitate intracellular DIC accumulation from the environment. DACs withall three subunit con ﬁgurations, gathered from members of the phyla Actinobacteria ,Proteobacteria ,Campylobacterota , and Aquiﬁcaeinhabiting diverse habitats (e.g., hotsprings, acid mine drainage, and marine sediments) with a broad range of pH values(acidic to basic), all share this capability. The juxtaposition of the genes encoding theseseven complexes to genes encoding enzymes necessary for autotrophic CO2ﬁxation(Fig. 7) suggests that DIC is their substrate when they are expressed in their nativeorganisms. These seven organisms grow autotrophically via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle or reductive citric acid cycle (rCAC), indicating that DACs arecompatible with a variety of autotrophic metabolisms. Furthermore, DACs are found inheterotrophic organisms as well, suggesting that they contribute to cellular growth ingeneral (15).Despite their origins in phylogenetically diverse organisms from very different habitats,six of the seven DACs studied here could be successfully expressed in E. coli .U n s u r p r i s i n g l y ,their “preferred ”promoters varied; different promoters resulted in different growth yields( f o u rw e r eh i g h e rw i t h araBp,a n dt h r e ew e r eh i g h e rw i t hT 7 ) .T h i sd i f f e r e n c em a yb ed u et othe effect of overproduction of the expressed proteins, as has been documented in mem-brane proteins using pET vectors with IPTG as an inducer (17).

However,accumulating excessive intracellular DIC might affect intracellular pH or have other physio-logical effects. Too much DAC expression could also overtax the Sec system (responsiblefor placing integral membrane proteins into the cell membrane) and inhibit the transloca-tion of other membrane proteins necessary for cellular function (17).With respect to the T. ruber DAC, it is not clear whether expression was successful.Expression controlled by a native promoter-rescued CO2-sensitive E. coli strain, andgrowth was robust when controlled by a T7 promoter. However, intracellular DIC con-centrations were not measurably higher when this complex was expressed, and pres-ence of the DAC could not be con ﬁrmed via mass spectrometry. It is possible that thiscomplex was expressed too weakly to provide a signal for the proteomic analysis andDIC measurement, while still providing the small amounts of DIC uptake necessary tosustain growth by E. coli . Another factor could be related to the host organism ’s habi-tat;T. ruber was the only hyperthermophile in this study. It is likely that the tempera-tures used for expression (37°C) and measuring DIC accumulation (21°C) were not opti-mal for its activity. Intracellular DIC concentrations were not elevated when uptakeexperiments were repeated at 37°C (data not shown). The DAC from this organism mayrequire much higher temperature for optimal function.For DACs composed of two or three subunits, all subunits are needed for DIC accu-mulation, which is consistent with prior studies of 2-subunit DACs (8, 14, 16).

As demonstrated with this study, 3-subunit DACs alsorequire the presence of the T subunit for activity; expression of the M subunit and theC subunit without the T subunit from Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans ,H. neapolitanus , andSulfurovum sp. strain AR also failed to accumulate intracellular DIC. The T subunits forthese three complexes all have predicted transmembrane helices, suggesting that theymay be involved in transport of DIC across the membrane, if DACs act as DIC transport-ers. Alternatively, the T subunit may play a regulatory role like that of the Sbt trans-porter regulatory subunit, SbtB. The SbtB subunit acts as like PII regulatory protein,modulating HCO32transport by adenylylation (9, 18).DIC accumulation by DACs appears to be universally linked to the proton motiveforce, as ﬁve structurally diverse DACs have now been shown to be sensitive to CCCP(15, 16, 19; this study). One possible mechanism to connect DIC accumulation to theproton motive force would be for DIC accumulation to rely on proton import, as hasbeen suggested previously (16). The M subunit belongs to a protein family thatincludes subunits from other complexes that act to transport protons. One complexwith subunits homologous to M subunits is the NADH dehydrogenase complex(including NuoL, ND5, and NdhF), which oxidizes NADH while contributing to cellularproton potential via proton expulsion. The other complexes with subunits homologousto M subunits are Mrp (multiple resistance and pH)-type Na1/H1antiporters (14).FIG 7 Chromosomal colocation of genes encoding DACs with those encoding enzymes from the CBB and rCAC pathways forautotrophic CO2ﬁxation.TABLE 6 Gene abundances gathered from metagenome datapH category pH rangeNo. ofmetagenomesTotal no.of genesNo. of DAC(COG3002)No. of Sbt(COG3329)COG ratio,DAC/SbtaNo. of DAC(Pfam10070)No. of Sbt(Pfam05982)Pfam ratio,DAC/SbtbAcidic 0.83 –5.4 91 2.7 /C2107864 180 4.8 701 159 4.4Alkaline 8.5 –10 74 3.4 /C21071,439 3,329 0.43 1,153 3,266 0.35Very alkaline 11 –14 23 3.73 /C2106142 996 0.14 138 976 0.14aCalculated as no. of DAC (COG3002)/no. of Sbt (COG3329).bCalculated as no. of DAC (Pfam10070)/no. of Sbt (Pfam05982).DIC Accumulating Complexes Journal of BacteriologyDecember 2021 Volume 203 Issue 23 e00377-21 jb.asm.org 11These antiporters contain either six or seven transmembrane subunits that function tomaintain intracellular pH and sodium homeostasis (20).Two possible models of DAC function are consistent with the data presented here(Fig. 1). In one model, proton translocation is coupled to conversion of intracellularCO2to HCO32(16). This model is similar to the action of the modi ﬁed NADH dehydro-genases used by some Cyanobacteria , which act as unidirectional carbonic anhydrases,converting intracellular CO2to HCO32to prevent it from leaking from the cell (13, 21).Consistent with this proposed activity, C subunits from DAC are homologous to b-typecarbonic anhydrases (16). Interestingly, the sequences of the genes encoding thesesystems in Cyanobacteria do not provide evidence for homology with those encodingDAC, suggesting independent evolutionary origins for the two types of complexes,which is consistent with other differences in mechanism. The systems in Cyanobacteriacouple CO2hydration to redox reactions, while the amino acid sequences of DAC subu-nits do not suggest a link to such reactions (16). The other possible model for DACfunction is that it acts as a CO2:H1symporter (Fig. 1). In this case, CO2and H1wouldboth be transported across the cell membrane. Upon arrival in the cytoplasm, the CO2could be converted to HCO32by vectoral carbonic anhydrase activity by the DAC, asdescribed above. Both models of DAC activity would result in elevated intracellular DICconcentrations, so it is not possible to determine which model is more likely to be cor-rect at this point.If DACs act as DIC transporters, it is interesting that they use CO2as a substrate, andnot HCO32. All the DIC transporters found in Bacteria thus far (SbtA, SulP, and BCT1)transport HCO32. Metagenomics data also supports DAC using CO2as a substrate. Theincreased frequency of DAC over Sbt genes in metagenomes from more acidic environ-ments would be bene ﬁcial, since CO2is more readily available than HCO32at lower pH.Transporting CO2would make DAC unique among DIC transporters currently charac-terized in Bacteria . Though it seems counterintuitive that a CO2transporter would facil-itate CO2entry into a cell, since CO2can diffuse through cell membranes, CO2entryand capture when DACs are expressed is much higher than in their absence (Fig. 5).Consistency in DIC accumulation by these seven DACs, as well as those studied pre-viously, strongly suggests that other members of this family throughout the tree of lifelikely also act to elevate intracellular DIC concentrations for the myriad of autotrophicand heterotrophic organisms in which they are found. The relative ease of heterol-ogous expression of DACs from multiple phyla makes them an attractive tool forenhancing the activity of engineered organisms that convert CO2to industrial precur-sor compounds. In addition, the DACs studied here operate in organisms inhabitinghabitats with acidic to basic pH values and low to high temperatures, which suggeststhat they could operate well in industrial contexts with similarly challenging environ-mental conditions. Though DACs were initially detected in a deep-sea sulfur chemoli-thoautotroph (14), their activity on DIC, a metabolite of near-universal importance tolife, has implications for the ecophysiology of CO2ﬁxation in many habitats, as well ascarbon-neutral industry.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of plasmids for expressing DACs. Genes encoding DACs from seven taxonomicallydiverse organisms were inserted into three vectors, each with a different promoter: native (pENTR)(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc), T7 (pET28) (EMD Biosciences) and araBp, the promoter from the araBAD op-eron (pBAD202) (Invitrogen, Inc.).These constructs were synthesized by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. First,sequences of genes encoding the presumed subunits of the complexes were optimized for expressioninE. coli via BOOST (22). Then, genes encoding the 1, 2, and 3 presumed subunits of each complex weresynthesized as linear DNA fragments (Twist Biosciences Inc., CA) and Gibson assembled using theNEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix (New England Biolabs) with vectors carrying one of three dif-ferent promoters: native (presumably weak in E. coli ), pBAD (tightly regulated), or attenuated T7 (strongand regulated).For constructs with native promoters, bacterial promoters were predicted from the genome sequen-ces of the native organisms using BProm (23). DAC genes from Am. ferrooxidans ,Acidithiobacillus ferroox-idans ,At. thiooxidans ,H. neapolitanus ,H. crunogenus , and T. ruber appear to be distal to the beginning ofSchmid et al. Journal of BacteriologyDecember 2021 Volume 203 Issue 23 e00377-21 jb.asm.org 12an operon and do not have promoters predicted upstream. For each of these genes, a 200- to 300-nucle-otide extension was added to the 5 9end of the sequence encoding the DAC (Table 7). This extensioncontained the promoter 5 9to the apparent operon that includes the DAC. Synthesized DNA was clonedinto pENTR (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc).For constructs in which expression was regulated via araBpin pBAD202 (Invitrogen, Inc.), sequenceswere optimized, and DNA was synthesized as described above and cloned into pBAD202 digested withNcoI and PmeI to remove all fusion domains so that the expressed proteins would have native aminoand carboxy termini. For constructs regulated via T7 promoter, DNA was cloned into pET28b vector(EMD Biosciences) digested with NcoI and XhoI.Constructs were also created to determine which of the presumed subunits of the complexes wereresponsible and/or necessary for DIC accumulation. For all DACs except the one from Am. ferrooxidans ,in which M and C subunits are fused into a single protein (MC), constructs were created that carried onlythe gene encoding the M subunit. For DACs predicted to include a T subunit, constructs were created inwhich this subunit was absent. Genes were either synthesized as described above or ampli ﬁed from theinitial construct via PCR, and Gibson chewback cloned into pBAD202 or pET28b at the cloning sitesdescribed above. All constructs were sequence veri ﬁed by PacBio sequencing (Paci ﬁc Biosciences, Inc.,CA), and plasmids were introduced into E. coli TOP10 (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc).Construction of E. coli host strain for expressing DACs. AnE. coli strain was created to test theability of the DAC to elevate intracellular DIC concentrations (described in the supplemental material).Like other heterotrophs, E. coli requires HCO32for essential biological processes and thus requires car-bonic anhydrase (CA) to convert cytoplasmic CO2to HCO32(24). E. coli expressed two isoforms of CA:YadF, which is expressed when cells are growing slowly, and CynT, which is expressed when cells areusing cyanate as a nitrogen source (25). E. coli EDCM636, in which yadF had been deleted, had previ-ously been used to study DIC transporters (25) but was prone to pseudoreversion via expression of cynT .E. coli in which both CA genes are deleted is more stable and has been successfully used to expressDACs from H. neapolitanus ,V. cholerae , and B. anthracis (16), but this strain lacks a gene encoding T7RNA polymerase. To avoid pseudoreversions, as well as to facilitate gene expression from multiple pro-moters, both CA genes were deleted from E. coli Lemo21(DE3). This strain of E. coli carries pLysS, encod-ing T7 RNA polymerase but also encodes a T7 lysozyme to provide the option of attenuating expressionby T7 RNA polymerase (26).Primers used for overlap extension PCR and PCR conditions are listed in Tables 8 and 9. Overlapextension PCR products, in which the target genes ( yadF and cynT ) were deleted, were cloned into sui-cide vector pLD55 (27). Selection of single and double crossovers, resulting in loss of cynT and yadF , wasundertaken as described in reference 27. A detailed description of the steps to create E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT is provided in the supplemental material.Chemically competent E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadFDcynT.E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT wasmade chemically competent using the CaCl2method (28). Preparation of competent cells was asdescribed in reference 29 with the following modi ﬁcations. Bacteria were pelleted from 200 ml LB sup-plemented with chloramphenicol (30 mg/liter) under a 5% CO2headspace. The culture was resuspendedin 12 ml 0.1 mM CaCl2and then incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were harvested via centrifugation(1,500/C2gfor 10 min at 20°C). The pellets were resuspended in 3.2 ml 1 M CaCl2with 15% glycerol (vol/vol) and stored at 280°C.Expressing DAC genes in E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadFDcynT.Plasmids carrying DAC genes (see“Construction of plasmids for expressing DACs, ”above) were puri ﬁed from E. coli Top10 using theQIAprep spin minikit (Qiagen) and introduced into the chemically competent E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadFDcynT cells described above. Transformations were conducted as described in reference 29 with the fol-lowing modi ﬁcations. Mixed DNA and competent cells were stored on ice for 15 min. A recovery periodof 1 h at 37°C was used. Each reaction mixture was plated on solid LA supplemented with the appropri-ate antibiotic (depending on the vector; 25 mg/liter kanamycin for pENTR vectors, 25 mg/liter kanamycinfor pET28 vectors, and 30 mg/liter apramycin for pBAD202 vectors) and incubated for 24 h at 30°C in ahigh-CO2incubation chamber. PCR assays (Tables 8 and 9) were used to con ﬁrm that the pLD55 plas-mids containing the C and M subunits (as appropriate) were successfully carried by the E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT cells after transformation.Cells were grown in 20-ml liquid cultures using LB with 25 mg/liter kanamycin for pET28 vectors,and 30 mg/liter apramycin for pBAD202 vectors. For DACs whose expression was driven by the T7 pro-moter, IPTG (1 mM) was added to growth media to induce expression and rhamnose (2 mM) to repressexpression. Media for DACs whose expression was driven by araBpwere supplemented with 6 mMTABLE 7 Regions of host organism genomes predicted to encode native promoters for the operons in which the DAC genes were colocated,which were cloned into pENTRHost organism Region with promoterAm. ferrooxidans 300-nucleotide intergenic region upstream from cbbL (IMG gene ID 644951266)At. thiooxidans 200-nucleotide intergenic region upstream from cbbL (IMG gene ID 2838919118)H. neapolitanus 200-nucleotide intergenic region upstream from cbbL (IMG gene ID 646383307)Sulfurovum sp.

For E. coli expressing the DAC from Sulfurovum sp. strain AR, growth yields were higher whenarabinose concentrations were dropped to 1.2 mM (Fig. S4), presumably by lowering the expression ofthe DACs to diminish deleterious effects on the cells (17).LC-MS/MS was used to con ﬁrm the expression of DAC genes in E. coli Lemo21(DE3) DyadF DcynT asdescribed in reference 14 with the following modi ﬁcations. A 120-min gradient was used for peptideseparation by a C18reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column prior to analysison a Q Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc), and raw data ﬁles were processed inMaxQuant, version 1.6.17.0.Growth of E. coli constructs expressing DACs. As an initial screen to determine whether expressionof DACs stimulated growth under low DIC conditions, strains were propagated on solid lysogeny me-dium with low CO2(ambient air, 0.04% CO2) and high CO2(5% CO2). Cells were grown under conditionsthat either induced or repressed gene expression, as described above. Once growth was con ﬁrmed onsolid medium, cells were cultivated in liquid medium. Cells were cultivated in 20 ml liquid lysogenybroth in 250-ml ﬂasks, under ambient air or a 5% CO2–95% air headspace at 100 rpm and 37°C, andgrowth was monitored via optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to measure the effects of DIC, inducer(1 mM IPTG or 6 mM arabinose; see above), or repressor (2 mM rhamnose or 0.2% glucose; see above).Intracellular DIC concentrations in E. coli expressing DACs. Cultures expressing each of the sevenDACs were grown in LB under a 5% CO2atmosphere with the appropriate antibiotic and inducers. Cellswere harvested by centrifugation (10,000 /C2g, 5 min, 4°C), washed once in fresh LB, resuspended to anOD600of 5, and kept on ice for immediate quanti ﬁcation of DIC accumulation by silicone oil centrifuga-tion as described in reference 8, with the following modi ﬁcations. Cell suspensions were mixed into to amodi ﬁed assay buffer (LB, 50 mM Na-HEPES [pH 8], 0.25 mM NaH14CO32[2 mCi/mM]). This mixture wasthen carefully pipetted into microcentrifuge tubes with silicone oil overlying a killing solution and centri-fuged, and the pellet was assayed via scintillation counting in order to quantify intracellular [14C]DIC (8).DAC substrate: HCO32or CO2.DACs from three bacteria, Am. ferrooxidans ,H. crunogenus , andSulfurovum sp. strain AR, were chosen for further investigation. These three DACs included all three sub-unit compositions (1 subunit, 2 subunit, and 3 subunit), three phyla ( Actinobacteria ,Proteobacteria , andCampylobacterota ), and a broad range of habitat pH values (acidic to alkaline). These DACs were testedto determine if they were active with CO2versus HCO32by performing isotopic disequilibrium experi-ments as described in reference 30. This technique relies on the slowness of interconversion of CO2andHCO32in the absence of CA (30). To prepare for isotopic disequilibrium experiments, a solution of14CO2was prepared by adding [14C]DIC stock solution to 1 mM H3PO4in a sealed serum vial and allowing it toequilibrate for 5 min. To measure CO2uptake, cells were suspended in 200 ml of 50 mM HEPES-bufferedLB (pH 8) and layered on top of silicone oil and killing solution as described in reference 30. Ten microli-ters of14CO2solution was added, and after a 20-s incubation, cells were centrifuged into the killing solu-tion and processed as described in reference 30. To measure H14CO32uptake, the incubation solutionwas supplemented with bovine carbonic anhydrase (0.1 mg/ml), which instantaneously converts ;99%of the CO2to HCO32and CO322, assuming a pKa for carbonic acid of 6.1 and an incubation pH of 8. Tenmicroliters of14CO2solution was added and presumably instantaneously converted to HCO32, and cellswere incubated and processed as described above.Use of proton potential for DIC accumulation. To investigate the mechanism of DIC uptake, theproton potential was collapsed using the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone(CCCP) as described in reference 14. CCCP solutions were prepared in DMSO (100 mM). Cells were incu-bated for 2 min in the presence of 0.1% DMSO (solvent control) or 0.1 mM CCCP dissolved in DMSObefore intracellular DIC concentrations were measured as described above. To verify that the CCCPaffected proton potential in these cells, the effect of this inhibitor was also measured on intracellularATP with an ATP bioluminescence assay kit (Sigma). Effects on the proton potential were also veri ﬁed bymeasuring intracellular pH using [14C]methylamine, an ammonia derivative that accumulates in the cyto-plasm to a level proportional to pH, as described in reference 30.Relative abundance of genes encoding DACs and Sbt transporters in metagenomes fromalkaline and acidic environments. To determine whether the pH of the habitat in ﬂuences the abun-dance of DIC accumulation mechanisms acting on CO2(DACs) versus HCO32(Sbt transporters), metage-nomes for which habitat pH data were available were collected from the Integrated Microbial Genomesand Microbiomes database ( https://img.jgi.doe.gov/) (31 ).
