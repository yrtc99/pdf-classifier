However, theadverse effects of climate change pose a severe threat to agricultural sustainability. Compared to conventionalpractices, sustainable farming offers signi ﬁcant environmental bene ﬁts and helps to mitigate climate change im-pacts. In this article, we examined the effects of integrated nutrient management, organic amendment, no-tillage,crop rotation, residue retention, intercropping, and biochar on C sequestration and the in ﬂuencing factors andassociated economic bene ﬁts. A total of 2362 pair-wise observations from 295 studies were included in themeta-analysis framework. The result shows that biochar was the most effective practice for enhancing C seques-tration (+41.28 %). Maize-wheat and legume-based cropping systems, medium ﬁne-textured soils, humid-subtropical climate, rainfall, irrigation, and time period were the signi ﬁcant factors that affect carbon sequestra-tion. In addition, our study demonstrated that C sequestration is a dynamic process, and only a limited amount ofsequestration is possible from a piece of land. Further, we found that all the improved farming practices thatenhance C sequestration were technically feasible and economically pro ﬁtable. Thus, soil C sequestration throughimproved crop management practices represents a win-win strategy to combat climate change and conservenatural resources. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards outscaling of sustainable agricultural practicesto enhance resilience and adaptation to climate change.© 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

IntroductionEnsuring food and nutritional security for an ever-growing popula-tion under climate change is one of the critical challenges of the presenttimes. The impact of climate change on food security is visible throughthe rise in temperature, erratic rainfall, and extreme weather events.Global temperature is projected to increase by 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2050 ( IPCC, 2018 ). The negativeeffects of climate change further aggravate the scarcity of natural re-sources, pollution levels, and land degradation. Consequently, millionsof the population's livelihood and food security are rigorously threat-ened by climate change impacts and vulnerabilities of food productionsystems. Although agriculture provides various ecosystem services butalso contributes to global warming through greenhouse gas emissions.India is regarded as one of the fastest-growing developing nations inthe world. The country's real GDP is expected to grow by 6.7 % in 2021and 9.9 % in 2022 ( OECD, 2021 ). Agriculture and allied sectors play apivotal role in rural economies' sustainable growth and development.These sectors contribute 19.9 % of the total GDP and 11.4 % of total ex-ports and support livelihood for more than two-thirds of the population(GoI, 2020, 2021 ). Besides, it plays a vital role in national food securityand provides raw materials to various agro-based industries. However,despite higher economic growth, about 208.6 million (15.3 %) popula-tion of the country is still undernourished ( FAO et al., 2021 ), and 21.9% of the population is in extreme poverty ( UNDP, 2021 ). Further, popu-lation growth and degradation of natural resources coupled with thedetrimental impacts of climate change have threatened India's foodand nutritional security.Although conventional agricultural practices help to achieve food se-curity but often lead to indiscriminate use of farm inputs, higher GHGemissions, and degradation of natural resources. Further, intensivefarming practices and the cultivation of degraded lands resulted in theremoval of soil organic carbon and other essential nutrients ( Lal,2016 ;Feng et al., 2018 ). Consequently, it deteriorates soil health andmakes it infertile and unsuitable for further cultivation. Therefore, it isessential to enhance soil organic matter content in agricultural landsto enrich soil fertility and productivity while mitigating greenhousegas emissions. Numerous studies highlighted that soil organic matterincreases crop yield by sustaining soil health and positively impactingsoil quality and process ( Lal, 2016 ;Manlay et al., 2007 ). However, it isSustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708⁎Corresponding authors.E-mail addresses: kiran.tm@icar.gov.in (K.K. T.M.), spl.econ@gmail.com (S.

A global meta-analysis by Oldﬁeld et al. (2019) shows that anincrease in soil organic matter can increase crop yield in maize andwheat by 10 % and 23 %, respectively. Similarly, a positive correlationbetween soil organic carbon content and crop yield was also re-ported by Arunrat et al. (2020) . Nevertheless, agriculture also actsas a natural carbon sink and provides a huge opportunity to captureatmospheric carbon through sustainable agricultural practices.Therefore, it is indispensable to identify the farming practiceswhich enhance carbon sequestration without affecting other ecosys-tem services. To tap the carbon sequestration potential in agricul-tural lands, ‘4 per 1000 ’was also initiated to enrich soil organiccarbon by 0.4 % yearly ( Nath et al., 2018 ;Lal, 2020b ).Sustainable agricultural management practices (SAPs) are widelyrecognized and promoted as sustainable strategies to mitigate climatechange ( FAO, 2013 ). A wealth of evidence shows that sustainable agri-cultural practices provide a wide range of socio-economic and environ-mental bene ﬁts compared to conventional practices ( Hazra et al., 2020 ;Kumara et al., 2019 ). The most widely recognized SAPs to enrich carbonsequestration in cultivated lands include integrated nutrient manage-ment, organic amendment, no-tillage, crop rotation, residue retention,intercropping, biochar, and agroforestry. Growing awareness regardingthe importance of SAPs and ﬁeld-level evidence has led to increasedadoption of these practices in the recent past ( Clark et al., 2017 ;Chenet al., 2009 ). For example, converting land to no-tillage increases soilorganic carbon while limiting greenhouse gas emissions ( Curtin et al.,2000 ;Kumara et al., 2020 ). In addition, integrated nutrient manage-ment positively affects yield and soil carbon and enhances plant nutri-ent availability ( Choudhury et al., 2018 ). Similarly, retaining residuesin the ﬁeld after harvest improves soil health, carbon storage, andsoil moisture ( Turmel et al., 2015 ). Further, adding biochar improvessoil aggregation and delays the decomposition rate ( Han Weng et al.,2017 ). Other practices, viz., crop rotation, organic amendment,intercropping, and agroforestry also been proven to enhance soilcarbon stock. Furthermore, these improved management practicesare also recognized by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) as a prominent land-based management solution (withmedium cost) to address global climate change issues effectively(IPCC, 2019 ).Meta-analysis is popularly used in synthesizing individual studiesand deriving broad conclusions about the impact of a particular treat-ment in recent years ( Sharma et al., 2019 ;Padbhushan et al., 2021 ).Globally, many meta-analysis studies reported the impact of improvedcrop management practices on soil organic carbon ( Oldﬁeld et al.,2019 ;Haddaway et al., 2017 ;Qin et al., 2016 ). In the case of India,although many on-station studies have been conducted to assess thecarbon sequestration potential of sustainable agricultural practices,very minimal efforts have been made to synthesize the evidencethrough meta-analysis. Adequate information on the magnitude of soilcarbon sequestration and its signi ﬁcant drivers is still lacking. Manyfactors in ﬂuence the soil organic carbon (SOC) content of SAPs, suchas climate, rainfall, geographical region, soil condition, and agronomicmanagement ( Bai et al., 2019 ). Though the concern over the impactsof climate change on food security is growing over the period, the sys-temic evidence of improved management practices and their impactson soil carbon stock still needs to be improved. Further, some studiesreported negative and neutral effects of SAPs on soil carbon sequestra-tion ( Justine et al., 2015 ). Therefore, building a clear vision of the roleof carbon sequestration potential in productivity enhancement andidentifying crucial SAPs that improve soil carbon sequestration is neces-sary. This study attempts to synthesize the evidence of various studieson the carbon sequestration potential of improved crop managementpractices in Indian agriculture by using a meta-analysis framework.This study systematically collates the evidence on the carbon sequestra-tion potential of sustainable agricultural management practices inIndian agriculture with the help of a meta-analysis framework. Inthis study, we examined the (i) impacts of integrated nutrientmanagement, organic amendment, no-tillage, crop rotation, residueretention, intercropping, and biochar on C sequestration, (ii) to de-termine the factors that in ﬂuence carbon sequestration, and (iii)economic feasibility of improved crop management practices forC sequestration.2. Methods2.1. Data collectionAn inclusive search of peer-reviewed research articles comprisingvarious SAPs in India using online search engines viz., Google Scholar,Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus up to June 2021. The combi-nations of search keywords used to identify the peer-reviewed studiesare “soil organic carbon ”,“soil organic matter ”,“carbon sequestration ”,“integrated nutrient management ”,“organic amendment ”,“no-tillage ”,“minimum tillage ”,“crop rotation ”,“residue retention ”,“intercropping ”and “biochar ”,“India ”,“Indo-Gangetic Plains ”. The studies included intheﬁnal analysis were selected based on three criteria which werefollowed by Bai et al. (2019) ; (i) the study should be based on ﬁeld ex-periments with at least any of the SAPs, (ii) soil organic carbon is re-ported in tables or graphs with a side-by-side comparison of SAPs andtheir controls, and (iii) detailed information about the experiment,such as location, duration, soil depth, and other agronomic practices isprovided. The details of improved management and control practicesincluded in this study are given in Table 1 . The data reported in graphi-cal formats were extracted using DigiPlot software ( https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ ). Further, if the information on SOC stocks was notreported, then stocks were estimated using bulk density and soildepth. All the observations of SOC stocks were expressed in Mg Cha−1. The data has been collected from all the agro-climatic zones andmajor soil groups of India ( Fig. 1 shows the location of on-station trialsof improved farming practices). Based on the duration of the experi-ments conducted, studies were classi ﬁed as short (<5 years), medium(6–20 years), and long-term (>20 years) ( Bai et al., 2019 ). The soil tex-ture was broadly classi ﬁed into moderately coarse, medium, moderatelyﬁne, and ﬁne. The climates of the study region were grouped accordingto Köppen's climate classi ﬁcation as humid subtropical, semi-arid andsemi-arid subtropical. The mean annual rainfall was grouped into fourcategories: <750 mm, 750-1150 mm, 1150-2000 mm, and >2000 mm(See the Supplementary ﬁle, Fig. S4).Table 1Details of improved crop management practices used in this study.Improved managementpracticesTreatment ControlIntegrated nutrientmanagementIncorporation of organicand inorganic sources ofnutrients.100 % NPKOrganic amendment Addition of 100 % organicsources of nutrients.100 % NPKNo-tillage Minimal soil disturbance Conventional tillageCrop rotation Growing a variety of cropsin succession over a periodon the same ﬁeld.Growing of monocropResidue retention Residue retained in thecropping systemResidue removedIntercropping Simulations cultivation oftwo or more crops in thesame ﬁeldCultivation of sole cropBiochar Addition of biochar into soil No biochar addedK.K.

Statistical toolsThe collected data were analyzed using a meta-analysis framework.Meta-analysis is becoming a popular tool in the recent past due to itsﬂexibility in data analysis compared to other methods. Several studieshave used meta-analysis in environmental and natural resource eco-nomics studies ( Cadotte et al., 2012 ;Nelson and Kennedy, 2009 ).The effect size of each study was estimated as response ratio (RR),a ratio of the outcome variable of SAPs and their control group. Thenatural log of response ratio (LRR) is estimated using the belowequation ( Hedges and Gurevitch, 1999 ):Effect size ¼ln RR ¼lnXTXC"#¼lnXT−lnXC ð1Þwhere XTandXCare the soil organic carbon stocks under SAPs and con-ventional practices, respectively. Since many studies did not report thevariance of means, observations were weighted by the number of repli-cations. For studies where the number of observations was more thanone, then weights were divided by the total number of observationsfrom that study. The weights were estimated by using the followingequation.Weights w ðÞ ¼NTXNCNTþNCð2Þwhere N Tand N Care the number of replications under treatment andcontrol groups, respectively ( Van Groenigen et al., 2011 ;Lam et al.,2013 ). Further, a random-effect model was used to understand carbonsequestration response under different SAPs. Finally, the obtained LRRwas transformed in terms of percentage change in SOC stocks of treat-ment groups compared to the control group. The meta-analysis wasperformed using the “metafor ”package in R software ( Viechtbauer,2010 ). Percent change = (exp(LRR) −1)∗100. Further, heterogeneityand the publication bias of the studies were also assessed before ﬁnalstatistical analysis (see the Supplementary ﬁle, Table S2 & Fig. S3).To identify the agronomic and environmental factors affecting thecarbon sequestration potential of SAPs, a mixed linear model was esti-mated by using the response ratio as a dependent variable ( Toliveret al., 2012 ).IN RRðÞ ¼ WaþUβþε ð3Þwhere αandβare unknown ﬁxed and random effects vectors, and Wand U are given known and incidence matrices ( McLean et al., 1991 ).The sign and signi ﬁcance of the parameter estimates were used to iden-tify the factors in ﬂuencing carbon sequestration. Finally, the random in-tercepts for states and study locations were added to capture regionaldifferences in the explanatory variables. The ﬁnal model was speci ﬁedas follows:lnRR ¼α0þ∑αiCroppingSystem þ∑αjClimate þ∑αkSoilþα16Rainfall þα17Irrigation þα18Durationlogþ1jstate jstudysite ðÞ ð 4Þwhere the cropping system represents one of the four systems (i =maize-wheat, legume-based, soybean-wheat, ﬁnger millet based, horti-cultural based, and others), climate represents one of the ﬁve climatetypes (j = semiarid tropical, semi-arid, semi-arid-subtropical, sub-temperate, and arid), and the soil represents one of the four soil textures(k = coarse, ﬁne, medium and moderately ﬁne). The reference catego-ries for cropping systems, climate, and soil texture are rice-wheat,humid subtropical, and moderately coarse soil, respectively. Irrigationis a binary variable (value = 1 if irrigation was applied, 0 = otherwise),and rainfall (mm) is a continuous variable. The variable duration log is acontinuous variable representing the natural logarithm of the year ofthe experiment. The duration log variable is a continuous variable rep-resenting the natural log of the years for which an experiment lasted.The value of the duration log was used to test whether a lag existedbetween SAPs and conventional practices at the start and end of theexperiment and to see the effect of the time period on carbon sequestra-tion potential. All equations were estimated using STATA 14.2. As thepreliminary analysis shows the presence of heteroscedasticity, thestates/study location of the experiment was included in the model asa random effect variable and modelled using an identity covariancematrix. To select a better- ﬁtted model, Akaike information criteria(AIC) was used.2.4. Economic valuationSince India does not have a regulated carbon credit market, the eco-nomic valuation of carbon sequestration was performed by using thesocial cost of carbon as a shadow price. The social cost of carbon depictsthe economic cost of climate damage due to emission of one tonne ofCO2into the atmosphere and thereby represents the economic gainsfrom reduction. Hence we used a country-level social cost of carbon ofUS$86 Mg−1of CO 2for the valuation of C stock ( Ricke et al., 2018 ;MoSPI, 2021 ). Further, the cost of urea (46%N) at US$ 87.29 Mg−1ofUrea as the cost of stabilization for carbon storage in soil. Costs ofother nutrients and other costs were not included in the analysis. Fi-nally, the economic return was estimated as follows ( Lam et al., 2013 ):(i) Value of carbon stock (US$ha−1year−1)=C O 2equivalent(Mg CO 2ha−1year−1)∗Social cost of Mg−1of CO 2(ii) Economic return (US$ha−1year−1)=V a l u eo fc a r b o ns t o c k(US$ha−1year−1)−Cost of stabilization of carbon storage(US$ha−1year−1)Additionally, to determine the carbon credit potential of SAPs,we also conducted the analysis by using the 2021 global carbonprice for agriculture sector in the voluntary carbon market (VCM)as US$8.81 Mg−1of CO 2(Donofrio et al., 2022 ).3. Results3.1. Trends from the systematic reviewOur study indicated that the response of soil organic carbon tosustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) was predominantly positive,with 88 % cases of positive, 10 % negative and 3 % neutral effects(Fig. 2 ). Out of seven SAPs, integrated nutrient management, and resi-due retention had the highest number of positive effects. In contrast,crop rotation ( −22 %) and no-tillage ( −15 %) accounted for the highestproportion of negative effect sizes as compared to other practices.Although several studies have investigated the carbon sequestrationpotential of improved crop management practices, the most frequentlyexamined SAPs were integrated nutrient management, residue reten-tion, no-tillage, and organic amendment. However, biochar and crop ro-tation were less investigated and therefore call for further in-depthstudies in this area.3.2. Impact of sustainable agricultural management practices on carbonsequestrationThe meta-analysis shows signi ﬁcantly higher carbon sequestra-tion under improved management practices compared with conven-tional practices. Application of biochar resulted in a higher carbonsequestration rate (3.27 Mg C ha−1year−1), whereas crop rotationand no-tillage had a slightly lower sequestration rate compared toK.K. T.M., S. Pal, P. Chand et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708700other practices ( Fig. 3 ). The analysis of effect size shows that theaddition of biochar into the soil was a most effective practice toenhance carbon sequestration (33.75 % to 49.26 %) with a mean ef-fect of 41.28 % ( Fig. 4 ). Similarly, organic amendment, intercropping,integrated nutrient management, and no-tillage were also having asigni ﬁcant in ﬂuence over SOC with a mean effect ranging from28.27 % to 12.79 % higher than conventional practices. On the otherhand, crop rotation showed a lower yet signi ﬁcant impact on soil Cstocks with a mean effect of 7.19 %. All the results were statisticallysigniﬁcant.Cropping system-based analysis presented in Table 3 showedthat legume-based systems had highest carbon sequestration underintegrated nutrient management (17.3 %), no-tillage (15.04 %), residueretention (17.94 %), and organic amendment (40.03 %). Under themaize-wheat system, integrated nutrient management (18.71 %) andno-tillage (14.43 %) positively affected soil C stock. However, crop rota-tion and no-tillage were less effective and insigni ﬁcant in improving Csequestration under the rice-wheat system. Further, we also found apositive relationship between carbon sequestration and yield (see theSupplementary ﬁle, Fig. S2). The increase in yield was observed withan increase in soil organic carbon stocks. However, the largest gain inyield was witnessed within 1 % of soil organic carbon concentration.3.3. C sequestration potential of sustainable agricultural practices underdifferent climatic conditionsClimatic conditions play an important role in enhancing the carbonsequestration potential of SAPs. The results show that overall, highercarbon sequestration was found in the semi-arid region followed bythe semi-arid subtropical region and humid subtropical region ( Fig. 5 ).Implementation of crop rotation, no-tillage, and integrated nutrientmanagement had increased additional C sequestration by 18.01 %,13.02 %, and 11.13 % than humid subtropical climate. In contrast, res-idue retention (15.84 %) and intercropping (8 %) practices hadhigher C sequestration under semi-arid subtropical regions than inhumid subtropical areas. Interestingly, SOC stocks of biochar havenot varied signi ﬁcantly under all the climates considered in thisstudy. However, the organic amendment had increased 27.82 % addi-tional soil organic carbon in the humid-subtropical region comparedto the semi-arid region.3.4. Impact of soil texture and duration on C sequestration potential ofsustainable agricultural practicesSoil texture is also a major driving force that governs the magnitudeof C sequestration. Overall, moderately ﬁne-textured soils had higherC sequestration than other groups ( Fig. 6 ). The organic amendment,biochar, and crop rotation under these groups had increased Csequestration by 56.11 %, 51.11 %, and 26.28 %, respectively. In con-trast, integrated nutrient management, no-tillage, and intercroppingpractices performed better under moderately textured soils and in-creased SOC by 20.29 %, 12.61 %, and 22.58 %, respectively. At thesame time, medium-textured soil groups had shown a positive effecton residue retention and increased SOC by 21.82 %.Further, our results showed the effect of the time period on the car-bon sequestration potential of improved farming practices ( Fig. 7 ).

Sustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708701observed that an additional 2.62 Mg C ha−1can be sequestrated till40 years of implementation of SAPs. However, after 40 years, the addi-tional gain in SOC has shown a declining trend. Further, integratednutrient management had increased C sequestration by 14.66 %,19.91 %, and 27.62 % in all three experimental durations, i.e., short-term, medium-term, and long-term, respectively. Similarly, theorganic amendment also showed similar results of increased SOC inthe range of 9.91 % to 14.78 % under all three experimental durations.No-tillage practices signi ﬁcantly increased C sequestration by18.60 % in the medium-term experiments and 9.44 % in short-termduration experiments. Residue retention increased SOC in bothshort and medium-duration experiments by 9.51 % and 17.98 %, re-spectively. Intercropping also increased C sequestration by 7.96 %and 15.77 % in both short-term and medium-term experiments.However, crop rotation augmented higher C sequestration undershort-term duration (13.86 %) than in the medium-term durationexperiments (12.70 %) (see the Supplementary ﬁle, Table S1).3.5. In ﬂuence of agro-climatic factors on C sequestrationThe model speci ﬁed in Eq. (4)was used to identify the role ofcropping systems, soil texture, climate, and related factors on relativeC sequestration difference in SAPs. Coef ﬁcients in Table 4 are shown asthe effect of the variable on the C sequestration potential associatedwith its reference category. C sequestration responded differently tocrop production systems. Carbon sequestration under legume-based,maize-wheat, soybean-wheat, and ﬁnger millet-based systems wasfound higher than in the rice-wheat system. Further, moderately ﬁne-textured soils showed signi ﬁcantly higher C sequestration potentialthan coarse and ﬁne soils. Although the overall highest effect size wasobserved under a semi-arid climate, regression result shows that Csequestration favors humid-subtropical climate over semiarid-tropical, semi-arid, and semiarid-subtropical environments. Further,rainfall, irrigation, and duration parameters were also found to bemajor driving factors for the higher C sequestration potential underimproved management practices.3.6. Economic valuationSustainable agricultural practices can be targeted as potential tech-nologies to improve soil C sequestration and increase farm incomefor small and marginal holders. Our result shows that all the SAPsconsidered in this study emerged as economically feasible andhave the potential to tap the carbon credit market. The additionaleconomic value of carbon sequestration from each practice was esti-mated at US$1033 ha−1year−1by applying biochar, 297 US$ ha−1year−1through organic amendment, US$224.07 ha−1year−1by prac-ticing integrated nutrient management, US$181.54 ha−1year−1fromthe implementation of intercropping, US$ 99.84 ha−1year−1fromresidue retention, US$ 95.26 ha−1year−1through crop rotation andUS$ 50.03 ha−1year−1for no-tillage during initial ten years of adoptionof SAPs ( Table 5 ). The economic value of carbon stock was estimatedusing the social cost of carbon US$ 86 Mg−1of CO 2.F u r t h e r ,e v e ni fwe consider the cost of N as a stabilization cost for C storage, the pos-itive net economic return was still found for all the SAPs in the rangeof US$47.9 to 988.96 ha−1year−1.Fig. 4.

Further, the positive net economic return was also observedin the range of US$2.97 to 61.36 ha−1year−1for all the SAPs consideredin this study.

Carbon sequestration potentialSustainable agricultural management practices effectively mitigatethe adverse effects of climate change through increasing soil C seques-tration, thereby avoiding carbon emissions from conventional farmingpractices. Our results indicated that improved management practicespositively and signi ﬁcantly affected soil organic carbon at differentscales. The addition of biochar into soil had the highest C sequestrationdue to improved CO 2ﬂux, delay in carbon decomposition rate, andstabilization of soil organic carbon ( Wu et al., 2021 ).Das et al. (2022)observed that the use of biochar increased soil organic carbon by 23 %over control. Further, biochar is also recognized as a sustainable landmanagement response option to mitigate climate change by IPCC. Aglobal analysis predicted that biochar has the potential to remove0.03 –6.6 GtCO 2ey r−1from the atmosphere ( IPCC, 2019 ). Besidescarbon sequestration, biochar application also increases yield by 25 %in the tropics.Further, our study indicated that soil organic carbon stocks underthe organic amendment and integrated nutrient management weresigniﬁcantly higher than chemical fertilizer. Previous studies have alsosupported an increase in SOC stocks under organic amendments. Wuet al. (2021) reported 34 % higher soil organic carbon content underorganic amendment than chemical fertilizers. Similar trends of increas-ing soil organic carbon with an organic amendment were also reportedbyBai et al. (2020) andLi et al. (2021) . A global meta-analysis by Hanet al. (2016) showed a 36 % increase in topsoil organic carbon under in-tegrated nutrient management practice. Padbhushan et al. (2021) alsoperformed a meta-analysis and revealed that the addition of organic in-puts leads to a 16 –23 % increase in soil organic carbon over NPK. Simi-larly, Maillard and Angers (2014) also observed a relative increase insoil organic carbon of 26 % (for 18 years). Further, ﬁndings revealedthat integrated nutrient management had lower carbon sequestrationin the rice-wheat system over other systems. It may be due to ricecultivation in the puddled system, which hinders the oxygen supply re-quired for the soil chemical process ( Fageria et al., 2011 ). In addition, adecrease in aggregate stability and cracks in the Indian soil lowers soilorganic carbon ( Hobbs et al., 2008 ).This study postulates higher carbon sequestration potential in no-tillage practice over conventional tillage. Our ﬁndings were supportedbyKumara et al. (2020) andDas et al. (2022) , who reported a 16 –18 %higher C sequestration under conservation tillage. Further, Crop residueretention in the agricultural ﬁeld after crop harvest plays a pivotal rolein increasing C sequestration, in ﬂuencing C dynamics in soil, and im-proving water-holding capacity ( Beehler et al., 2017 ). The presentstudy shows that, on average, there is a 17.28 % more relative changein carbon sequestration under crop residue retention. Mafongoya et al.(2000) , also reported the positive in ﬂuence of soil cover on carbon se-questration. On the other hand, Ghimire et al. (2012) andReicoskyet al. (2002) reported the neutral and/or zero effect of land cover oncarbon sequestration. In addition, this study also observed highercarbon sequestration under crop rotation over mono-cropping systems.A similar study by West and Post (2002) estimated that globally anaverage 20 ± 12 g C m−2year−1C sequestration could be increasedthrough crop rotation.Fig. 7.

Sustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708704Improved land management practices represent a potential globalresponse option to address critical issues, viz., adaptation, mitigation,combating deserti ﬁcation and land degradation, and enhancingfood security ( IPCC, 2019 ). For example, many studies reportedthat improved farming practices have the potential to mitigatecarbon emissions in the range of 1.4 to 2.3 Gt CO 2ep e ry e a r( Smithet al., 2014 ;Pradhan et al., 2013 ). Further, the rejuvenation ofdegraded lands and improved rice management practices have thepotential to cut emissions by 0.2 to 0.7 GtCO 2ep e ry e a r( Smithet al., 2014 ). However, carbon sequestration rates in differentmanagement practices are primarily determined by agronomicpractices and different environmental and climatic factors ( Shiet al., 2018 ).4.2. Impact of climatic conditions, soil texture, and duration on soil carbonsequestrationClimatic conditions play a crucial role in C sequestration and its dis-tribution by regulating microbial mechanisms and biomass production(Callesen et al., 2003 ). The rate of C sequestration is highly dependenton temperature, rainfall, and prevailing environmental conditions. Aslight temperature variation can alter C sequestration by in ﬂuencingthe magnitude of organic matter decomposition ( Zhao et al., 2019 ).The higher temperature generally does not favor C sequestrationdue to the mineralization of soil organic carbon under such conditions(Li et al., 2020 ). In contrast, high rainfall positively in ﬂuences C seques-tration, supporting microbial and vegetation growth ( Han et al., 2019 ;Luo et al., 2017 ). Integrated nutrient management, no-tillage, and croprotation practices had a higher accumulation of SOC stocks in semi-arid regions than in humid subtropical areas, probably due to low SOCturnover in semi-arid subtropical areas than humid subtropical regions(Mureva et al., 2018 ). In contrast, residue retention and adoption ofintercropping practices enhance more extensive C sequestration undersemi-arid subtropical conditions compared to humid subtropical re-gions. The supportive environment for forming pedogenic CaCO 3is theprobable reason for higher C sequestration under semi-arid areas(Bhattacharyya et al., 2011 ;Srinivasarao et al., 2014 ). Further, the totalsoil organic carbon stock in the semi-arid region of India is estimatedat 2.9 Pg (30 % of the total SOC storage).The present study suggests that the C sequestration potential of bio-char does not vary signi ﬁcantly by climatic factors and performs betterin all the environments considered in this study. In contrast, many stud-ies also reported that biochar application in the arid region results inhigher C sequestration than in humid areas ( Karhu et al., 2011 ;Abelet al., 2013 ). The organic amendment increases SOC stocks higher inhumid-subtropical areas than in semi-arid regions. Organic amend-ments enhance SOC storage and delay the decomposition rate inhumid areas with proper management practices. As a result, the organicamendment has higher C sequestration potential under humid-subtropical conditions than in semi-arid areas. However, in highlandagricultural regions, the rate of soil carbon sequestration signi ﬁcantlyvaries compared to lowland areas. In addition to climatic conditions,carbon sequestration in these regions is determined by other factorssuch as elevation, altitude, and slope ( Arunrat et al., 2020 ;Grifﬁthset al., 2009 ). Many studies have shown a direct relationship betweenelevation and soil organic carbon in highland regions. Choudhury et al.(2016) reported a 53.7 % increase in soil organic carbon concentrationand 27 –31 Mg C ha−1at an altitude of 2000 masl compared to the base-line. Dinakaran et al. (2018) andKumar et al. (2017) reported a similarobservation of higher altitudes and higher soil carbon stock. In contrast,a decrease in soil organic carbon stock with altitude has also beenreported by Sheikh et al. (2009) .Soil texture signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuences the C sequestration processunder improved crop management practices. The organic amendment,biochar, and crop rotation practices promote SOC stocks under moder-ately ﬁne-textured soil groups. Clay loam and sandy clay loam soilsunder this group positively affected carbon sequestration and increasedSOC stocks ( Stronkhorst and Venter, 2008 ). These soil groups providephysical and chemical support to soils that help in increasing C seques-tration ( Six et al., 2002 ). Organic amendment and biochar additionunder ﬁne-textured soils increases soil organic matter, improves soilphysical, chemical, and microbial properties, and enhances soil organiccarbon stock ( Omondi et al., 2016 ). In contrast, Lu et al. (2014) andZhang et al. (2020) reported a limited effect on improved SOC underﬁne-textured soils due to the application of biochar. This happenswhen the soil has reached its in ﬂection point and has minimal scopefor further increase in SOC ( Six et al., 2002 ). On the other hand, C se-questration under integrated nutrient management, no-tillage, andintercropping practices was found to be better in sandy loam soils as itaccelerates physical and chemical reactions in the soil by formingbonds ( Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000 ). In contrast, residue retention im-proves SOC stocks under medium-textured soil groups as it augmentsthe soil organic matter, porosity, and cation exchange capacity, whichin turn increases SOC stocks ( Blanco-Canqui, 2017 ).The duration of adoption of SAPs in agricultural production systemsdetermines the rate and dynamics of C sequestration. When SAPs areimplemented, C sequestration initially increases but at a decreasingrate until it reaches a saturation point ( Hoyle et al., 2013 ). Thus, only acertain amount of carbon can be sequestered through improved farmpractices from a given piece of cultivated land ( Thamo et al., 2020 ). Topreserve accumulated SOC stock, the adoption of practice must be sus-tained; as the sequestration process is reversible, returning to the earlierpractice leads to the re-emission of CO 2(Thamo et al., 2020 ). Further,studies reported that about a decade is required for soil to respond toTable 5Economic valuation of carbon sequestration from sustainable agricultural practices in India (10 years).Practice Relative change inC stock(Mg C ha−1year−1)⁎⁎⁎C stock(CO 2eq Mg CO 2ha−1year−1)Value of C stock(US$ ha−1year−1)aN input to stabilizeC storage(Kg ha−1year−1)bN cost to stabilizeC storage(US$ ha−1year−1)cEconomic return(US$ ha−1year−1)Mean 95 % CIIntegrated nutrientmanagement0.71 0.53 to 0.89 2.61 224.07 110.24 9.62 214.45Organic amendment 0.94 0.63 to 1.26 3.46 297.15 146.19 12.76 284.39No-tillage 0.16 0.10 to 0.22 0.58 50.03 24.61 2.15 47.88Crop rotation 0.30 0.22 to 0.38 1.11 95.26 46.87 4.09 91.17Residue retention 0.32 0.26 to 0.38 1.16 99.84 49.12 4.29 95.56Intercropping 0.58 0.30 to 0.86 2.11 181.54 89.31 7.80 173.74Biochar 3.27 1.57 to 4.98 12.02 1033.34 508.38 44.38 988.96Note: CI: Con ﬁdence Intervals.⁎⁎⁎Indicate 1 % level of signi ﬁcance.aEstimated based on social cost of carbon US$ 86 Mg−1of CO 2.bEstimated by taking soil C: N ratio of 14:1 of arable lands.cEstimated by taking N cost of US$ 87.29 Mg−1of urea (46%N).K.K. T.M., S. Pal, P. Chand et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708705the changes in farming practices ( Brahma et al., 2018 ). In our study, theC sequestration potential of SAPs responded differently to the time pe-riod. It is observed that integrated nutrient management and organicamendment in ﬂuenced much higher C sequestration in long-term ex-periments. In contrast, no-tillage, residue retention, and intercroppingsigniﬁcantly in ﬂuenced SOC stocks under medium-term experiments.Conversely, short-term experiments had the highest effect on C seques-tration under crop rotation. Similar ﬁndings were reported by Das et al.(2021) andBai et al. (2019) . However, over time, the accumulation ofsoil carbon stocks will be limited ( Sommer and Bossio, 2014 ).4.3. In ﬂuence of agro-climatic factors on C sequestrationC sequestration potential of cropping systems responded differentlyunder SAPs and conventional practices. Among cropping systems, therelative gain in terms of C sequestration was higher in maize-wheat,soybean-wheat, and legume-based systems than in the rice-wheatsystem. The ability to ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen, the addition of large bio-mass below and above ground, and leaf shedding capacity were the pos-sible explanations for higher C sequestration ( Ganeshamurthy, 2009 ).In addition, moderately ﬁne-textured soils showed signi ﬁcantly higherC sequestration potential as these soil forms strong bonds in soils andfacilitate SOC accumulation ( Six et al., 2002 ). Further, the parameterestimate of the regression model shows that humid-subtropical areasfavor higher C sequestration than other regions as the rate of accumula-tion of SOC is more than the decomposition in humid conditions(Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000 ). Similarly, adequate precipitation is neededto promote the C sequestration process under SAPs, as suf ﬁcient mois-ture is crucial for microbial growth and regulation of the process ofdecomposition ( Lai et al., 2013 ). However, in highland agriculturalareas, factors viz., altitude, bulk density, and fertilizer (N&K) applicationwere reported as the signi ﬁcant drivers of C sequestration ( Arunratet al., 2020 ).4.4. Economic valuationSustainable agricultural practices have potential economic bene ﬁtsand can be regarded as economically feasible alternatives to improveC sequestration in the Indian agricultural landscape. This study esti-mated a positive net economic return of US$47.9 to 988.96 ha−1year−1from all the improved management practices ( Table 5 ).Graceet al. (2010) performed the economic feasibility of carbon sequestrationusing carbon supply curves and observed higher net economic return inno-tillage over conventional tillage. Similarly, Williams et al. (2004) in-dicated that the implementation of no-tillage practice resulted in highercarbon credit gain and estimated net return in the range of $8.62 to$64.65 Mg−1year−1. These results advocate that sustainable agricul-tural practices to enrich carbon sequestration and the value of carbonpreservation are technically feasible and economically pro ﬁtable. Incontrast, Lam et al. (2013) reported that improved farming practices,viz., no-tillage, crop residue retention, and pasture use, resulted in aneconomic loss of 8 to18 AU$ ha−1year−1during the ﬁrst decade ofimplementation.However, to make it more pro ﬁtable, changes in C sequestrationneed to be measured carefully at the farm level using the internationalcarbon offset standards ( Walcott et al., 2009 ). We also estimated thatall the improved crop management practices considered in thisstudy could potentially increase soil organic carbon stocks by 0.16 to3.27 Mg of C ha−1year−1in the Indian agricultural landscape. Regardingenvironmental bene ﬁts, the area under SAPs (excluding biochar) is esti-mated as 68.66 million ha ( Gupta et al., 2021 ) with a gain of 100.28 TgCO2e year−1from Indian agriculture. This is an optimistic estimate asit does not include the impact on methane and nitrous oxide emissionsby implementing these practices. Further, the amount of carbon seques-tration is based on climatic and environmental factors and ﬁeld-leveldata, which provide estimates that are more realistic.Our study also indicated that implementing improved cropmanagement practices could generate carbon credits worth US$2.97to 61.36 ha−1year−1in global voluntary carbon markets (Supplemen-taryﬁle, Table S3). Therefore, farmers are able to receive additionalreturns by selling sequestered carbon as carbon credits in the globalcarbon markets. Voluntary carbon markets (VCM) are dominated byprivate players and provide an opportunity to achieve voluntary climatetargets through carbon credits. These markets function outside the reg-ulated national and international carbon markets with internationalcarbon credit standards such as VERRA, Gold standard, and Americancarbon registry. The VCM is growing rapidly in the past few yearsand generated about 493 Million MtCO2e emission reduction worth$1.98 Billion in 2021 ( Donofrio et al., 2022 ). However, the carbon pricein these markets is highly volatile in the range of 5 to US$10, mainlydriven by market forces through demand and supply. Nevertheless,there is a huge potential in carbon markets that can be reaped byfarmers through the adoption of improved crop management practices.For instance, linking farmers with farmer-producer organizations couldhelp farmers to avail bene ﬁts from carbon credit markets.4.5. Limitations of the studyAccording to our knowledge, the compiled dataset is the largest forassessing the carbon sequestration potential of improved farming prac-tices in the Indian agricultural landscape. However, a few limitationsalso need to be considered while transforming the results of thisstudy. The ﬁrst limitation is that about 25 –30 % of the studies did notdirectly report the soil organic carbon stock. This is because the primeobjectives of these studies are intended to investigate other parameterssuch as yield and other properties. However, soil organic carbon con-centrations reported in these studies alone are not adequate to estimatecarbon sequestration potential. Another limitation is that most of thestudies did not report the standardized procedures employed to esti-mate the SOC concentration, which may hinder the potential bene ﬁts.Further, due to the lack of published on-farm data on soil organiccarbon, this study is entirely based on data reported from on-stationstudies. Therefore, suf ﬁcient data from the farmer's ﬁeld is necessaryfor a more realistic comparison. Another important limitation is due tothe lack of data, we have not considered the impacts of improved farm-ing practices on other GHG emissions. Further, valuation of soil carbonin monetary terms is a very complex process as it requires an in-depthunderstanding of carbon credit mechanism. Thus, variations in actualcarbon sequestration and economic gain from these practices maydiffer, as reported in this study.5. Conclusions and policy implicationsTo address the adverse impacts of climate change on agriculture,there is a need to develop sustainable production strategies consideringbiophysical and climatic factors. This national-level meta-analysisstudy has identi ﬁed various sustainable farming options for climatechange mitigation and adaptation. We found that improved crop man-agement practices lead to a 7.19 % to 41.29 % increase in soil organiccarbon stocks, indicating that implementing these practices has highercarbon sequestration potential in the Indian agricultural landscape.However, to reap the maximum C sequestration potential, SAPs shouldbe targeted in maize-wheat and legume-based cropping systems inhumid-subtropical regions and moderately ﬁne-textured soils. Findingsfrom this study also suggested that all SAPs considered enhancing Csequestration were economically pro ﬁtable and have the potential tocontribute to India's net zero emission by 2070 and climate target(creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 –3 billion Mg of CO 2eb y2030). However, an effective policy instrument is required to addressthe technological, economic, and sociocultural barriers to adoptingSAPs. Hence, efforts should be directed towards the promotion andoutscaling of SAPs by (i) Extending incentives for the generation ofK.K. T.M., S. Pal, P. Chand et al. Sustainable Production and Consumption 35 (2023) 697 –708706ecosystem services in the form of agri-environmental payments, (ii) In-vestment in agricultural R&D to improve agricultural productivity andlivelihood of smallholders, (iii) Strengthening technology transfer andextension services, (iv) by linking smallholders to carbon credit mar-kets, and (v) designing appropriate policy mix by including synergiesand trade-offs from improved management practices. Thus, carbon se-questration through improved agricultural management practices rep-resents a win-win strategy to improve livelihood while mitigatingclimate change impacts in the region.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancialinterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in ﬂu-ence the work reported in this paper.Appendix A.
