However, how fertilization management under corn‚Äìsoybeanrotation affects soil organic carbon and aggregate stability at different soil depths in Mollisols isunclear. The effects of 6‚Äìyr fertilization under corn‚Äìsoybean rotation on aggregate stability, soilorganic carbon content and storage, and size distribution in soil aggregates were investigated. Fivedifferent fertilization practices were carried out in 2013: corn and soybean without fertilizer; cornwith chemical fertilizer, soybean without fertilizer; corn with chemical fertilizer, soybean withoutfertilizer, returning the corn and soybean residues; corn and soybean with chemical fertilizer; andcorn with chemical fertilizer, soybean with farmyard manure. Compared with corn and soybeanwithout fertilizer, returning the corn and soybean residues increased bulk SOC content, and enhancedmean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter values at 0‚Äì10 cm because of increased water‚Äìstable aggregates (WSA) larger than 2 mm proportion and decreased WSA <0.053mm proportion.Simultaneously, corn with chemical fertilizer and soybean with farmyard manure increased bulk soilorganic carbon content but reduced mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter values at0‚Äì20 cm due to increased WSA <0.053mm proportion and decreased WSA >2mm proportion. Altogether,the application of consecutive returning crop residues and chemical fertilizer in alternate years isthe most favorable approach for soil organic carbon accumulation and aggregate stability at 0‚Äì10 cmunder corn‚Äìsoybean rotation in Mollisols.Keywords: crop residue return; manure; aggregate stability; soil organic carbon; Mollisols1. IntroductionCrop growth and development are heavily dependent on soil structure. Soil aggre-gates and their stability are regarded as indicators of soil structure, which is identiÔ¨Åed bymean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and fractal dimension(D) [ 1]. Aggregates are classiÔ¨Åed by particle size in the soil [ 2]. Different sizes of aggregates,especially macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) protect soil organic carbon (SOC) from decompos-ing and degrading [ 3]. As the binding agent and the kernel during the formation of soilaggregates, SOC content is usually related to the number of aggregates [ 2,4]. In addition,SOC is an indicator of soil fertility, which is an essential part of agricultural productionin bonding with soil physicochemical properties, for instance soil aeration, water content,and tillage [ 5]. Filho et al. conÔ¨Årmed that soil is less aggregated in the lower organicAgriculture 2022 ,12, 265. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12020265 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agricultureAgriculture 2022 ,12, 265 2 of 16carbon regions [ 6]. The amount of crop residue returned to the soil and the chemicalsubstances released from plants also inÔ¨Çuence the stability, rate of formation, and turnoverof aggregates [7,8].Crop rotation is used to attenuate the drawbacks of agricultural intensiÔ¨Åcation, as itcan increase soil carbon accumulation, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass, especiallywhen cover crops are included [ 9,10]. Corn‚Äìsoybean rotation has been found to promotecorn yield and economic proÔ¨Åt [ 11]. Increased soil available N and microbial diversity, butreduced N fertilizer requirements and crop disease incidence with corn‚Äìsoybean rotationcompared to continuous corn or soybean have also been found [ 12‚Äì14]. However, negativeimpacts have been reported, such as declines in soil C due to the reduced efÔ¨Åciency byplant residues retained as soil C [ 15], and reduced soil aggregate stability [ 16]. Fertilizationpractices also have impacts on soil aggregates. In the past decades, organic farminghas been recommended based on the merits of environment‚Äìfriendly and agriculture‚Äìsustainable [ 17]. Studies have shown that soils with the application of organic manuresillustrate a smaller bulk density, but larger water holding capacity, and greater organicmatter content [18,19]. In cultivated soils, adding manure often demonstrates a better soilphysical condition and a higher MWD value [ 20‚Äì22]. As a measure of increasing organicmatter input, crop residue return can relieve resource waste and increase inputs of organicC and other nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) [ 23‚Äì26].On average, straw returning increased SOC sequestration by 12.8% 0.4% and enhancedsoil macroaggregates [27].As one of the four continuous regions in Mollisols throughout the world, ChineseMollisols are distributed in Northeast China, which accounts for 11.9% of the world‚Äôstotal, with an area of 109 104km2[28]. The Mollisol region in Northeast China is thecountry‚Äôs ‚Äúbread basket‚Äù and ecological parclose due to its inherently fertile and higherorganic matter content ranging from 3‚Äì10% [ 29,30]. However, excessive reclamation andirrational farming management have caused SOC loss and soil erosion problems in theregion [ 31]. Countermeasures such as conservation tillage, crop rotation, and return oforganic materials have been developed to deal with the negative effects.Although soil aggregate stability and SOC in Mollisols have been extensively exam-ined by many researchers [ 32‚Äì34], information linking the two indicators and reÔ¨Åning themto different sized aggregates at various soil depths is limited. Our research attempts tocomprehend the impacts of different fertilization measures on SOC content/storage in bulksoils and different sized aggregates, and aggregate stability at different depths. We Ô¨Årst in-vestigate the SOC changes in Mollisols after 6‚Äìyr application of chemical fertilizer, manure,and crop residue return under corn‚Äìsoybean rotation, and then examine how these changesaffect the soil aggregates associated C content/storage, and the changes in soil aggregatestability. The outcome of the research will be of theoretical and practical signiÔ¨Åcance forenhancing soil quality and mechanisms involved between SOC and aggregate stability.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Experimental SiteThis study was carried out at the Hailun Station of Soil Erosion Monitoring andResearch, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences(126490E, 47210N) on a typical Mollisol of Northeast China. The site is under semi-humidcontinental monsoon climate conditions with an effective accumulated temperature of1030.7C, and the average annual rainfall and temperature are 553.9 and 2.4C, respectively.The thickness of topsoil is 30 cm, and the basic properties of soil fertility are described inTable 1. Soil pH was determined by a glass electrode pH meter using soil: water ratio of 1:5.The BD was measured using the ring knife method. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N(TN) were determined by elemental analyzer. Soil‚Äìavailable phosphorus was measured bythe sodium hydrogen carbonate solution‚ÄìMo‚ÄìSb anti‚Äìspectrophotometric method. Soilavailable potassium was determined by Ô¨Çame spectrophotometers after soil samples wereextracted with ammonium acetate.Agriculture 2022 ,12, 265 3 of 16Table 1.

Experimental Design and ManagementOur experimental plot was carried out in 2013 with a corn‚Äìsoybean rotation. Cornwas planted in the Ô¨Årst year, followed by soybean, and subsequent crops were plantedin the same order. The crops were sowed in early May and harvested in early Octobermanually. Each plot includes 12 rows with 9 m row long and 0.7 m inter‚Äìrow distance. Theplanting density was 250,000 ha 1for soybean and 48,000 ha 1for corn, according to thelocal farmers‚Äô sowing method.In total, Ô¨Åve different fertilization treatments were carried out. Each treatment includedthree replications with a completely random block arrangement. The area of each plot was9 m8.4 m.The Ô¨Åve fertilization treatments were:CNoF‚ÄìSNoF: Planting corn without fertilizer, then planting soybean without fertilizerin the next year.CCF‚ÄìSNoF: Planting corn with chemical fertilizer, then planting soybean withoutfertilizer in the next year.CCR‚ÄìSNoR: Planting corn with chemical fertilizer, returning the corn residues to theÔ¨Åeld after harvest, then planting soybean without fertilizer in the next year, but returningsoybean stalks to the Ô¨Åeld in middle October.CCF‚ÄìSCF: Planting corn with chemical fertilizer, and planting soybean with chemicalfertilizer in the next year.CCF‚ÄìSFYM: Planting corn with chemical fertilizer, and planting soybean with farmyardmanure in the next year.In the C CR‚ÄìSNoRtreatment, corn or soybean residues were cut into <3 cm pieces andthen ploughed into topsoil mechanically. Residues in other treatments were all removedafter harvest. Chemical fertilizer application standards refer to the regular fertilizer appli-cation of local farmers. Concretely, N, P , and K (pure N, P 2O5, and K 2O) fertilizers wereapplied to soybean at 50, 30, and 21 kg ha 1. Next year, N, P , and K fertilizers were appliedto corn at 61.5, 30, and 21 kg ha 1as basal fertilizer. An additional 193.5 kg N ha 1wasapplied to corn during the jointing period as topdressing fertilizer. The types of fertilizerswere urea, diammonium phosphate, and potassium sulfate. The basal fertilizer was appliedmanually to 20‚Äì25 cm soil depth, while the topdressing fertilizer was applied manually to10 cm soil depth. In the C CF‚ÄìSFYM treatment, naturally decomposed manure in the amountof 15,000 kg ha 1was applied into the 30 cm topsoil by mixing with chemical fertilizer me-chanically in middle October when the crops were harvested. The average composition ofmanure is C with 454 g kg 1, N with 20.7 g kg 1, P with 7.93 g kg 1and K with 11.8 g kg 1on a dry weight basis [ 35]. The soybean [ Glycine max (Merrill.) L.] and corn ( Zea mays L.)varieties planted were Dongsheng No.1 (mature period 98 days, medium‚Äìearly maturingvariety) and Xingken No.5 (mature period 110‚Äì113 days, medium‚Äìearly maturing variety),respectively. The abamectin and ethazine butyl ester, each with 0.75 kg ha 1were appliedmanually, and a mechanical tillage operation was implemented.2.3. Soil CollectingSoil samples were collected in early Oct. 2018 after soybean was harvested, undis-turbed soil samples of 0‚Äì10 cm, 10‚Äì20 cm, and 20‚Äì30 cm were sampled by containers sizedat 20 cm30 cm30 cm to determine the size distribution of soil water‚Äìstable aggregates(WSA). In each plot, three sample points were diagonally selected, and samples at thesame depth were mixed together. A 100 cm3volume and 5.046 cm diameter ring knifeAgriculture 2022 ,12, 265 4 of 16were applied at the same sampling points and depths for calculating bulk density andSOC content.2.4. Laboratory MethodAbout 50 g of soil sample was taken and weighed, then dried at 105 2C to constantweight. Soil moisture content was calculated by Equation (1):SMC =(M1 M2)/M2 (1)SMC is soil moisture content; M1and M 2represent wet and dried soil weight, respectively .Ring knives with soil were dried at 105 2C to a constant weight, denoted as M0measured by a scale. The bulk density ( BD) values were calculated via the followingEquation (2):BD=M0 MR/V (2)BDis the value of bulk density, MRis the weight of ring knife, and Vis the volume ofring knife.Wet sieving was used to determine the distribution of water‚Äìstable aggregates (WSA).The size distribution of WSA was measured by the soil aggregates analyzer (TPF‚Äì100,Tuopuyunnong, Hangzhou, China). The detailed manipulations were as follows: 50 gsoil samples were air‚Äìdried for 24 h and evenly distributed over the nested sieve surfacesthrough a series of three sieves (2 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.053 mm) to isolate four aggregatesize fractions. The four aggregate sizes with >2 mm, 0.25‚Äì2 mm, 0.053‚Äì0.25 mm, and<0.053 mm refer to larger macro‚Äìaggregates, smaller macro‚Äìaggregates, micro‚Äìaggregates,and silt + clay fractions, respectively. The nest was set at the highest point when theoscillation cylinders were Ô¨Ålled with distilled water. To slake the air‚Äìdried soil, 1 L ofdistilled water was rapidly added to each cylinder until the soil sample and top screen werecovered with water. The soils were submerged in water for 10 min before the wet‚Äìsievingaction. The oscillation time, stroke length, and frequency were 10 min, 4 cm vertical, and30 cycle min 1, respectively [ 36]. Finally, the soils remaining on each sieve were collectedby Petri dish weighting M1, then drying them at 60‚Äì80C and weighting M2.The mass of each size aggregate ( M) was computed by Equation (3). The size distri-bution of the WSA was based on the M. The proportion of each aggregate size ( Pi) wascomputed by Equation (4).Mi=M2 M1 (3)Pi=Mi/50100% (4)TheMWD ,GMD , and Dwere calculated by Equations (5), (6), and (7), respectively.MWD =n√•i=1(XiPi) (5)GMD =exp((n√•i=1PilgXi)/(n√•i=1Pi))(6)(3 D)lgXi/Xmax	=lgnW(dXi)/Wo(7)Xiindicates the mean diameter of each size (mm), calculated by the average value ofmax and min diameter of each sized aggregates; Xmaxis the diameter of soils on the sieve of2 mm aperture size before wet sieving, which is 10 mm. W(dXi)is the sum of soil weights(sizeXi).Since the inorganic carbon in Mollisols is negligible [ 37], the total soil carbon mea-sured by the elemental analyzer (FlashEA 1112, ThermoÔ¨Ånnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) isapproximately equal to the soil organic carbon; in the following text, it appears in the formAgriculture 2022 ,12, 265 5 of 16of soil organic carbon (SOC). Before measuring SOC by elemental analyzer, soil sampleswere ground and passed through a 0.25 mm sieve.TheSOC storage was calculated by Equation (8).Si=MiSOC iBDH10 1(8)As to this equation, Simeans the SOC storage of i‚Äìsize aggregates (Mg ha 1),Miisthe mass fraction, while the SOC iofi‚Äìsize aggregates. The BDis the corresponding bulkdensity (gcm 3). H is the soil thickness, whose value is 10 cm in this study.2.5. Statistical AnalysisThe original values and statistical analysis were carried out by Excel 2019 and SPSS 24,respectively. All graphs were drawn using Sigma Plot 12.5. Tukey‚Äôs HSD test at the p< 0.05level ( n= 3) was applied to determine the signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the treatmentswith one‚Äìway variance analysis. The correlations among the measured parameters weredetermined through linear regression analysis.3. Results3.1. Size Distribution of Water‚ÄìStable AggregatesIn general, regardless of fertilization regimes and soil depths, higher proportionsof WSA were found in WSA 0.25‚Äì2mm , ranging from 30‚Äì40% (Table 2). Among the Ô¨Åvefertilization practices, the highest and lowest proportion of WSA sizes did show a differenttendency in the three soil depths.Table 2.

Correlations among Each Measured Soil ParameterThe linear regression models among measured parameters by stepwise regressionanalysis are listed in Table 6. The MWD was positively correlated with WSA >2mm pro-portion (Equation (9); R2= 0.855, p= 0) and SOC storage in WSA >2mm (Equation (10);R2= 0.848 ,p= 0). Similarly, a signiÔ¨Åcant and positive correlation was found between GMDand WSA >2mm proportion (Equation (11); R2= 0.814, p= 0). Meanwhile, the GMD valuewas positively correlated with SOC storage in WSA >2mm but was negatively correlated toSOC storage of WSA <0.053mm (Equation (12); R2= 0.848, p= 0.027). Additionally, signiÔ¨Åcantand negative correlations were obtained between the D value and WSA >2mm proportion(Equation (13); R2= 0.744, p= 0), and between the D value and SOC storage in WSA >2mmproportion (Equation (14); R2= 0.790, p= 0.002). However, the D value was positively cor-related with the WSA <0.053mm proportion (Equation (13)) and SOC storage in WSA <0.053mmproportion (Equation (14)).

DiscussionSoil aggregate stability is a vital index for evaluating soil quality [ 38]. The aggregatesized with >0.25 mm plays a crucial part in sustaining the stability of soil structure and isconsidered the best structure of the soil [ 23]. For the Ô¨Åve treatments in the present study, wefound that 0.25‚Äì2 mm sized aggregates exhibited the biggest proportions, which indicatesthat Mollisols have more smaller macro‚Äìaggregates as its ideal structure.MWD, GMD, and D values are all parameters of soil aggregate stability. The greaterMWD and GMD values, and the smaller D value mean the stronger stability of soil struc-ture [ 39]. In our experiment, the signiÔ¨Åcantly positive correlation between MWD/GMDand the WSA >2mm proportion, and between D and the WSA <0.053mm proportion, as well asthe signiÔ¨Åcantly negative relationship between D and the WSA >2mm proportion all demon-strated that macroaggregates (>2 mm) and silt + clay (<0.053 mm) fractions contributedthe most to the stability of soil aggregates. This association might be due to macroaggre-gates developed by surrounding new inputs of organic carbon as an additional sourcefor microbial activity, thus promoting the formation of aggregate binders, resulting in alarger value of MWD and GMD [ 40]. Additionally, the relationship of strong linearitybetween MWD/GMD and SOC storage in WSA >2mm suggested that SOC storage in theWSA >2mm exhibited a vital part in soil aggregate stability. However, Das et al. believedthat MWD as one of the soil aggregate stability indicators was related to SOC content [ 41].The discrepancy might be because of the different soil type, substrate type, and the naturalconditions of experimental site and so on.The current research indicated that crop residue return increased soil aggregate sta-bility at 0‚Äì10 cm soil depth, but manure addition decreased it at 0‚Äì20 cm soil depth. Theincreased soil aggregate stability under crop residues at 0‚Äì10 cm compared to continuousAgriculture 2022 ,12, 265 13 of 16chemical fertilizer application could be due to the increment proportion of WSA >2mm andthe decrement proportion of WSA <0.053mm at 0‚Äì10 cm soil depth in the current research. Incomparison to continuous chemical fertilized crops, improved crop growth [ 42] by incorpo-ration of crop residues and chemical fertilizer enhanced the return of organic matter, thusraising SOC content, which is the main binding agent of aggregates, leading microaggre-gates combined into macroaggregates [ 43]. In addition to improving crop growth causinga range of effects on macroaggregates, the carbohydrates produced during the humiÔ¨Åca-tion process after crop residues strengthen soil microbial activity and promote plant rootvigor and humus formation, which has a profound positive impact on the formation ofmacroaggregates, and thus larger values of MWD and GMD (Figure 2) [26,44].The decreased soil aggregate stability under manure addition at 0‚Äì20 cm comparedto continuous chemical fertilizer application could be due to the increment proportion ofWSA <0.053mm and the decrement proportion of WSA >2mm in the present research. Silt +clay fraction (WSA <0.053mm ) proportion was crucial determinants of water stable aggrega-tion [ 45,46]. Accordingly, higher silt + clay concentration aggregates are less susceptibleto destructive forces than lower silt + clay concentration ones [ 47,48]. In addition, theincreased moisture content in the current research promoted microbial activity, whichenhanced the breakdown of macroaggregates [ 49,50]. The negative correlation between soilmoisture content and aggregate stability was because soil minerals swell unevenly whenwet, which induces aggregate cracking [ 51,52]. Therefore, increasing drainage should beconsidered to solve this problem under corn‚Äìsoybean rotation in Mollisols.SOC content is an important parameter that affects soil physical properties. In ourstudy, the 6‚Äìyr application of manure and crop residues both raised the SOC contentcompared to chemical fertilizer application at 0‚Äì20 cm. The order of SOC content wasmanure addition > crop residue return. It is obvious that crop residue return and manureapplication are organic carbon inputs themselves. In addition, crop residue return canimprove C content by modulating C‚Äìrelated microbial abundance. Manure usually has ahigh SOC sequestration efÔ¨Åciency [ 53]. The meta‚Äìanalysis of 95 studies showed that cropresidue return signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the SOC content of Chinese farmland by an averageof 13.97% [ 54]. They further proposed that the increased SOC by crop residue return wouldbe less pronounced in the region with a mean annual temperature < 10C or initial SOCcontent greater than 10 g kg 1. The mean annual temperature in our experiment site is2.4C, and the SOC content only increased by 6.23%. Low temperature reduces the activityof straw‚Äìdegrading microorganisms [ 55,56]. The application of manure elevated SOCcontent at different rates, and the limitations of other factors were not obvious [ 21,57,58].Thus, the 6‚Äìyr application of manure is the best way to enhance SOC content in ChineseMollisols, while crop residues returning follows behind.5. ConclusionsWe investigated 6‚Äìyr different fertilization practices on aggregate size distribution,SOC content, and storage within soil aggregates and bulk soil of Mollisols under corn‚Äìsoybean rotation. Compared with consecutive application of chemical fertilizer alone,annual alternate application of manure and chemical fertilizer increased bulk SOC by13.4%, but reduced MWD and GMD values by 37.4% and 22.4% at 0‚Äì20 cm. Simultaneously,the combined application of consecutive returning crop residues and chemical fertilizer inalternate years increased bulk SOC by 6.23% at 0‚Äì20 cm, and increased MWD and GMDvalues by 32.7% and 17.2% at 0‚Äì10 cm. No signiÔ¨Åcant differences were presented for MWDvalues among the Ô¨Åve treatments at 20‚Äì30 cm soil depth.
