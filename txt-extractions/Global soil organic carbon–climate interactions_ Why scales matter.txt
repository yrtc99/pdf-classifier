WOAInstitution: University of Koblenz-Landau; Blended DEAL: Projekt DEAL.Edited by: Mike Hulme, Editor-in-ChiefAbstractSoil organic carbon (SOC) holds the large st terrestrial carbon stock because ofsoil conditions and processes that favor s oil carbon persistence. Vulnerable toclimate change, SOC may cross a tipping point toward liberating carbon-basedgreenhouse gases, implying massive self -amplifying SOC- climate interactions.Estimates of SOC persistence are challenging as we still lack broad mechanisticinsights. Upscaling mechanistic details from small to larger scales is challengingbecause the driving factors are not available at the needed resolution. Downscal-ing is problematic as many modeling studies point to the highest uncertaintiesderiving from the SOC response to climate change, while models themselveshave difficulties in replicating contemporary soil properties and dynamics. Tobridge the problems of scaling, strict process orientation seems adequate.Holdridge Life Zones (HLZ) classification, as one example, is a climate classifica-tion framework at a mesoscale that provides a descriptive approach to facilitatethe identification of potential hotspots an d coldspots of SOC-climate interaction.Establishing coordinated experiments across all HLZ, but also including multipleglobal change drivers, has the potential t o advance our understanding of generalprinciples regulating SOC-climate interaction and SOC persistence. Therefore,regionally tailored solutions for both e xperiments and modeling are urgentlyneeded and can lead to better management of soil and the ecosystem servicesprovided. Improving “translations ”from the scales relevant for process under-standing to the scales of decision-making is key to good management and to pre-dict the fate of our largest terrestrial carbon stock.This article is categorized under:Integrated Assessment of Climate Change > Integrated ScenarioDevelopmentKEYWORDScritical mesoscale, ESM, regional perspectives, soil carbon persistenceReceived: 4 May 2020 Revised: 17 March 2022 Accepted: 28 March 2022DOI: 10.1002/wcc.780This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, providedthe original work is properly cited.© 2022 The Authors.

In terms of climate change mitigation, if this SOC is destabilized and liberatedas carbon-based greenhouse gases (GHG), it would easily induce massive self-amplifying SOC –climate interactions. Thehuge amount of SOC (1700 Pg =1015g) is the result of an imbalance of soils receiving more carbon than they return tothe atmosphere (Figure 1). The latter is not in a steady-state, but the result of highly dynamic equilibria of interactionsmainly between the atmosphere, plants, and soils, which can be directionally tipped by human interventions. The mostprominent component of the carbon cycle is photosynthesis, the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) to car-bohydrates, which are temporarily held as biomass. These carbohydrates eventually return to the atmosphere as CO 2ormethane (CH 4) by autotrophic respiration or decay processes in soils. However, once carbohydrates enter the soil sys-tem, and myriads of pathways are possible, the chance that they will persist increases because decay processes in soilscan be delayed in multiple ways (Kleber et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011). Therefore, processes that determine SOC per-sistence (Box 1) contribute to the buildup of global SOC, and consequently are key to understanding and predictingSOC–climate interactions under present and future climate. Actually, SOC persistence has received increased attention(Amundson, 2022; Chen et al., 2021; Heckman et al., 2022; Lehmann et al., 2020), as it controls both carbon sequestra-tion and release, and therefore, human societies have great interests in taking advantage of the resulting ecosystemservices.In the undisturbed global carbon cycle, SOC persistence makes soil systems carbon sinks and helps to regulateglobal climate. However, SOC is susceptible to climate change, although susceptibility is not homogeneous across theglobe because SOC differs in chemical composition, more importantly in the way it is protected from microbial access(Lehmann et al.,2020; Schmidt et al., 2011; Woolf & Lehmann, 2019). Consequently, the heterogeneity of SOC (summa-rized by Heckman et al., 2022) and the scale at which we interpret this heterogeneity have to be addressed. Both thedegree and the relationship to environmental factors of SOC persistence vary across the globe (Heckman et al., 2022),which suggests taking a regional approach to efforts of SOC protection or C sequestration. Soil carbon persistenceshows tight relationships to temperature and water balance, which are used as main drivers in Earth system modelsFIGURE 1 The contemporary (2010 –2019) global carbon budget —simplified sketch strictly on CO 2exchanges and based onCanadell et al.

Relevant details of processes determin-ing SOC persistence are yet to be understood, and therefore are among the greatest challenges in climate change science(Lal et al., 2007; Lehmann et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2011; Trumbore, 1997). Time to fully understand earth systemcomplexities, however, is not on our side if we want to manage human influence on the earth's climate system. If weremain on our present course, we risk degrading soil carbon persistence and creating a self-amplification of globalwarming due to SOC-climate interactions.BOX 1 Revised understanding of SOC persistenceOur understanding of organic matter in soil was dominated by the idea that carbon entering the soil formsproducts with “recalcitrant ”characteristics. This “humification ”process was presumed to transform biomasscarbon into persistent SOC and has been the basis for our understanding of stable SOC for more than 200 years.More recently, organic matter in soil was described as a “continuous flow of C-atoms ”(Agren & Bosatta,1996;Janzen, 2006; Lehmann & Kleber, 2015), emphasizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of SOC, rather thandescribing it as a distinct chemical category. Subsequently, a new consolidated view of stabilized SOC wasdeveloped, integrating the adsorption and desorption to and from mineral surfaces to form mineral associatedorganic matter (MAOM) and the formation and destruction of aggregates as a continuous process of organicmatter formation and stabilization (Kleber et al.,2015,2021; Lavallee et al., 2020). Next to mineral associations,the concept of priming (Kuzyakov et al., 2000; Siles et al., 2022), the impact of roots (Dijkstra et al., 2021; Rasseet al., 2005), better integration of the soil structure (Fatichi et al., 2020; Guhra et al., 2022; Vogel et al., 2022)and variations in soil moisture forming gradients of oxygen availability (Huang et al., 2021; Keiluweitet al., 2017) advanced our understanding of SOC persistence. The new, consolidated view considers knowledgegains regarding soil functional complexity like “molecular diversity, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal vari-ability ”from small to large scales as fundamental in protecting vital soils for ecosystem functioning, predictingSOC persistence under climate change, and recommending management practices sustaining soil fertility(Dungait et al.,2012; Kleber et al., 2011; Lehmann et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2011). Yet, science-based defini-tions of persistent SOC and political interest of SOC permanence do not align, and resolving definitions used todescribe the lifespan of SOC and carbon sequestration activities requires a common language in scientific andpolicy sectors (Baveye et al.,2020; Dynarski et al., 2020; Smith, 2005).BOX 2 Earth system modelsMechanistic models incorporate mathematical process understanding and are used to calculate possible reac-tions of a system to changes in the driving conditions. In climate change science, earth system models (ESMs)are applied to assess the reactions of the whole earth system as well as its respective subsystems to potential cli-mate changes (GHG concentrations, temperature, precipitation). Commonly, ESMs are composed of multiplesubmodels, of which some can be regarded as individual models if they can operate independently. For estimat-ing the SOC changes, the latest developments of ESM use advanced soil biogeochemical sub-models, where soilC formation and decomposition rates are influenced by clay content, pH, differing turnover times of carbonpools, and SOC pool size. Other ESMs are less well prepared to reduce the high uncertainties associated withestimating the feedback of SOC to climate change. Haaf et al. (2021) and Song et al. ( 2019) noted the limitationsof transferability between experimental and mechanistic knowledge on soil processes across geo-climatic zones.ESMs will most likely have to be regionally tailored to each geo-climatic zone in order to improve the globalpicture supported by modeling of SOC –climate interactions. One other major source of uncertainty is theappropriate spatial resolution of needed input variables of certain soil properties, which are not detectable withremote-sensing techniques. Provided that these data gaps can be filled, we will need to broaden our processunderstanding from areas outside China, Europe, and North America when forecasting future terrestrialcarbon-climate feedback (Song et al.,2019).JUNGKUNST ET AL . 3o f1 7 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseGlobal SOC-climate interactions are driven by planetary-atmospheric processes and governed by SOC persistence atvery detailed scales down to soil aggregates and molecules. Hence, we face an intrinsic scaling challenge to unveilingthe mechanisms of SOC –climate interactions. It is of utmost importance to understand if, when, and how climatechange will alter SOC retention and foresee when soils will release more carbon to the atmosphere than they receive. Itis this potential self-amplification between soil and atmosphere that poses a Pandora's Box scenario (Amundson,2022)because not only the soils but also the whole earth system would then cross a tipping point toward a new stage (Lentonet al., 2019; Steffen et al., 2018). Recent ESMs, designed to simulate process complexity and spatial heterogeneity, pre-dict that soils will maintain their function as carbon sinks at the global scale at least until 2100 (IPCC, 2019; Itoet al., 2020; Todd-Brown et al., 2013), giving hope like in the Pandora's Box mythology. These data, however, point to ahigh uncertainty related to SOC persistence. Therefore, the tremendous importance of SOC persistence is widely identi-fied and accepted as the key knowledge gap to improving our scientific understanding (Dynarski et al., 2020; Lehmannet al., 2020; Lehmann & Kleber, 2015; Schmidt et al., 2011). So, it all boils down to improving our understanding ofSOC persistence under varying climatic conditions across different scales.Preventing the earth system from crossing this tipping point requires human actions. The most straightforwardway, albeit difficult in practice, remains reducing carbon emissions (Schlesinger & Amundson, 2019). As important asprotecting the existing SOC stocks is, it is tempting to overly promote the atmospheric CO 2sequestration potential ofagricultural soils by improved soil management in order to regain its preindustrial values. Carbon sequestration is oftenused to describe human activities aimed at the removal of atmospheric carbon. However, it may be more appropriate tothink of it as a longer-termed transfer of atmospheric CO2to soils, or other parts of the global carbon budget(Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Lal, 2008). Since the onset of agriculture, an estimated 115 –154 Pg of SOC (Lal et al., 2018;Sanderman et al., 2017) has been lost through land-use change, but it is estimated that the sink capacity of agriculturaland degraded soils might be only 50% –66% of the historic-C loss (Lal, 2004; Stockmann et al., 2013). Still, parts of soci-ety have focused on implementing management practices, such as the 4p1000 initiative that aims at atmospheric Csequestrations in agricultural soils at rates of 4 ‰(0.4%) per year (Chenu et al., 2019; Minasny et al., 2017; Rumpelet al., 2020). It will have positive effects and could stem the expected additional losses of SOC by agriculture, but itappears naive to consider it the only option. Evidence is pending that agricultural soils can store carbon at a rate that iscomparable to the current emissions. Furthermore, despite good intentions, we run the risk of releasing more carbonfrom the soil if we enact misguided conservation programs without understanding the large global scale variation ofunderlying processes. SOC sequestration potentials vary regionally and, for example, have higher “costs ”in water-limited and hot areas compared with cool, moist zones (Chenu et al.,2019). The underlying processes that explain thespatial distribution of SOC stocks and SOC persistence need to be accounted for to develop regionally tailored soil man-agement optimization. Consequently, we need concepts and models that account for regionally specific soil carbon per-sistence. Here we run into the scale dilemma. Processes that govern soil persistence are much finer than those scales ofdecision-making, which is taking place at scales finer than the processes in the climate system. To best supportdecision-making, translations are needed that meet in a critical mesoscale.With this review, we aim to provide a summary of the current challenges in translating insights into SOC –climateinteraction obtained from different scales. The scales most relevant for decision-making lie between the fine scales rele-vant for process understanding of SOC cycling and the coarse scales relevant to understand climate change. We high-light the advantages that intermediate mesoscales provide by taking advantage of the benefits of each scale withoutadopting too many of the individual drawbacks. These “sweet spots ”differ with the questions raised and have yet to beprecisely identified. Process orientation should guide us to finding the best individual mesoscale, which includesregional variations that may provide outcomes deviating from global gradients (Doetterl et al.,2015; Gonz /C19alez-Domínguez et al., 2019; Sanderman et al., 2017). Yet, dominant factors of SOC turnover and SOC persistence are relatedto temperature and water (oxygen) availability (Conant et al., 2011; Davidson & Janssens, 2006; Doetterl et al., 2015;Keiluweit et al., 2017), producing strong relationships between SOC stocks and climate zones (Batjes, 2014; Beillouinet al., 2022; Ciais et al., 2014; Heckman et al., 2022; Kramer & Chadwick, 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2018). Therefore, dis-aggregating the global scale into mesoscalic climate zones was the best first step toward finding the sweet spot for“translating ”SOC–climate interaction. Beyond climate, SOC persistence is determined by the interplay of organic mat-ter and soil minerals forming mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) (Grant et al.,2022; Hemingway et al., 2019;Kleber et al., 2021; Mikutta et al., 2006). Therefore, the next step of disaggregating the global scale, or aggregating fromdetailed- to meso-scale, most likely seems to be applying soil properties like clay content or pH values, but the availabil-ity of these at reasonable resolution will always be limited. Additionally, recent literature indicates systematic variationsin the importance of individual mineral or microbial relations with climate (Chen et al.,2021; Haaf et al., 2021; Hall4o f1 7 JUNGKUNST ET AL . 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

Therefore, it seems very timelyto identify overarching soil proxies for fine-tuning individual climatic zone, which justifies sticking to a climate-drivendisaggregation. Incorporating both climatic and soil factors will be necessary to enable regionally tailored approaches,where separate trajectories must be identified to improve understanding and implementation of SOC –climate interac-tions across the entire range of scales. By adopting a regionalization approach to better understand climate changeimpacts on SOC persistence, we bridge the gap between process understanding and potential management actions, aswell as tie in global modeling approaches.2|WHICH SCALE TO CHOOSE TO BEST ADDRESS GLOBAL SOC-CLIMATEINTERACTIONS?According to O'Rourke et al. ( 2015), top-down approaches (from global to local) are necessary to isolate effects of cli-mate change on SOC, while bottom-up approaches (from local to global) are necessary to integrate the smallest-scaledSOC–climate dynamics. Concepts are needed that bring the large- and the small-scale processes together. Experimen-tally, SOC persistence is determined at the molecular, mineral, or aggregate scale to gain a bottom-up understanding ofprocesses. Consequently, the key challenge to gaining a global overview of SOC –climate interactions is to identify thescale that best reflects the underlying processes without getting lost in details less relevant at the transnational, global,or earth system scales. Tradeoffs always exist when deciding which scale is best suited for understanding a given system(Levin,1992). We need to account for these tradeoffs and find the best individual scale, where the components of vari-ability and complexity that affect the processes of interest are highest compared with those that are just noise (Burt &Pinay,2005). However, interests usually differ when it comes to interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. The over-lapping areas of interest then have to be defined by developing common questions, which also requires a common lan-guage. Burt and Pinay ( 2005) originally coined the term “problematic ”mesoscales to describe this overlap. We will callthis overlapping area of interest the critical mesoscale or the sweet spot. This scale reflects the level of interests, andtherefore scales, that are most relevant for people acting on the science as well as primary stakeholders and politicaldecision-makers (Figure2).The reason for the high scientific interest in safeguarding SOC is that it is considered the most important knowledgegap in global SOC –climate interactions (Lehmann et al., 2020). The scales at which SOC persistence is experimentallyFIGURE 2 Categorical scales used to describe SOC –climate interaction ranging from detailed scales at the molecular, mineral, oraggregate level of soils to the transnational, global scales to the earth system level. Data produced at specific scales serve different purposes,for example, data from the detailed scale is obtained from scientists that work experimentally to gain process understanding. These data canbe used to produce interpolated maps from modeling scientists. Stakeholders and politicians work at the critical scale in between as they(1) require the knowledge of small-scaled data and (2) base the decision-making on projected model outputs. As we still lack the theoreticalframework to bridge the gap between the detailed scales and the global scales, we call the intermediate scales the critical mesoscales that —depending on the addressed need —are variableJUNGKUNST ET AL . 5o f1 7 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licensedetermined are smaller (processes between molecules and up to soil horizons) than the scales of interest of mostdecision-makers. For example, a farmer would be mainly interested in spatial scales from field to farm, whereas a politi-cian may be more interested in the scale from community to state/nation. Therefore, various authors highlight the needto improve our “translations ”from the scales relevant for process understanding to the scales of interest and decision-making (Amelung et al.,2020; Lehmann et al., 2020; O'Rourke et al., 2015). This goal is best achieved by developingmutual hypotheses that, when addressed, help to define the critical mesoscale and the sweet spot that in turn results inthe best possible individual governance –science symbiosis. In contrast, scales of continental to planetary size have lowresolution, containing few details, and most interpolations are beyond the scales relevant for most decision-making.However, to understand climate change and the processes driving the climate system, continental to global scalesrequire consideration because they predict climate change and therefore affect all other scales by, for example, influenc-ing political decisions and directions of established experiments to study SOC –climate interactions.3|LIMITATIONS OF SCALING: FROM SMALL TO LARGE AND FROMLARGE TO SMALLBoth up- and downscaling have associated shortcomings (Anderson et al., 2003). Therefore, it is important to knowhow and at what scale data were gathered to get an idea of the associated uncertainty. For example, global soil mapsappear very detailed and complete (Figure4a). However, all information gathered about soils that feeds into modelsderives from the detailed scales of pits and augurs. These represent an extremely small area because they are usuallylimited to a few cm2to m2multiplied by the number of samples taken per site. Independent of the scale, this localizeddatum of SOC information always has to be extrapolated and extended to the spatial area of interest. Given that thesampling points are not evenly distributed globally, for example, lacking data in Northern Africa, Greenland, and largeparts of the Asian continent (Figure 4b), the global SOC map mirrors an accuracy that may not be realistic. Therefore,important regions for SOC –climate interactions like Siberia are not well represented compared with North Americaand Europe, and even these are not displayed at a grid size that the ESM uses. SOC content and stocks vary largely atany scale, which introduces inherent uncertainties (Chen et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2020). According to Smithet al. ( 2020), these difficulties in measuring content and changes of SOC create fundamental problems for SOC seques-tration programs, which happen within the critical mesoscale.Data gaps will always need to be filled because of the uneven distribution of soil data (see, e.g., Doetterl et al. ( 2021))Both interpolation and gap-filling procedures are done with expert knowledge and transfer functions and carry randomerror. The most common way to interpolate is to select a regular grid size, that is, resolution (pixel) of the image chosento show the landscape, state, nation, or globe. Usually, the grid size is not chosen randomly but rather determined bythe resolution at which models use that information or are validated by it. Hence, the area of interest for the interpola-tion of the soil data is defined by the grid (pixel) size chosen and not by the underlying process knowledge. For exam-ple, for the world map of SOC stocks (Fischer et al.,2008), a resolution of about 1 km2(30 arc seconds by 30 arcseconds) is selected to fit many global modeling approaches. Therefore, a map depicting the global SOC distributionconveys a rather fine resolution, even scaled up to the resolution of Community Land Model (CLM) grid cells (0.05degrees by 0.05 degrees) (Wieder,2014), which is used in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) (Figure 4a). Thedistribution of data sources (harmonized soil parameters as of 2020) demonstrates the uneven distribution of informa-tion (Figure 4b) (Batjes et al., 2017), which highlights the geographic bias. Another layer of complexity relates to thedepth for which SOC stocks are considered. Since deeper soil is increasingly recognized to be important in SOC –climateinteractions (Rumpel & Kögel-Knabner, 2011), considering SOC to a depth of 1 m instead of 30 cm has been proposed(Lal, 2018; Rumpel & Kögel-Knabner, 2011).An alternative to using regular grid sizes for interpolation is to apply irregularly sized polygons, whose boundariesare set by well-defined ranges of the main factors that drive the processes of interest. An example would be Hydrologi-cal Response Units that are mainly defined by topography and used successfully in Soil and Water Assessment ToolModels (e.g., Kalcic et al. (2015)). The range and the number of driving factors are adjustable to the scale of interest.Based on the strong dependence of SOC distribution on temperature and precipitation, they should be primarily usedto define the boundaries of the polygons in which SOC is scaled up. Climate zones (polygons) of climate classificationsystems are defined by differences in temperature and simplified water budgets (precipitation as input and potentialevapotranspiration as output). Consequently, climate zone polygons of various sizes should be used for regionalizingthe SOC distribution. Including soil properties (Rasmussen et al.,2018) or pedogenetic soil group classification (Kögel-6o f1 7 JUNGKUNST ET AL . 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseKnabner & Amelung, 2021) in SOC descriptions is a great step forward, and integration of these could improve the defi-nition of the shape of polygons tremendously. Since global soil data are not yet available in a density needed to justifyfine resolution, regional patterns rely on fairly coarse resolutions. In addition, process knowledge required for classifica-tion is not yet fully unraveled. To guide real management options within the critical mesoscale, finer and climate-independent polygons referring to soil properties, like clay content and beyond (Rasmussen et al.,2018) are needed.Similarly, the required global soil type data are not available —we are thus left to rely on interpolated information,which portends to give higher resolution in the data than actually exists.In a nutshell, process-oriented polygons could provide scientific-based interpolation in contrast to regular homoge-nized grids. In a first hierarchical step, we suggest these boundaries to be strictly set by temperature and water balanceas primary drivers of SOC (Chen et al., 2021; Davidson & Janssens, 2006; Shi et al., 2020). However, integrating pedo-genic controls, like mineral-associated organic matter content (Kleber et al., 2021; Kramer & Chadwick, 2018; Lavalleeet al., 2020), could greatly improve predictions of SOC persistence, which is well summarized by Rasmussen et al. ( 2018).Several studies present that SOC and mineral interactions vary with climate (Hall et al., 2020; Kramer &Chadwick, 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2018). Crowther et al. ( 2019) additionally emphasize that it is not only the abioticenvironment but also organisms that drive the persistence of SOC, suggesting the inclusion of the functional diversityof soil organisms to identify general global patterns. Recently it has been shown that pedogenic controls vary systemati-cally with climate (temperature and water balance) (Heckman et al.,2022; Kramer & Chadwick, 2018). Accordingly, itis of utmost importance to identify the climate classification that best fits the polygons to the drivers of SOC distribu-tion. It is clear that these polygons (climate classes) should be fine rather than coarse, and strictly defined by tempera-ture and water balance.4|CLIMATE CLASSIFICATION AS CRI TICAL MESOSCALE TO IDENTIFYGLOBAL SOC –CLIMATE INTERACTIONSHoldridge Life Zones (HLZ) (Holdridge, 1947; Holdridge, 1964) proved to be a highly suitable polygon-based system fordemonstrating process-oriented regional SOC distribution across the globe (Jungkunst et al., 2021; Post et al., 1982)(Figure 3). Already 40 years ago, Post et al. ( 1982) argued it to be “important to establish the relationships between thegeographical distribution of SOC and climate as a basis for assessing the influence of changes. ”Following studies haverecognized the importance of understanding the SOC dynamics and being able to link these with larger global-scalemodeling approaches, and have also taken a regionalization approach, but this means generally looking at smaller,landscape, or even national scales (Anderson et al.,2003; Doetterl et al., 2015; Slessarev et al., 2022). Elmore andAsner ( 2006) demonstrate a relationship between remotely sensed surface litter and field SOC measurements, allowingfor regionalization of SOC estimations using remote sensing data. Nave et al. ( 2018) propose a method and conse-quently quantify SOC stocks based on 15,000 national-level observations combined with remote sensing information onland use and land cover, and later, Nave et al. (2021) demonstrate the applicability of this method in another effort ofecoregional SOC assessment. However, they do not present a methodology for upscaling the “regional ”information tobroader-scale uses (possibly with the exception of going from regional to global in one step). In this context, Paustianet al. (2019) propose a quantification system consisting of several methods (integrated model frameworks, expandedmeasurement and monitoring networks, remote sensing and crowd-sourcing of relevant management activity data) toinform global-scale soil science. Still, to the next step of upscaling from regional to global-scale SOC estimates seemsmissing. Authors using climate zonation in relation to SOC stocks chose almost exclusively, to our knowledge, classifi-cations based on HLZ above all other possible climate zonation systems or at least a system that similarly uses polygonsdefined by climate variables (Kramer & Chadwick,2018; Lin et al., 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2018).Jungkunst et al. ( 2021) showed that the approach of Post et al. ( 1982) even improved when updated data points onSOC stocks were added. A possible reason why the SOC stock for each of the 38 zones of the HLZ is so distinguishableis the fact that (a) there are 38 polygons (more than others) that are (b) strictly defined by annual values, and which(c) exclusively use temperature and water balance rather than plant-related parameters. For example, other climate-classification systems like Köppen –Geiger use specified climate data controlling plant growth in individual-specificzones, which may be less influential for SOC persistence than the uniformly and strictly annual biotemperature andwater balance classes used in HLZ. Therefore, HLZ may provide a good critical mesoscale for showing regionalizedglobal SOC stocks and SOC persistence without mimicking greater details than exist in the data.JUNGKUNST ET AL . 7o f1 7 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

The latitudinal/altitudinal regions are defined according to biotemperature (whichfocuses on the effective temperature for plant growth and is the mean of unit-period temperatures with substitution ofzero for all temperature values below 0/C14C and above 30/C14C( 0/C14C< T<3 0/C14C)) and named from cold to hot polar, subpo-lar, boreal, cool temperate, warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical. The number of humidity provinces increaseswith biotemperature. The humidity provinces are defined by mean annual precipitation (MAP) and potential evapo-transpiration (PET). When MAP exceeds PET, this ratio is <1, and the zone is considered as humid; when this ratio is>1, the zone is considered as dry. All eight are defined as super-arid, per-arid, arid, semi-arid, humid, per-humid, andsuper-humid.The global map using HLZ to display SOC stocks (Figure4c) has certain similarities with the regular grid-basedmap (Figure 4a). These similarities beg the question of which is closer to reality. From our perspective, HLZ enablelinking process knowledge and global modeling approaches and aligns better with the expected latitudinal patterns forthe processes, which make them ideal sweet spots improving “translations ”from the scales relevant for process under-standing to the scales of decision-making.5|PREDICTIONS OF SOC –CLIMATE INTERACTIONS BY USING CLIMATECLASSIFICATIONThe response of SOC to climate change is one of, if not the greatest uncertainty in climate change projections (Varneyet al., 2020; Veldman et al., 2019). More energy (temperature) available for microbial decomposer communities leads tohigher decomposition rates, as long as other resources are not limited. Consequently, elevated respiratory CO 2releasesfrom the soil are to be expected with continuing climate change. Understanding the global heterogeneity of both SOCstocks and climate change is key for an improved and regionally diversified understanding of the processes governingSOC–climate interactions. Similarly, as regions with higher SOC stocks and regions with very low SOC stocks exist(Figures4and5), climate change will not happen uniformly. In general, the HLZ classification provides a descriptiveapproach to facilitate the identification of potential hotspots and coldspots of SOC –climate interaction (Figure 5). Ifzones with high SOC stocks spatially overlap with zones where above-average temperature increases are predicted,potential hotspots of SOC –climate interactions emerge. In contrast, coldspots will form in areas with low SOC andbelow-average temperature increases. For example, the highest temperature changes are predicted for the boreal, cool,and warm temperate temperature zones by 2050 (Figure5). Regarding the humidity provinces, the arid zones will beaffected by temperature increases, whereas the predicted temperature in humid zones will be lower (Figure 5). Accord-ingly, hotspots of potential SOC susceptibility form in the boreal and cool temperate humid regions where 36.9% SOC isstored globally and which is affected by large rises in mean temperature. Interestingly, the humid subtropical zonebares 10.7% of the global SOC and has the potential to turn into a hotspot after 2050. The strongest reductions in precip-itation are expected in the rather dry warm temperate zones and strongest increases in precipitation in the tropic dryareas. While studies investigating SOC persistence across global climate classes may be suitable to show the long-termresponse of SOC to a given climate, they may fail to present the shorter-term dynamics of non-adapted systems. Under-standing ecosystem threats imposed by interspersed climate extremes or climate change in a specific area, requiringmanipulated experiments.We know from field experiments that the response of SOC to warming alone is inconsistent with reported increasesand decreases in SOC stocks (Crowther et al.,2016; Sulman et al., 2018; van Gestel et al., 2018). Measuring respiratoryCO2fluxes to the atmosphere provides limited insights to resolve SOC responses to climate change (Conantet al., 2011). Apparently, soil ecosystem reactions are complex even to the manipulation of only a single climate variablelike heating. For example, SOC has recently been shown to respond contrary to plant behavior under elevated atmo-spheric CO 2concentrations implying a revision of future SOC projections (Terrer et al., 2021). According to Duffyet al. ( 2021), the thermal maximum for photosynthesis has already been reached globally, which is predicted to resultin a nearly 50% reduction in the land-sink strength of atmospheric carbon by as early as 2040. In total, the complexityextends to multiple reactions and dynamics like input, transport, sorption, (co-)precipitation, and aggregation thatoccur even in highly heterogeneous patterns. Consequently, Haaf et al. (2021) propose that more process knowledgefrom spatial diverse soil types is needed to advance predictions of SOC –climate interactions under climate change. Weare convinced that climate classification provides a way forward for improved predictions as it allows for separatingcontrasting processes. In line with that, Haaf et al. ( 2021) interpret their results separately for the colder, temperate,8o f1 7 JUNGKUNST ET AL . 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseand tropical climate zones and justify it by different mineral ages and complexity between these zones. In colder climatezones, SOC is hardly being stabilized by minerals as there is less mixture of organic and mineral material, whichexplains a quicker response to warming compared with warmer zones (Doetterl et al., 2015). At least between cold andwarm climates, repeatable patterns of differences emerge (Crowther et al., 2019; Koven et al., 2017). There seems to bea consensus that climate class and difference in temperature sensitivity of SOC are key to precisely predicting the SOCdynamics under global warming (Wang et al., 2019). Otherwise, it is impossible to unravel the cause of the spatial pat-terns in SOC changes under warming that need to be understood to improve climate change projections (Crowtheret al.,2018).Other predictive variables accounting for heterogeneously distributed soil carbon persistence are necessary toexplain large-scale patterns (Bradford et al., 2016; Bradford et al., 2017). Thus, more observational studies across diversesoils are needed to accurately predict the response of SOC to warming at the global scale (Haaf et al., 2021). Moreover,when forecasting future terrestrial SOC –climate interactions, there is an urgent need to explore the interactions amongmultiple global change drivers (Song et al., 2019) like elevated atmospheric CO 2concentrations, atmospheric N deposi-tions, and varying precipitation. To gain fine-scaled process understanding, manipulative experiments with multiplefactors are required which push observational studies beyond what is feasible, particularly as these observations wouldneed to be evenly distributed across the globe within relevant geo-climatic zones. As coordinated globally distributedexperiments are designed to compare ecosystem sensitivity to global-change drivers, their performance depends onwhether they cover a significant proportion of the global range of environmental variables (Fraser et al.,2013; Yahdjianet al., 2021). Establishing coordinated experiments across all HLZ, but also including multiple global change drivers,has the potential to advance our understanding of general principles of SOC –climate interaction, and SOC persistence.Even without pushing observational studies to their limits, simulations of possible climate change impacts on SOCshould employ calculation exercises with mechanistic models (Box 2). Powerful ESMs are already capable ofFIGURE 3 The global map of the Holdridge Life Zones (HLZ).

Todd-Brown et al.

Sourcesof data sets are provided under further reading. As part of the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) workflow, soil profile data are beingpopulated from different kinds of studies with varying focus, and therefore termed standardized soil profile to ensure completeness andquality criteria like observation date, level of trust including soil expert knowledge and accuracy (Batjes et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020).Since the data are submitted in multiple formats, the data were converted into a digital standard format and units standardized to make datausable (Batjes et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020)10 of 17 JUNGKUNST ET AL . 17577799, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.780 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/04/2023].

Todd-Brown et al. ( 2013) point out that ESMs have not fully incorporated fine-scale mechanismslike priming effects, nutrient availability, mineral surface stabilization, and aggregate formation. However, according toIto et al. ( 2020), model uncertainty has not been markedly diminished since 2013 and they report future (2015 –2100)global SOC stock increases of 48 ± 32 Pg and 49 ± 58 Pg. But literally, all modeling studies point to the highest uncer-tainties deriving from the reaction of SOC to climate change. ESMs also have difficulties in replicating contemporarysoil properties and dynamics (Luo et al.,2017; Todd-Brown et al., 2013). It will be interesting if present model calcula-tions hold in predicting a global rise of SOC —this will give us hope. Some improvements in ESM soil calculations arereported that capture this emergent behavior (Koven et al., 2017). However, ESMs most likely have to be regionally tai-lored to represent diverse mechanistic understanding to the diverse soil regions. How can we approach this –poten-tially by scaling the HLZ further down to soil properties like pH and clay, since the key to improvement lies withinexplaining SOC persistence. However, this will end up in fine scales that may be beyond the critical mesoscales for aglobal overview, so more aggregate soil information like soil types may be more appropriate.FIGURE 5 Mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (0 –100 cm) and SOC storage (total per zone) plotted across the Holdridgescheme for world life-zone classification (u pper triangles).

As the mythical storygoes, Pandora opened the “box”and unleashed evils on humanity. Analogously, this can happen if the SOC stocks wereto enter the atmosphere in a self-amplifying mechanism. But, as in the myth, there is hope. We propose that this hopelies in the soils themselves. Their ability to continue providing the ecosystem service of protecting the global climateand preventing a tipping point is supported by current models. Assessing any solutions on global scales will require bet-ter data from a wider variety of soil types and regions, as well as deeper process knowledge of soils. Our revelation fromthis review convinces us that if soil processes (from the fine-scale) can be better integrated into models (more globalscale, better proxy variables, and ability to incorporate multiple variables), we may yet have fine-tuned tools to informmanagement interventions working in the critical mesoscale. One possible way forward is to reconsider the approachof relying solely on regular grids, which have inherent resolution and upscaling issues, and explore irregular grids(i.e., polygons) that can better represent the process knowledge gains in soil science. Results from applying HLZ areencouraging and may help connect approaches at the extreme scales with the critical mesoscale. Given that the largeststocks of carbon are stored in soils, the scientific community must help inform management practices and ultimatelyallow the hope rather than the calamity of Pandora's box to prevail.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSHermann F.
