Metagenomics data are increasinglyeasy to obtain, but studies of soil metagenomics face three key challenges: (1) accounting for soilphysicochemical properties; (2) incorporating untreated controls; and (3) sharing data. Accountingfor soil physicochemical properties is crucial for better understanding the changes in soil microbialcommunity composition, mechanisms, and abundance. Untreated controls provide a good baselineto measure changes in soil microbial communities and separate treatment effects from randomeffects. Sharing data increases reproducibility and enables meta-analyses, which are importantfor investigating overall effects. To overcome these challenges, we suggest establishing standardguidelines for the design of experiments for studying soil metagenomics. Addressing these challengeswill promote a better understanding of soil microbial community composition and function, whichwe can exploit to enhance soil quality, health, and fertility.Keywords: soil physicochemical properties; microbial ecology; metagenomics; untreated controls;data-sharing guidelines1. IntroductionSoil microbial communities in agroecosystems contribute to (i) soil health, nutrientcycling, and fertility [ 1,2], thereby increasing pathogen suppression [ 3,4] and processes thatenhance crop yields [ 5,6]; (ii) the production [ 7,8] and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions [ 9]; and (iii) carbon sequestration through the formation of mineral-associatedorganic matter [ 2,10] and carbon storage [ 11,12]. All these soil microbe functions are directlyor indirectly linked to soil physicochemical properties.The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled in-depth investigationsof the composition and functions of whole microbial communities [ 13,14] and allowed theperformance of metagenomic studies [ 15]. The term metagenomics was coined in 1998 byHandelsman et al. [ 16] and refers to the genomic information of the microbial communityinhabiting an environment. The decreasing cost of NGS has facilitated the analysis ofcomplex environments and has allowed researchers to perform metagenomic studies onsoil [ 17] and produce large-scale data. However, the ease of generating metagenomic databrings new challenges for study design and analysis. First, soil microbial communitiesand their functions are inﬂuenced by environmental factors such as soil physicochemicalproperties, but this complexity of the soil microbiome is largely neglected [18,19]. Second,proper controls are necessary to better understand the inﬂuence of the environment on soilmicrobial communities. Third, large, published, and publicly available datasets are neces-sary to conduct meta-analyses to develop a better understanding of microbial communitieson a larger scale. In this paper, we discuss how these three challenges are limiting furtherdevelopment of the ﬁeld of metagenomics and how they can be overcome. Moreover,we outline the implications of surmounting these obstacles for our understanding of soilmicrobial communities.Microorganisms 2022 ,10, 1900. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10101900 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganismsMicroorganisms 2022 ,10, 1900 2 of 82. Soil Physicochemical Properties Improves Our Understanding of CommunityProcesses in Soil MicrobiomesSoil physicochemical properties play a crucial role in determining soil microbiomecomposition and function [ 20,21]. However, most soil microbiome studies either do notinclude soil physicochemical properties or limit measurements to pH, soil organic carbon(SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), moisture, and/or temperature, which donot fully reﬂect the complex soil chemical matrix and its various constituent elements(e.g., N, C, K, P , Zn, Fe, Ca, Mn, Mg). Soil properties vary with soil depth [ 22], as shownfor SOC, total N [ 23,24], and total P [ 25]. Moreover, soil properties, particularly pH, aredynamic and ﬂuctuate with changes in climate [ 26], environment [ 27], and the abovegroundpopulation [28].A common pitfall of soil microbiome studies is a lack of measurements of soil physic-ochemical properties. This is especially important in agricultural studies because landuse determines soil physiochemical properties [ 20], which change nutrient availabilityand cycling [ 2]. These changes explain (part of) the shifts observed in soil microbialcommunities, root–soil interactions [ 29], pathogen suppression [ 30], and microbial pro-cesses [ 31]. If these properties are not measured before the start of a long-term experiment,the control cannot be used to investigate the inﬂuence of time on soil physicochemicalproperties because time changes soil physicochemical properties [ 32]. In other words, thedirect effect of the treatment cannot be separated from the indirect effect of changes in soilphysicochemical properties.Including soil physicochemical properties in every soil metagenomic study does notonly ease the comparison of studies, but also increases the knowledge within a system.This will allow us to further disentangle soil microbial communities by linking speciﬁcmicroorganisms or functions to precise chemical changes [ 33]. Microbial responses arecontext-dependent; they change with soil disturbance [ 34], climate, and nutrient availabil-ity [26,35]. Nutrients also determine the abundance of root promoting microorganisms [ 36],which can even help explain changes in plant productivity. These contexts change not onlythe content of microbial communities but also their interactions [ 37]. The choice to notinclude physicochemical properties in a soil microbial community study means there is avital part missing in explaining soil microbial community responses.In addition, accounting for soil properties can provide a better understanding ofwhy speciﬁc microbes are especially sensitive to certain abiotic changes and the potentialimpact of this sensitivity on their ecosystem function. Recently, Leite et al. [ 36] showedthat the efﬁciency of plant-growth-promoting microbes depends on the availability ofnitrogen. A stronger grasp of the effects of soil physicochemical properties on soil microbialcommunities will provide insights into how these microbial communities are shaped andtheir roles in soil quality, health, and plant productivity.3. Untreated Controls Are Critical for a Better Understanding of Soil Microbial CommunitiesSoil microbial communities are complex and susceptible to change [ 5,19]; this empha-sizes the importance of establishing a baseline for comparison with the targeted treatment.Untreated controls provide such a baseline for determining whether a change in the soilmicrobial community is due to the treatment or to an unknown factor (e.g., stochasticprocesses). To illustrate this need, consider a hypothetical experiment comparing organicamendment and inorganic fertilizer; in such a comparison, the abundance of Acidobacteriais high in the treatment with organic amendment but low in the treatment with inorganicfertilizer. These results have two potential explanations: (1) organic amendment increasesthe abundance of Acidobacteria, and (2) inorganic fertilizers decrease the abundance ofAcidobacteria. In the absence of a control containing the original soil without any amend-ment (untreated), both explanations are valid. Thus, including a control simpliﬁes theinterpretation of the results and facilitates the design of follow-up experiments.Nonetheless, most comparisons of organic amendments with inorganic fertilizersdirectly compare the microbial communities in the two treatments. This approach doesMicroorganisms 2022 ,10, 1900 3 of 8not provide a clear picture of which treatment is the main cause of microbial shifts. Onereason for the lack of untreated controls is that soil biology agricultural research is oftenconducted on farms, where not treating an area of soil will have economic and food-securityconsequences if crop yields are reduced. A second reason is that expanding the number ofsamples to include a control increases the cost as well as the burden of data analysis, whichmay be an issue when there are time constraints. A potential solution is to maintain a smallarea of the plot without any fertilizers for use as a control, which would beneﬁt researchwithout reducing crop yield. If there are time or cost constraints, a single plot could bekept free of any treatments instead of replicating the control three or more times. A thirdreason is in cases where the area is highly farmed, so there is no untreated land available.Even when a piece of land is untreated from that time, the history of the land can stillinﬂuence and explain changes in the soil microbial community [38]. An untreated controlis also important when accounting for the inﬂuence of soil physicochemical properties.Without an untreated control, it is very difﬁcult to determine whether changes in the soilmicrobial community reﬂect soil physicochemical properties, time, or the treatment. It isimportant to realize that the lack of an untreated control impacts the vision on the soilmicrobial community. The lack of an untreated control may mislead the conclusions. Forinstance, Soman et al. [ 39] found that bacterial diversity was higher in soil with poultrylitter than with inorganic fertilizer, it is the case that poultry litter is better for bacterialdiversity than inorganic fertilizer. However, the untreated control shows that bacterialdiversity was higher without treatment. Thus, inorganic fertilizer and poultry litter bothlower bacterial diversity and it might be better to use no fertilizer if an increase in bacterialdiversity is the aim.Some researchers have developed creative solutions for including a control sample.One common approach is to measure the soil microbial communities and/or soil physic-ochemical properties before the start of the study for use as a control. However, thisapproach neglects the possibility of changes in the soil microbial community and/or soilphysicochemical properties over time, especially in long-term ﬁeld experiments [ 40,41].Consequently, it is important to have a real-time control that is exposed to the elements inthe same way as the treatments. Another common solution is the use of inorganic fertilizeras a control. However, inorganic fertilizer also changes the soil microbial community andsoil physicochemical properties [ 42], making it impossible to establish a baseline. Otherresearchers use non-agricultural ﬁelds, such as grassland, as controls, but such controlscannot be reliably compared to agricultural ﬁelds because soil microbial communities differgreatly among different land-use systems [ 43]. Absolute microbiome proﬁling quantiﬁesabsolute abundance in metagenome samples which eases comparisons between soil mi-crobial communities [ 37]. This does not, however, lift the need for an untreated control; itdoes not explain which environmental variables inﬂuenced the soil microbial communityduring the experiment, or how they had this inﬂuence.Including an untreated control in every soil microbiome study would contributeto reproducibility and facilitate the integration of studies in meta-analyses. In addition,the effects of the treatments could be separated from environmental effects. Widespreadadoption of untreated controls in soil microbial community research would also enablethe creation of a database of microbial baselines that could be used to infer possibleconsequences of changes in soil microbial communities.4. FAIR Data Are Needed to Better Understand the Soil MicrobiomeMore sequencing data are being generated than ever before [ 44,45], which has in-creased the complexity of conducting transparent and reproducible research. Data sharingand transparency are key factors for ensuring reproducibility and comparability betweenstudies. To help structure data management and ensure reproducibility in scientiﬁc research,the FAIR (ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guidelines for scientiﬁc data wereintroduced in 2016 [ 46]. This approach has since been evaluated by the biomedical researchcommunity [ 47,48] and has also been proposed for environmental metagenomics [ 49]. ManyMicroorganisms 2022 ,10, 1900 4 of 8initiatives have improved data sharing and standardization, such as TerraGenome [ 50], theEarth Microbiome Project [51,52], and the Genomics Standards Consortium [53].There is an increasing need for meta-analyses of the soil microbiome to uncover soilmicrobial community mechanisms and untangle the inﬂuences of soil type, location, soilphysicochemical properties, and treatments. However, the FAIR approach is not widelyused in soil metagenomics research. For instance, if the FAIR approach is not applied,information such as soil depth is missing from the methods. This loss of informationreduces reproducibility and increases the difﬁculty of metagenomic meta-analyses. Dataare not always checked for metadata correctness and completeness. This could be improvedwith guidelines to standardize metadata across platforms [54].The FAIR principles should be prioritized from the start of the project as they requiremutual awareness and consent from the relevant group members and a consideration ofcosts involved in maintaining FAIR data [ 55]. Reasons for not applying the FAIR princi-ples in environmental metagenomics include work regulations preventing data sharing,technical difﬁculties in sharing data [ 56], or underestimation of the importance of datasharing [ 57]. One option for addressing these issues is to include data-sharing seminarsor lectures in PhD programs and conferences to teach prospective researchers about theimportance of data sharing. Another option is to develop data-sharing tools that facilitatedata sharing [ 56]. Data-sharing requirements are a solution that has already been imple-mented by funding agencies which has signiﬁcantly improved data sharing over the lastyears [ 58]. Despite these initiatives, some data-sharing problems have remained, becausethe guidelines for data sharing as given by a journal are not always translated to reality.Vasilevsky et al. [ 59] found that encouragement of data sharing is not pursued by journalsas they do not require it. They found that, for journals requiring data sharing, the lackof data does not stop them from publishing a paper. Some journals require that a datastatement is included, but authors are often not compliant to this statement [ 60] or the dataare not ﬁndable [ 61]. Another workaround that some authors use to fulﬁl the data-sharingrequirements by a journal, is to only publish part of their sequencing data [ 58]. FollowingFAIR guidelines with software [ 45] and R packages [ 62] is also important to create anopen-data environment. Stricter journal guidelines with speciﬁc guidance increases FAIRdata management and data sharing [59,63].Applying the FAIR principle to all studies of soil metagenomics will allow meta-analyses to elucidate the dynamics of soil microbial communities and provide new insightsinto published data. It would also provide greater transparency, which would allow us tolearn more about soil microbial communities and how they are affected by environmentalconditions. Most importantly, we could work together as a scientiﬁc community to ﬁndsolutions and advance the development of the ﬁeld of metagenomics.5. DiscussionSoil microbial communities are a vital part of our ecosystems that contribute to diseasesuppression, nutrient cycling, and soil fertility. The emerging ﬁeld of metagenomics hasthe potential to uncover the functions and mechanisms of soil microbial communities.However, common guidelines are necessary to ensure comparability between studies anda better understanding of soil microbial communities. We argue that those guidelinesshould start with (i) a more detailed characterization of soil properties, (ii) the inclusion ofuntreated controls to avoid biased conclusions on shifts of community structure, and (iii)data-sharing and transparency measures to ensure reproducibility.Many soil physicochemical properties affect soil microbial communities, and if we donot include at least some soil physicochemical properties, we will be navigating in the dark.The importance of including soil physicochemical properties goes beyond cross-study com-parisons and is essential to disentangle soil microbial community mechanisms and connectthem to speciﬁc chemical changes. Accounting for the soil physicochemical properties alsobrings the additional beneﬁt of indirectly showing the effect of other soil organisms thatshape the soil factors (e.g., decomposers [64]) without the need to characterize them. ThisMicroorganisms 2022 ,10, 1900 5 of 8will contribute to a better understanding of the role of soil physicochemical properties andthe speciﬁc microorganisms that we can use for precision farming and increasing soil healthand plant productivity. It is especially important to include soil physicochemical propertiesin tropical soil, where soil properties may be very different to temperature soils [ 65], whichcan change soil microbial communities signiﬁcantly [5].Adopting appropriate controls will promote reproducibility in metagenomics andestablish a clear microbial baseline for soils. In-ﬁeld and real-time controls can be used tocreate a database of soil microbial community baselines around the globe, which we cancombine with soil physicochemical property data to better understand soil changes [ 66–68].However, the creation of a true soil microbial community baseline demands a renewedemphasis on transparent data sharing. Soil metagenomics is complex, and the results areinﬂuenced by many factors, including the methods of DNA isolation, sequencing, and dataanalysis [ 69–71]. Therefore, it is essential not only to share our data in a FAIR way but alsoto include FAIR metadata [46,48,72].We present the three key challenges, but we also acknowledge the existence of manyother challenges. Mocali and Benedetti [ 73] highlighted that, in order to study soil microbialcommunities via soil metagenomics, we need to consider efﬁcient DNA-extraction methodswith well-deﬁned screening strategies and sequencing approaches. For example, Dimitrovet al. [ 69] proposed that successive DNA extractions optimize the DNA yield and led to abetter understanding of the microbial community composition. Altogether, we highlightthat we need also to consider methodological challenges to fully embrace the complexity ofsoil microbial community.Prosser [ 74] argued that microbial ecology research should go beyond describing themicrobial community and its functionality. We extend this recommendation by suggest-ing common guidelines to ensure that data collection efforts are not wasted or repeatedunnecessarily. These challenges are also applicable to metatranscriptomics, metabolomics,and metaproteomics [ 75]. However, these disciplines are largely underexplored for soilmicrobial communities due to operational challenges [ 76]. The challenges motivating theseguidelines need to be solved to ensure that the ﬁeld of soil metagenomics continues toexpand. Strengthening our research and increasing our understanding of the soil micro-biome will accelerate efforts to tackle issues related to carbon sequestration, greenhousegas mitigation, and food security.6. ConclusionsIn this paper, we discuss the three critical challenges faced by soil metagenomicsresearch: (1) accounting for soil physicochemical properties; (2) incorporating untreatedcontrols; and (3) sharing data. We suggest resolving these issues by establishing standardguidelines for experimental design in soil metagenomics. A strict procedure by journalsand funding agencies will help to convince researchers to adhere to these guidelines.Overcoming these challenges beneﬁts the ﬁeld by the increased understanding of soilmicrobial community responses and facilitating cross-study analyses such as meta-analysesand global models.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, M.F.A.L. and E.E.K.; investigation, M.F.A.L. and S.W.E.B.v .d.B.;data curation, S.W.E.B.v .d.B.; writing—draft preparation, S.W.E.B.v .d.B. and M.F.A.L.; writing—reviewand editing, E.E.K.; supervision, E.E.K.; project administration, E.E.K.; funding acquisition, E.E.K.
