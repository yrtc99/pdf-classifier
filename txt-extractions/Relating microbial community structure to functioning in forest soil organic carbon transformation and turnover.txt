Weused phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as biomarker to study soil microbialcommunity structure and measured activities of ﬁve extracellular enzymesinvolved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., b-1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohy-drolase), chitin (i.e., b-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (i.e., phenoloxidase and peroxidase) as indicators of soil microbial functioning in carbontransformation or turnover across varying biotic and abiotic conditions in atypical temperate forest ecosystem in central China. Redundancy analysis(RDA) was performed to determine the interrelationship between individualPFLAs and biotic and abiotic site factors as well as the linkage between soilmicrobial structure and function. Path analysis was further conducted toexamine the controls of site factors on soil microbial community structureand the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial commu-nity structure and function. We found that soil microbial community struc-ture is strongly inﬂuenced by water, temperature, SOC, ﬁne root mass, claycontent, and C/N ratio in soils and that the relative abundance of Gram-nega-tive bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and actinomycetes explained most of the vari-ations in the speciﬁc activities of soil enzymes involved in SOCtransformation or turnover. The abundance of soil bacterial communities isstrongly linked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbon transforma-tion, whereas the abundance of saprophytic fungi is associated with activitiesof extracellular enzymes driving carbon oxidation. Findings in this study dem-onstrate the complex interactions and linkage among plant traits, microenvi-ronment, and soil physiochemical properties in affecting SOC via microbialregulations.IntroductionThe interactions between above- and below-ground com-ponents play an important role in driving ecosystem pro-cesses, but their underlying mechanisms are yet poorlyunderstood. Thus, there have been continued and growinginterests to elucidate the explicit relationships between veg-etation and below-ground processes and to seek mechanis-tic understanding on the contribution of soil biota andassociated processes to ecosystem functioning (Wardleet al. 2004; Xiao et al. 2007; De Deyn et al. 2008; Jin et al.2010; Zhou et al. 2013).Soil microorganisms are a critical link between shifts inthe composition of dominant vegetation and fundamentalshifts in ecosystem functioning (Waldrop et al. 2000; Pres-cott and Grayston 2013; Prescott and Vesterdal 2013). Soilactive microbial communities play a central role in below-ground processes, especially in mediating soil organicª2014 The Authors.

An improved knowl-edge on the interactions between site factors and soilmicrobial communities in facilitating forest soil organicmatter decomposition and soil carbon sequestration isincreasingly recognized as key to understanding feedbacksof terrestrial ecosystem processes to global climate change(Singh et al. 2010). However, owning to the complexity ofbelow-ground processes as well as technical difﬁculties toexperimentally manipulate soil microbial structures andactivities, signiﬁcant gaps remain in our current under-standing on how soil microbial communities are controlledby complex interactions of biotic and abiotic site factorsand how the structural shifts in soil microbial communitiesare linked to alterations of their functioning, such as inmediating soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics (Hacklet al. 2005; Brockett et al. 2012). While advancement inbiotechnology has allowed for the development of tech-niques for structural analysis of soil microbial communi-ties, for example, the characterization of microbialfunctional components with phospholipid fatty acids(PLFA) analysis, determinations of the linkage betweenmicrobial structure and function still pose a critical issue(Prescott 2010). A lack of effective technical solution indirectly relating microbial community structure to func-tioning in SOC transformation and turnover in naturalecosystems has been an obstacle for seeking mechanisticunderstanding on the feedbacks of changes in below-ground processes to ecosystem succession and functioningin response to climate and land-cover changes.The PLFAs extracted from soil are used as an indicatorof microbial community structure, as certain groups ofmicroorganisms have different “signature” fatty acids(Tunlid and White 1992). These lipids are only present inthe membranes of viable organisms and are rapidlydegraded in soil and as such are a measure of the organismsliving at the time of sampling (Grayston and Prescott2005). A more advanced technique based on nucleic acidextraction and analysis has also been increasingly used forexamining soil microbial community structure, particularlygenes coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). However, thePLFA method is a rapid and inexpensive way of assayingthe biomass and composition of microbial communities insoils and may even be more sensitive in detecting shifts inmicrobial community composition when compared tonucleic acid-based methods (Ramsey et al. 2006). Althoughthe PLFA method cannot compete with the rRNA methodsin the phylogenetic resolution by which a given communitycan be characterized, the latter provide little informationon the phenotype and the activity of the microorganisms inthe environment (Frosteg /C23ard et al. 2011).Soil microbial community structure in natural ecosystemsis known to be directly inﬂuenced by many edaphic factors,such as temperature, water, and soil physicochemicalproperties (Williams and Rice 2007; Collins et al. 2008;Angel et al. 2010; Castro et al. 2010). Vegetation type andstructure, by modifying the site microclimate, the quantityand quality of litter, the production of root exudates, and/orthe allocation patterns of organic matter, directly andindirectly affect soil microbial community structure (DeDeyn et al. 2008; Wardle et al. 2012; Jassey et al. 2013). Pre-vious studies have demonstrated that ecosystems may differin the relative inﬂuences of site factors on soil microbialcommunities. For example, Brockett et al. (2012) found thatsoil water was the dominant factor inﬂuencing the potentialfunction of the soil microbial community across forests ofvarying biogeoclimatic zones. In contrast, many studies showthat SOC is closely related to soil microbial communitystructure and function under different types of vegetation(Grayston and Prescott 2005; Yao et al. 2006; Franklin andMills 2009; Katsalirou et al. 2010). There are also ﬁndingsthat speciﬁc soil chemical properties, such as soil C/N ratio(Fierer et al. 2009), nutrient status (Lauber et al. 2008), andsoil pH (Rousk et al. 2009), are highly correlated with soilmicrobial community composition and function, and thatplant litter chemistry (Ushio et al. 2008; Strickland andRousk 2010) and spatial pattern of soil properties (Ushioet al. 2010) can impose marked impacts on forest soil micro-bial function by changing soil microbial community compo-sition. Despite a much improved understanding on thecontrols of below-ground processes, however, there lacks ageneral model quantifying the relative contributions to, andthe levels of control of, soil microbial processes when multi-ple biotic and abiotic site factors are involved. The underly-ing mechanisms on the functional linkages between plantcommunities and soil microbial communities and theimpacts on forest biogeochemical processes that arise as aconsequence of below-ground activities are much compli-cated by the multiple effects of various site factors, biotic orabiotic, leaving alone the complexity in interactions andautocorrelations among the factors that potentially lead tononlinearity of biotic and environmental controls of ecosys-tem processes. Clearly, a holistic approach taking into con-sideration of all potential factors and drivers is necessarywhen examining the structure –function relationships of soilmicrobial communities in order to gain mechanistic under-standings on the controls and functioning of below-groundprocesses.In this study, using a typical temperate forest in centralChina as a model ecosystem, we examined the linkagebetween soil microbial structure and functioning in driv-ing SOC transformation and turnover and assessed therelative inﬂuences of biotic and abiotic site factors on soilmicrobial structure and function.

Multivariate analysisand pathway analysis were used to identify the dominantbiotic and abiotic site factors affecting soil microbialstructure and function and to determine the regulatorypathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial commu-nity structure and function. Our objectives were to deter-mine that, in forest ecosystems, (1) how soil microbialcommunities are controlled by complex interactions ofbiotic and abiotic site factors; and (2) how and to whatextend the structural variations in soil microbial commu-nities are linked to functioning in driving SOC transfor-mation and/or turnover. We anticipate that the outcomeof the study would help with gaining better mechanisticunderstanding on the microbial regulation of SOCdynamics. We hypothesized that soil microbial commu-nity controls SOC stabilization or turnover through alinkage between structure and function and that the roleof biotic and abiotic site factors in affecting SOC stock isoperated via regulations on the structural attributes of soilmicrobial community (Fig. 1).Materials and MethodsStudy sitesThe study was located in ﬁeld sites at the BaotianmanLong-Term Forest Ecosystem Research Station in the Bao-tianman Nature Reserve (latitude 33 °20′–33°36′N, longi-tude 111 °46′–112°04′E, and elevation 600 –1860 m a.s.l.),in the east of the Qinling Mountains in central China. Itis in a transitional zone from warm temperate to north-ern subtropical climatic region. The climate is of a conti-nental eastern monsoon type, with annual mean airtemperature of 15.1 °C and mean annual precipitation of900 mm (Luan et al. 2011). Precipitation occurs mainlyin the summer months June through August (55 –62%;Liu et al. 1998). The soils are of dystric cambisols (FAO-UNESCO soil classiﬁcation system) developed on weath-ered arenites.The zonal vegetation at the study sites is typically adeciduous broadleaved forests dominated by, withchanges in topography and position on slopes, Quercusaliena var. acuteserrata Maxim., Quercus glandulifera var.brevipetiolata Nakai., and Quercus variabilis Blume.,respectively, in the canopy layer.

Thereare also some azonal tree species, such as Acer monoMaxim., Toxicodendron verniciﬂnum (Stokes) F. Barkley,Carpinus cordata Bl., and Populus davidiana Dode, etc.,occurring in low frequency in the local forests. Theunderstory is composed of predominantly woody plantsLauraceae obtusiloba Bl.,Rubus corchorifolius Linn.

Focke, andAdenophora axilliﬂora Borb. in the ﬁeld layer.Four forest types, each dominated by Q. aliena ,Q. glandulifera ,Q. variabilis , and mixture of P. armandiiand Q. aliena , respectively, and an age sequence of Q.aliena forest ( ~40,~80, and >160 years), were included inthis study. Three 20 m 920 m plots were set up on sep-arate sites for each of the forest types and the agesequence stands in April 2011. The stands of similar age(~80 years) were selected for forest types representingQ. aliena ,Q. glandulifera , and Q. variabilis . The mixedQ. aliena and P. armandii forest stands were aged>50 years. Stand age was obtained from forest manage-ment records and increment core samples. All sites areunder natural conditions and have not experienced appar-ent anthropogenic disturbance in recent history.Field survey was conducted on each plot to collect dataon tree species composition and density, size of individualtrees >5 cm DBH, canopy openness, litter mass on for-est ﬂoor, ﬁne root biomass, and soil physicochemicalproperties.Field measurements and samplingSoil temperatures at 10 cm depth ( Tsoil10) were measuredusing HOBO Data Loggers (TidbiT v2 Temp, OnsetComputer Corporation, Cape Cod, MA) at 30 min inter-vals. The average soil temperature for each plot was calcu-lated for 4 weeks prior to soil sampling, whichrepresented the critical time period for microbial responseto varying environmental conditions (Bell et al. 2009).Plant ﬁne roots and litter samples were collected follow-ing soil sampling. Litter samples (including undecom-posed plant tissues, partially decomposed duff, and Oeand Oahorizons) were collected on each plot at 12 ran-dom locations with a 20 cm diameter ring frame andoven-dried at 65 °C to constant weight. Twelve root coresamples were also collected on each plot by soil layer for0–5 cm, 5 –10 cm, and 10 –20 cm using a 15-cm-inner-diameter soil-corer. They were washed clean using 0.4-mm mesh bags and separated into coarse ( >5 mm), med-ium (2 –5 mm), and ﬁne ( <2 mm) roots before beingoven-dried at 65 °C to constant weight. All litter and rootsamples were measured for total dry mass and analyzedfor concentrations of C and N, and the acid soluble frac-tion and insoluble residue (i.e., the “Klason lignin”) (Par-ton et al. 2007; Meier and Bowman 2010).Soil samples were collected in mid-August 2012, at 12systematically arranged locations on each plot at a distanceof 5 m from the plot center in the directions of 0, 30, 60,90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330 °. They werecollected at depths of 0 –5 cm, 5 –10 cm, and 10 –20 cmusing a 10-cm-inner-diameter soil-corer. The samples weremixed to obtain one composite sample for each of the soillayers on each plot. All soil samples were immediatelystored on ice in insulated containers upon collection andsieved to pass a 2-mm mesh after returning to laboratory.Each processed soil sample was divided into two portionsand stored in a refrigerator at /C020°C before being analyzed.One was freeze-dried for PLFA analysis and the other forenzyme assays and physicochemical analysis.Altogether, 216 forest ﬂoor litter samples, 648 ﬁne rootsamples, and 54 composite soil samples were collectedand analyzed in this study.Measurements of soil physicochemicalpropertiesThe gravimetric soil water content (% SWC) was calcu-lated from the mass loss after drying the samples at105°C to a constant weight, for at least 48 h. We used ahydrometer method for analysis of soil particle size distri-bution (Sheldrick and Wang 1993). The soil pH was mea-sured by mixing the soil sample with deionized water at a1:2.5 ratio (w/v; Liu et al. 2012). The supernatants weremeasured using a pH meter (HI-9125, Hanna InstrumentsInc, Woonsocket, RI). Soil organic carbon (SOC) contentwas analyzed by K2Cr2O7-H2SO4calefaction method(Nelson and Sommers 1982). Soil total nitrogen (TN)content was analyzed using Kjeldahl digestion procedure(Gallaher et al. 1976). Soil ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N)and nitrate nitrogen (NO 3-N) were determined from 10 g(dry mass) of soil using 50 mL 2M KCl extraction proce-dure and analyzed colorimetrically by a continuous ﬂowanalyzer (SEAL AA3, Norderstedt, Germany). Microbialbiomass carbon (MBC) was measured by fumigation –extraction method, using 0.5 mol/L K2SO4as extractingagent; a conversion factors of 2.64 were used to convertextracted C to MBC (Vance et al. 1987). The dissolvedorganic carbon (DOC) was determined by directly mea-suring carbon concentration in the 0.5 mol/L K2SO4extract solution without fumigation treatment (Wu et al.2011).636 ª2014 The Authors.

The indicatorPLFAs were used for classiﬁcation of microbial commu-nity types. Bacterial community was represented byPLFAs i14:0, 15:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, 16:1 x7c, 17:0, a17:0,i17:0, cy17:0, 18:1 x7c, and cy19:0 (Frosteg /C23ard and B /C23a/C23ath1996; Liu et al. 2012). Gram-positive bacteria are com-posed of PLFAs i14:0, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, a17:0, and i17:0(Liu et al. 2012; Nie et al. 2013), Gram-negative bacteria16:1x7c, cy17:0, 18:1 x7c, and cy19:0 (Zelles 1999; Liuet al. 2012), actinomycete 10Me16:0, 10Me17:0, 10Me18:0 (Frosteg /C23ard and B /C23a/C23ath 1996; Bell et al. 2009; Brockettet al. 2012), saprotrophic fungi 18:2 x69c (Nie et al.2013), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 16:1 x5c(Olsson 1999; Brockett et al. 2012; Nie et al. 2013). OtherPLFAs such as 14:0, 16:0, 16:1 2OH, 16:1 x9c, 17:1 x8c,and 18:1 x9c were also used for analysis of the microbialcomposition (Liu et al. 2012).Soil extracellular enzyme assaysWe assessed microbial function by measuring activities ofﬁve soil extracellular enzymes involved in degrading cellu-lose ( b-1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), chitin ( b-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (phenol oxidaseand peroxidase), respectively. The activities of b-glucosi-dase (BG; EC:3.2.1.21), cellobiohydrolase (CBH;EC:3.2.1.91), and N-acetyl- b-glucosaminidase (NAG;EC:3.2.1.30) were determined by the conventional p-ni-trophenol assays (Parham and Deng 2000; Baldrian 2009).Phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities were deter-mined using 1-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) assubstrate (Sinsabaugh et al. 1993; Li et al. 2010). For phe-nol oxidase, the reaction mixture composed of 2 mL5 mmol/L L-DOPA solution and soil slurry (1 g fresh soilwith 1.5 mL 50 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer), and per-oxidase activity assays received 2 mL of 5 mmol/L-DOPAand soil slurry (1 g fresh soil with 1.5 mL 50 mmol/Lsodium acetate buffer), plus 0.2 mL of 0.3% H2O2. Alltotal enzyme activities were expressed as lmol/g soil/h.The results of all enzymatic assays were expressed on adry-weight basis. There were three replicates for each soilsample.The speciﬁc enzyme activity, which is deﬁned as theactivity of a given enzyme on per unit of SOC basis, wascalculated for each of the ﬁve soil extracellular enzymesfor comparison of their relative contributions to thedynamics of SOC decomposition (Baldrian et al. 2013).Soil microbial respiration measurementsSoil microbial respiration (MR) was measured by determin-ing CO 2evolution over a 12-day incubation following theprocedure described by Jin et al. (2010). Speciﬁcally, 20 g(dry weight equivalent) of each soil sample was adjusted to60% of water-holding capacity (WHC) and placed in a 250-mL Mason jar. Respired CO2was absorbed in 10 mL0.1 mol/L NaOH solution suspended inside the jar. All jarswere sealed with rubber septum and incubated at 25 °C andfor 12 days in the dark. The NaOH solutions containingdissolved CO2were then each titrated with 0.05 mol/L HClsolution to determine the amount of CO 2evolved at 3-dayintervals. After each reading, the jars were left open for halfan hour to ventilate and then resealed.The microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2) was calcu-lated by:qCO2¼MRMBC(1)Data analysisBased on biologic measurements and ﬁeld survey andmonitoring, a total of 21 variables were derived and usedin the analysis of site factors on soil microbial communitystructures, including the slope and cross-section area atbreast height (CAB) for capturing potential inﬂuences oftopography and tree stands; soil physiochemical proper-ties consisting of Tsoil10, %SWC, pH, SOC, DOC, MBC,TN, NH 4-N, NO 3-N, C to N ratio in soil (C/N soil), andclay content (%Clay); biotic factors consisting of FR, littermass, litter lignin content (%ligninlitter), root lignin con-tent (%lignin root), litter C to N ratio (C/N litter), root C toN ratio (C/N root), litter lignin to N ratio (lignin/N litter),and root lignin to N ratio (lignin/N root).Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed on data ofrelative abundance of individual PLFAs, expressed as %mole of the total, and site biotic and abiotic variables fordetermining the interrelationships between soil microbialcomposition and environmental conditions (Andersenet al. 2010; Thoms et al. 2010). We also used RDA todetermine the linkage between soil microbial communitytypes and the speciﬁc activities of soil extracellularenzymes involved in SOC acquisition and oxidation. Theforward selection procedure in RDA, based on MonteCarlo permutation with 499 iterations, was performed todetermine the most signiﬁcant discriminating variables onthe composition of individual PLFAs and the speciﬁc soilextracellular enzyme activities, and the signiﬁcant vari-ables ( P<0.05) were used in the ﬁnal analyses. Signiﬁ-cance tests for RDA were made using CANOCO softwarefor Windows 4.5 (Biometris-Plant Research international,ª2014 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 637Y.

All data were log-trans-formed before being used in the analyses (Thoms et al.2010; Ushio et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011).Path analysis was conducted to examine the controls ofbiotic and abiotic factors on soil microbial compositionand the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating tomicrobial community structure and function. This wasmade by constructing structural equation models, knownas the path models, based on the conceptual modelshown in Fig. 1. Structural equation modeling (SEM) isan advanced multivariate statistical technique that allowsfor hypotheses testing of complex path-relation networks(Grace et al. 2007). Path models were established andseparately tested based on hypothetical connectionsbetween the dominant biotic and abiotic site factors andthe structural attributes of soil microbial communities, aswell as the linkage of the soil microbial community typeswith the function as represented by activities of soil extra-cellular enzymes involved in SOC transformation (i.e., Cacquisition) and turnover (i.e ., C oxidation). The soiltemperature, soil water content (%), soil clay content(%), SOC content (%), and soil C to N ratio (C/Nsoil)were retained to represent microclimate and soil physico-chemical properties, and the ﬁne root biomass to repre-sent plant factor. In the path model depicting thehypothesis on regulatory pathway of SOC dynamics, theMBC was considered as an early indicator of changes inSOC (Zhang et al. 2013); the abundance of bacteria andsaprophytic fungi was retained to represent the structuralattributes of soil microbial community, which correspondto an increase in C availability and recalcitrant compounddecomposition, respectively (Strickland and Rousk 2010;B/C19arcenas-Moreno et al. 2011; Cusack et al. 2011), whilethe speciﬁc activities of the hydrolytic enzyme b-glucosi-dase and the oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase wereretained to represent microbial function driving the Cacquisition and the oxidation of complex C compounds,respectively (Cusack et al. 2011).The normality of data distribution was examined forheteroscedasticity, and all bivariate relationships werechecked for signs of nonlinearities before the SEM analy-sis. These analyses were performed by using the maxi-mum-likelihood estimation procedures of Amos 17.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The adequacy of model ﬁttingwas determined by several tests, including the v2test(P>0.05, CMIN/df <2), the goodness of ﬁt (GFI) (val-ues>0.8 and <1), the root square mean error of approxi-mation (RMSEA) (values <0.05), and the comparative ﬁtindex (CFI) (values >0.9) (Grace et al. 2010; Jassey et al.2013; Zhang et al. 2013). To obtain the most parsimoni-ous model, the nonsigniﬁcant indicators and pathwayswere eliminated in the ﬁnal path model. For each set ofanalysis, R2values were obtained for each dependentmatrix, representing the proportion of total varianceexplained by the model (Grace et al. 2010).ResultsControls of site factors on soil microbialcompositionAmong the 21 biotic and abiotic site variables, nine werefound to relate signiﬁcantly with the microbial composi-tion, including % SWC, SOC, Tsoil10, % Clay, FR, C/N soil,C/N litter,N H 4-N, and NO 3-N (Table 1). The ﬁrst twocomponents of RDA axes explained 73.5% of the variancein the relationship between soil microbial compositionand the nine selective site factors.More than half of the variations in the microbial com-position are explainable jointly by the nine factors (sumof Lambda-B in Table 1).

The path analysis pointsto direct and strong positive control of C acquisitionactivity by abundance in soil bacterial community,whereas the C oxidative activity is directly controlled by apositive effect of abundance in soil saprophytic fungalcommunity and by negative effects of abundance in soilbacterial community (Fig. 5).

As microbialcommunities in soils act to either stabilize or turning overplant-derived organic carbon (Liang et al. 2011; Miltneret al. 2011), it has long remained a challenge to directlylink the soil microbial attributes with the capacity of soilcarbon sequestration. Despite a profound progress overthe past two decades in elucidating the microbial commu-nity structure as affected by site or environmental condi-tions in forest soils (H €ogberg et al. 2007; Ushio et al.2008; Thoms et al. 2010), associating the soil microbialstructure with functioning in driving soil carbon transfor-mation and turnover still occurs as an unresolved issue.In this study, by measuring a suite of complex site factorsand soil microbial-related attributes under ﬁeld condi-tions and applying multivariate analysis techniques, weexamined ecosystem-level controls on soil microbial com-munity structure and the linkage between microbial struc-ture and function in soil carbon processes. Results showthat at ecosystem level, factors relating to soil microcli-mate and fertility are the major controls on soil microbialstructure and that the soil bacterial community and sap-rophytic community play distinct roles in mediating soilcarbon processes in temperate forest ecosystem of theregion.Research to date has uncovered some of the regulationsof soil microbial community composition by individualbiotic and abiotic factors and/or their interactive effects(Bezemer et al. 2006; Thoms et al. 2010; Brockett et al.2012). However, results are inconsistent concerning thecritical drivers of differences in soil microbial structure.While the study of H €ogberg et al. (2007) shows that soilC to N ratio and pH are the major factors associated withvariations in soil microbial community structure, thestudy of Mitchell et al. (2010) suggests that plant com-munity composition better predicts changes in microbialcommunity composition than soil properties. Thomset al. (2010) found that plant community directly andindirectly affected soil microbial community compositionthrough inﬂuences on the amount and quality of litterand soil physicochemical properties. Here, we show thatsoil water, SOC, soil temperature, soil clay content, ﬁneroot mass, and soil C to N ratio are all signiﬁcant driversof variations in soil microbial community composition.We found that soil water was positively associated withthe abundance in bacterial community, especially theGram-negative bacteria community, whereas soil temper-ature was positively associated with the abundance insaprophytic fungal community and negatively with theTable 4.

Both soil temperatureand soil water have been identiﬁed as primary drivers ofvariations in soil microbial community structure in otherstudies (Hackl et al. 2005; Djukic et al. 2010; Brockettet al. 2012).Factors relating to soil fertility, that is, SOC, NH4-N,NO 3-N, and soil C to N ratio, were also found to corre-late with soil microbial community structure. Bacteria aretypically found in soils with rich SOC, whereas the rela-tive abundance of saprophytic fungal community tends toincrease with decreasing soil fertility (Grayston et al.2004; Grayston and Prescott 2005; Franklin and Mills2009; Katsalirou et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011). The C to Nratio in both soil and litter was strongly and positivelyassociated with saprophytic fungi in this study, consistentwith the ﬁndings of positive correlation between the soilC to N ratio and the fungal to bacterial ratio by others(e.g., H €ogberg et al. 2007; Fierer et al. 2009). Our ﬁndingthat high soil clay content favors the abundance of bacte-rial community and constrains the abundance of sapro-phytic fungal community is well supported by literature(e.g., H €ogberg et al. 2007; Lamarche et al. 2007; Fiereret al. 2009). Fine root mass, as a biotic factor, was foundto associate mainly with nonspeciﬁc PLFAs. The inﬂuenceof plant ﬁne root mass on soil microbial communitystructure has been considered to involve several mecha-nisms, including alteration of soil microclimate, for exam-ple, changing soil water by uptake activity or modifyingsoil physical structure by root penetration, etc. (Prescottand Grayston 2013), and production of root litter (Lo-ranger-Merciris et al. 2006; Ushio et al. 2008) and rootextrudes (Kuzyakov and Donmanski 2000; Jones et al.2004) as energy sources of soil microbial communities.Several recent studies have demonstrated that soil pHis among the primary site factors determining soil micro-bial community structure (H €ogberg et al. 2007; Sinsab-augh et al. 2008). But in the current study, soil pH wasnot identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant explanatory variable in thevariations of soil microbial community composition. Thenarrow range of soil pH at our study sites (i.e., pH value4.14 –4.73) and inclusion of more dominant site factorsmay contribute to this discrepancy.The nine dominant site factors explained only 58% ofthe total variations in soil microbial community composi-tion. The relatively low predictive power overall suggeststhere are other unaccounted factors inﬂuencing themicrobial community composition. The unexplainedvariances may possibly due to the interference of rootexudates and growth regulators (Pires et al. 2012), con-densed tannins (Ushio et al. 2010), total phenoliccompounds (Ushio et al. 2010), and factors associatedwith soil type and structure (Girvan et al. 2003; Wakelinet al. 2008).Changes in the soil microbial community compositionare likely to result in shift in the function of microbialcommunities, thus altering soil biologic and physiochemi-cal processes (Waldrop and Firestone 2006). Increases inthe abundance of soil microbial communities thatproduce hydrolytic enzymes facilitate C acquisition insupport of soil microbial primary metabolism (Cusacket al. 2011), whereas increases in the oxidative enzyme-producing microbial communities, mainly as saprophyticfungi, help with degrading complex compounds (Sylviaet al. 2004). An explicit understanding on the relationshipbetween microbial community structure and function iscrucial for predicting how shifts in microbial communitystructure may lead to changes in soil processes (Weandet al. 2010). In particular, identiﬁcation of speciﬁc soilmicrobial attributes driving SOC transformation, andturnover is a signiﬁcant step forward for gaining mecha-nistic understanding on the control of soil carbon sinkand carbon sequestration potential in forest ecosystems(Lucas et al. 2007; Acosta-Mart /C19ınez et al. 2010). With thehelp of RDA ordination, which is a well-known multivari-ate analysis technique for discriminating the relativeeffects when multiple factors are involved in regulating aspeciﬁc process, we were able to establish the relativelinkage between soil microbial community types andfunctional-speciﬁc soil extracellular enzymes. We foundthat the relative abundance in the Gram-negative bacteriaand arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities was asso-ciated with the speciﬁc activities of hydrolytic enzymesinvolved in C acquisition (i.e., b-glucosidase and cellobio-hydrolase), whereas the relative abundance in the sapro-phytic fungi community was correlated with the speciﬁcactivities of soil enzymes involved in degradation of chitin(i.e., NAGase) and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxi-dase). Gram-negative bacteria generally grow fast to com-pete for simple organic compounds (Waldrop et al. 2000)and were found in this study to signiﬁcantly relate to thespeciﬁc activity of b-glucosidase involved in the break-down of complex organic compounds into small mole-cules substrates in favor of C acquisition throughmicrobial community growth. Gram-positive bacteriawere positively correlated with cellobiohydrolase responsi-ble for degrading complex compounds (Waldrop et al.2000; Bell et al. 2009). The saprophytic fungi possess thephysiological capacity to produce phenol oxidase and per-oxidase essential in lignin depolymerization (Colpaert andLaere 1996; Courty et al. 2008), as well as to produceNAGase involved in chitin degradation (Miller et al.1998; Burke et al. 2011).Our results suggest that the complex interactionsbetween the biotic and abiotic site factors may furtherpropagate in affecting the soil microbial community func-tion involved in SOC transformation and/or turnoverª2014 The Authors.

Moreover, factors affect-ing soil microbial community structure may also imposedirect and/or indirect impacts on the microbial function,enhancing or weakening the overall controls of soilmicrobial community function by individual site factors.We used the speciﬁc activity of the soil extracellularenzymes (i.e., enzymatic per unit SOC) to assess thedynamics of SOC transformation and/or turnover in pathanalysis. Soil bacteria community was identiﬁed tostrongly regulate SOC storage although increasing themicrobial C acquisition activity. Saprophytic fungi com-munity contributes to SOC turnover by increasing themicrobial C oxidative activity. Extracellular enzyme activ-ity in soils has been studied for more than a century witha goal of understanding the biochemistry of decomposi-tion and nutrient cycling. Extracellular enzymes arewidely produced by different groups of soil microorgan-isms, and some of them can be used as indicators of thepresence or activity of speciﬁc microbial taxa (Baldrian2009). They provide useful insights into the mechanismsof microbial sensitivity to environment change (Cusacket al. 2011). The most widely assayed enzymes are thoseinvolved in the degradation of cellulose and lignin, themost abundant components of plant litter (Cusack et al.2011). Other commonly measured enzymes hydrolyzeproteins, chitin, and peptidoglycan, which are the princi-pal reservoirs of organic N (Caldwell 2005). However,none of the soil enzyme assay techniques is able to com-pletely reﬂect the in situ conditions and to measure theactual rates of enzymatic reactions (Toberman et al.2008). Quantitative PCR of gene sequences or mRNAtranscripts was recently used for quantiﬁcation of someenzyme-encoding genes, including phenoloxidase –laccase(Hassett et al. 2009; Lauber et al. 2009). However, theconnection between transcript or gene copy level andenzyme activity is indirect and is biased by genes encod-ing inactive molecules (Baldrian 2009).In summary, our study reveals complex controls of soilcarbon dynamics by various above- and below-groundprocesses and their interactive effects. Soil microbial com-munity composition is strongly inﬂuenced by water, tem-perature, SOC, ﬁne root mass, clay content, and C/Nratio in soils. Soil bacterial communities are stronglylinked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbontransformation, whereas saprophytic fungi are associatedwith activities of extracellular enzymes driving carbonoxidation. There exist complex interactions and linkageamong plant traits, microenvironment, and soil physio-chemical properties in affecting SOC via microbial regula-tions in temperate forests.AcknowledgmentsWe gratefully acknowledge the Baotianman Long-TermForest Ecosystem Research Station and BaotianmanBureau of the National Nature Reserve for logistic sup-port and site access permission.
