IntroductionSince the industrial revolution, a large amount of carbon dioxide emitted by humanproduction and living has been one of the main causes of global climate change. Inresponse to the adverse effects of climate change, nearly 200 parties worldwide signedthe Paris Agreement [ 1,2]. As a major greenhouse gases emitter, China has proposeda “national independent contribution” under the framework of the Paris Agreement,promising that carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030 and the carbon dioxideemissions per unit of GDP will decrease by 60–65% by 2030 compared with 2005 [ 3,4].The Third National Information Circular of the People’s Republic of China on ClimateChange, issued in 2019, shows the greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities in2014 were about 830 million tons equivalent to carbon equivalent, and carbon sink fromland use, land-use change and forestry was about 1.12 billion tons. Agriculture is thebasis of national economic development, and compared with the secondary and tertiaryindustries, agriculture has dual attributes of carbon emission and carbon sink. Underthe premise of ensuring food security, increasing the ACCR is of great signiﬁcance topromoting the “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals” [ 5]. In February 2022, theOpinions of the State Council of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Chinaon Promoting Rural Revitalization in 2022 was released, which is the 19th central documentfocusing on agriculture, rural areas, and farmers since the 21st century, which focuses onthe “Problems about Agriculture, Rural areas and Peasantry”. Agriculture is basic, weak,multifunctional, and public goods in nature and requires ﬁnancial support and protectionfrom the government to guarantee sustainable agricultural development [ 6]. In recent years,Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142113892 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 2 of 15China’s ﬁnancial support for agriculture has been continuously enhanced. Agriculturalﬁnancial support has increased from CNY 43.022 billion in 1995 to CNY 2242.211 billion in2019 [ 7], with an average annual growth of 17.9%. The continuous enhancement of ﬁnancialsupport for agriculture has improved agricultural infrastructure and science and technologyto a certain extent and improved the development level and international competitiveness ofChina’s agriculture [ 8]. Agricultural ﬁnancial support promotes agricultural developmentthrough direct inputs, ﬁnancial subsidies, tax incentives, and other ways. Will China’sagricultural ﬁnancial support have an impact on the ACCR while promoting agriculturaldevelopment? Clarifying the impact mechanism of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCRwill help expand the way of agricultural carbon sink increase and reduction and acceleratethe green transformation and upgrading of agriculture.There have been studies on agricultural carbon emissions, mainly focusing on thefollowing three aspects. Firstly, studies related to agricultural carbon emissions. The exist-ing studies mainly measure agricultural carbon emissions from agrarian material inputs,CH 4emissions in rice production, livestock breeding, and abnormal waste disposal [ 9]. Onthis basis, the spatial characteristics of agrarian carbon emissions [ 10,11], the relationshipbetween agricultural economic growth and agricultural carbon emissions [ 12,13], the ef-ﬁciency of agricultural carbon emissions [ 14], and the path of agrarian carbon emissionreduction [ 15] were discussed. Many studies have focused on the correlation betweenindustrial structure [ 16], agricultural technological progress [ 17], and rural human capi-tal [18]. Secondly, studies related to the carbon effect of agriculture. Due to the dual natureof agricultural carbon emissions, studies have involved the net carbon sink of agricul-ture [ 19] as well as the situations and potential of unilateral agricultural carbon sink [ 20].In view of the huge carbon sink potential of agriculture, the paths and suggestions for de-veloping carbon sink agriculture are put forward [ 21], mainly including promoting circularagriculture, promoting organic agriculture, and changing farming methods, etc. [ 22,23].Thirdly, studies related to carbon emission reduction in agriculture. It has been conﬁrmedthat technological progress in agriculture is the main driver of carbon reduction in agri-culture [ 24,25]. Advances in agricultural technology can promote the deep integration ofagrarian production resources and production methods, which helps to form an efﬁcientand low-energy consumption agricultural development model and release the potential foragricultural carbon emission reduction [26].As for the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agriculture, scholars haveconducted in-depth studies, mainly including the following three aspects. Firstly, theimpact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agricultural economic development, which ismainly veriﬁed by most scholars based on the production function model. The results showthat agricultural ﬁnancial support is conducive to promoting agricultural economic growth,and optimizing the structure of ﬁnancial support for agriculture is crucial to agriculturaleconomic development [ 27,28]. Secondly, the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial supporton the income gap between urban and rural residents. As an important element for thegovernment to guide rural development, ﬁnancial support for agriculture can promotefarmers’ income and narrow the income gap between urban and rural residents [ 29].However, some scholars believe that there will be urban bias in government ﬁnancialexpenditure allocation and unreasonable structure of ﬁnancial support to agriculture willincrease the income gap between urban and rural areas [ 30]. Thirdly, with regard to theimpact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on the environment, some studies believe thatagricultural ﬁnancial support will distort market mechanisms, leading to excessive use ofchemical-like elements and signiﬁcantly increasing agricultural surface source pollutionemissions [ 31]. However, ﬁnancial support for agriculture promotes technological progressand resource endowments, thus contributing to agricultural carbon emissions reduction.Existing studies focus on the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on carbon emis-sions; most of them are from the perspective of carbon emission without considering thedual attributes of agricultural carbon emission and carbon sink and without an in-depthanalysis of the impact mechanism of agricultural ﬁnancial support. In order to make up forSustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 3 of 15the deﬁciency of existing studies, this paper uses a spatial econometric model to explore theimpact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR under the premise of fully consideringthe spatial correlation of ACCR. This study uses the mediating effect model to verify theinﬂuencing mechanism. It is expected to provide a theoretical basis for comprehensivelyevaluating the policy effect of agricultural ﬁnancial support and promoting agriculturalemission reduction.2. Policy Background and Mechanism Analysis2.1. Policy BackgroundIn China, agriculture is a basic industry but also a weak industry, which is vulner-able to both natural disasters and market risks. China has been managing the variousrisks facing agriculture through various agricultural ﬁnancial support policies. Since 2004,China’s No.1 Central Document has focused on the “Problems about Agriculture, Ruralareas and Peasantry” for 18 consecutive years. China has implemented a series of policiesto support, beneﬁt and strengthen agriculture, and has increased investment in agricultureand gradually improved agricultural production conditions. In 2018, the Ministry of Agri-culture and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Finance released the Financial Key Policiesfor Strengthening Agriculture and Beneﬁting Farmers, which covers direct subsidies forfarmers, agricultural restructuring, and the promotion of green technologies in agriculture.In 2019, the agricultural ﬁnancial support policy focused on a green and ecological-orientedagricultural subsidy system, clarifying the new direction of future agricultural subsidyreform. The ﬁnancial support policy for agriculture emphasizes the conservation and uti-lization of agricultural resources and lays the foundation for transforming the agriculturaldevelopment mode and achieving the transformation and upgrading of the agriculturalstructure. At present, China is in a critical period of building a new economic developmentpattern and promoting common prosperity and needs to better play the role of governmentﬁnancial support. Compared to urban areas, rural ﬁnancial resources are insufﬁcient,and agricultural production infrastructure is backward. The government can improvethe overall efﬁciency of ﬁnancial resources utilization through ﬁnancial support policiesand gradually form a long-term mechanism to promote farmers’ income and agriculturalenvironment improvement.2.2. Mechanism AnalysisIn recent years, China’s agricultural ﬁnancial support has given strong support toagricultural infrastructure construction, agricultural technology investment, and subsidyof agricultural support. According to the classiﬁcation of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), agricultural subsidies are divided into agriculturalproducer support and general service support. Agricultural producer support includesprice support and direct subsidies. The price support includes the lowest price purchasepolicy and temporary purchase and storage of grain. Agricultural subsidies include in-put use subsidies, linkage subsidies, and decoupling subsidies. General service supportincludes science and technology promotion, farmer training, investment in resource andenvironmental protection, and infrastructure construction. At present, China’s agriculturalﬁnancial support has entered the stage of in-depth development, focusing on supportinggreen agriculture, rural revitalization, and agricultural science and technology innovation,and promoting the transformation of traditional agriculture to modern agriculture.2.2.1. Impact of Agricultural Financial Support on ACCRAgricultural ﬁnancial support plays an important role in enhancing the ACCR andaffects both agricultural carbon emissions and agricultural carbon sink (see Figure 1).Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 4 of 15Sustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 17   Figure 1. Impact of agricultural financial support on ACCR.  Hypothesis 1.  Agricultural financial support can effectively increase the ACCR, and this effect has spatial spillover effects.  2.2.2. Mediating Effects of Technological Progress in Agriculture  Economist Schultz pointed out in his book Transforming Traditional Agriculture  that government investment in agricultural research will accelerate the transformation of ag-ricultural technology [34]. Cohen et al. (1994) confirmed the correctness of this view that the government would promote agricultural technology progress by formulating induc-tive incentive policies [35]. The three costs  of science and technology in agricultural finan-cial support (referring to the trial production of new products, intermediate tests, and subsidies for scientific research in agricultural research departments) promote the agri-cultural technology progress  and production technology innovation, accelerate the pro-motion and application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements, and en-hance agricultural technology service capability. The expenditure on supporting agricul-ture through science and te chnology will optimize the scale and structure of agricultural production and strengthen the promotion and application of agricultural science and tech-nology. The agricultural output will be increased under the premise that the number of factors input rema ins unchanged, and agriculture will be guided to develop in the direc-tion of intensification and scale. Agricultural technological progress mainly affects agri-cultural carbon emissions through three aspects. Firstly, it improves the utilization effi-ciency of production factors. Agricultural technological progress can improve the quality and efficiency of chemical inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural film [36]. Under the condition of constant factor input, it can increase agricultural output per unit of land area, thereby reducing agricultural carbon emissions. Secondly, agricultural tech-nological progress can improve farmers’ professional and technical literacy through the learning ef fect and technology spillover effect, thereby improving agricultural production efficiency. Thirdly, agricultural technological progress improves the utilization efficiency of labor by influencing or creating new means of labor. For example, the updating o f ag-ricultural machinery technology eliminates backward agricultural machinery and equip-ment, reduces agricultural diesel consumption, and thus significantly reduces agricultural carbon emissions. Given this, we put forward:  Hypothesis 2.  Agricultural tech nical progress is the mediating variable of agricultural financial support affecting ACCR.    Figure 1. Impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR.The impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agricultural carbon emission is mainlyreﬂected in three aspects: crop production, animal management, and energy use [ 32]. First,the carbon emission reduction of agricultural crop production includes the reduction of ricecultivation and crop residue management. Technology subsidies in agricultural ﬁnancialsupport can promote the development of low-carbon rice crop technology, realize linkedprecision irrigation and drainage of rice production, and reduce methane emissions andenergy consumption during rice production. At the same time, subsidies for farmlandprotection and quality improvement in agricultural ﬁnancial support will improve theutilization rate of straw resources and the efﬁciency of crop residue management. Second,carbon emission reduction of animal management includes enteric fermentation emissionreduction and fecal management. Agricultural ﬁnancial support promotes feed process-ing enterprises to optimize feed ratios and improve feed processing, and reduce carbonemissions from animal intestinal fermentation. At the same time, agricultural ﬁnancialsupport can promote large-scale and intensive livestock production, thus helping realizethe recycling and harmless utilization of animal manure and reducing carbon emissionsgenerated in the process of manure management. Third, in terms of energy use, ﬁnancialfunds strongly support the construction of clean energy systems for agriculture, cover-ing solar, wind, biomass, and other clean energy sources, while encouraging agriculturalenterprises and farmers to use clean energy to reduce agricultural carbon emissions.The impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agricultural carbon absorption isreﬂected in agricultural land use [ 33]. Subsidies for returning farmland to forest and grassand subsidies for peatland restoration in agricultural ﬁnancial support have improvedthe coverage of forest and grass in China and rebuilt forest and grass ecology. Returningfarmland to forest and pasture to grass has made remarkable achievements in reducingsoil erosion and improving vegetation cover. At the same time, the increase in forestland area helps to increase the forest carbon sink, and its sustainable carbon sink beneﬁtsare signiﬁcant. Agricultural ﬁnancial support measures such as building high-standardfarmland and expanding the implementation area of conservation tillage in agriculturalﬁnancial support will improve the carbon sink function of farmland, thus increasing theagricultural carbon sink.In addition, agricultural ﬁnancial support not only increases the local ACCR but alsohas a spillover effect on the surrounding areas. Agricultural ﬁnancial support will promotethe spatial clustering of low-carbon factors. For example, the emission reduction andsink increase in agricultural ﬁnancial support have a demonstration effect on neighboringareas, thus speeding up the transformation of low-carbon operation mode and low-carbonefﬁciency in neighboring areas, cultivating compound green and low-carbon cycle agri-Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 5 of 15culture with efﬁcient use of resources, and realizing the low-carbon transformation ofagricultural development.Hypothesis 1. Agricultural ﬁnancial support can effectively increase the ACCR, and this effecthas spatial spillover effects.2.2.2. Mediating Effects of Technological Progress in AgricultureEconomist Schultz pointed out in his book Transforming Traditional Agriculture thatgovernment investment in agricultural research will accelerate the transformation of agri-cultural technology [ 34]. Cohen et al. (1994) conﬁrmed the correctness of this view that thegovernment would promote agricultural technology progress by formulating inductiveincentive policies [ 35]. The three costs of science and technology in agricultural ﬁnancialsupport (referring to the trial production of new products, intermediate tests, and subsi-dies for scientiﬁc research in agricultural research departments) promote the agriculturaltechnology progress and production technology innovation, accelerate the promotion andapplication of agricultural scientiﬁc and technological achievements, and enhance agricul-tural technology service capability. The expenditure on supporting agriculture throughscience and technology will optimize the scale and structure of agricultural productionand strengthen the promotion and application of agricultural science and technology. Theagricultural output will be increased under the premise that the number of factors inputremains unchanged, and agriculture will be guided to develop in the direction of intensi-ﬁcation and scale. Agricultural technological progress mainly affects agricultural carbonemissions through three aspects. Firstly, it improves the utilization efﬁciency of produc-tion factors. Agricultural technological progress can improve the quality and efﬁciencyof chemical inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural ﬁlm [ 36]. Under thecondition of constant factor input, it can increase agricultural output per unit of landarea, thereby reducing agricultural carbon emissions. Secondly, agricultural technologicalprogress can improve farmers’ professional and technical literacy through the learningeffect and technology spillover effect, thereby improving agricultural production efﬁciency.Thirdly, agricultural technological progress improves the utilization efﬁciency of labor byinﬂuencing or creating new means of labor. For example, the updating of agriculturalmachinery technology eliminates backward agricultural machinery and equipment, re-duces agricultural diesel consumption, and thus signiﬁcantly reduces agricultural carbonemissions. Given this, we put forward:Hypothesis 2. Agricultural technical progress is the mediating variable of agricultural ﬁnancialsupport affecting ACCR.3. Model and Data3.1. Variable Selection and Data Sources3.1.1. Variable Selection1. Explained variableAgricultural carbon compensation rate ( CR). The agricultural carbon compensationrate is the ratio of agricultural carbon sink to carbon emission. When the ratio equals 1, itindicates that agricultural carbon sink is equal to carbon emission. When the ratio is greaterthan 1, it indicates that the agricultural carbon sink is greater than carbon emission. Whenthe ratio is less than 1, it indicates that the agricultural carbon sink is less than agriculturalcarbon emission. The higher the ACCR, the stronger the agricultural carbon absorptioncapacity in this area. The formula for ACCR is as follows.CR =CT/CE (1)where CRis the agricultural carbon compensation rate, CTis the total carbon absorption inagriculture, and CEis the total carbon emission in agriculture.Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 6 of 15Due to the great differences in agricultural resource endowments among provinces,agricultural carbon sink, and carbon emissions vary greatly among regions. The calculationof agricultural carbon emissions includes four aspects. Firstly, the carbon emissions gener-ated by the input of agricultural materials mainly include the carbon emissions generatedby chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural ﬁlm, diesel, and irrigation power consump-tion [ 37]. Secondly, the carbon emissions generated during the rice growth cycle. Thirdly,livestock farming produces carbon emissions, mainly including the carbon emissions fromthe intestinal fermentation of ruminant feeding and manure management. Fourthly, carbonemissions from agricultural waste disposal, mainly from agricultural straw incineration.Agricultural carbon emissions are the sum of the four types of emission sources. Theformula for agricultural carbon emissions is as follows.CE =åCni=åTnidn (2)where CEis the total carbon emissions of province i.Cniis the carbon emissions ofprovince iand carbon emission sources n.Tnidenotes the different carbon emissionsources, and dndenotes the carbon emission factor. The speciﬁc carbon emission factorsrefer to Liu et al., Cui et al., and Tian et al. [38,39].Agricultural carbon sink mainly considers the carbon sink during the whole life cycleof crop growth, without considering forest land and grassland. There are two reasonsfor this: Firstly, there is no uniﬁed standard for measuring carbon sinks in woodlandsand grasslands, and the coefﬁcient values provided by different institutions vary greatly.Secondly, compared with crop cultivation, woodland and grassland are less affected byhuman activities. Agricultural carbon sink calculation mainly includes speciﬁc crop speciessuch as rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, cotton, rape, beans, sugar beets, peanuts, sugar cane,melons, and tobacco. The formula for agricultural carbon sinks is as follows.CT =åCmi=åcmYm(1 r)/HIm (3)where CTis the total carbon uptake; Cmiis the amount of carbon absorbed by province i,crop m;cmis the amount of carbon absorbed per unit of organic matter synthesized by cropmthrough photosynthesis; Ymis the economic yield of crop m;ris the water content of theeconomic product fraction of the crop; HImis the economic coefﬁcient of crop m.2. Core explanatory variableFinancial Support for Agriculture ( FS). Financial support policy for agriculture is aneffective means for the country to solve the “Problems about Agriculture, Rural areas andPeasantry” Financial support for agriculture is the sum of all ﬁnancial resources directlyor indirectly used by the government to develop agricultural production, improve therural environment and improve the living standards of farmers. China Statistical Yearbookno longer subdivides the ﬁnancial support for agriculture after 2006, and the statistics ofagriculture, forestry, and ﬁshery expenditures are calculated in agriculture, forestry, andwater affairs. Therefore, to ensure the consistency of the data scale structure within theresearch interval, this paper uses the agriculture, forestry, and water affairs expendituresafter 2006 for the analysis in the empirical process.3. Mediator variableTechnological progress in agriculture ( TL). Drawing on existing research, this studyadopts the agricultural mechanization level to measure agricultural technology’s progress.There are two main reasons for this: ﬁrstly, China’s current agricultural machinery-basedtechnology has evolved into a leading technology, and the improvement of the agriculturalmechanization level will optimize the combination of agricultural input factors, thereby im-proving agricultural productivity. Secondly, agricultural ﬁnancial support will improve thelevel of agricultural mechanization through agricultural machinery purchase subsidies andagricultural science and technology investment. Considering the variability of agriculturalSustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 7 of 15production scale in each province, this paper uses the ratio of total agricultural machinerypower to the agricultural sown area to measure the level of agricultural mechanization.4. Control variablesAgricultural chemical inputs ( CI). Agricultural chemical inputs generally includepesticides, fertilizers, agricultural ﬁlms, etc. When measuring carbon emissions fromagriculture, carbon emissions from fertilizers account for a larger proportion of the totalemissions of agricultural chemical inputs. Therefore, the ratio of discounted fertilizer tocrop sown area is used to express agricultural chemical inputs. The scale of grain planting(GF). In the process of grain planting, the tillage operation, material input, waste disposal,etc., will produce carbon emissions. In general, the larger the scale of grain planting, themore carbon emissions will generate. In this paper, we use grain sown area to measurethe scale of grain planting. Level of agricultural economic development ( AE). The ratio ofthe total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and ﬁshery to the ruralpopulation is used to express the level of agricultural economic development, which willaffect the market maturity of agricultural products and agricultural production factorsand can inﬂuence the structure of agricultural production and agricultural productionfactor inputs, thus affects ACCR. Agricultural ﬁxed assets investment ( FA). The increasein investment in agricultural ﬁxed assets helps to improve agricultural infrastructure andreduce factor inputs per unit of output, which may affect ACCR. The income level of ruralresidents ( IN) is measured by the net income of rural residents. Sectoral proportionaloptimization index ( ST) is expressed by the ratio of non-planting output value to the totaloutput value of agriculture, forestry, and ﬁshery output.3.1.2. Data SourcesThis paper selects panel data from 31 provinces in mainland China (excluding HongKong, Macao, and Taiwan due to missing data) from 2006–2019. ACCR data were obtainedfrom our calculations. Data on agricultural ﬁnancial support, agricultural mechanizationlevel, and other control variables were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook and ChinaRural Statistical Yearbook .

Model Setting3.2.1. Spatial Durbin ModelTo accurately reﬂect the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on the ACCR, thisstudy constructs a spatial panel regression model based on the adjacent spatial weightmatrix and the geographic distance spatial weight matrix. LM (lag), LM (error), RobustLM (lag), and Robust LM (error) tests were all signiﬁcant at the 1% level of signiﬁcance.Both LR and Wald tests reject the original hypothesis at the 1% level, i.e., the spatial Durbinmodel cannot degenerate into a spatial lag model and a spatial error model. After the abovetests, this paper selects the spatial Durbin model with two-way ﬁxed effects for empiricalSustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 8 of 15analysis. In order to make the data stable, all explanatory variables are logarithmic. Themodel is set as follows.lnCR =rWlnCR +a0+tlnFS+gControl +jWlnFS+qWControl +mit(4)where r,j, and qrepresent the agricultural carbon emissions of neighboring cities, agri-cultural ﬁnancial support, and the intensity of inﬂuence of control variables on localagricultural carbon emission, respectively.

In this paper, we use the neighboring matrix andthe inverse geographic distance matrix as the spatial weight matrix. The main diagonalelements of the spatial weight matrix are all 0.

Mediating Effect ModelFrom the theoretical analysis section, it is clear that agricultural ﬁnancial supportmay affect the ACCR through agricultural technological progress. Based on the interme-diary effect test steps, the intermediary effect of technological progress in agriculture isidentiﬁed [40]. The model is set as follows.lnCR =rWlnCR +a0+t1lnFS+gControl +jWlnFS+gWControl +mit (5)lnTL =rWlnTL+a0+qlnFS+gControl +jWlnFS+gWControl +mit (6)lnCR =rWlnCR +a0+t2lnFS+dlnML +gControl +jWlnFS+lWlnML+gWControl +mit(7)where Mis the mediating variable, and the other explanatory variables are the same as in model (4) .The steps of the mediating effect test are as follows. Firstly, the intensity of agricultural ﬁnancialsupport is regressed on the ACCR to test the signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcient t1. Secondly, the intensityof agricultural ﬁnancial support was regressed on the agricultural technological progress variable totest the signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcient q. Finally, the intensity of agricultural ﬁnancial support andagricultural technological progress variables are regressed on the ACCR simultaneously. When bothqanddare signiﬁcant, if t2is signiﬁcant, it indicates that agricultural technological progress has apartial mediating effect, and if t2is not signiﬁcant, it means that agricultural technological progresshas a complete mediating effect.4. Empirical Results and Analysis4.1. Result of ACCR Measurement4.1.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of ACCRTo show more intuitively the spatial differences of China’s ACCR, this study divided theexamination period into two periods: 2006–2012 and 2012–2019. The results were plotted as shown inFigure 2. In general, the provinces with low ACCR remained stable during the study period, andthe regions with higher rates showed an expansion trend, indicating that China’s ACCR was onthe rise in general. Speciﬁcally, the provinces with high ACCR in 2006 were mainly distributed inXinjiang, Jilin, Shanxi, Henan, Guangxi, etc. The area of provinces with high ACCR in 2019 wasexpanded, mainly distributed in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi,Henan, Shandong, and Guangxi.Thirteen provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan,Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Heilongjiang are classiﬁed as major grain-producing areas, whileother provinces are classiﬁed as non-major grain-producing areas concerning the regulations of theState Food Bureau of China. From the comparison results of grain-producing regions, the ACCR in2006–2019 was signiﬁcantly higher in grain-planting regions than in non-grain-planting regions. It isworth noting that Jiangxi and Hunan, which are major grain-producing regions, have lower ACCR,which may be due to the fact that both provinces are large rice-growing provinces. Compared withother food crops, rice emits more CO 2during its growth cycle.Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 9 of 15Sustainability 2022 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW  9 of 17  4. Empirical Results and Analysis  4.1. Result of ACCR Measurement  4.1.1. Spatial Distribution Characteristics of ACCR  To show more intuitively the spatial differences of China’s ACCR, this  study divided the examination period into two periods: 2006 –2012 and 2012 –2019. The results were plot-ted as shown in Figure 2. In general, the provinces with low ACCR remained stable during the study period, and the regions with higher rates showed an exp ansion trend, indicating that China’s ACCR was on the rise in general. Specifically, the provinces with high ACCR in 2006 were mainly distributed in Xinjiang, Jilin, Shanxi, Henan, Guangxi, etc. The area of provinces with high ACCR in 2019 was expanded, ma inly distributed in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Guangxi.  Thirteen provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Hu-nan, Sichuan, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Heilongjia ng are classified as major grain -producing areas, while other provinces are classified as non -major grain -producing areas concerning the regulations of the State Food Bureau of China. From the comparison results of grain -producing regions, the ACCR in 2006 –2019 was significantly higher in grain -planting regions than in non -grain -planting regions. It is worth noting that Jiangxi and Hunan, which are major grain -producing regions, have lower ACCR , which may be due to the fact that both provinces are large ric e-growing provinces. Compared with other food crops, rice emits more CO 2 during its growth cycle.   Figure 2. Spatial distribution of ACCR.  4.1.2.

Local spatial autocorrelation is used to describe the distribution location of the clusteringof geospatial units with similar attributes, and the speciﬁc formula is omitted [41].The spatial econometric model is applied on the premise that the value of an attribute on a spatialunit is correlated with the same attribute on an adjacent spatial unit. Therefore, before analyzing theimpact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on the ACCR, this study needs to verify whether the twovariables are spatially correlated. The overall spatial correlation results of ACCR and agriculturalﬁnancial support from 2006 to 2019 are shown in Table 2. The global spatial correlation test showsthat ACCR and agricultural ﬁnancial support show a signiﬁcant positive spatial correlation for allyears under the inverse geographic distance spatial weight matrix, indicating that the spillover effectsof ACCR and agricultural ﬁnancial support are signiﬁcant in terms of geographic distance. From thetime dimension, the spatial correlation of ACCR shows a ﬂuctuating upward trend. It indicates thatthe spatial correlation of ACCR is gradually increasing while the spatial correlation of agriculturalﬁnancial support is gradually decreasing.Table 2.

Analysis of the Impact of Financial Support to Agriculture on ACCRThe spatial correlation test of the ACCR above fully proves that the ACCR has a signiﬁcantspatial correlation. If this is not considered in the model construction, the model estimation resultsmay be greatly biased. Therefore, this paper introduces a spatial econometric model, and after theHausman test, this study chooses a two-way ﬁxed-effects spatial Durbin model.To investigate the effect of ﬁnancial support to agriculture on the ACCR, this paper uses aspatial Durbin model to regress agricultural ﬁnancial support and other explanatory variables basedon the adjacency weight matrix and geographic distance matrix. Due to the introduction of the spatialweight matrix, the model is no longer endogenous and overcomes the shortcomings of biased orinvalid OLS estimation results of traditional econometric models, as shown in Table 3.Table 3.

Numbers in parentheses arerobust standard errors.Columns (1) and (2) show the results of the model estimation under the adjacency weightmatrix and the geographic distance weight matrix, respectively. It can be seen that the coefﬁcients ofagricultural ﬁnancial support are all signiﬁcantly positive at the 5% signiﬁcance level, which provesthe robustness of the study ﬁndings. Due to the space limitation, this study uses the geographicdistance weight matrix for analysis. At the national level, the effect of agricultural ﬁnancial supporton the ACCR in column (2) is positive and signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This suggests that agriculturalﬁnancial support signiﬁcantly increases the ACCR; for every 1% increase in agricultural ﬁnancialsupport intensity, the ACCR will increase by 0.0281%. Hypothesis one is veriﬁed. At the regional level,the effect of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR has signiﬁcant variability. It shows a signiﬁcantpositive effect in the eastern region and a non-signiﬁcant effect in the central and western regions.The main reasons are as follows. Firstly, the efﬁciency of the use of agricultural ﬁnancial supportfunds is higher in the eastern regions than in the central and western regions. The fragmentation ofagricultural support funds will increase administrative costs and make it difﬁcult to form a synergisticeffect to support agricultural development. It has a greater negative impact on the central and westernregions with insufﬁcient funds, reducing the scale efﬁciency of capital use in the central and westernregions. Secondly, the investment of agricultural ﬁnancial support funds is unbalanced. The scale ofagricultural ﬁnancial support investment in the eastern region is large, while the scale of input in thecentral and western regions is small, and there is a large gap in agricultural ﬁnancial support funds.Coupled with the unreasonable structure of administrative expenditure and productive expenditure,it is difﬁcult to have an impact on the rate of agricultural carbon compensation.4.3. Direct, Indirect, and Total EffectsAccording to Lesage and Elhorst [ 42,43], the regression coefﬁcients of the spatial Durbin modelcan not fully reﬂect the effect of the explanatory variables on the explained variables, and theirtotal, direct, and indirect effects need to be calculated. Direct effects reﬂect the effects of changesSustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 11 of 15in explanatory variables on the explained variables of the local spatial unit. Indirect effects reﬂectthe effects of changes in explanatory variables on the explanatory variables of adjacent spatial units.The speciﬁc results are shown in Table 4. In terms of the direct effect, agricultural ﬁnancial supporthas a positive effect on the ACCR, and it is signiﬁcant at the 1% level of signiﬁcance, indicatingthat the increase in local agricultural ﬁnancial support helps to enhance the local ACCR. In termsof indirect effects, although the effect of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR is positive, it is notsigniﬁcant, indicating that the “demonstration effect” of local agricultural ﬁnancial support intensityon neighboring provinces is not obvious. In terms of the overall effect, the effect of agriculturalﬁnancial support on the ACCR is positive at the 10% signiﬁcance level; that is, overall, the increase inthe intensity of agricultural ﬁnancial support has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the ACCR.Table 4.

Testing the Mediating Effects of Technological Progress in AgricultureFrom the results of the mediating effect test in Table 5, it is clear that agricultural technologyprogress plays a mediating role in the process in the process of agricultural ﬁnancial support affectingACCR. From the regression results, ﬁrstly, without considering the effect of mediating variables,the effect of agricultural ﬁnancial support on the ACCR is signiﬁcantly positive. Secondly, the coreexplanatory variable ln FShas a signiﬁcant positive effect on the mediating variable, indicatingthat agricultural ﬁnancial support has a positive contribution to agricultural technological progress.Thirdly, after including the mediating variables, the effect of agricultural technology progress on theACCR is signiﬁcantly positive, which indicates that agricultural technology progress may reduceagricultural carbon emission by changing the factor structure and improving agricultural productionefﬁciency and may also increase agricultural carbon absorption by increasing the planting area of foodcrops, thereby promoting the improvement of ACCR. The effect of the core explanatory variable ln FSon the ACCR is positive, and the absolute value and signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcient have decreased.It indicates that the positive effect of agricultural technological progress on ACCR has a partialmediating effect. Hypothesis 2 was tested.Table 5.

Much of theliterature focus on agricultural carbon emission, but less attention has been paid to the carbon sinkeffect of agriculture. In addition to affecting agricultural output, agricultural ﬁnancial support canalso regulate agricultural carbon emissions and carbon sink by inﬂuencing the production decisionbehavior of farmers. There are few studies linking agricultural ﬁnancial support and the agriculturaldual carbon effect. Based on clarifying the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agriculture’sdual carbon effect, this study brings agricultural ﬁnancial support, agricultural technological progress,and ACCR into the same framework. The spatial Durbin model is used to examine the inﬂuence pathsof agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR and explain the mediating effect played by agriculturaltechnological progress in it.Agricultural ﬁnancial support is of great signiﬁcance to the development of low-carbon agri-culture. The government should not only focus on the short-term impact of agricultural ﬁnancialsupport on carbon emission reduction but also pay attention to the transformation path of low-carbonoperation mode of micro-farmers under the incentive of agricultural ﬁnancial support so as to givefull play to its long-term impact. At the same time, it is necessary to explore multiple realizationmechanisms of agricultural low-carbon development, such as market-oriented mechanisms of low-carbon development, to stimulate the vitality and efﬁciency of the market and promote agriculturalcarbon emission reduction at a low cost.This study has several limitations. First, the agricultural ﬁnancial support is expressed in termsof agricultural, forestry, and water affairs expenditure rather than purely agricultural expenditure,which can only be an approximate proxy for the scale of ﬁscal agricultural expenditure. Second, whenstudying the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on agricultural carbon offset rate, there is a lackof agricultural ﬁnancial support data at the farm household level, but the purpose of this paper isto explain and illustrate the scientiﬁc aspects of the study. The empirical results of this paper canlead to revealing conclusions. In the future, agricultural ﬁnancial support data at the household levelcan be further used to study the impact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR and then verifythe robustness of the conclusion of this study. Third, in terms of the selection of the spatial weightmatrix, the spatial spillover effect of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR is not obvious under theinverse geographic distance spatial weight matrix, and it fails to reﬂect the temporal change of theimpact of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR at the same time, which can be further analyzed byintroducing spatio-temporal weight matrix in the future.Despite these limitations, the ﬁndings of this paper have certain reference signiﬁcance for thedevelopment of low-carbon agriculture. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of ﬁnancial supportfor agriculture. To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in agriculture, it is important to considerthe implementation of effective agricultural ﬁnancial support policies in China and to consider thebalance of localities. It should be noted, however, that those different countries have different ﬁscalstructures and agricultural development strategies; therefore, the ﬁndings of this paper may notapply to other countries and regions.6. ConclusionsBased on panel data for 31 provinces in China from 2006 to 2019, this paper investigatesthe effects of agricultural ﬁnancial support on ACCR and the mediating effects of agriculturaltechnological progress. The study shows that: (1) ACCR has a signiﬁcant spatial correlation underthe spatial weight matrix of geographical distance, and the ACCR has an overall increasing trend;(2) agricultural ﬁnancial support has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the ACCR, but this effect hasobvious heterogeneity in the eastern, central, and western regions, with the most signiﬁcant effect ofagricultural ﬁnancial support on the ACCR in the eastern region; (3) agricultural ﬁnancial supporthas a spatial spillover effect on the ACCR, but it is insigniﬁcant; (4) agricultural technology progressplays a signiﬁcant mediating role in the process of agricultural ﬁnancial support affecting ACCR.Based on the above conclusions, the following countermeasures are proposed.First, coordinate inter-regional emission reduction and sink enhancement policies and promotethe formation of a synergistic linkage mechanism between emission reduction and sink enhancementpolicies in the region. When formulating agricultural emission reduction and sink policies, the spatialcorrelation of agricultural carbon compensation rates among regions should be fully considered.For example, according to the spatial correlation characteristics of carbon emission reduction, the“lead-follow” type of synergistic emission reduction strategy should be implemented, and the leadingregion should actively explore agricultural technologies to promote emission reduction and sinkincrease, fully explore favorable factors that promote regional emission reduction and sink increase,Sustainability 2022 ,14, 13892 13 of 15explore diversiﬁed paths of emission reduction and sink increase, and at the same time promoteagricultural carbon emission reduction in the follow region through technology transfer and ﬁnancialinvestment, etc., so as to promote a long-term mechanism for collaborative emission reduction.Second, innovate ﬁnancial support for agriculture, and strengthen the green cycle orientation ofﬁnancial support to agriculture. Firstly, innovate the allocation mechanism of ﬁnancial support foragriculture, increase the tilt to green cycle agriculture in the use of ﬁnancial support for agriculture,give full play to the guiding and supporting role of ﬁnancial support for agriculture, and improve theecological beneﬁts of the use of ﬁnancial support for agriculture. Secondly, improve the long-termincentive mechanism of ﬁnancial support for agriculture, improve the green recycling agricultureproduction subsidy system, give full play to the environmental protection effect of agriculturalsubsidies, and promote low-carbon agricultural development by supporting the comprehensiveutilization of agricultural waste, promoting the reduction of agricultural chemicals and increasing ef-ﬁciency, and implementing green breeding and recycling agriculture pilot measures. Thirdly, explorethe withdrawal mechanism of ﬁnancial support for agriculture, adapt to the needs of the marketeconomy operation, gradually weaken the direct support for agricultural production and operation,and instead increase the ﬁnancial support for agricultural ecological protection, agricultural scienceand technology projects, green breeding and recycling agricultural pilot construction, agriculturalinfrastructure construction, etc.Third, a differentiated agricultural ﬁnancial support strategy is implemented to achieve abalanced regional development of low-carbon agriculture. From this study, agricultural ﬁnancialsupport has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the ACCR in the eastern region, while the westernand central regions are not signiﬁcant. Therefore, the eastern region can increase environmentalprotection expenditures to further expand the emission reduction and sink effect. The central andwestern regions need to highlight the guidance of ﬁnancial support on agricultural technologyinnovation, set up special funds for agricultural technology promotion, and increase subsidies foragricultural production and operation entities to apply new technologies and promote low-carbonagricultural production.Fourth, the policy radiation effect of ﬁnancial support to agriculture is brought into play tostrengthen the linkage and coordination of the impact of ﬁnancial support policies on the dual carboneffect of agriculture. The research results show that the current spillover effect of ﬁscal support foragriculture on the agricultural carbon compensation rate is not signiﬁcant. Therefore, provincesshould fully realize that the effect of encouraging ﬁscal support policies for agriculture may beoffset by the spatial spillover effect in the surrounding areas, pay attention to the synchronization ofagricultural support policies, and promote the areas with high efﬁciency of the ﬁscal support policyfor agriculture to radiate to low-lying areas, so as to effectively promote the regional ACCR.Fifth, promote the level of environment-friendly agricultural mechanization and increases theeconomic and ecological beneﬁts of agricultural production. The empirical results show that agricul-tural ﬁnancial support plays a signiﬁcant role in promoting the ACCR through technological progress,which is mainly manifested in the improvement of the agricultural machinery level. Improving thelevel of agricultural mechanization helps to achieve accurate control of agricultural input factors,improve agricultural efﬁciency, reduce resource consumption, and promote agricultural large-scaleand intensive production. First, we should improve the agricultural machinery purchase subsidypolicy, focus on the low-carbon transformation of agriculture, and strengthen the application ofresource-saving agricultural machinery technology. Second, we should strengthen the constructionof agricultural mechanization infrastructures, such as the construction of machine roads and agricul-tural machinery storage sheds, etc., improve the operating conditions of agricultural machinery, andenhance the scale of agricultural machinery cultivation.Author Contributions: X.N.: conceptualization, methodology, software.
