We synthesize current results and propose the new Rhizo-Engine framework consisting of two linked components: microbial turnover and the soilphysicochemical matrix. The Rhizo-Engine is driven by rhizodeposition, root turnover, and plantuptake of nutrients and water, thereby accelerating SOC turnover through both stabilization anddestabilization mechanisms. This Rhizo-Engine framework emphasizes the need for a moreholistic approach to study root-driven SOC dynamics. This framework would provide betterunderstanding of plant root effects on soil carbon sequestration and the sensitivity of SOC stocksto climate and land-use changes.I. IntroductionThe interplay between plant roots and the soil in which plant rootsgrow, often referred to as rhizosphere processes, has been a mainresearch focus within the disciplines of plant and soil sciences. Eversince the concept rhizosphere was coined more than a hundredyears ago (Hiltner, 1904), the deﬁnition of the rhizosphere (Box 1)has been constantly evolving and expanding and often been tailoredto suit the context of individual studies (Luster et al., 2009). Forexample, the spatial extent of the rhizosphere in some workingdeﬁnitions may range from a few millimeters of the root surfaceand, depending on root density, to as large as the entire rooting zoneof all vegetated ecosystems on earth, harboring pivotal functions inthe earth system. For instance, some estimates suggest thatrhizosphere processes at the global scale may release 3 –10 timesmore CO2than fossil fuel burning by human activities (Hopkinset al., 2013), or c.30–60% of global primary production on land(Friedlingstein et al., 2019), and fundamentally regulate manyaspects of biogeochemical cycles (Finzi et al., 2015). Given therecognized functional importance of the rhizosphere, understand-ing of how plant roots and associated rhizosphere processes mayregulate the soil carbon (C) cycle, particularly in relation to climatechange, has increasingly gained attention.The root –soil organic carbon paradoxIn general plant roots control and inﬂuence soil organic carbon(SOC) dynamics by providing organic C to the soil primarily in the60 New Phytologist (2021) 230: 60–65 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comReviewforms of root litter and rhizodeposition (Box 1). This C inputresults in SOC gain, particularly when plant roots promote SOCstabilization (Box 1). However, roots can also promote SOCdestabilization (Box 1), exposing previously protected C tomicrobial decomposition causing SOC loss. In most cases, therole of plant roots contributing to SOC stabilization has beenstudied in isolation from their role in contributing to destabiliza-tion. As a consequence, there exists an apparent paradox (Fig. 1):results from studies on SOC stabilization by plant roots convinc-ingly suggest that roots stabilize or increase SOC, and reduce SOCloss (Schmidt et al., 2011; Slessarev et al., 2020); whereas, anemerging body of results from other studies shows that plant rootsdestabilize SOC and accelerate SOC decomposition (Hartley et al.,2012; Cheng et al., 2014). In this Tansley insight we summarize keyrecent developments for both sides of this apparent paradox andprovide a new framework integrating current knowledge about rooteffects on SOC dynamics.II. Root-driven SOC stabilizationIt has become increasingly clear that organic matter inputs fromroots tend to contribute to SOC stabilization signiﬁcantly more thanaboveground plant inputs (Rasse et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2017).The scope and fundamental mechanisms of root-driven SOCstabilization has been recently reviewed (Poirier et al., 2018) anddeliberated in terms of the three widely known SOC stabilizationpathways, i.e. biochemical recalcitrance, mineral adsorption, andphysical inaccessibility (or disconnect) (Sollins et al., 1996; Schmidtet al., 2011), and here we only highlight recent advances.Recently, Lavallee et al. (2020) recommended to separate soilorganic matter (SOM) into particulate organic matter (POM,Box 1) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM, Box 1).Root litter tends to be more recalcitrant than leaf litter (e.g. Xiaet al., 2015) and may therefore contribute more to POM, whichcould particularly accumulate in soil environments with lowoxygen and temperature (e.g. arctic and alpine ecosystems), or onceit is thermally altered by ﬁre. However, SOM has usually a longerresidence time once organic matter is stabilized through adsorptiononto minerals forming MAOM (Lavallee et al., 2020).There is now mounting evidence that labile C inputs areparticularly efﬁcient in stabilizing C. In their Microbial Efﬁciency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework Cotrufo et al. (2013)argued that MAOM is predominantly formed from microbialproducts. Because labile or ‘high quality’ plant C inputs are moreefﬁciently transformed into microbial products than ‘low quality’plant litter, more of the high-quality plant C inputs remain in thesoil and ultimately are stabilized through sorption onto soilminerals. This has also been referred to as the microbial necromass‘entombing effect’ (Liang et al., 2017), and further suggests thatSOC stabilization rates relate to microbial turnover rates. Recently,it was suggested that microbial products derived from rhizodepo-sition are more efﬁciently transformed into MAOM compared tomicrobial products derived from root and shoot litter (Sokol &Bradford, 2019; Sokol et al., 2019). This entombing effect onstabilizing SOC from rhizodeposition may therefore be moreprominent in ecosystems where there is greater production of labileC (or high energy yielding substrates) in the rhizosphere, such as inecosystems with fast growing acquisitive plant species (Henneronet al., 2020), and in ecosystems dominated by trees associated witharbuscular mycorrhizas than trees associated with ectomycorrhizas(Craig et al., 2018).Roots can contribute to SOC stabilization by forming soilaggregates thereby making SOC less accessible to microbialdecomposition, but can also contribute to SOC destabilizationthrough aggregate destruction, discussed later in section III. Rootgrowth and death can further engineer the soil by altering thedistribution of soil pores thereby affecting micro-environments formicrobes to grow and inﬂuence both SOC stabilization anddestabilization. For instance, using a combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping it was shown thatmore diverse plant communities stimulated development of poreswith 30 –150µm radii that had the largest enzyme activity, and itwas suggested that those pores were particularly important for theproduction of microbially processed C and stabilization of soil C(Kravchenko et al., 2019).III. Root-driven SOC destabilizationWhile root-driven SOC stabilization is increasingly recognized,paradoxically SOC destabilization by plant roots has also emergedas a crucial aspect of soil C dynamics. The majority of publishedreports demonstrating SOC destabilization by plant roots is relatedBox 1 GlossaryMineral associated organic matter (MAOM): Organic matter adsorbed to soil minerals and thereby protected from further microbial decomposition.Particulate organic matter (POM): Organic matter of partly undecomposed or charred plant litter and decomposed microbial products that are notadsorbed to soil minerals.Rhizodeposition: organic material released from plant roots including exudates, sloughed cells and mucilage. It can also include mycorrhizal biomassdepending on how it is measured (e.g. it is often included in carbon isotope-based methods).Rhizosphere: the region of soil that is directly inﬂuenced by rhizodeposition, root growth and death, and nutrient and water uptake.Rhizosphere priming effect (RPE): the stimulation (or occasionally suppression) of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition by live roots and associatedrhizosphere organisms when compared to SOM decomposition from rootless soils under the same environmental conditions.Soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization: any process that makes SOC persist longer and decompose at a much slower rate than the unstabilized SOC.SOC destabilization: any process that activates stabilized SOC./C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist TrustNew Phytologist (2021) 230: 60–65www.newphytologist.comNewPhytologist Tansley insight Review 61 14698137, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17082 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseto the phenomenon called rhizosphere priming effect (RPE, Box 1).While there are several hypotheses explaining the RPE, rhizode-position is considered as one of the main factors, where it is used as asubstrate by a speciﬁc set of microbes, thereby enhancing SOCdecomposition by other microbes (Cheng et al., 2014; Huo et al.,2017). Similar to the entombing effect described earlier, themagnitude of the RPE is to a large degree controlled byrhizodeposition effects on microbial turnover (Yin et al., 2019).The magnitude of SOC destabilization by plant roots as gauged bythe RPE may range widely from 380% enhancement to 50%reduction as compared to the decomposition rates from root-freesoils (Zhu & Cheng, 2011; Cheng et al., 2014). In a studycombining empirical values of the RPE, root morphology anddistribution with a numerical model, it was suggested that root-driven SOC destabilization may account for one-third of the totalSOC mineralization in temperate forest soils (Finzi et al., 2015).Besides these direct effects on microbial activity, rhizodepositioncan also indirectly enhance the RPE by chemically liberating C andexposing fresh C to microbial decomposition. For instance, organicacids released by plants can break up bonds or ‘bridges’ betweenorganic structures formed by polyvalent metals (iron (Fe),aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca)) thereby destabilizing SOC andexposing smaller fragments to microbial decomposition (Clarholmet al., 2015). Moreover, these organic acids produced by roots candestabilize MAOM, where organic acids liberate organic matterfrom mineral surfaces and increase their microbial access anddecomposition (Keiluweit et al., 2015).As mentioned earlier, roots can form and destroy aggregatesthereby exposing previously protected C to microbial decompo-sition (Six et al., 2000). For instance, roots produce extracellularpolymeric substances that can enhance soil aggregation (Sher et al.,2020), or take up water thereby intensifying drying –rewettingcycles in soils, which can result in breakage of existing aggregatesand formation of new ones, particularly in more heavy-texturedsoils. In recent studies less aggregates were observed in soil grownwith plants after a period of time, and where the net destruction inaggregates resulted in a RPE (Lu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020).However, a limitation with this approach is that roots not onlydestroy aggregates, but also form new aggregates, often incombination with mycorrhizal hyphae. While destruction ofaggregates can result in enhanced decomposition of previouslyexposed SOC, formation of aggregates can incorporate and protectexisting SOC as well as C from rhizodeposition. Therefore, netchanges in soil aggregation induced by root growth underestimatethe real contribution of aggregate turnover to SOC loss and SOCgain. Recently, rare earth oxides (REOs) were used to assess theturnover of aggregates in soil (Peng et al., 2017). When combinedwith C isotope methods that can assess C sources and transforma-tions, the REO tracing method would be a powerful method to linkroot-induced aggregate turnover to RPEs.Uptake of nitrogen (N) by plant roots can further destabilizeSOC by increasing microbial demand for N so that microbes userhizodeposition to mine for N contained in SOM that is relativelyrich in N (Craine et al., 2007; Dijkstra et al., 2013; Boilard et al.,2019). Microbial mining for N causing enhanced SOC decompo-sition would particularly occur under conditions when availablesoil N (N that can be directly taken up by microbes) is low, althoughthe opposite may also occur, where under low available Nconditions competition for N between plants and microbesbecomes more severe thereby reducing microbial activity andRoot effectscausing SOC gain• Production of new carbon Organo-mineral complexation Aggregate formationCO2Root effectscausing SOC loss Decomposition of old carbon Organo-mineral decomplexation Aggregate destructionSoil organic carbon Soil organic carbonFig. 1 The root –soil organic carbon (SOC) paradox. Roots can cause SOC stabilization (resulting in SOC gain) through formation of new carbon (C), andpromotion of organo-mineral complexation and aggregate formation, but can also cause SOC destabilization (resulting in SOC loss) through enhancin g old Cdecomposition, and promoting organo-mineral decomplexation and aggregate destruction.New Phytologist (2021) 230: 60–65 /C2112020 The AuthorsNew Phytologist /C2112020 New Phytologist Trust www.newphytologist.comReview Tansley insightNewPhytologist 62 14698137, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17082 by National Cheng Kung University, Wiley Online Library on [18/04/2023].

Mining for N couldpotentially be more efﬁcient with destabilization of MAOM, giventhat it is richer in N and has lower activation energies compared toPOM (Lavallee et al., 2020). Preference for root N uptake asammonium cation (NH4+) over nitrate (NO 3/C0) and exudation oforganic acids that result in rhizosphere acidiﬁcation, could furtherinhibit the RPE (Wang et al., 2016; Wang & Tang, 2018).IV. The Rhizo-Engine frameworkFrom the earlier-mentioned, a picture emerges showing that plantroots strongly accelerate both SOC stabilization (resulting in SOCgain) and destabilization (resulting in SOC loss), illustrating therelevance of biological, chemical and physical mechanisms in therhizosphere due to the action of rhizodeposition, root turnover, anduptake of nutrients and water (Hinsinger et al., 2009). To betterunderstand SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, we thereforeargue that both SOC stabilization and destabilization mechanismscausing accelerated SOC turnover by plant roots need to beconsidered. Here we describe a new framework: the Rhizo-Engineframework (Fig. 2).The Rhizo-Engine is driven by the three modes of plant action:rhizodeposition, root turnover, and uptake of nutrients and water.The ‘Engine’ has two key components or ‘gears’ that affect the rateof SOC stabilization and destabilization: the microbial turnovercomponent, which includes microbial growth, death, and mycor-rhizal interactions, and the physicochemical matrix component,which includes mechanisms related to organo-mineral complexa-tion and soil structural and aggregate dynamics (but excludesbiochemical recalcitrance mechanisms of SOC stabilization). Thetwo components are linked together, where the microbial turnoveris responsible for C decomposition and production of microbialnecromass and other decomposition products, while the physic-ochemical matrix is directly responsible for SOC stabilization anddestabilization. The microbial turnover is fueled by C from plantlitter and rhizodeposition, but also gets its C from unprotectedorganic matter (i.e. POM not in aggregates including recycledmicrobial necromass), and protected organic matter (C in MAOMand aggregates) supplied by the physicochemical matrix. Some ofthe decomposition products from microbial turnover ﬂows backinto the unprotected SOC, but some of the C fuels thephysicochemical matrix to stabilize and destabilize SOC.Using this framework, we envision several potential scenarios(Fig. 3). In the ﬁrst scenario, rhizodeposition and root action modescan accelerate the microbial turnover to increase decompositionand production of microbial products, but without affecting thephysicochemical matrix. This scenario would occur where there isno potential to stabilize SOC into MOAM or aggregates, such as insandy soils. Only unprotected SOC is affected by roots, and becauseC ﬂowing in and out of this pool can be large, we refer to this as theSusceptible scenario (Fig. 3a). A second scenario, the Destabilizingscenario is where plant roots accelerate the microbial turnover andproduction of unprotected SOC, and accelerate SOC destabiliza-tion by the physicochemical matrix and subsequent decompositionby the microbial turnover component (Fig. 3b). This replacementof protected SOC with unprotected SOC could occur in soils thatare C saturated, i.e. in soils where the maximum protective capacitythrough physicochemical pathways has been reached (Six et al.,2002). By contrast, a third scenario, in soils where this maximumhas not been reached yet, the Stabilizing scenario could occur,where plant roots accelerate stabilization of SOC, but at the sametime can accelerate decomposition of unprotected SOC (Fig. 3c). Afourth scenario is where soils are C saturated, where plant rootscontinuously destabilize SOC, but at the same time replace thedestabilized C with stabilization of new microbial products frommicrobial turnover. Because this scenario involves stabilization anddestabilization of protected SOC only, we refer to this as theResistant scenario (Fig. 3d).We emphasize that potentially large changes in SOC stabiliza-tion and destabilization may be concealed by relatively smaller netchanges in soil C pools, for instance, in response to climate andPMUnprotectedProtectedSOCPlant carbon input: Litter RhizodepositionCO2Root action modes: Rhizodeposition Root turnover Nutrient and water uptakeFig. 2 The Rhizo-Engine framework. The Rhizo-Engine has two keycomponents driving soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization anddestabilization: microbial turnover (M) and the physicochemical matrix (P),represented by the gray gears. The microbial turnover is fueled with carbon(C) from plant litter and rhizodeposition, but also from unprotected SOC (orC in particulate organic matter not protected in aggregates, includingrecycled microbial necromass) and protected SOC (C in mineral-associatedorganic matter and aggregates). The microbial turnover releases CO2, butalso produces microbial necromass, which then ﬂows into unprotected SOCpool or becomes a C source for the physicochemical matrix. Thephysicochemical matrix is directly responsible for stabilization of microbialnecromass into protected SOC and destabilization of protected SOC.Destabilized SOC then fuels the microbial turnover. Both the microbialturnover and the physicochemical matrix are further affected by root actionmodes (gray arrows), including physical and chemical liberation of C inprotected SOC by rhizodeposition, formation and destruction of aggregatesby root turnover and water uptake, and acceleration or deceleration ofmicrobial activity by nutrient uptake.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons Licenseland-use changes. Indeed, climate and land-use changes may havethe potential to tip the balance between root-driven SOCstabilization and destabilization resulting in either long-termSOC accrual or depletion (Luo & Weng, 2011), where root-drivenSOC stabilization should dominate in most aggrading ecosystems,while destabilization would dominate in degrading ecosystems.Furthermore, while plant roots may only cause small or no netchanges in SOC pools, root-induced changes in SOC stabilizationand destabilization may have important consequences for nutrientcycling. For instance, in the Destabilizing scenario plant roots couldenhance net N mineralization and consequently plant N uptake,where decomposition of organic matter liberated by roots fromMOAM relatively rich in N, could result in N mineralization rateslarger than N immobilization caused by formation of relatively N-poor POM (Lavallee et al., 2020). By contrast, root effects on SOCdynamics could disadvantage plants in terms of N uptake in theStabilizing scenario by causing net N immobilization.V. ConclusionsWith our Rhizo-Engine framework, we highlight the double-edgedsword effect that roots have on SOC dynamics, causing bothstabilization or gain and destabilization or loss in SOC. Ourframework does not speciﬁcally address how the balance betweenSOC stabilization and destabilization depends on factors such asplant economic traits (Henneron et al., 2020), symbiotic relation-ships between plants and microbes (e.g. differences betweenarbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants (Craig et al.,2018)), or environmental factors (Cheng et al., 2014), whichremain key areas for future research. However, we believe there ismuch need for understanding the relative importance of thedifferent modes of action by which roots affect the magnitude ofSOC stabilization and destabilization. Considering both stabiliza-tion and destabilization mechanisms will provide better under-standing of how the Rhizo-Engine functions may aid actions forsoil C sequestration, and new opportunities for understanding thesensitivity of SOC pools to climate and land-use changes.VI.
