Tobetter understand the drought tolerance mechanism of quinoa, we screenedthe drought-tolerant quinoa genotype “Dianli 129 ”and studied the seedlingleaves of the drought-tolerant quinoa genotype after drought and rewateringtreatments using transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics. Drought-treatment, drought control, rewatering-treated, and rewatered control werenamed as DR, DC, RW, and RC, respectively. Among four comparison groups,DC vs. DR, RC vs. RW, RW vs. DR, and RC vs. DC, we identi ﬁed 10,292, 2,307,12,368, and 3 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 215, 192, 132, and 19differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), respectively. A total of 38,670genes and 142 pathways were annotated. The results of transcriptome andmetabolome association analysis showed that gene- LOC110713661 and gene-LOC110738152 may be the key genes for drought tolerance in quinoa. Somemetabolites accumulated in quinoa leaves in response to drought stress, andthe plants recovered after rewatering. DEGs and DEMs participate in starch andsucrose metabolism and ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, which are vital for improvingdrought tolerance in quinoa. Drought tolerance of quinoa was correlated withgene expression differences, metabolite accumulation and good recovery afterrewatering. These ﬁndings improve our understanding of drought andrewatering responses in quinoa and have implications for the breeding ofnew drought-tolerance varieties while providing a theoretical basis fordrought-tolerance varieties identi ﬁcation.KEYWORDSquinoa, drought stress, transcriptomics, metabolomics, ﬂavonoid biosynthesisFrontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 01OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYRavi Gupta,Kookmin University, South KoreaREVIEWED BYWang Pu-chang,Guizhou Normal University, ChinaDinesh Kumar Saini,South Dakota State University,United States*CORRESPONDENCEPeng Qinqinpeng77@163.com†These authors have contributedequally to this workSPECIALTY SECTIONThis article was submitted toCrop and Product Physiology,a section of the journalFrontiers in Plant ScienceRECEIVED 07 July 2022ACCEPTED 10 October 2022PUBLISHED 26 October 2022CITATIONHuan X, Li L, Liu Y, Kong Z, Liu Y,Wang Q, Liu J, Zhang P, Guo Y andQin P (2022) Integratingtranscriptomics and metabolomics toanalyze quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoaWilld. ) responses to drought stressand rewatering.Front.

Quinoa grains are small andround with white, black, and red colors ( Repo-Carrasco et al.,2003 ). Their outstanding physicoc hemical, nutritional, andfunctional properties result in their use as a staple food forhumans ( Melini and Melini, 2021 ). With its high nutritionalpotential and genetic diversity, the Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) classi ﬁed quinoa as a promising crop forhumans that can contribute to food security in the 21st century(FAO Regional Of ﬁce for Latin America and the Caribbean &Proinpa, 2011 ). Therefore, the selection and exploitation ofquinoa varieties is crucial.Quinoa contains high quality protein with a perfect balanceof essential amino acids and a suitable fatty acid composition. Inaddition, it is rich in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols,ﬂavonoids, and minerals ( Nowak et al., 2016 ); the high contentof phenolics makes it an important antioxidant active. Thepolysaccharide fraction of quinoa also has potential as anatural antioxidant, antidiabetic, and immunomodulatory food(Tan et al., 2021 ). Both the seeds and leaves of quinoa have somenutritional value, and current research on quinoa has focused onthe nutritional composition of the seeds as functional foods.However, quinoa leaves also have some nutritional potential andmay prevent cancer and other diseases related to oxidative stress(Gawlik-Dziki et al., 2013 ). Quinoa grains and leaves bothcontain a high content of phenolics, although the leaves have ahigher protein content than the grains. The consumption ofnutrient-rich green leaf quinoa can prevent nutritionaldeﬁciencies caused by iron and zinc, and there is highersaponin content in the grains compared with the leaves(Pathan et al., 2019 ;Villacre ́s et al., 2022 ). Quinoa grains alsocontain suf ﬁcient micronutrients such as calcium, phosphorus,potassium, copper, iron, and zinc ( Ayasan, 2020 ). In addition,quinoa has some anti-nutritional factors such as saponins,phytic acid, tannins, and protease inhibitors, among which thesaponins can resist the adverse conditions of the externalenvironment ( Filho et al., 2017 ). Quinoa has a wide geneticdiversity and can adapt to various harsh environments includingbiotic and abiotic stresses, and can be grown on plateaus fromsea level to 4,500 m ( Zhang et al., 2021 ). However, thenutritional value of quinoa differs by variety and environment(Nowak et al., 2016 ), making it particularly important to studyquinoa breeding in adverse conditions.Drought conditions threaten crop production and foodsecurity ( Yang et al., 2020 ). Drought stress affectsmorphological and physiological changes in plants, leading tosevere crop yield de ﬁcits; agricultural drought affects global foodproduction and is among the most serious challenges facingsustainable agriculture ( Fadiji et al., 2022 ). Water stress not onlyaffects metabolic activities suc h as plant respiration, sugarmetabolism, and photosynthesis ( Dos Reis et al., 2012 ), butalso reduces the cellular water potential, affecting growth and cellelongation. The occurrence of drought stress during thereproductive period may also lead to interruption of ﬂoweringand yield loss ( Kaur and Asthir, 2017 ). Plants under droughtstress release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals,triggering an increase in ethylene content ( Nair et al., 2008 ;Narayanasamy et al., 2020 ). Drought stress not only causesphysiological responses in plants, but also impacts mineralnutrition, where a reduction in iron uptake occurs through aspeciﬁc response to drought, leading to a reduction in zinc andmanganese uptake, which is associated with differentialexpression of transp ort-related genes ( D'Oria et al., 2022 ).Drought tolerance in plants refers to the ability of plants totolerate drought and rapidly resume growth after rehydration.Drought severely affects plant growth and development;however, there is some compensation through rehydration(e.g., photosynthesis) ( Chaves and Oliveira, 2004 ). Inconclusion, increasing future food production under droughtstress will be challenging. While many crops have beenextensively studied under drought stress, research on theunique mechanisms of quinoa, an important gluten-free crop,to cope with different degrees of drought have been limited.Among the mechanisms of action for drought adaptation inquinoa, bio-promoters can lead to an increase in total solublesugars (SS), proteins, and ant ioxidant enzyme activities inquinoa leaves and roots; however, drought decreases biomass,leaf water potential, and stomatal conductance, and increasesmalondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content ( Benaffariet al., 2022 ). Physiological analysis of drought tolerancemechanisms in quinoa demonstrated an increase in H 2O2andmalondialdehyde (MDA) content in drought-treated quinoa,with differences in the physiological response to differentvarieties of quinoa. This suggests that different varieties ofquinoa have different drought tolerance mechanisms ( Lin andChao, 2021 ). Further, physiological characteristics of quinoaunder rehydrated conditions after drought stress have notbeen reported. Quinoa genotypes grown in coastal lowlandshave always exhibited better yields and larger seeds with reducedAbbreviations: ABA, abscisic acid; CHS, chalcone synthase; DC, droughtcontrol; DEG, differentially expressed gene; DEM, differentially expressedmetabolite; DFR, dihydro ﬂavonol 4-reductase; DR, drought treatment; EC,Enzyme Commission; F3H, ﬂavanone 3-hydrogenas e; FC, fold-change;FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript, per million mapped reads;GO, Gene Ontology; JA, jasmonates; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes; KOG, Eukaryotic Orthologous Group; MDA,malondialdehyde; PCA, principal component analysis; PCC, Pearson ’scorrelation coef ﬁcient; POD, peroxidase; Pro, proline; RC, rewateredcontrol; RW, rewatering treatment; SA, salicylic acid; SOD, superoxidedismutase; SS, soluble sugar; TF, transcription factor TIC, total ion current.Huan et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.988861Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 02irrigation relative to commercial varieties ( Dumschott et al.,2022 ). Among them, CqZF-HD14 further enhanced the droughttolerance of quinoa seedlings in synergy with CqNAC79 orCqHIPP34 and may be a key gene in the drought toleranceregulatory network of quinoa ( Sun et al., 2022 ). Varieties andmethods that can withstand drought stress, among others, arebeing extensively researched worldwide to alleviate water stress(Philippot et al., 2013 ). Thus, it is imperative to investigate themechanisms of drought tolerance in quinoa in order tosuccessfully breed drought-tolerant varieties.Transcriptome sequencing technologies and metabolomeassays have been used to analyze plant tolerance mechanisms(Lenka et al., 2011 ;Nakabayashi et al., 2014 ;Yuan et al., 2018 ;Muet al., 2021 ). Comparative transcriptome analysis of droughttolerance in two rice varieties showed that it was attributable toenhanced expression of several enzyme-coding genes, anddrought sensitivity was attributed to signi ﬁcant down-regulationof regulatory components that confer drought tolerance ( Lenkaet al., 2011 ). Ramie plants exhibited differential expression of AP2,MYB, NAC , zinc ﬁnger proteins, and the bZIP transcription factor(TF) ( An et al., 2015 ), suggesting an association with osmotictreatment. The maximum activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)and peroxidase (POD), as well as the contents of MDA andproline (Pro), increased in wheat plants to differing degrees duringa winter drought ( Mu et al., 2021 ). Flavonoids can alleviateoxidation and drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana(Nakabayashi et al., 2014 ). In the study of Tibetan hulllessbarley under salt stress the main compounds included aminoacids and their derivatives, organic acids, nucleotides and theirderivatives, and ﬂavonoids ( Wang et al., 2019 ). Transcriptomicand metabolomic studies on powdery mildew tolerance in Tibetanhullless barley showed a signi ﬁcant enrichment of genes related topathways such as phenylalanine metabolism, terpene biosynthesis,zeatin biosynthesis, and iso ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, which may beassociated with downy mildew tolerance in fully tolerant varieties(Yuan et al., 2018 ).However, a multi-omics-based study ofdrought tolerance mechanisms in quinoa seedlings has not yetbeen reported.Therefore, it is imperative to rapidly screen genes associatedwith drought stress and rehydration to provide excellent geneticresources for creating drought-tolerant quinoa germplasm.However, studies on the molecular regulation of quinoaadaptation to drought stress have been limited, and multi-omics-based studies on drough t tolerance mechanisms inquinoa seedlings have not yet been reported. In this study, weanalyzed drought-tolerant quinoa plants at the seedling stage(six-leaf stage) after drought and rewatering by transcriptomesequencing and metabolomics. Our results shed light on themechanisms of drought tolerance in quinoa and direct researchtowards a comprehensive exploration of drought tolerance genesin quinoa. In addition, this topic is important to understand thedrought tolerance mechanism of quinoa in order to breedoptimal varieties.Materials and methodsMaterial plantingMaterial was sourced from China and the United States, andquinoa genotypes were introduced through selective breeding(The natural variation of existing varieties during the breedingprocess is used as the original material for the selection work,which is then carried out con tinuously according to therequirements of high and stable yield and disease resistance,and the selected lines are planted and selected again until thetraits are relatively stable). While quinoa grains are available in avariety of colors, four colors were initially selected for this study:red, yellow, white, and black, with ﬁve genotypes of each colorfor a total of 20 an advance generation genotypes. The 20 quinoagenotypes were planted in a greenhouse seedling tray. Fifty-cellseedling growth trays were used (50 mm × 50 mm × 90 mm foreach point). Three seeds were sown at each point, the seedlingswere thinned when the plants had grown to the two-leaf stage,andﬁnally, one plant was left at each point. All genotypes weremanaged in the same way with water and fertilizer before thedrought treatment. Humus soil was mixed with perlite at a 4:1ratio as the cultivation substrates for the drought stress-treatedand control groups.Drought treatment and drought-tolerance material screeningQuinoa seedlings were treated with natural drought stress(i.e., no watering during this period) for 5 ds at the 6-leaf-onestage, followed by 1 day of rewatering. The drought-treatedcontrol was watered normally during the drought treatment andthe rewatered control was watered normally on both the 5 daysof the drought treatment and the 1 day of rewatering. Theaverage temperature of the greenhouse was 27.1°C and theaverage humidity was 59.6%. Based on the degree of wiltingand survival rate of plants on the ﬁfth day of drought treatment,two drought tolerant genotypes (Dianli 66 and Dianli 129) andtwo drought sensitive genotypes (Dianli 58 and Dianli 114) wereinitially screened out of 20 genotypes. Only a few plants in eachgenotype with slightly curled leaves were considered droughttolerant and most plants in each genotype with all curled leaveswas considered drought sensitive, according to degree of wiltingcriteria used. For the survival rate criteria, seedlings of quinoagenotypes with more than 85% survival are considered droughttolerant genotypes and those with less than 60% survival areconsidered drought sensitive genotypes. The most droughttolerant genotype, Dianli 129, and the most drought sensitivegenotype, Dianli 114, were further screened among the fourgenotypes according to the method above. The leaves of thesetwo genotypes were sampled on day 5 of the drought treatmentand on day 1 of the rewatering treatment, with DR on day 5 ofHuan et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.988861Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03the drought treatment, drought treatment was rewatered for 1day after 5 days as RW and normal watering during both thedrought and rewatering treatments was the rewatering controlRC. The physiological parameters related to drought tolerancewere measured, and the drought tolerant genotypes and droughtsensitive genotypes were analyzed for comparison ( Lin andChao, 2021 ). Finally, metabolome determination andtranscriptome sequencing were performed on the mostdrought tolerant genotype, Dianli 129, to further investigatethe drought tolerance mechanism of quinoa. Dianli 129 had fourtreatments, drought treatment (drought treatment for 5 days),drought control (normal water ing), rewatering treatment(drought treatment for 5 days followed by rewatering for 1day) and rewatering control (normal watering), each with threereplicates for a total of 12 samples, one sample from eachtreatment was mixed with ﬁve biological replicates.Morphological parameters, physiologicalparameters measurement andstatistical analysisThe most drought tolerant genotype, Dianli 129, and thedrought sensitive genotype, Dianli 114, were screened formorphological and physiological parameters measurement.Single quinoa seedlings of uniform growth were selected todetermine plant height, above- and below-ground partbiomass, and leaf morphology and each parameter werereplicated three times. The root length, average root diameter,volume and root surface area were determined by scanning witha Topper root scanner (MRS-9600TFU2L). The plants wereplaced in an oven, killed at 110°C for 15 min, dried at 80°Cuntil a constant weight, and the dry weight of above- and below-ground parts was measured, and the root-to-crown ratio = rootdry weight/above-ground part dry weight was calculated. Leafcolor was measured by a Minolta colorimeter (CR-20). Amongthe physiological parameters determined, Chlorophyll contentwas determined using the ethanol acetone method. Solubleprotein content was determined by the Komas bluecolorimetric method. Pro content was determined by theacidic ninhydrin method. MDA content was determined bythe thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. Catalase (CAT) activitywas determined by the hydrogen peroxide reduction method.POD activity was determined by the guaiacol method. SOD wasdetermined by the nitrogen blue tetrazolium photochemicalreduction method. Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) wasdetermined by the iron ion reduction method. SS weredetermined by the anthrone col orimetric method. Relativeconductivity was also measured. Each parameter was repeatedthree times ( Benaffari et al., 2022 ). Microsoft Excel 2010 wasemployed for graphical analysis and statistical analysis wasperformed using SPSS25, DPS version 7.05 software.Metabolite extraction and detectionThe samples were placed in a SCIENTZ-100F LyophilizationDryer Laboratory LCD Display Freeze Dryer (SCIENTZ) forvacuum freeze-drying. The samples were ground to powderform using a MM 400 grinding machine (30 Hz, 1.5 min;Retsch). Subsequently, 100 mg of powder was dissolved in a 1.2mL 70% methanol extract. The dissolved samples wererefrigerated overnight at 4°C, while swirling six times during theperiod to improve extraction rate. Each sample was centrifuged at12,000 rotations per min for 10 min, after which the upper liquidfraction was ﬁltered through a 0.22- mmm e m b r a n e ﬁlter (0.22- mmpore size). Each sample was saved in a bottle for analysis usingultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandemmass spectrometry.Metabolome pro ﬁling was performed using a widelytargeting metabolomics method, based on a database (MWDB)built by Wuhan Mettware Biotechnology ( http://www.metware.cn/), and qualitative analysis was based on secondary spectruminformation. Metabolites were q uantitated using triple-levelquadrupole mass spectra obt ained in multiple-reactionmonitoring mode. Before data analysis, quality-control analysiswas performed to con ﬁrm the reliability of the data.

DEMs were subjectedto orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Metabolites with a variabl e importance in projection(VIP) ≥1 and a fold-change (FC) of ≥2( o r ≤0.5) weredeﬁned as DEMs. See Supplementary Material 1 for thecollection conditions and experimental methods ofchromatography-mass spectrometry.Transcriptome sequencing anddata analysisTotal RNA was extracted from 12 quinoa leaf samples usingthe TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer ’s instructions(Beijing TransGen Biotech). After RNA extraction, an RNA-sequencing library was constructed, and then the quality of thelibrary was determined. The Illumina HiSeq platform was usedfor sequencing after determining that the sequencing library metthe requirements. To ensure the accuracy of subsequent analysis,the original data were ﬁltered and screened, and low-qualityreads, adapter sequences, and when the N content (proportion ofreads with N bases) of any sequenced read exceeds 10% of thenumber of bases in that read were removed. The high-qualityclean reads obtained by screening were compared with thereference genome. The fragments per kilobase of transcript(FPKM) per million mapped reads was used as an parametersto measure gene expression levels. The screening criteria foridentifying DEGs were a |log2 FC| value of ≥1 and a false-Huan et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.988861Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04discovery rate of < 0.05, a positive value of |log2 FC| is an up-regulated gene, while a negative value is a down-regulated gene.Functional annotations of DEGs were performed using theKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), GeneOntology (GO), Eukaryotic Orthologous Group (KOG),PfAM, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and NR databases. SeeSupplementary Material 2 for the experimental procedure oftranscriptome sequencing.Quantitative real-time PCR validation(qRT-PCR)qRT-PCR was conducted in Step One in addition to a real-time ﬂuorescence quantitative PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher,USA). TUB1 was used as the internal reference gene. Thereaction procedure was as follows: 95°C for 30 s, followed by40 cycles, 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 30 s. According to the kitinstructions (Beijing TransGen Biotech), a 20 mL system wasused for each reaction: 3 mL cDNA, 0.4 mL forward primer (10mM) and 0.4 mL reverse primer (10 mM), 10 mL green qPCRSuperMix, 0.4 mL passive reference dye I, and 5.8 mL nuclease-free water. The experiment was repeated with three biologicalreplicates on 96-well plates.ResultsEffects of drought stress and rewateringon the morphology and physiology ofquinoa seedlingsThe morphological parameters (total root length, total rootsurface area, total root volume, etc.) and physiological parameters(CAT, SOD, MDA, T-AOC, etc.) of the drought tolerant genotypeDianli-129 and drought-sensitive genotype Dianli 129 werecompared. The difference of morphological indexes between twostrains “dianli-114 ”and “dianli-129 ”was compared. The rootshoot ratio was P > 0.05, so the difference was not signi ﬁcant. Thetotal root length and other six indexes were P<0.01, so thedifference was extremely signi ﬁcant; The comparison among thefour treatments (DR, DC, RW, RC) showed that the root shootratio was P < 0.05, so the difference was signi ﬁcant. The leaf areaand other six parameters were P < 0.01, so the difference wasextremely signi ﬁcant ( Table 1 ). Compared between the twostrains, leaf width P < 0.05, the difference is not signi ﬁcant, andleaf perimeter and other seven parameters P <0.01, the differenceis extremely signi ﬁcant; Compared among the four treatments, allindexes were P < 0.01, the difference was extremely signi ﬁcant(Table 2 ). The ANOVA found no signi ﬁcant differences in CAT,SOD, MDA and T-AOC between the two genotypes, however,signiﬁcant differences in PDO and all other parameters wereidenti ﬁed. In each treatment, the difference of all parameterswas highly signi ﬁcant; Under the cross action of the two factors,the chlorophyll difference was signi ﬁcant, and all other parametersreached a highly signi ﬁcant level ( Table 3 ).Metabolomics of quinoa leaves underdrought and rewatered conditionsFour groups of samples (DR, DC, RW, and RC) were analyzedusing a widely targeted metabolomics approach that enabled thedetection of 701 metabolites divided into 12 categories includingamino acids and derivatives, ﬂavonoids, and phenolic acids. Atotal of 99 ﬂavonoids related metabolites were detected, namely 53ﬂavonols, 36 ﬂavonoids, 4 dihydro ﬂavonols, 2 dihydro ﬂavone, 2isoﬂavones, and 2 chalcones. The contents of 11 ﬂavonoids such as6-hydroxyluteolin 5-glucoside were lower than the control duringdrought but increased to the control level or signi ﬁcantly higherafter rehydration. The content of 15 ﬂavonoids such askaempferol-4 ’-o-glucoside increased during drought, and thecontent after rehydration exhibited little difference comparedwith the control or continued to increase after rehydration. Thecontents of 58 ﬂavonoids such as naringenin (5,7,4 ’-trihydroxy ﬂavanone) were signi ﬁcantly lower than the controlduring drought. After rehydration, their contents did not adjust tothe control level; however, they all exhibited varying upwardtrends ( Supplementary Table 1 ). The total ion current (TIC)diagram of total ion ﬂow shows detection and analysis ofessential spectra for different quality-control samples, whichoverlapped. The total ion ﬂow metabolite curves showed a highdegree of overlap, that is, the retention times and peak strengthswere consistent. This indicates that the signal stability of massspectrometry for detecting the same sample at different timepoints was good, that is, the technology of metabolite extractionTABLE 1 Analysis of variance for morphological parameter determination 1 ( Fvalue).Source ofvariationDF Total rootlength (cm)Total root SurfaceArea (cm2)Total rootvolume (cm3)Average rootDiameter (mm)Plantheight(cm)Leaf area(mm2)Root-shootratioMaterials 1 150.409** 374.858** 559.578** 29.356** 757.412** 11.689** 1.850Treatments 3 112.004** 269.226** 274.101** 13.582** 249.828** 203.869** 6.319*Materials×Treatments 3 102.450** 231.390** 407.149** 8.466** 255.951** 20.927** 19.002*** and ** indicate P<0.05 and P<0.01.

Cluster-heat map analysis was performed on allsamples. All samples grouped together after performing threereplicates, indicating tha t the metabolome data had highreliability. Signi ﬁcant differences were found between thecontrol groups (RC and DC) and the treatment groups (DR andRW), in terms of the metabolite levels. After rewatering treatment,the metabolites slowly returned to normal levels After rewateringtreatment, the metabolites slowly returned to normal levels(Figure 1C ). PCA of the samples revealed that there was anevident trend of separation between groups on PC1 and PC2,differences among the groups and good repeatability ( Figure 1D ).Identi ﬁcation of different metabolites inquinoa leavesDEMs were identi ﬁed between samples according to thecriteria of a VIP of ≥1 and an FC of ≥2o r≤0.5. To study trendsin different samples, the relative contents of different metaboliteswere standardized, centrali zed, and analyzed by K-meansclustering ( Supplementary Figure 1 ;Supplementary Table 2 ).The different metabolites were divided into nine groups, In the6th cluster, the levels of amino acids and their derivatives withhigher metabolite levels under drought conditions, whichreturned to normal after rewatering. In the seventh cluster,metabolites such as ﬂavonoids were lower under droughtconditions and returned to nor mal after rewatering. Fourdifferential metabolite-comp arison groups were obtainedthrough pairwise comparisons. Speci ﬁcally, in the DC vs DRcomparison group, 84 metabolites were up-regulated and 131were down-regulated. In the RC vs RW comparison group, 84metabolites were up-regulated and 108 were down-regulated. Inthe RW vs DR comparison group, 67 metabolites were up-regulated and 65 were down-regulated. In the RC vs DCcomparison group, 15 metabolites were up-regulated and fourwere down-regulated ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The Venndiagram in Figure 2 shows that the different groups had 40,23, 0, and 47 DEMs, respectively, four of which were commonamong all four groups. By comparing the metabolite FCs in eachgroup, we determined that among the four groups, up-regulatedDEMs with the largest |log2 FC| values included N-feruloyltyramine, quercetin-7-O-rutinoside-4-O-glucoside,4-O-(6-O-glucosylferuloyl)-3,4-d ihydroxybenzyl alcohol, andquercetin-7-O-rutinoside-4- O-glucoside. Down-regulatedDEMs with the highest |log2FC| values included quercetin, 4-O-(6-O-glucosylferuloyl)-3 ,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol,quercetin, and LysoPE 15:1 ( Supplementary Figure 2) . In thefour differential metabolite-comparison groups, the DEM-associated metabolit e pathways with signi ﬁcant enrichmentincluded cyanoamino acid metabolism, ﬂavonoid biosynthesis,starch and sucrose metabolism, penicillin and cephalosporinbiosynthesis, indole alkaloid biosynthesis, sulfur metabolism,propanoate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, glucosinolatebiosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, synthesis anddegradation of ketone bodies, fatty acid metabolism, and lysinebiosynthesis ( Figure 3 ;Supplementary Figure 3 ).Transcriptomics of quinoa leaves underdrought and rewatered conditionsTranscriptome sequencing analysis of 12 samples yielded77.06 GB clean data, Among the high-quality clean reads, thepercentage of the Q20 base was >98%, the percentage of the Q30base was >94%, and the GC contents were >43.0%.

By adopting the PCA method of multivariate statisticalanalysis, the data for each group of triplicate samples showedthat the method had good stability and quality. Signi ﬁcantseparation was found between the treated and control samples,indicating that changes in metabolite accumulation were strictlycontrolled by differential gene expression ( Figure 4A ). UsingFPKM as an parameter of gene expression levels, the densitymap showed that the gene-abundance trends in the sampleschanged with the expression levels, which clearly re ﬂected thegene expression levels in the samples ( Figure 4B ), FPKM = 10-2~104. Pearson ’s correlation coef ﬁcient (PCC, abbreviated as “r”)was used as an parameter to evaluate correlations with biologicalreplicates. The closer the R2 is to 1, the stronger the correlationbetween the two replicate samples. This study requires that theR2 between biological replicate samples be at least greater than0.8 before further study of DEGs.DEGs in quinoa leavesUsing the following databases, we annotated of DEGs withKEGG (38,670; Supplementary Table 5 ), GO (38,191;Supplementary Table 6 ), KOG (45,935; Supplementary Table 7 ),PfAM (77,193; Supplementary Table 8 ), Swiss-Prot (31,837;Supplementary Table 9 ), TrEMBL (47,387; Supplementary Table10), and NR (49,054; Supplementary Table 11 ). KEGG involves142 pathways. By analyzing DEGs in quinoa leaves under droughtstress and rewatering conditions, 14,883 differentially expressedgenes were found. When comparing them in pairs, we generatedfour DEG comparison groups, among which 4,104 up-regulatedgenes and 6,188 down-regulated genes were found in the DC vs.DR comparison group. In the RC vs. RW comparison group, therewere 1,439 up-regulated genes and 868 down-regulated genes. Inthe RW vs. DR comparison group, there were 5,374 up-regulatedgenes and 6,994 down-regulated genes. In the RC vs. DCcomparison group, there were no up-regulated genes and threedown-regulated genes ( Supplementary Table 12 ). After droughttreatment, the gene expression patterns changed signi ﬁcantly, andthe genes tended to be stably expressed after rewatering ( Figure5A). The Venn diagram in Figure 5B shows 0 DEGs in commonamong all four groups, and 1,830, 3,343, 0, and 407 speci ﬁcD E G sin the four comparison groups, respectively.

The DEGs in quinoa leaves were classi ﬁed byGO enrichment ( Supplementary Figure 5 ), to evaluate enrichmentfor DEGs in terms of molecular function, cellular component, andbiological process. In terms of biological process, this includedmetabolic and cellular processes. Cellular components mainlyincluded cells, cell parts, and organelles. Molecular functionsmainly included binding and catalytic activities. The resultsindicate that cells and cell parts were most enriched for DEGsin quinoa leaves, indicating that cellular components playedimportant roles in responding to drought stress. The 50 GOterms with the lowest q values in the enrichment analysis wereselected, and the enrichment entries were plotted in a bar chart.The genes showing greater enrichment were related to severalbiological factors, such as fatty acid metabolic processes, ribosomebiogenesis, apoplasts, ribosomal subunits, lyase activity, rRNAbinding, and photosynthesis ( Supplementary Figure 6 ).Analysis of TFs under drought andrewatering conditionsT F sp l a yi m p o r t a n tr o l e si np l a n tr e s p o n s e st od r o u g h tstress and rewatering by regulating the expression levels oftarget genes. We analyzed TFs associated with the DEGsidenti ﬁed in quinoa leaves. In four comparison groups(Supplementary Table 13 ), 598, 116, 629, and 0 TFs weredetected, indicating the key roles of TFs during drought andrewatering treatment. The 1,343 TFs were divided into 55families. The main TFs in this study included the AP2 (130),MYB (126), bHLH (80), WRKY (79), NAC (64), and bZIP(41) families.FIGURE 2Venn diagram for differential metabolites.

Ten genes were randomly selected to calculate therelative expression levels of differentially expressed genes by 2-DDCт.This data was compared with log 2FC values fromtranscriptome sequencing, and these 10 genes had the same up-or down-regulation trend ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). The resultsshowed that the transcriptome sequencing was reliable.Analysis of quinoa drought-tolerancemechanisms using combinedtranscriptomics and metabolomicsPlants can produce a large number of specialized metabolitesunder drought stress; most of which are antioxidant substances.Among them, ﬂavonoids can improve the drought tolerance ofplants under drought stress ( Nakabayashi et al., 2014 ). Thebiosynthesis of ﬂavonoids originates from Cinnamoyl CoA,and p-coumaroyl-CoA is synthesized through the action ofCYP73A. Then, the types and contents of metabolites formedunder the action of different enzymes differ, resulting indifferences in concentrations of quercetin, hesperetin 7-o-glucoside, kaempferol, and phlorizin, and ﬁnally the droughttolerance of quinoa ( Figure 7 ). DEGs and DEMs with PCCvalues of >0.8 in the ﬂavonoid-synthesis pathway were selected.Correlation analysis was performed on the differential genes anddifferential metabolites, and results with Pearson ’s correlationcoefﬁcient |PCC| greater than 0.8 were selected, with a positivePCC being a positive correlation and the opposite being aBC DAFIGURE 3KEGG enrichment diagram of different metabolites in quinoa leaves.

The LOC110713661 gene wassigniﬁcantly positively correlated with kaempferol, phlorizin,and hespertin-7-O-glucoside, The expression of this gene wasapproximately 20 in different treatments and controls, and theorder from high to low was DR, RW, RC and DC, therefore, thismay be the key gene for drought tolerance in quinoa. TheLOC110729560 gene was signi ﬁcantly negatively correlatedwith phlorizin ( Supplementary Table 16 ).

Through transcriptomics analysis,44, 7, and 51 differentially expressed genes related to ﬂavonoidbiosynthesis were found in the DC vs. DR, RC vs. RW, and RWvs. DR comparison groups, respectively ( SupplementaryTable 18 ). Among these, the LOC110724467 gene (chalconesynthase, CHS, EC: 2.3.1.74) was down-regulated duringdrought but stabilized after rewatering. The LOC110695126gene ( ﬂavanone 3-hydrogenase, F3H, EC: 1.14.11.9) was up-regulated during drought and stabilized after rewatering. TheLOC110709209 gene (5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate 3 ’-monooxygenase, EC: 1.14.14.96) was stable during drought,but up-regulated after rewatering. The LOC110736236 gene(anthocyanidin reductase, EC: 1.3.1.77) was stably expressedduring drought, but down-regulated after rewatering. Elevengenes, including the LOC110715013 (Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferas, EC: 2.3.1.133), were up-regulatedor down-regulated during drought, four genes were up-regulatedafter rewatering, and three genes, including the LOC110682224gene (DFR, EC: 1.1.1.219; 1.1.1.234) were up-regulated or down-regulated during drought, but stabilized after rewatering. Eightgenes, including the LOC110708783 gene (FLS, EC: 1.14.20.6),were up-regulated or down-re gulated during drought, butstabilized after rewatering ( Supplementary Figure 9 ,Supplementary Tables 19 ,20). In the ﬂavonoid biosynthesispathway, the up-regulated expression of enzymes such as F3 ’Hunder drought stress, and the stable expression of enzymes suchas CHS after rewatering, affected the synthesis of ﬂavonoids,which helps achieve the goal of improving the drought toleranceof quinoa.Under drought conditions, down-regulated expression of ﬁvegenes (EC: 2.4.1.357, phlorizin synthase), including theLOC110693894 gene, promoted the down-regulation ofphlorizin. Up-regulated expression of the LOC110690711 geneand down-regulated expression of four genes, including theLOC110702757 gene (EC: 5.5.1.6, chalcone isomerase)contributed to naringenin dow n-regulation. Up-regulatedexpression of the LOC110695126 gene (EC:1.14.11.9, naringenin3-dioxygenase) contributed to dihydrokaempferol down-regulation. Up-regulated expression of three genes, such as theLOC110698563 gene, and down-regulated expression of ﬁve genes,such as the LOC110699285 gene (EC: 1.14.20.6, FLS) promotedkaempferol and quercetin down-regulation ( SupplementaryBCDAFIGURE 6KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs.

Deeper red shading indicates greater statistical signi ﬁcance in terms of the enrichment.Huan et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.988861Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 11Figure 9 ,Supplementary Table 19 ). The part of the genes shown inTable 4 were strongly correlated with metabolites in the ﬂavonoidbiosynthesis pathway, and the starch- and sucrose metabolismpathways. The LOC110729560 gene (EC: 2.4.1.357, phlorizinsynthase) was signi ﬁcantly negatively correlated with phlorizin,which was down-regulated during drought, but recovered afterrewatering. Phlorizin contents were down-regulated duringdrought but changed minimally after rewatering. KEGG-basedfunctional enrichment of DEGs (transcriptome data) andDEMs (metabolome data) showed that starch and sucrosemetabolism were signi ﬁcantly enriched. The DEGs andmetabolites with |PCC| >0.8 in the starch- and sucrosemetabolism pathways were selected for further analysis. Duringdrought treatment, 32 genes, including the LOC110715744 gene,were signi ﬁcantly negatively correlated with D-fructose 6-phosphate, whereas the LOC110712600 gene was signi ﬁcantlypositively correlated with D-fructose 6-phosphate. TheLOC110722127 gene and other 12 genes were signi ﬁcantlynegatively correlated with D-glucose. Fifteen genes, includingtheLOC110695607 gene, were signi ﬁcantly negatively correlatedwith D-glucose 6-phosphate. The LOC110738152 gene exhibited asigniﬁcant negative correlation with the metabolite trehalose 6-phosphate, whereas the LOC110715744 gene showed a signi ﬁcantpositive correlation with trehalose 6-phosphate. Eighteen genes,including the LOC110687336 gene, showed a signi ﬁcant negativecorrelation with the metabolite, glucose 1-phosphate(Supplementary Table 21 ). After rehydration, signi ﬁcantnegative correlations were found between the LOC11068475 2gene and D-sucrose and D-trehalose. The LOC110721696 genewas signi ﬁcantly positively correlated with D-glucose 6-phosphate(Supplementary Table 22 ).Through metabolomics analysis, we determined thattrehalose-6P, D-glucose-6P, D-fructose-6P, D-glucose, a-D-glucose-1P, trehalose, and sucrose were involved in the starch-and sucrose-metabolic pathways ( Supplementary Figure 10 ).Through transcriptome analysis, 187, 30, and 205 differentiallyexpressed genes were identi ﬁed that were related to starch andsucrose metabolism among the three comparison groups(Supplementary Table 23 ).

Gene- LOC110709538 and gene-LOC110693540 expressed 0 in DR, but low after rehydration.In this study, 42 differential genes (5 for ﬂavonoid biosynthesisand 37 for starch and sucrose metabolism) and 11 differentialmetabolites (4 for ﬂavonoid biosynthesis and 7 for starch andsucrose metabolism) with differential metabolites were identi ﬁedas key factors of drought tolerance in quinoa leaves ( Tables 4 –6). Gene- LOC110738152 was not expressed in DC, and was verylow or not expressed in RC and RW. This gene was highlyexpressed in DR. Therefore, gene- LOC110738152 may be the keygene to improve the drought tolerance of quinoa.DiscussionWater scarcity has devastating effects on the yield andquality of major crops, and water de ﬁcits caused by droughtcan lead to severe growth retardation and yield loss ( Zhang et al,2014 ). When plants are exposed to a water de ﬁcit, they undergohighly complex morphological, physiological, biochemical, andmolecular changes ( Bhargava and Sawant, 2013 ). Drought stresscan reduce plant heights, ear lengths, chlorophyll contents, androot and stem biomass, thereby reducing grain yields ( Abbaset al., 2018 ). In the present study, similar conclusions to previousstudies were reached, where by several parameters of themorphology of the drought tolerant genotype Dianli 129showed increase or a small decrease under drought conditions.The ability to maintain key biological functions during droughtand recover quickly after rewatering are important determinantsof the maximum lifetime productivity and high droughttolerance ( Abid et al., 2018 ). Dianli 129 showed betterrecovery ability after rewatering, and its drought tolerancemechanism may occur by reducing the above-ground partbiomass and leaf area while maintaining a larger root-to-crown ratio to better maintain normal growth. In contrast, thedrought-sensitive genotype Dianli 114 demonstrated a decline intotal root length and total root volume under drought and didnot recover well after rehydration, likely because drought stressinhibited root growth. Photosynthesis is enhanced underdrought stress, which confers a high potential to withstanddrought stress ( Abid et al., 2016 ). The physiological changes oftea plants under drought and rehydration conditions have beenstudied ( Liu et al., 2015 ). With the development of droughtstress, the MDA, SS, and Pro contents, as well as the SOD andCAT activities increased signi ﬁcantly, however, decreasedrapidly after rehydration. The ABA and SA levels peaked at anearly stage of drought stress and then declined rapidly ( Liu et al.,2015 ). Pro, total SS, ascorbic acid, and ABA levels increased inthe drought-tolerant varieties , whereas hydrogen peroxide,superoxide anions, lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakageincreased rapidly in the drought-sensitive varieties, indicatingthat the tolerant varieties showed higher antioxidant capacitiesand stronger protective mechanisms ( Das et al., 2015 ).

In this study, the drought tolerant genotype Dianli129 maintained a high total antioxidant capacity under drought.Soluble protein content increased sharply under droughtconditions, which may be closely related to the assay method,varietal differences, stress intensity and time. Relativeconductivity increased less, chlorophyll content also decreasedless and recovered better or showed supercompensation afterrehydration. Under drought stress and rehydration, the droughttolerant genotype Dianli 129 showed higher enzyme activity andhigher osmoregulatory substances, and therefore exhibited agreater ability to resist drought stress as well as recover afterrehydration. This genotype could be used as an importantdrought tolerant quinoa germplasm resource.In recent years there have been many histological studiesdemonstrating that plant resistance is associated with ﬂavonoids.Transcriptome and metabolite analysis of grapes under droughtstress showed that water scarcity regulated the expression ofstructural genes related to phenylpropane, ﬂavonoids,carotenoids, and terpenoids, and these metabolic pathwaysunderwent transcriptional regulation in grapes under waterstress ( Savoi et al., 2016 ). Comparative transcriptome analysisofAmmopiptanthus mongolicus under drought and cold stressrevealed that ﬂavonoid biosynthesis genes were enriched in DEGup-regulated by both stresses ( Wu et al., 2014 ). The effects offulvic acid on genes and metabolites of tea plants during differentdrought stress stages were studied by transcriptomics andmetabolomics. The results s howed that fulvic acid couldenhance ascorbic acid metabolism, improve glutathionemetabolism, and promote the biosynthesis of ﬂavonoids (e.g.,C4H, CHS, F3 ’5’h, F3H, kaempferol, and quercetin). Thus, fulvicacid could signi ﬁcantly improve the antioxidant-defense abilitiesof tea plants under drought stress, to enhance the droughttolerance of tea plants ( Sun et al., 2020 ). Sugars (sucrose andtrehalose) in ﬂuence the regulation of cell osmotic pressureduring the stress response of plants during drought ( Shinozakiand Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007 ). Similar to previous studies inthe present study, DEGs were analyzed using the KEGGdatabase, and the haircut showed a signi ﬁcant enrichment ofKEGG metabolite pathways including ﬂavonoid biosynthesis,suggesting that possibly quinoa drought tolerance is alsoassociated with ﬂavonoids. The gene gene-LOC110713661 wassigniﬁcantly positively correlated with ﬂavonoids (Kaempferol,Phlorizin, Hesperetin-7-O-glucoside), which means that thisgene promotes the synthesis of ﬂavonoids to tolerate drought.However, gene-LOC110738152 was highly expressed in thedrought treatment, but not in the drought control, and hadvery low or no expression in the rewatering treatment and therewatering control. We therefore infer that gene-LOC110713661and gene-LOC110738152 may be key genes for enhancingdrought tolerance in quinoa. The tolerance to drought stressmay be due to the elevated expression levels of these two genes,and the drought tolerance genes may still be lowly expressed orslowly not expressed after later rewatering due to environmentalchanges. This study involved six metabolites (phlorizin,naringenin, hespertin-7-O-glucoside, dihydrokaempferol,kaempferol, and quercetin), as well as CHS, naringenin 3-dioxygenase, anthocyanidin reductase, and FLS, among otherenzymes. Previous data showed that DREB, ERF, NAC, andWRKY were jointly regulated by drought and cold stress ( Wuet al., 2014 ). The main TFs examined in this study include AP2,MYB, BHLH, WRKY, NAC, and bZIP. The gene expressionlevels may be related to drought tolerance in quinoa. Trehalose-6p, D-glucose-6P, D-fructose-6P, D-glucose, a-D-glucose-1P,trehalose, and sucrose, as well as related genes such ashexokinase, fructokinase, malpase-glucoamylase, and glucan1,3-beta-glucosidase, may be correlated with drought tolerancein quinoa. In this study, 42 DEGs and 11 DEMs were identi ﬁedTABLE 6 The log 2FC of differential metabolites.Compounds Log 2FC DC_vs _DR log 2FC RC_VS_ RW log 2FC RW_vs_DRPhlorizin -1.7576 -2.0336 0.1234Kaempferol -3.1101 -2.0164 -1.4189Hesperidin-7-O-glucoside -1.5406 -1.7914 -0.1764Naringenin -12.4423 -3.1737 -10.0105D-Glucose 6-phosphate -1.7741 -1.5406 -0.0440D-Fructose 6-phosphate -1.6879 -1.4563 0.2797D-Glucose -1.0217 -0.7181 0.2220Glucose 1-phosphate -1.8962 -1.4918 -0.1369Trehalose 6-phosphate 2.0636 0.2035 1.4972D-Sucrose -0.9879 -2.9574 2.3223D-Trehalose -1.0142 -2.5478 1.8593Huan et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.988861Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 17as key factors of drought tolerance in quinoa leaves. We alsodiscovered 3,259 genes potentially related to drought tolerancein quinoa ( Supplementary Table 26 ).ConclusionTo study the mechanisms mediating responses to droughtstress at the seedling stage in quinoa, we adopted a droughtstress –rehydration method and conducted transcriptomics andmetabolomics analyses on the drought-tolerant Dianli 129quinoa genotype. The results showed that the gene-LOC110713661 and gene- LOC110738152 may be key genes fordrought tolerance in quinoa, and our ﬁndings provide atheoretical basis for breedin g drought-tolerant quinoagenotypes. In this study, we investigated the biosyntheticpathways of ﬂavonoids in quinoa and the active roles of thestarch- and sucrose metabolism pathways in quinoa underdrought stress. The results of this study con ﬁrm that a strategyto protect quinoa from drought stress is to regulate theantioxidant systems and the accumulation of metabolites. TheDianli 129 quinoa genotype showed a high ability to resistdrought stress and to recover after rehydration.Data availability statementThe data presented in the study are deposited in the NCBIrepository, accession number PRJNA857812.Author contributionsXH: Writing - Original Draft, Methodology.
