ARTICLEParticulate organic matter as a functional soilcomponent for persistent soil organic carbonKristina Witzgall1✉, Alix Vidal1, David I. Schubert2, Carmen Höschen1, Steffen A. Schweizer1,Franz Buegger3, Valérie Pouteau4, Claire Chenu4& Carsten W. Mueller1,5The largest terrestrial organic carbon pool, carbon in soils, is regulated by an intricate con-nection between plant carbon inputs, microbial activity, and the soil matrix. This is manifestedby how microorganisms, the key players in transforming plant-derived carbon into soilorganic carbon, are controlled by the physical arrangement of organic and inorganic soilparticles. Here we conduct an incubation of isotopically labelled litter to study effects ofsoil structure on the fate of litter-derived organic matter. While microbial activity and fungalgrowth is enhanced in the coarser-textured soil, we show that occlusion of organic matterinto aggregates and formation of organo-mineral associations occur concurrently on freshlitter surfaces regardless of soil structure. These two mechanisms —the two most prominentprocesses contributing to the persistence of organic matter —occur directly at plant –soilinterfaces, where surfaces of litter constitute a nucleus in the build-up of soil carbon per-sistence. We extend the notion of plant litter, i.e., particulate organic matter, from solely aneasily available and labile carbon substrate, to a functional component at which persistence ofsoil carbon is directly determined.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24192-8 OPEN1Soil Science, TUM School of Life Sciences, Technical University of Munich, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany.2Institute for Organic Farming, Soil andResource Management, Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture, Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany.3Institute of Biochemical Plant Pathology,Helmholtz Zentrum München (GmbH), German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.4UMR Ecosys, INRA AgroParisTech, Bât.EGER, Thiverval-Grignon, France.5Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.✉email: kristina.witzgall@tum.deNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2021) 12:4115 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24192-8 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;Sustained by a continuous input of plant-derived carbon (C),soils comprise the largest terrestrial C pool; therefore, thispool has a decisive role in the global C cycle1,2. Microbialdecomposition is a crucial process in transforming plant-derivedorganic matter (OM) and in fostering the formation of soilorganic matter (SOM). Consequently, the abundance and activityof microorganisms determine the pathway of C from early-stageplant litter residues to persistent SOM3,4. In turn, the microbiomeis controlled by the soil environment, where biological, chemicaland physical factors determine microbial growth and activity5,6.One major factor for the biogeochemical functioning of soils isthe 3D arrangement of solids. The physical soil structure de ﬁnesthe porous network, affecting the movement and bioavailability ofgases (e.g., CO 2and O 2) and water6. Determined by pore size, thedifferences in soil water contents can shape ecological nichessuitable for certain microbial taxonomic groups. The size of poresalso controls the contact between microorganisms and theiressential source of energy and nutrients —the litter7. The effect ofsoil structure on the functionality of the microbial communitycan be predicted, e.g., via oxygen availability, which regulates Cturnover8.Over the last decades, it has become more evident that inherentchemical recalcitrance is of less importance to SOM persistencecompared to soil structure-driven mechanisms that rely on soilaggregation and accessibility of reactive mineral surfaces9,10. SoilC is mostly stored in two major pools: as particulate OM (POM;particulate organic residues mostly of plant origin) and mineral-associated OM (MAOM; OM adhering to mineral surfaces)11,12.Physical mechanisms, such as the potential of OM compounds toadhere to mineral surfaces13, or the accessibility of substrates formicroorganisms3, are now paving the way for a better under-standing of OM cycling and persistence in soils. This persistenceof soil C is regulated in microscale hot spots14at which micro-organisms transform plant-derived OM into SOM15. The func-tioning of biogeochemical interfaces between plant littersubstrates, microorganisms, and soil mineral surfaces requireschemical, physical, and biological factors to be considered in theconsortium.Here, we apply a systemic approach by investigating howphysical soil texture governs the pathway of litter-derived Ccompounds from initial plant litter into more persistent SOMpools via microbial transformation in a relevant process scale(µm–mm). To disentangle mineral-microorganism interactionsthat regulate these processes, we incubate two differently texturedsoils together with13C-labeled litter in a 95-day microcosmexperiment. Aside from monitoring CO 2production and litter-derived13CO 2release, we divide the microcosms into three depthincrements and follow alterations in the chemical composition ofSOM in POM and MAOM, and assess microbial communitystructures and microbial uptake of litter-derived13C intophospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). The intact biogeochemicalinterfaces between plant residues (POM), microorganisms, andsoil minerals were, for the ﬁrst time, directly studied using nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Our objectivein this study is to quantitatively assess interactions betweenmicrobial litter decay and the parallel formation of more persistentsoil C pools in regard to aggregate formation, as well as theassociation of microbial C with mineral surfaces. Our data showthat soil texture controls microbial activity and fungal growth,where litter addition leads to enhanced CO 2release and fungalabundance in the coarser-textured soil compared to the ﬁner-textured soil. The PLFA pro ﬁles further con ﬁrm that fungi mainlyconsume the litter, and transform it into microbial biomass. Theexpansion of the fungal hyphae leads to the build-up of litter-derived OM into deeper soil layers in the coarser-texturedsoil. This highlights the key role of fungi not only for litterdecomposition but also for the translocation of OM away from thedetritusphere. This is further underlined by the elemental andchemical composition of POM and MAOM fractions, showing theocclusion of fresh litter-derived C into soil aggregates in deepersoil layers away from the litter layer. Via direct measurements ofintact plant-soil interfaces at the nano-scale, we show the spatialdistribution and isotopic enrichment of fungal hyphae, micro-organisms, and soil minerals assembled at litter surfaces. Weconclude that POM surfaces are not only constituting hotspots formicrobial activity, but also for the occlusion and formation ofmineral-associated litter-derived OM regardless of soil texture,and ultimately, for the regulation of SOM persistence.ResultsLitter decomposition and native soil carbon priming .W emeasured how different soil textures and litter addition (enrichedin13C,δ13C=2129 ± 82 ‰V-PDB) affected the soil hetero-trophic respiration by monitoring the soil-CO 2emissions. Byanalyzing13CO 2, we were able to differentiate CO 2derivedfrom native soil organic C from CO 2derived from the addedlitter. In the coarse-textured soil, the total native respiration(89.4 mg CO 2-C g−1Cbulk) and the net litter-derived CO 2(40.4 mg CO 2-C g−1Cbulk)w e r es i g n i ﬁcantly higher than intheﬁne-textured soil (55.3 mg CO 2-C g−1Cbulkand 24.6 mgCO 2-C g−1Cbulk,P< 0.001, t=−7.512 and t=−6.593 respec-tively; df =8 for both, Fig. 1). While the litter-derived CO 2accounted for around 30% of the total respiration in bothsoil textures, the litter addition induced a higher total primingeffect in the coarse-textured soil (Fig. 1b and d), accountingfor a net release of 23.3 mg CO 2-C g−1Cbulkfrom the nativeLitter-derived Soil-derived Priming e ffecta b40 60 80dayscoarse texturecfine textured20 40 60 80days20060120060120cumulative mg CO2-Cg-1Cbulkcumulative mg CO2-Cg-1Cbulk****P = 6.8e−5***P = 1.7e−4***P = 1.6e−4Fig. 1 Cumulative heterotrophic respiration in ﬁne-textured and coarse-textured soil.

We assessed the contribution of OCderived from the decaying litter to the formation of differentlystabilized OM pools in two soils with contrasting textures dividedinto three depths (top, center, and bottom) by soil fractionationaccording to density and size. The soil-derived C in mg g−1Cbulkwas similarly distributed across OM fractions for both differentlystructured soils. The MAOM fraction dominated the C storagein both soils (Fig. 2a). In the coarse-textured soil, we found a sig-niﬁcantly higher litter-derived C content occluded within aggregates(oPOM; 71.1 mg C g−1Cbulkcompared to 36.8 mg C g−1Cbulkintheﬁne-textured soil, P=0.007, t=−5.03, df =4) and slightlyhigher content in the MAOM fraction (101.3 mg C g−1Cbulkin thesoil with coarser texture compared to 48.8 mg C g−1Cbulkin the soilwith a ﬁner texture, P=0.08, W =0; Fig. 2b). Although not sta-tistically signi ﬁcant, a tendency of a higher contribution of litter-derived C recovered as oPOM and MAOM in the coarse-texturedsoil further extended down with soil depth to the center layer of themicrocosms ( P=0.06 in both cases, t=−2.66 and −2.60, respec-tively; df =4 for both).Fresh litter incorporated into soil aggregate structures . Thechemical composition of OM fractions was analyzed using13Csolid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).Carbohydrates (O/N alkyl C) clearly dominated the NMR spectraof all fPOM fractions (Fig. 3), and similar chemical compositionwas also detected in oPOM fractions of both textures with litter.In oPOM fractions, the added litter had induced an increase inrelative intensity from around 50% to 70% in the O/N alkyl Cregion (Supplementary Table 1), demonstrating the dominance ofpolysaccharides (mainly cellulose and hemicellulose)16. Accord-ing to the molecular mixing model results, this was further sup-ported by the relative increase in carbohydrates ( +26% in thecoarse-textured and +20% in the ﬁne-textured soil) accompaniedby a relative decrease in lignin ( −12% in the coarse-texturedand−10% in the ﬁne-textured soil) in oPOM fractions(Supplementary Table 2)17,18.

The changescaused by litter addition in microbial community structures betweenthe textures were captured via the measurement of microbial-derivedPLFA. The litter amendment led to a slight increase in thetotal PLFA content in the top layers of both the coarse-textured(61 nmol g−1mg soil C−1,P=0.07, t=−2.40, df =4) and ﬁne-textured soil (76 nmol g−1mg soil C−1,P=0.10, t=−2.15, df =4),whereas the total PLFA contents in the center and bottom layerswere similar to those of the controls (Fig. 4aa n db ) .W h i l et h edifferences in soil texture had no effect on the overall communitystructure, a strong response to litter addition was detected in fungalbiomarkers. The increase in fung al markers was particularly pro-nounced in the top layer of the coarse-textured soil where fungalabundance increased by a factor of 5.4 ( P=0.01, t=−4.11, df =4)compared to 2.6 in the ﬁne-textured soil ( P=0.15, t=−1.75, df =4). As opposed to the other observed microbial groups, the increasein fungal markers also extended into the center layer of microcosmswith coarse-textured soil (2.1 nmol g−1mg soil C−1compared to0.4 nmol g−1mg soil C−1in the control, P=0.02, t=−3.81, df =4;Fig.4c), while there was no corresponding increase in the respectivelayers in the ﬁner-textured soil (Fig. 4d).When considering the proportion of fatty acids with incorpo-rated litter-derived13C within the observed groups in relation tothe total amount of enriched FAs in the sample, neither texturenor depth had an effect (Fig. 5a). This corroborated the consistentcommunity structures detected during the PLFA analysis. Whenconsidering the proportions of13C-enriched FAs to unlabeledFAs within each microbial group, the proportion was by far thehighest in the fungal markers (92% in the coarser-textured and82% in ﬁner-textured soil, P=0.11 between textures, t=−2.04,df=4, Fig. 5b). This distinction of fungi compared to othermicrobial groups was signi ﬁcant in top layers of both textures, aswell as in the center layer of the coarse-textured soil (over 42% ofFAs were enriched compared to 21% in the ﬁne-textured soil).Furthermore, the proportion of enriched gram-negative markerswere signi ﬁcantly higher in all layers of the coarser-textured soil(P=0.004, t=−5.79, P=0.019, t=−3.83, and P=0.0007, t=−9.54; df =4 for all) compared to the ﬁne-textured soil.Formation of MAOM fostered by microbial activity ondecaying POM surface . We gained direct insight into the bio-geochemical interface between decaying plant residues (POM),mineral particles, and microorganisms at the microscale usingscanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. 6, Fig. 7a1 and b1,Supplementary Fig. 1) and NanoSIMS. This approach allowed todetermine elemental and isotopic information on fungal hyphae,unicellular microorganisms and extracellular polymeric sub-stances (EPS;12C14N−distribution), soil minerals (16O−dis-tribution), and litter-derived POM particles (12C−distribution).We quanti ﬁed the13C-enrichment in EPS covering large areasof the POM particles, forming a bio ﬁlm-like structure that wasintertwined with13C labeled fungal hyphae and unicellularmicroorganisms (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Clay-sizedminerals were directly enclosed into the bio ﬁlm on the POMsurface (Figs. 6and 7b).

The13C−:(12C−+13C−)r a t i o sf o rfungal hyphae, bacteria, and EPS (3.0, 2.3, and 3.0 atom %13C,respectively) were well over the natural abundance level (1.1 atom %13C ) ,a n dt h eh y p h a es h o w e das i g n i ﬁcantly higher enrichmentcompared to bacteria and POM ( P<0 . 0 5 , d f =3, Fig. 7c).DiscussionSoil texture, and thus the 3D structure of soils, controls overallmicrobial activity; the coarser soil texture entailed both higherdecomposition of litter-derived OM, and an increased primingeffect, fostering the mineralization of native soil C (Fig. 1b and d).Plant litter fragments located in larger soil pores of coarse-textured soils are more easily accessible; therefore, litter decom-position is enhanced19–21. In the coarse-textured soil, theincreased accessibility and, hence, increased bioavailability oflitter-derived C was further demonstrated by consistently higherproportions of labeled PLFAs in gram-negative bacteria across allsoil depths (Fig. 5b); bacteria that are specialized in the processingof labile plant C sources22,23.We show that the coarse-textured soil offered a more favorablehabitat for fungi in a microenvironment rich in bioavailablesubstrates formed by fresh unprotected litter. Fungal abundanceincreased by more than ﬁve-fold following the litter addition inthe coarse-textured soil. Furthermore, a substantial part (92% inthe coarse-textured soil) of the fungal biomass was directlyderived from the added plant litter, as demonstrated by the PLFAmeasurements (labeled PLFA pro ﬁles; Fig. 5b). This highlights thekey role of the fungal community for rapid litter decomposition,particularly in coarse-textured soils. Soil structure with a distinctsoil pore network determines the abundance and communitystructure of microbiota24and fungi are mainly found in macro-pore spaces (>10 µm) that are noticeably larger than the hyphaeitself19,25,26. The ﬁlamentous growth of the mycelium enablesfungi to bridge air- ﬁlled pore spaces, supporting them to over-come capillary boundaries between wet and dry soil and to adaptto heterogeneous pore networks27–29. Consequently, under thephysical conditions of coarse-textured soils, fungi have a clearadvantage over other microorganisms to reach OM in hard-to-access soil compartments that are not connected via water norbioﬁlms24. Our microcosm experiment suggests that in sandysoils, fungi are key to sustain crucial soil functions such as C andnutrient cycling by the transformation of litter-derived OMinto SOM.a100%bcoarse texture ﬁne textureBacteria Gram+ Gram- Fungi**proportion of litter-derivedfatty acids (%)a100500********ababbaabcdaaabaabaaaabbaTop Center Bottom Top Center Bottomﬁne textureproportion of litter-derivedfatty acids (%)coarse texture**********a***ab***100500Top Center Bottom Top Center BottomFig. 5 Litter incorporation in microbial biomass. a The proportion of litter-derived fatty acids within a certain microbial group related to the total amountof litter-enriched fatty acids in the entire sample (%) in the three depths of two textures (means, n=3 independent replicates). bThe proportion of13C-enriched fatty acids compared to unlabeled fatty acids within each microbial group (%) in the three depths of two textures (means, SDs displayed wit herrors bars, n=3 independent replicates).

The expansion of hyphalnetworks facilitates the incorporation of litter into aggregates33,34.Microorganisms have a decisive role in soil aggregate formationprocesses35, and the stabilization of aggregated soil structures canpartly be ascribed to the exudation of EPS (e.g., polysaccharides,Fig.7a and b) from the hypha36. We propose that the expansionof fungal hyphae, together with its interactions with mineralparticles, results in the build-up of litter-derived oPOM in thedeeper soil layers away from the litter source (Fig. 2b). Thisintricate interaction between fungal hyphae, plant residues, andmineral particles adhering to microbial-derived EPS was under-lined by spectromicroscopic imaging (Figs. 6and 7). With thedirect measurement of intact plant-fungi interfaces, we emphasizethe key role of fungi in the translocation of litter-derived C withinsoils, as well as in the formation of aggregates and mineral-associated OM –a process which ultimately drives the stabilizationof litter-derived C compounds in soils37.We were able to demonstrate the incorporation of plant Cinto microbial biomass directly at the interface of plant residuesand soil minerals. This was quanti ﬁed with high levels of13Cenrichment in fungal hyphae and microbial EPS on the POMsurface (Fig. 7). The direct contact between minerals (16O−dis-tribution; Fig. 6) and microbial biomass (12C14N−; Fig. 7),together with the enmeshment of fresh litter (POM) with fungalhyphae and microbial-derived EPS (Fig. 7a and b), promotes thecohesion of ﬁne-sized soil minerals38,39. This agglomeration ofﬁne mineral particles, driven by microbial activity and regulatedby the bioavailability of litter-derived C, drives the aggregateformation and soil structure development40directly at the plant-soil interface. In addition, the chemical composition of the litter-derived OM that got entrapped in soil aggregates (oPOM) by thissoil structure formation resembled the undecomposed litter(Fig. 3). Thus, particulate OM acts as an important precursor forthe aggregate formation41and parallel occlusion of litter-derivedPOM into aggregated soil structures (Fig. 8).Regardless of soil texture, fresh litter surfaces serve as hotspotsof microbial activity driving the formation of organo-mineralassociations in concert with comprising a nucleus for aggregateformation. Thus, the biogeochemical interfaces of decaying plantlitter determine —via promoted microbial activity —the two mostprominent mechanisms which increase the persistence of OC insoils; the (i) occlusion of POM in soil aggregates and (ii) theassociation of OM with mineral surfaces as simultaneous pro-cesses across soils of different structure (Fig. 8). These twomechanisms strongly rely on the spatial proximity of particulatelitter and its surfaces, microbial residues, and ﬁne-sized mineralparticles. Thus, the formation of persistent POM and MAOM,b aa1 a2 b1 b20.060.01a30.060.01Fungal hyphaeMineral particlePOMEPSb3Micro-aggregate00.030.0603613C atom%0112 14 − 12 − 12 14 −CN: (C +CN )Bacteria POMHyphae EPScd13 12 13C  :( C   +C   )-- - 13 12 13C  :( C   +C   )-- -13 − 12 − 13 −C: ( C  +C   )aabbbabcdFig. 7 High13C enrichment detected in fungal hyphae and EPS based on NanoSIMS imaging.

The soil was collected at 5 −20 cm (Ap horizon)from an agricultural ﬁeld in Southern Germany (Freising, Bavaria, 48°23'53.8 “N,11°38'39.7 “E) in December 2017. The sampling area is situated within the lowerBavarian upland, and characterized by a mean annual temperature of 7.8 °C andmean annual precipitation of 786 mm. The soil type is a Cambisol (silty clay loam;32% clay, 53% silt, and 14% sand) with a considerable amount of loess mixed withunderlying Neogene sandy sediments. The soil was selected to represent a widelydistributed soil type and land use. The collected soil was oven-dried (2 days, 40 °C),sieved (<2 mm), and visible plant remains were manually removed using tweezers.Experimental setup . The experimental design involved four treatments; soils oftwo textures, either with or without13C-labeled maize stalks. In order to obtain acoarse-textured soil (sandy clay loam; 24% clay, 15% silt, and 60% sand), half of theinitial soil was mixed with cleaned quartz sand (Quarzwerke, Frechen, Germany) toincrease the sand content from 14% to 60% (Supplementary Table 3). To achieveconsistent bulk densities between treatments (0.9 –1.3 g cm−3) 120 g (for coarsertexture) and 90 g (for ﬁner texture) soil was ﬁlled homogeneously and gentlypacked into microcosms (height: 5 cm, internal diameter: 5 cm, total volume:98.2 cm3; polyoxymethylene, 1.4 g cm−3; Sahlberg, Munich, Germany). While thecontrol microcosms were ﬁlled entirely with soil, 330 mg of air-dried and grounded13C-labeled maize stalks (2 –3 mm, δ13C=2129 ± 82 ‰V-PDB; SupplementaryTable 4; Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland) were mixed into the upper 1.67 cm of thesoil within the other microcosms to create a quasi-natural gradient, with above-ground litter addition from the top (Fig. 9). Maize was chosen as litter substrate asit is a crop grown worldwide in agricultural systems. Each of the four treatmentswas replicated ﬁve times. The microcosms were sealed from below with polyestergauzes (37-µm mesh) and placed into Ball Mason Jars (475 ml) on top of metalgrids to ensure downward gas diffusion.Heterotrophic respiration . After making all containers gas-tight and rinsing themwith synthetic air (Westfalen AG, Münster, Germany), 12 ml of gas samples (IVAAnalysentechnik, Meerbusch, Germany) were collected from the headspace of theMason Jars on day 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 15, 23, 31, 44, 65, 80, and 95. For each mea-surement of CO2respiration, two samplings of the container atmosphere werecarried out, and the time in between the two samplings was adapted to the currentrespiration rates. During the incubation period of 95 d, the CO 2concentration, aswell as the13C abundance in the respired CO 2, was measured via gas chromato-graphy isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS; Delta Plus, Thermo Fisher,Dreieich, Germany). The CO 2levels were calibrated against three calibration gases(890, 1500, and 3000 ppm CO 2; Linde AG, Pullach, Germany). Then, CO 2withknown isotopic composition, diluted in helium, was used as a lab standard. Thisstandard was in turn calibrated against three international standards (RM 8562,RM 8563, and RM 8564; International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria)with a dual inlet system. The temperature and water holding capacity were keptconstant at 21 °C and 60%, respectively, along with the incubation period.Sampling . Following 95 days of incubation, each microcosm was cut into threehorizontal sections with a razor blade, separating the top, center, and bottom layer(each 1.67-cm high). The microcosms were designed to be opened from the side,allowing for precise separation of the depth increments (Supplementary Fig. 4).Subsamples for subsequent microbial analyses were freeze-dried and stored at 4 °C,and dried aliquots for fractionation were stored in sealed plastic containers at20 °C. Furthermore, a few POM particles were selected manually for NanoSIMSmeasurements.Physical fractionation and subsequent analyses . The soil was separated into ﬁvedistinct OM fractions using a combined density and particle size fractionationscheme11. Air-dried soil (18 –20 g) was gently capillary-saturated with sodiumpolytungstate solution (Na 6[H2W12O40]; 1.8 g cm−3) and after 12 h, the free-ﬂoating particulate organic matter (fPOM) was collected using a vacuum pump.oPOM was released from aggregated soil structures via ultrasonic dispersion(Bandelin, Sonoplus HD 2200; energy input of 440 J ml−1)42allowing its separationfrom heavier minerals. The excess salt was removed from the oPOM by washing itwith deionized water over a sieve (20-µm mesh size), which yielded an oPOMfraction of <20 µm (oPOM small). Both fPOM and oPOM fractions were washedseveral times using deionized water and pressure ﬁltration (20-µm mesh) until thesolution dropped below an electric conductivity of <5 µS cm−1via pressure ﬁl-tration. The oPOM smallfraction was cleaned via saturation with deionized water for24 h. While sand and coarse silt fractions were separated by wet sieving, mineralfractions <20 µm were separated via sedimentation, and later combined as oneMAOM fraction. The C, N, and13C contents were determined for freeze-dried andmilled OM fractions, as well as milled bulk soil, via dry combustion with an isotoperatio mass spectrometer (Delta V Advantage, Thermo Fisher, Dreieich, Germany)coupled with an elemental analyzer (Euro EA, Eurovector, Milano, Italy). Acet-anilide was used as a lab standard for calibration and to determine the isotopelinearity of the system, and was in turn calibrated against several suitable isotopestandards (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria). Internationaland lab isotope standards were included in every sequence to create a ﬁnal13CCO2 CO 2fungal plant litterbacteriafine-sizedmineralprimarymineralsA(e.g. clayminerals)(e.g. quartzgrains)CDBEPSmicro-aggregatemacro-aggregatecoarse texture fine texturebothtextures(POM)mineral-associatedorganic matterhyphaeFig. 8 Aggregate and mineral-associated organic matter formation in soils of different textures driven by interactions between litter, microorgan isms,and soil matrix.

Since the samples did not contain carbonates, the C contents wereassumed to be equal to organic C contents.13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . The chemical compositions ofthe POM fractions were determined via13C CP-MAS NMR in solid-state (BrukerDSX 200, Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), where samples were ﬁlledinto 7-mm zirconium dioxide rotors and spun in a magic angle spinning probe at arotation speed of 6.8 kHz and 0.01024 s acquisition time. The recorded13C spectrawere quanti ﬁed in the following chemical shift regions: alkyl C ( −10–45 ppm),O/N alkyl C (45 –110 ppm), aromatic C (110 –160 ppm), and carbonyl/carboxyl C(160–220 ppm)11. The regions were integrated and an alkyl C:O alkyl C ratio(−10–45/45 –110 ppm) was computed to describe the degree of aliphaticity of thedifferent fractions43. Lastly, the obtained spectra were transformed into OMcompound classes via the molecular mixing model18,44with the following chemicalshift regions: 0 –45, 45 –60, 60 –95, 95 –110, 100 –145, 145 –165, and 165 –215 ppm.Calculations of litter-derived C in CO 2, soil, and OM fractions . Along with theincubation period, the amount of C respired per hour was computed (Eq. 1).mg CO2-Ch¼4CO24tppmminhi/C151106/C15VHSPml½/C13824:1mlmmol/C2/C3 /C1512mg CO2-Cmmol/C20/C21/C1560 minð1Þwhere ΔCO 2/Δtis CO 2increase over time, VHSPis the volume of the headspace ofMason Jars, the volume of an ideal gas at 21 °C is set at 24.1, and 12 represents theatomic mass of C.Subsequently, the percentage of respired CO2originating from the litter wascalculated (Eq. 2).CO2-Clitter%½/C138¼δ13Cresp/C0δ13Ccontrolδ13Clitter/C0δ13Ccontrol !/C15100 ð2Þwhere δ13Crespemission gives the δ13C for the current CO 2emission between thetwo samplings ( ‰V-PDB), δ13Ccontrol is the average δ13C of the control soils at thetime of measurement, and δ13Clitteris the δ13C signature of the labeled litter.Finally, the respired C originating from the soil was computed (Eq. 3).CO2-Csoil%½/C138¼100/C0CO2-Clitter ð3ÞThe proportion of litter-derived C (%) in the OM fractions was calculated (Eq. 4)45.Litter-derived C %½/C138¼δ13Clabeled /C0δ13Ccontrolδ13Clitter/C0δ13Ccontrol/C15100 ð4Þwhere δ13Clabeled is the13C enrichment in labeled samples, δ13Ccontrol is the13Cenrichment in controls (natural abundance level, i.e., 28 ‰V-PDB), and δ13Clitteristhe13C enrichment in the added litter (i.e., 2129 ‰V-PDB) from which theamount of litter-derived C within each OM fraction could then be determined(Eq. 5).Clittermg/C2/C3¼litter-derived C100´Cfraction ´m ð5Þwhere C fraction is the amount of C in mg g−1, and mis the recovered mass (g) ofeach fraction after the fractionation.PLFA analyses . The PLFA patterns were analyzed46and adjusted according to theISO/TS 29843-2:2011F standard. In summary, the soil lipids from 3 g of soil(freeze-dried aliquots) were extracted with a Bligh and Dyer solution [methanol,chloroform, and citrate buffer (pH =4 ± 0.1), 2:1:0.8, v/v/v]. A biphasic system wasachieved by adding chloroform and citrate buffer from which the lipid phase wasevaporated at 30 °C under a nitrogen stream. The phospholipids were separatedfrom neutral lipids and glycolipids by solid-phase extraction on silica tubes (SPEDSC-Si, 500 mg, Discovery®) and evaporated. The PLFA were turned into fatty acidmethyl esters (FAMEs) via alkaline methanolysis47and later quanti ﬁed via gaschromatic retention time comparison with a gas chromatograph (GC AgilentHP6890, G1530A, Chemstation, Santa Clara, USA) connected to a ﬂame ionizationdetector equipped with a capillary column (SGE, BPX5, 60 m × 0,25 mm ×0,25 mm). The FAME concentrations were quanti ﬁed relative to methyl non-adecanoate (19:0), enabling methylated lipids to be identi ﬁed. A standard soil wasused and extracted in parallel to detect potential deviations between the extractionrounds, expressed in nmol C-FA per g of soil. Mono-unsaturated and cyclopro-pylated PLFA (C16:1w7c, C18:1w9c, and C18:1w9t) were assigned to gram-negative bacteria, iso-branched and anteiso-branched PLFA (iC15:0, aC15:0,iC16:0, i-C17:0, C:17, and C18:0) were assigned to gram-positive bacteria andC18:2w6c, C18:3w3c, respectively C20:5w3c were assigned to fungi48. The totalcontent of bacteria was expressed by adding gram-positive, gram-negative togetherwith the markers C14:0, C16:0, C20:0, and C15:1.

(1) The coarse soil texture was obtained by adding quartz sandto the loamy soil material, achieving a total sand content of 60% compared to 14% in the ﬁner-textured soil consisting only of the original soil material.(2) The uppermost layer of the microcosm was prepared by mixing13C labeled plant litter with homogenized soil. Two-thirds of the microcosms were ﬁlledwith soil material, and the prepared litter layer was added as the top layer in respective textures. ( 3) Five replicates for each of the four treatments (two soiltextures with or without plant litter added) were incubated for 95 days. Respiration measurements ( a) were carried out on all ﬁve replicates. ( 4) Eachmicrocosm was cut into three depths and depth increments were thereafter always analyzed separately. ( 5) While bulk analyses ( b) were conducted on allﬁve replicates, three representative replicates were selected based on C and N concentrations for physical fractionation ( c) and phospholipid fatty acidanalysis (PLFA; d). Obtained organic matter fractions (POM and MAOM) were analyzed for C, N, and13C(c1) and the chemical composition of thefractions was determined via13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy ( c2). Lastly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-scale secondary ion massspectrometry (NanoSIMS) measurements ( e) were carried out on various fragments of particulate OM that had been handpicked from samples of bothtextures.ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24192-88 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2021) 12:4115 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24192-8 | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsand relating it to the chain length of fatty acids (Eq. 6).δ13CFAV-PDB½/C138 ¼Cnþ1/C0/C1´δ13CFAME /C0δ13CMeOHCnð6Þwhere δ13CFArepresents the δ13Co ft h ef a t t ya c i d ,C nthe number of C atomsin the fatty acid, δ13CFAME is the δ13Co ft h ef a t t ya c i dm e t h y le s t e r ,a n dδ13CMeOH is the δ13C of the methanol used for the methylation ( −63%)to calculate the isotope ratios of the fatt y acids. The relative incorporation of13C into four microbial groups was calculated by relating the proportions ofeach fatty acid to the total13C incorporation, and the absolute incorporationof13C in each microbial group was calculated by dividing the amount of13Cenriched fatty acid by the total amount of extracted fatty acid for thatparticular group.SEM and NanoSIMS microspectroscopy . In order to gain insights into themicroscale distribution of the assemblages of litter with microbes and minerals, weused SEM and NanoSIMS. Free POM from non-fractionated soil was hand-pickedandﬁxed onto graphene sample substrates on metal stubs (10 mm in diameter). Toavoid the charging phenomena, samples were gold-coated prior to SEM analyses byphysical vapor deposition under an argon atmosphere (Emitech SputtercoaterSC7620, Gala Instrumente, Bad Schwalbach, Germany). To analyze the microscalestructures of the assemblages of POM, microorganisms and soil minerals of thesamples were ﬁrst analyzed using SEM (Jeol JSM 5900LV, Freising, Germany), andsubsequently, the spots that best exempli ﬁed the microbial transformation on thedecaying litter (POM) surface were analyzed using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 L(Cameca, Gennevilliers, France)49. For the NanoSIMS measurements, a 270-pAhigh primary beam was used to locally sputter away impurities and gold coating,and to implant primary ions (Cs+) into the sample ’s surface (impact energy of16 keV) to enhance the yields of secondary ions. Subsequently, secondary ions weremeasured using electron multipliers;12C−,13C−,12C14N−to display OM fragmentsand16O−,28Si−,27Al16O−, and56Fe16O−secondary ions to record the mineralphase. The instrument was tuned to a high mass resolution in order to accuratelyseparate mass isobars at mass 13 (13C−,12C1H−). The ion images were acquiredwith a 25 × 25 µm ﬁeld of view, 40 planes and 1 ms pixel−1dwell time for allmeasurements. Charging effects were compensated for with an electron ﬂood gun ifnecessary. The acquired measurements were dead time (44 ns) and drift correctedusing the OpenMIMS plugin of the ImageJ software. The13C−:(12C−+13C−) and12C14N−:(12C−+12C14N−) ratios were computed for distinct regions of interestswhich were chosen manually with respect to the major compartments: continuousfragments of fungal hyphae, individual bacteria, EPS patches, as well as exposedPOM surfaces. To account for instrumental mass fractionation, the electron mul-tipliers were carefully checked, and the control measurements of non-labeledPOM samples were conducted regularly along with the sessions. Here, the mean13C−:(12C−+13C−) ratios were in line with the level of natural abundance, whichmeant that a correction of ratios for labeled POM samples was not necessary.Statistical analyses . All parameters were separately tested for normality withShapiro –Wilk test and for homoscedasticity with Bartlett ’s test. In addition, thedistribution of the datasets was checked with Q –Q plots. In cases where theassumptions of normality or homoscedasticity were not met, a log-transformationwas applied on the raw data, and analyses were carried out on the log-transformeddata. The differences caused by texture and litter addition were tested usingunpaired t-tests, and depth differences were tested using one-way analysis ofvariance with Tukey ’s honestly signi ﬁcant difference as the post-hoc test. In caseswhere the log-transformed data did not meet the requirements for parametricaltesting, the unpaired two-samples Wilcoxon test or Kruskal-Wallis test wasapplied. The statistical ﬁndings were considered signi ﬁcant if the con ﬁdence limitswere in excess of 95% ( P< 0.05). All statistical testing was carried out in the Rstatistical environment50using agricolae51and ggpubr52packages.Reporting summary .
