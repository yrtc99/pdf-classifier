Endophyticbacteria improve plant health and are sometimes necessary to ﬁght againstadverse conditions. There is an increasing trend for the use of bacterialendophytes as bio-fertilizers. Howev er, new challenges are also arisingregarding the management of these newly discovered bacterial endophytes.Plant growth-promoting bacterial endophytes exist in a wide host range as partof their microbiome, and are proven to exhibit positive effects on plant growth.Endophytic bacterial communities within plant hosts are dynamic and affectedby abiotic/biotic factors such as soil conditions, geographical distribution,climate, plant species, and plant-mi crobe interaction at a large scale.Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the mechanism of bacterialendophytes ’interaction with plants under ﬁeld conditions before theirapplication. Bacterial endophytes have both bene ﬁcial and harmful impactson plants but the exact mechanism of interaction is poorly understood. A basicapproach to exploit the potential genetic elements involved in an endophyticlifestyle is to compare the genomes of rhizospheric plant growth-promotingbacteria with endophytic bacteria. In this mini-review, we will be focused tocharacterize the genetic diversity and dynamics of endophyte interaction indifferent host plants.KEYWORDShost endosymbiont interactions, mechanism of interaction, bacterial endophytes,plants, endophyticFrontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 01OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYMamoona Rauf,Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan,PakistanREVIEWED BYJulio Alves Cardoso Filho,Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil*CORRESPONDENCEMuhammad Adnan Shahidmshahid@u ﬂ.eduMuhammad Sha ﬁqshaﬁq.iags@pu.edu.pkSPECIALTY SECTIONThis article was submitted toPlant Symbiotic Interactions,a section of the journalFrontiers in Plant ScienceRECEIVED 07 November 2022ACCEPTED 22 December 2022PUBLISHED 18 January 2023CITATIONMushtaq S, ShaﬁqM , Tariq MR, Sami A,Nawaz-ul-Rehman MS, Bhatti MHT,Haider MS, Sadiq S, Abbas MT,Hussain M and Shahid MA (2023)Interaction between bacterialendophytes and host plants.Front.

Microorganisms can colonize onplants ’surfaces or internal parts depending on the host genotypeand the molecular signals released by plant roots.Microorganisms can colonize on plants ’surfaces or internalparts depending on the host genotype and the molecular signalsreleased by plant roots. Endophytes are prokaryotic bacteriafound within the healthy host tissue ( Brader et al., 2014 ).Bacterial endophytes can bene ﬁt the host in several ways, suchas biotic and abiotic stress resistance, increased availability ofnutrients, degradation of toxic molecules, and production ofphytohormones ( Kandel et al., 2015 ).Plant population dynamics have soil microbialintermediation. The plant has a microbial population inthe phyllosphere, endophytes, or rhizospheric microbes. Theecology and phenotype of the plants can be affected by theinﬂuence of symbiotic microbes on the atmosphere andcompetition for soil resources.The plant genotype affects the microbial make-up of thephyllosphere, rhizosphere, a nd endophytic microorganisms(Lynch et al., 2001 ). Although the precise method involves theplant-associated microorganisms and ecosystem function, theother speci ﬁc mechanism is still unknown. Because they are co-evolved with bacteria, plants are immobile and need to controlthe results of their intricate interactions ( Schnitzer andKlironomos, 2011 ). Different sorts of chemicals arecontinuously produced by plant roots, gathered, and secretedinto the soil ( Wood et al., 2012 ) known as the root exudateswhich contain enzymes, water, mucilage, H+ions, and primary,secondary compounds made up of carbon ( Singh, 2015 ). Everyplant species ’rhizosphere is known to have a microorganismpopulation that is 100 times higher than soil and is mostlycontrolled by compounds generated by roots ( Jonkers et al.,2003 ;Bever, 2003 ). The favorable plant-soil microbial responseenhances the microbial populations ’spatial spread ( Schimelet al., 2007 ), while negative reaction results in plantreplacement, which demands recolonization of locally speci ﬁcroots ( Bever et al., 2010 ;Pedrotti et al., 2013 ).It has been proposed that endophytic bacteria vary fromrhizobacteria in their genetic architecture, which may accountfor their capacity to colonise plant tissues internally. However,no speci ﬁc gene or gene family has been found to explain theendophytic regime. In a 2014 study, the whole genomes of nineProteobacteria were compared to identify a list of genes that mayplay a role in the endophytic activity. So yet, only a few of thosegenes have undergone experimental testing to determinewhether they are involved in endophytic colonisation ( Shenet al., 2013 ;Ouyabe et al., 2019 ). In this study, we havedocumented some mechanisms involved in plant endophyteinteraction at the molecular level.2 Plant growth promotionby endophytesPGPEs enhance plant development through three interconnectedmechanisms: phytostimulation, biofertilization, and biocontrol.Phytostimulation is the product ion of phytohormones for directplant development ( Vishwakarma et al., 2021 ). The amount of theplant hormone ethylene frequently declines as a result of the enzyme1-aminocyclopropane-1-ca rboxylate (ACC) deaminase ( Cruz Barreraet al., 2020 ). According to numerous studies, the pea plant and thepepper plant ( Pseudomonas putida andPiper nigrum , respectively)both have bacterial endophytes t hat release ACC deaminase to aidplant growth ( Rudus ́et al, 2013 ). By controlling ethylene levels inplants, ACC deaminize production may minimize abiotic stressbecause an increase in ethylene can obstruct DNA synthesis, rootand shoot growth, and cell division. However, the speci ﬁcm e t h o df o renhanced plant development is still unknown ( Gonza ́lez Candia,2021). Bacterial strains also produ ced other hormones which includeabscisic acid, indole-3-acetic ac id, and jasmonic acid, to stimulateplant growth ( Forchetti et al., 2007 ).The endophytes can enhanceplant growth by increasing the availability of important nutrientsknown as bio-fertilization.Nitrogen ﬁxation is the most studied phenomenon of bio-fertilization which is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen intoammonia ( Mishra and Arora, 2016 ). Bacterial species likeAzospirillum spp., Pantoea agglomerans ,a n d Azoarcus spp. allare known to be involved in a substantial amount of nitrogenﬁxation in plant roots ( Indiragandhi et al., 2008 ). Nonetheless,only 21 PGPEs can increase plant phosphorus availability bysolubilizing phosphate. The metal cation linked to phosphorous ischelated as a result of the release of low molecular weight acids,making it more available to plants. The researchers have isolated,identi ﬁed, and assessed the ability of Achromobacter xiloxidansand Bacillus pumilus to solubilize phosphate in sun ﬂowers(Barrera et al., 2020 ). PGPEs were utilized to treat corn,lowering the quantity of arti ﬁcial phosphorus fertilizer requiredwhile increasing yields by up to 50% ( Cruz Barrera et al., 2019 ).The protection of plants from phytopathogens and theirgrowth promotion is known as biological control. Antibiotic andsiderophores production are involved in biological controlmechanisms. Siderophores like pyochelin and alicyclic acidand chelate iron are not directly involved in disease controldue to their competition with pathogens for trace metals(Leopold, 1964 ). The disease can be suppressed in plants byantimicrobial metabolites secreted by bacterial endophytes suchas 2,4-diacetylphloroglucin ol (DAPG). Seed treatment ofeggplant (Solanum melongena ) with DAPG-producingbacterial endophytes reduced 70% of eggplant wilt caused byRalstonia solanacearum (Rana et al., 2020a ).Burkholderia, Bacillus, Ps eudomonas, Enterobacter ,a n dSerratia are just a few of the bacterial endophyte strains thatare successful at preventing the growth of pathogenic germs inMushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 02both in vitro andin vivo settings ( Khan and Doty, 2009 ). Asidefrom that, bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Enterobacter,Arthrobacter, Azotobacter, Isolptericola, Streptomyces ,a n dPseudomonas improved the crop ’s stress resistance from heat,drought, and salt ( Rana et al., 2020b ;Khalil et al., 2021 ). Themost important interaction between these endophytes andsymbiotic plants allowed the plants to signi ﬁcantly increasetheir biomass and height while lowering stress. Although, it isnot yet clear how bacterial endophytes lessen abiotic stress ( Liuet al., 2014 ).2.1 Rhizobium and process ofnodule formationRhizobium is a member of the family Rhizobiaceae and theclass Alphaproteobacteria . Rhizobium, was the name given tothis genus for the ﬁrst time by Frank in 1889. There are 11 non-rhizobial species and 49 rhizobial species in the familyRhizobiaceae at the moment ( Ledermann et al., 2021 ). Therhizobial species induce the nodules on the roots of plants(Fabaceae family) and are linked to symbiotic nitrogen- ﬁxingbacteria. The nodule ’s nitrogen ﬁxation activity is extremelyoxygen sensitive. The host plant receives continual supplies ofreduced nitrogen from the bacterial enzyme system in thissymbiotic connection, and the bacteria in exchange receivenutrients and energy from the plant ( Van Rhijn andVanderleyden, 1995 ). Nodules can occur in about 10% oflegumes. The majority of the rhizobacteria in soil are oxygensensitive and feed on the decomposing remains ofother organisms.In roots, nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria occur as irregular cellsknown as bacteroids, which are frequently Y, club-shaped andappear as straight rods with a regular structure (Figure 1 ).Bacteroidsencode genes that determine the rhizobium ’s hostspeciﬁcity ( Lodwig and Poole, 2003 ). Rhizobia that generatenodules but are unable to ﬁx nitrogen are sometimes referred toas ineffective strains, whereas effective strains cause nitrogenﬁxation in nodules. Nodule development is controlled by certaingenes known as nod genes i.e. nodF, nodE, nodL, nodP, nodQ,FIGURE 1Diagrammatic representation of the whole process of nodule formation through rhizobia.Mushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03and nodH ( Basile and Lepek, 2021 ). Some substances, such asﬂavonoids, are released by the root cells and trigger theproduction of nodules in bacteria by activating the nod gene.In essence, these chemicals are in charge of identifying theproper host and attaching to the root hairs.The nod factors, which are secreted by bacteria, cause the roothairs to curl ( Moran, 1997 ). The root hair tip is damaged byrhizobia, which also causes the infection thread to arise. Thethread then extends to neighboring cells by thread branching, andthe bacteria continue to grow within the growing network oftubes, continuing to create nod factors that encourage the growthof the root cells and ultimately result in the formation of rootnodules ( Oldroyd et al., 2011 ). Following a week of infection,nodules are visible with the unaided eye and each nodule containsthousands of living rhizobium bacteria, the majority of which aremalformed and are referred to as bacteroids. Small sections of theplant cell membranes called symbiosomes, which may or may notinclude multiple bacteroids, are located next to bacteroids and areactive sites for nitrogen ﬁxation ( Ratu et al., 2021 ). Through theNitrogenase enzyme , also known as Nitrogenize catalysis, nitrogengas from the atmosphere is converted inside legume nodules intoammonia, which is then assimilated into amino acids, DNA, andRNA as well as signi ﬁcant energy molecules like ATP or otherchemicals like vitamins, ﬂavones, and hormones ( Bergersen,1961). The Nitrogenize complex is protected by a variety ofmechanisms used by aerobic free-living bacteria, includingphysical barriers and fast metabolic rates. Azotobacter, forinstance, circumvents this issue by maintaining the lowestoxygen concentration in its cells and the greatest rate ofrespiration of any organism. In the instance of Rhizobium, thenodule ’s red iron-containing protein, similar to hemoglobin infunction to bond with oxygen, maintains control over the oxygenlevel ( Lindström and Mousavi, 2020 ). However, this avoids theaccumulation of free oxygen to prevent the loss of Nitrogenizeactivity while still providing enough oxygen for the metabolicfunctioning of bacteriods. Rhizobia and plants work together tomake leghemoglobin, something neither of them could ever do ontheir own. Even in poor soil with few nutrients and insuf ﬁcientnitrogen to support the growth of other plants, these nodulesincrease crop output ( Lodwig and Poole, 2003 ).2.2 Spread and variation of microbesfrom seed to plantsPlants and their microbial diversity vary throughout their lifespan of plants. These factors, prompt the structure and variety of themicrobial community ( Honma and Shimomura, 1978 ). Seed-bornmicrobes gain entry into the germinating plant and take advantage ofother colonizing microbes as well a s opportunistic pathogens fromthe surrounding soil ( Glick et al., 1999 ;Oteino et al., 2015 ). Hence theoverall microbial biota and population changed dramaticallythroughout the life cycle of plants. The important ways of entryinto host plants are through root hair cells, root cracks, and woundswhereas other sources include stom ata particularly of young stemsand leaves; lenticels, and germinating radicles ( Figure 2 ). Vertical seedtransmission is another possible way to receive endophytic bacteriathrough plant host generations ( Bergersen, 1961 ).2.3 Presence of plant microbes indifferent parts of plantsMicroorganisms associated with plants formed a complexnetwork. Different studies sugg ested that plant-associatedmicrobes live inside plant tissues or on the surface of plantparts such as leaves, stems, fruit, and roots ( Clarholm, 1985 ).The microbiome studies of A. thaliana leaves showed that plantgenotype, surrounding plants, and abiotic features affected themicrobial population structure ( Teixeira et al., 2013 ). Theseinteractions are responsible for expediting the defense signalsbetween plants and the ef ﬁcacy of natural biological control agents(Morgan et al., 2005 ). Microbial populations might indirectlyaffect the other taxa of microbes by altering the host growthresponse or metabolites without direct interaction with microbes.3 Bene ﬁcial effects of microbes onplant growth and developmentPlants usually take nutrients from the soil which constitutesa pool for microscopic life forms including bacteria, fungi,actinomycetes, algae, and protozoa. So, among them, thebacteria are the most common ones and have the maximumproportion in soil. The maximum number of bacteria present inthe rhizosphere near the roots of plants is different from bulk soil(Luu et al., 2020 ). As these bacteria are present in moreconcentration in the soil so the bacteria may affect a plantthrough three different pathways ( Edwards and Harding,2004 ). PGPEs can promote plant growth directly by expeditingthe procurement of compounds or modifying levels of planthormones and reducing the inhibitory effect of plant growth andpathogenicity by acting as biocontrol agents ( Yan et al., 2019 ).The bene ﬁts provided by the endophytes to the host plants andtheir mechanisms are described in ( Table 1 ).4 Role of PGPEs against biotic stressThroughout their lives, plants are exposed to harmful abioticand biotic stresses. The damage that bacteria, fungi, viruses,nematodes, viroids, and insects do to plants is referred to as“biotic stress. ”Rhizobacteria that promote plant growth bygenerating phytohormones o r facilitating the uptake ofparticular nutrients might affect plant growth through bioticstress ( Tiwari et al., 2020 ). However, PGPR reduces or evenMushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04eliminate the negative impacts of plant pathogens. For example,Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens produces 2,4-Diacetyl Phloroglucinol,which inhibits the development of pathogenic fungi in plants(Suslow and Schroth, 1982 ). Chitinase and laminarinase, twoextracellular enzymes generated by P. stutzeri , caused the lysis ofFusarium solani mycelia and root rot ( Cano-Salazar et al., 2011 ).During a seven-month ﬁeld trial, the endophytic B. cenocepaciareduced the prevalence of fusarium wilt disease in banana plantsby 3.4%, compared to 24.5% in untreated infected plants ( Sapaket al., 2008 ). The antibiotic Pyrrolnitrin, which helps to reducecotton damping off losses brought on by Rhizoctonia solani , wasdeveloped by several endophytic Pseudomonas ﬂuorescensstrains ( Timper et al., 2009 ).Fusarium oxysporum , which wasused as a bio-agent to create resistance in tomato plants, wassuccessfully protected against P.ﬂuorescens inﬂowering plants(Dudai, 2011 ). A bacteria that inhabit plant roots called Bacillusamyloliquefaciens has the power to control plant diseases andpromote plant growth ( Vardi et al., 2021 ).In a study, it was discovered that bacterial endophytes shieldcucumber plants from the cucumber anthracnose produced byPseudomonas ﬂuorescents (Akköprü et al., 2021 ). It was oncebelieved that Achromobacter sp., Streptomyces sp., and Bacilluslicheniformis were responsible for the foliar disease known asdowny mildew. The downy mildew disease infestation level waslowered by Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Basu et al., 2022 ),which ultimately resulted in an increased yield.The management of pests, which has become a challenge formost crops since pests have evolved a tolerance to pesticides, isanother use for these endophytic bacteria ( Deng et al., 2014 ).Entomopathogenic bacteria have been used to combat pests thatare immune to insecticides ( Figure 3 ). A few fungi from thegenera Podonectria, Verticillium, Hirsutella, Sphaerostilbe,Agerata, Metarhizium Aschersonia , and Myriangium are usedfor the biological management of pests. Brevibacilluslaterosporu s is effective against nematodes, Lepidoptera,Coleoptera, and toxic fungi in plants in addition to insects(Skinner et al., 2014 ).5 Identi ﬁcation of endophyticbacteria interaction with HostIn recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS)techniques have been utilized to study the whole population ofFIGURE 2Overview of the endophytic bacterial mode of entry into different plant tissues.Mushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 05TABLE 1 Examples of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria tested for various crop types.PGPR Plant Bene ﬁts to plant growth ReferencesPseudomonas sp.Green gramIncreased plant dry weight, number of nodules, total chlorophyll content, root/shoot N, P seed protein, and yield.(Del Carmen Orozco-Mosqueda et al, 2020 )SoybeanWheatIncreased soil enzyme activity, nutrient absorption, and yield ( Kalyani et al., 2008 )Chickpea An enhanced fresh and dry weight of plants ( Berendsen et al., 2012 )Rice More ability to control fungal and bacterial pathogens ( Bulgarelli et al., 2012 )Canola Encouraged growth and cadmium accumulation in plants ( Agler et al., 2016 )Mustard Improved growth and reduced Cr contents among plants ( Foster, 1988 )Soybean, mungbean, wheatPromotes growth of plants ( Bertin et al., 2003 )Pseudomonas putidaMung beanThe ethylene production repressed in treated plantIncrease the growth and decreases Pb and Cd uptake(Glick, 2012 )(Ahemad and Khan, 2012 )Lectuca Enhancement of shoot/root length attained through concentrated inoculants ( Sharma et al., 2011 )ArtichokePSB along with N ﬁxers increase in shoot length/weight, germination percentageseedling vigor, and reduction in germination time(Tank and Saraf, 2010 )Pseudomonas aeruginosaMaizeEndorsed plant growth and helped soil metal utilization, increase Pb and Cruptake(Lawongsa et al., 2008 )Black gramReduced Cd deposition in tissues, widespread rooting, and increased plantgrowth(Wu et al., 2015 )Indian mustardand pumpkinIncreased in plant growth, decrease in Cd uptake ( Rajkumar et al., 2006 )Tomato, Okra,African spinachIncrease in Dry weight of tomato, okra, and spinach ( Gupta et al., 2002 )Pseudomonas ﬂuorescensAlfalfa Enhanced Fe and Cu movement from root/shoot ( Mayak et al., 1999 )Peanut Increase in pod yield and nodule dry weight ( Lobo et al., 2019 )Soybean Increased plant growth ( Rekha et al., 2007 )Canola Protect plants against the inhibitory effects of Cd ( Jahanian et al., 2012 )MaizeIncrease of plant growth, height, seed weight, no. of seed/ear, leaf area, shoot dryweight(Cura ́et al., 2017 )Azospirillum amazonense RiceGrain dry matter deposition, panicle count, and nitrogen buildup at the grainmaturity stage all increase(Sant'anna et al, 2011 )Azospirillum brasilense Common bean Increase of Root growth in plants ( Adesemoye et al, 2008 )Azospirillum lipoferum CottonAn increase in soil microorganisms, plant height, and seed production wasobserved, but no changes in boll weight or staple length.(Fayez and Daw, 1987 )Azotobacter chroococcum Chinese mustard Increased plant development and metal toxicity protection for the plant ( Jha, 2017 )Azospirillum brasilense Rice Increased grain yield ( Gupta et al., 2005 )Kluyvera ascorbateMustard, TomatoCanola,Heavy metals reduce plant growth but do not boost metal uptake.

The interaction of host and bacterial endophytes hasinsightful concerns for the biological functioning of plants. As aresult of interactions, rapid changes in host phenotype occursalso it is assumed as a driving force for the speciation and co-evolution of both the genetic system of host and bacteria(Fawcett, 1944 ). Though old genetic techniques to study plant-microbe interaction are less ef ﬁcient, time-consuming, costly,and labor-intensive required a wide range of experiments andare usually limited to certain known genes ( De Oliveira et al.,2004 ) in comparison to investigating the host-microbeinteractions in molecular levels, it is needed to understand thephenotypic phenomena and genomics in depth. So thedevelopment of NGS technologies or metagenomic studies hasprovided the best way to understand the host-pathogen system.Through this technology, we can construct genome models ofdifferent organisms, which includes strains, their naturalpopulations over time and their evolutionary histories ( Navaset al., 2017 ;Sharma et al., 2021 ).These complicated interactions can be analyzed andintegrated by viewing plant microbiomes as a system. Tobetter understand endophytism, contemporary genomicinvestigations incorporatin g metaomics and comparativestudies can be quite bene ﬁcial ( Dubey et al., 2020 ). A betterunderstanding of endophyte in teractions could be used toimprove agricultural management by increasing plantdevelopment, biocontrol , and bioremediation ( Alaimoet al., 2018 ). Some of the tools being utilized or that could beused to understand the link between plants and endophytesinclude genome sequencing, comparative genomics,microarray, next-generation sequencing, metagenomics,and metatranscriptomics ( D i x i te ta l . ,2 0 2 2 ). To studyendophytes and their apparent function in host plantecology, contemporary methods and approaches need to beinvestigated ( Gaiero et al., 2013 ).Another way to identify the end ophytic bacteria interactwith the plant is to isolate the endophytic bacteria culture andthen classify based on its phenotypic traits, and a few isolatesfrom each category are identi ﬁed further through partialsequencing of the 16S rRNA gene ( Khare et al., 2018 ). Theresults of partial sequencing show that the isolates belongedto the genera Pseudomonas ,Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus,Pantoea ,a n d Serratia of bacteria ( Liu et al, 2017>2552 ).These isolates are tested for their ability to producesiderophores, phosphate so lubilization, atmosphericnitrogen ﬁxation, protease, and hydrogen cyanide, as well asphytohormones like auxin and gibberellin ( Eid et al., 2019 ).Auxin and gibberellin, two plant growth hormones, can beproduced by all strains, though t o varying degrees. Almost allstrains could solubilize phosphate ( Lata et al., 2019 ). Theoutcomes of protease, siderophore, and atmosphericnitrogen- ﬁxing ability vary between strains. These ﬁndingsprovide information on the relationship between endophyticbacteria and their host plant ( Vandana et al., 2021 ).Furthermost genomic method s require recognition ofvariations among sequences within species or populations, likepoint mutations, Addition/deletions, and structural variations instructures ( Bulgarelli et al., 2013 ).TABLE 1 ContinuedPGPR Plant Bene ﬁts to plant growth ReferencesGreen gramIncrease of nodule number, seed yield, grain protein, root/shoot N at 290 mg Ni/kg soil(Burd et al., 2000 )Brevundimonas Canola Isolated cadmium directly from the solution ( Gholami et al., 2009 )Enterobacter cloacae Canola Signi ﬁcant increases in root and shoot length were observed.(Bashan and Gonza ́lez,1999 )Klebsiella oxytocaMaize Increase of plant growth parameters ( Remans et al., 2008 )Enterobacter sakazakiiBrevibacillus White clover Increased plant growth and nutrition and decreased zinc conc.

( Robinson et al., 2001 )Mushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 075.1 Evolution of new pathogenicstrains of microbesOne of the great evolutionary changes in life is thedevelopment of advantageous symbioses between eukaryotic(plants) and prokaryotic creatures ( Chebotar et al., 2015 ).According to certain theories, the relationship betweenendophytic bacteria and plants frequently depends on twofundamental elements: currency and a system for exchangingcurrency. The currency could be, for instance, a root exudatethat bacteria can take up in the context of interactions betweenplants and endophytic bacteria ( Mercado-Blanco and JJLugtenberg, 2014 ). Similarly, bacteria may release hormonesthat encourage plant growth, such as auxin and gibberellins,which may be favorable for plant growth ( Maksimov et al.,2018 ). It is anticipated that selection will favor the evolution ofmutualism when the exchange of currencies between the twoparties is balanced. Therefore, it is hypothesized that increasedmutualistic dependency devel ops through reciprocal co-evolution or adaptation by one of the partners through theselection of features directly related to the mutualistic interaction(Chen et al., 2021 ).Competition for scarce shared resources like iron may alsolead to asymmetrical currency exchange, which could help toexplain why some plant-microbe interactions are hostile ( Hongand Park, 2016 ). Furthermore, because the rhizosphere is open,the free diffusion of resources derived from plants may promotehigher levels of cheating in which mutant bacterial genotypestake bene ﬁto f “public goods ”without producing substances thataid plant growth ( Pandey et al., 2017 ). Because of this,mutualistic plant-microbe interactions may need additionalenforcement from the plant, such as penalizing dishonestbacterial genotypes or positively identifying genotypes thatpromote plant growth ( Ryan et al., 2008 ).Intriguing researchwould also be done to see whether endophytic bacteria andplants may coevolve from ﬁrst neutral interaction and whetherplants can coevolve in response to rhizosphere bacteria ( Santoset al., 2018 ). In conclusion, by showing that plant-associatedbacteria can quickly evolve along the symbiotic connectionwithin a few growth cycles, our results urge eco-evolutionarymanagement of endophytic bacteria and plants interactions inagriculture ( Aswani et al., 2020 ).5.2 Endophytic bacteria indisease managementCrop productivity is impacted by a number of commonplant diseases that are present worldwide. Some of the seriousones are wilt disease, root rot, powdery mildew, leaf spot, leafcurl, and blight. To counter these phytopathogens, endophyticbacteria are crucial ( Latha et al., 2019 ).FIGURE 3Mechanism of plant growth promotion by rhizobacteria (PGPR).Mushtaq et al. 10.3389/fpls.2022.1092105Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 08By producing proteins associated with pathogenesis (PRPs)and defense enzymes that stop the growth of phytopathogensthat cause disease, endophytic bacteria can producesiderophores, antimicrobial compounds, and systemicresistance ( Pandey et al., 2019 ). Bacterial endophytes are alsopotentially useful biocontrol agents. Plant diseases degrade plantperformance and crop quality, which reduces crop output(Muthukumar et al., 2017 ). It has been shown that thenitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria Azotobacter chrococcum ,t h ephosphate-solubilizing bacteria PSB ( Pseudomonas cepacia ),the endophytic bacterial strains Lysinibacillus sp. and Bacillussubtilis , and their combination as bio-fertilizers can reduce theincidence of bacterial wilt disease in chili plants by up to 80%(Tewari et al., 2019 ).The endophytic bacterial strain B. subtilis showed thestrongest (80%) illness suppression ( Jacob et al., 2020 ). Thisendophyte could also considerably aid the growth of the chili.Chemical pesticides are typically used to manage suchphytopathogens, but this tactic has raised concerns aboutenvironmental contaminati on and contributed to theemergence of resistance to speci ﬁc chemicals over time(Prasad et al., 2020 ). New insecticides must always bedeveloped to address this. Chemical pesticides are thought tobe ineffective when compared to endophytic bacteria acting asbiocontrol agents or bioins ecticides. A broad array ofmechanisms, including direct antagonism viathe generation ofantibiotics, siderophores, hydrogen cyanide, hydrolytic enzymes(chitinases, proteases, and lipases), etc., are involved in thebiocontrol of plant diseases ( Puri et al., 2017 ).6 ConclusionSome of the bacterial endophytes or PGPR are commonlyused to control different diseases and as biological control agentsso nowadays most of the focus is the understanding of complexinteractions and their mechanisms and outcome either bene ﬁcialor harmful. It is hard to ﬁnd the exact mechanism of interactionamong complex microbial populations residing in the soil andenvironment near to host. So that proper characterization andmanagement strategies can be devised according to the currentneed of time. In recent time peoples are preferring organic foodand disliked the use of fertilizers and chemicals in agriculture. Asthe world population is increasing and food shortage issues areraised, in the current situation food security is an importanttopic for debate. Hence bacterial endophytes can be used as analternative to chemical fertilizers, nutrient sources, andbiological control agents for various plant pathogens. Scientistsare focusing on the use of these endophytes in the form ofbiopesticides, and biofertilizers with different trade names forthe control of different diseases and sustainable agriculturalsystems. Although the applica tion of these endophytes incombination may lead to the development of optimum PGPEsinoculants that robust, and slight variation of environmentalfactors will not affect the plant growth promotion.Author contributionsSM, MN, MH, MS, and MA conceived and conceptualizedthe study.
