Abstract .T h ea i mo ft h e project was analytical evaluationof carbon content and soil carbon sequestration in Miscanthus andcoppice willow crops biomass. In this paper, we present the resultsfrom a field experiment carried out in 2004-2006 at two ExperimentalStations of the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, Pu³awy,and net C sequestration under this cultivation. The C-sequestrationmodel adapted by Matthews and Grogan (2001) was used for thesimulations. The abovementioned crops are cultivated for the pro-duction of solid fuels. The three-year average yield for Miscanthuswas between 15 and 17 t ha-1y-1, dependent on location, whereas forwillow it was 12 and 13 t ha-1y-1. The net soil carbon sequestration forMiscanthus cultivation was 0.6 4tCh a-1y-1while for coppicewillow it was 0.3 0tCh a-1y-1.Keywords : carbon sequestration, Miscanthus, coppicewillow, greenhouse gas emissionsINTRODUCTIONAgriculture, besides contributing to greenhouse gasemissions, also contributes to carbon dioxide absorption andsoil sequestration of carbon into a solid organic form (Faber,2001; Freibauer et al., 2004; Smith, 2004). It is estimatedthat global potential scale of carbon sequestration in soilsused for agricultural purposes is around 0. 3tCh a-1y-1onarable lands and around 0.5-0. 7tCh a-1y-1on grasslands(IPCC, 2000). Hopes for increased soil carbon sequestrationare associated with increase in large-scale energetic cropscultivation. However, different authors found that thecarbon sequestration rates for these cultivars are different.Bradley and King (2004) determined carbon sequestrationin forests and willow cultivations at 0.15-0.22 t C ha-1y-1,whereas in Miscanthus cultivation at 0.13-0.20 t C ha-1y-1.According to Matthews and Grogan (2001), carbon se-questration in the surface layer of soil (0-23 cm) was at 0.31for forests, and 0.41 for the cultivation of willow, whereasforMiscanthus it was measured at 0.9 3tCh a-1y-1. Freibaueret al. (2004) and Smith (2004) determined carbon seque-stration in cultivations of energy crops at 0.6 and 0.62 t Cha-1y-1, respectively. The carbon sequestration showed bySmith (2004) was higher than in no-tillage cultivation (0.38 tCh a-1y-1) or organic farming (0-0.5 4tCh a-1y-1), but atmuch lower levels than by converting arable land intograsslands (1.2-1.69 t C ha-1y-1). The cultivation of energycrops is associated with greenhouse gas emission (burningfuel, production of fertilizers, crop protection). The assump-tion is that carbon sequestration of around 0.2 5tCh a-1y-1,resulting from energetic crops cultivation, makes biomasscombustion neutral in terms of greenhouse gas emissions(Volk et al., 2004).MATERIALS AND METHODSThe plant material used for this research came from fieldexperiments conducted in 2004-2006 with several genoty-pes of Miscanthus and coppice willow clones. The above-mentioned crops are cultivated for the production of solidfuels. The field experiment was established in 2003 at twoExperimental Stations of the Institute of Soil Science andPlant Cultivation, Pu³awy. The experimental fields are loca-ted in the Experimental Station Pu³awy-Osiny on heavyblack earth (complex 8 – cereal-fodder strong), and at theExperimental Station in Grabów on medium-heavy soil(comple x 4 – very good rye), where five genotypes of Miscan-thusand four clones of willow were planted. The sizes of theindividual experimental plots ranged from 200 to 700 m2.Int. Agrophysics, 2008, 22, 185-190Evaluation of carbon sequestration in energetic crops ( Miscanthus and coppice willow)**M.

Water available for crops comes from autumn-winter retention and from rainfalls. The rainfalls in the re-searched time were lower than the long-term averagerainfalls (Table 1).Basic information concerning the agrotechnique ofexperimental plots is shown in Table 2. In late autumn, theharvest was carried out and the yield of dry matter wasdetermined.Based on the experimental yield of aboveground bio-mass the total yield of plant and underground biomass wereestimated, accepting that the roots of Miscanthus constitute35% of the whole mass, whereas the roots of coppice willowconstitute 25% of the produced dry matter (Matthews andGrogan, 2001). In addition, soil carbon sequestration wasevaluated by using the Matthews and Grogan model.The annual amount of C input into the fresh C pool fromMiscanthus was accepted at the level of 30% (Matthews andGrogan, 2001), because of the senescent leaves and postharvest remnants entering the soil during wintertime. In thecase of willow leaves, the mass that enters the soil waspredicted from the equation showed by Matthews andGrogan (2001):WCi n=( Lf c)/SLA 105+W AGfW (1)where: W Ci n– annual amount of C input into the fresh Cpool (kg C ha-1y-1), L – LAI (leaf area index) (m2m-2), fc–fraction of C in biomass = 0. 4gCg d.m.-1, SLA – specificleaf area = 250 cm2g-1,W AG– weight of C abovegroundbiomass = (0.75 dW/dt) (kg C ha-1y-1), fW– fractionaboveground C input = 0.0004.The LAI measurements for willow were taken fourtimes with a Lai Canopy Analyzer-2000, from June untilAugust at five replications.The total contribution of C input into the fresh C poolfrom the root system of willow and Miscanthus (WRin ,k gCha-1) was calculated as:WRi= dW/dt f RfFRTO +W BGfW (2)where: f R– fraction of C input from roots to soil = 0.25,fFRTO – fraction C input from fine roots to soil = 0.85, W BG–weight of C belowground in the root system = (f RdW/dt) (kgCh a-1y-1).The total inflow of organic substance to the soil is theamount of leaves and dead underground biomass (WCi n+WRi). It was adopted, according to the Matthews andGrogan model, that 18% of carbon is processed into solidhumus. The quantity of carbon in solid humus calculated inthis way was reduced by the amount of carbon that wasemitted during the cultivation of the examined crops(RcoEP, 2003).186 M.

Technique of energy crops productionRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe yields of willow clones dry matter did not demon-strate any significant differences and was in the range of11.6-13.7 t ha-1at a three year average for the first location(Table 3), and 11.1-12.9 t ha-1at the second location. Theywere lower from simulated yields for willow cultivations(13.8-18.1 t ha-1) located on very good soils of EasternEurope (Fischer et al., 2005). It can be assumed that thelimited water influenced the experimental yield of willow.The average yearly yield of all clones was falling as thecrops were getting older.The dry matter yield of Miscanthus genotypes wassignificantly different within average of 10.2-20.7 t ha-1(Table 4) at both locations. The yield for the first year of theexperiment was low; this could be because it was the secondyear of cultivation when the plant was still not matureenough to obtain an economic yield (Clifton-Brown andLewandowski, 2000). In the second year of the experiment,the yield witnessed a high increase. The third year of theexperiment was characterized with very bad weather condi-tions, including a late spring ground-frost and long summerdraught. The yields were approaching the presupposed si-mulated yields for Miscanthus cultivations (17.7-21.8 t ha-1)located on the very good soils of Eastern Europe (Fischer etal.,2005). It can be assumed with a high probability thatlimited water in 2005 did not influence the experimentalMiscanthus yield, but there was an influence from weatherconditions in 2006. The average three-year moisture contentwas, at the harvest in autumn, between 33.5 and 52.2%. Themoisture content for biomass should be under 25%, that iswhy it is advisable to harvest in late winter or early spring(Jorgensen et al., 2003).The model applied in the research allows the evaluationof the input of biomass into soil, gross soil carbon seque-stration, net soil humus sequestration, and greenhouse gasemissions resulting from willow and Miscanthus cultiva-tions. According to the simulation for the ExperimentalStation Pu³awy-Osiny, the total input of biomass enteringthe soil from willow biomass was 1.75 to 3.03 t C ha-1y-1(Table 5). This value was lower compared to 5.2 t d.m.ha-1y-1obtained for the UK (Matthews and Grogan, 2001).The gross soil carbon sequestration was 0.32 up to 0.55 t Cha-1y-1(Table 5), and it was within the evaluation range forthe UK (Matthews and Grogan, 2001). After deducting theemissions from the greenhouse gas, resulting from willowcultivation, it was established that net soil carbon seque-stration was around 0.22-0.39 t C ha-1y-1. As a result, the netsoil carbon sequestration was just a little higher than onarable lands (0. 3tCh a-1y-1) (IPCC, 2000). However, evenwith such a level of sequestration, willow coppice combustionmay be considered as neutral greenhouse gas emission.The aboveground biomass has a high influence on theamount of carbon sequestration which enters the soilusually in the form of senescent leaves and postharvestremnants.

Matt-hews and Grogan (2001), in Great Britain, estimated the in-flow of organic matter at a level of 7.5 t d.m. ha-1y-1. Corres-pondingly, in this research, the input of biomass entering thesoil was evaluated as from 2.63 to 6.58 t d.m. ha-1y-1.The sequestration model calculated the gross soilcarbon sequestration at 0.47- 1.18 t d.m. ha-1y-1(Table 6)forMiscanthus cultivations in the Experimental StationPu³awy-Osiny. An assumption according to literature on thesubject was made that 18% of that carbon is processed intosolid humus. After deducting the greenhouse gas emissions,resulting from the Miscanthus cultivations, it was calculatedthat the net soil carbon sequestration was around 0.38-0.95 tCh a-1y-1. Such a high result was obtained due to the fact thatduring the winter Miscanthus crops lose 30% of theirbiomass, which is absorbed into the soil. Matthews andGrogan (2001) estimated the sequestration level at 0.93 t Cha-1y-1. Bradley and King (2004) estimated the carbonsequestrations at a level of 0.13 to 0.20 t C ha-1y-1; whereasClifton-Brown et al. (2004) in Great Britain obtainedsequestrations at levels up to 0.9 3tCh a-1y-1.The agriculture net retention at the scale of Poland was0.07 t C ha-1y-1, and the greatest net retainer assures theusage of farm manure and cover crops (0.1 4tCh a-1y-1) andgrassland (0.1 0tCh a-1y-1) (Faber, 2001).The obtained results distinguish a conflict between theprofitability of energy crops production. The cultivation ofcrops demands substantial input in the form of additionalfactors, including farming practices, logistics, and manage-ment. These alternative crops take several years to establisha plantation, though it requires very little work once it hasbeen successfully established. The profitability of thisinvestment depends on the achievable yield and biomassprices. The main aim of the energy plantation cannot only beecological issues, but also it needs to be economicallyviable.CONCLUSIONSThe results obtained from the presented research allowthe formulation of the following conclusions:1. The net soil carbon sequestration in Miscanthus cropswas around 0.38-0.95 t C ha-1y-1and 0.22-0.39 t C ha-1y-1for coppice willow.2. The obtained sequestration results confirm theneutrality of biomass combustion in terms of greenhouse gasemissions.3. An increase of soil carbon sequestration in energycrops leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the economicplantation.EVALUATION OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN ENERGETIC CROPS 189Year GenotypeTotal input ofbiomass into soilGross soil carbonsequstrationGreenhouse gasemissions (GHG)Net soil carbonsequestration( tCh a-1y-1)2004Giganteus 2.77 0.50 0.10 0.40M 7 3.27 0.59 0.12 0.47M 40 3.19 0.57 0.11 0.46M 105 2.84 0.51 0.10 0.41M 115 2.63 0.47 0.09 0.382005Giganteus 6.58 1.18 0.24 0.95M 7 6.27 1.13 0.23 0.90M 40 5.70 1.03 0.21 0.82M 105 4.88 0.88 0.18 0.70M 115 5.64 1.01 0.20 0.812006Giganteus 5.39 0.97 0.20 0.77M 7 5.23 0.94 0.19 0.75M 40 4.58 0.83 0.16 0.66M 105 4.37 0.79 0.16 0.63M 115 4.22 0.76 0.15 0.61Table 6 .
