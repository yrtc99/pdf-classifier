Here, we synthesized currently available soil carbondata to show that mean organic carbon density in the topsoil (0–10 cm) in TP grassland (3.12 ± 0.52 kgCm/C02) is less than half of that in Arctic tundra (6.70 ± 1.94 kg C m/C02). Such difference is primarily attrib-uted to their difference in radiocarbon-inferred soil carbon turnover times (547 years for TP grasslandversus 1609 years for Arctic tundra) rather than to their marginal difference in topsoil carbon inputs.Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of improving regional-speciﬁc soil carbon turnover and its control-ling mechanisms across permafrost affected zones in ecosystem models to fully represent carbon-climatefeedback./C2112021 Science China Press.

IntroductionThe thawing of carbon-rich permafrost could cause a positivefeedback to climate change due to enhanced carbon decompositionrate with global warming [1,2] . The importance of permafrost toclimate change is determined in part by the size of the soil carbonpool, with a higher soil carbon content generally generating a lar-ger impact. Due to rapid climate warming and its ampliﬁcation inpermafrost areas, ~5%–15% of the permafrost carbon is vulnerableto thawing, and subsequently likely to return to the atmosphere bythe end of this century [3].The world’s ‘‘Third Pole”, Tibetan Plateau (TP), is the largestpermafrost affected zones aside from the Arctic regions. However,according to all available evidence, the soil organic carbondensities exhibit large difference between the two regions [4,5] .Currently, there is still a lack of understanding in the formationof different soil carbon densities within the surface active layerof soil which acts as an essential interface between the vegetationand the underlying permafrost. It is well established that net soilcarbon accumulation is a long-term balance between carbon gainsthrough litter production and carbon losses through organic car-bon decomposition [6,7] . There is also clear evidence to show thatTP grassland differs from Arctic tundra in terms of temperature,solar insolation, topography and the degree of vegetation coverage[8]. Such differences could lead to different environmental con-straints on the processes which affect the variations of regional soilcarbon density. Thus, a critical question is how the processes con-trol soil carbon difference between TP grassland and Arctic tundra.Resolving this issue could provide new model formulations fordescribing soil carbon accumulation processes in different per-mafrost affected zones, which should, in turn, help to improveour current understanding of the carbon-climate feedback.In this study, we ﬁrst assessed the difference of topsoil organiccarbon density (0–10 cm) between TP grassland and Arctic tundrawith multi-source datasets. To understand how the difference oftopsoil organic carbon density between the two regions wasformed, we then investigated the main drivers of soil organic car-bon in terms of carbon inputs and carbon turnover times [7,9] .Furthermore, we explored the possible mechanisms of the differ-ence in soil carbon turnover times between the two regions.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2021.04.0192095-9273/ /C2112021 Science China Press.

Materials and methods2.1. Study regionsWe used the grassland type in the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classiﬁcation provided by the landcover product (MCD12C1) from Moderate Resolution ImagingSpectroradiometer (MODIS) [10] to deﬁne the grassland areas onthe TP ( Fig. S1 a online). Arctic tundra was deﬁned as a combinationof grassland and open shrubland north of 55 /C176N[11], but excludedpeatlands (histel and histosol landcover classes with > 15% cover-age) [5]which have different soil carbon dynamics ( Fig. S1 bonline).2.2. Soil organic carbon density (SOCD)The topsoil organic carbon density (0–10 cm) in TP grasslandand Arctic tundra was estimated from three observation-baseddata sources ( Figs. S2 and S3 online). The ﬁrst soil carbon datasetis the latest SoilGrids database [12]. The SOCD was reported forsix intervals (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm).For the SoilGrids dataset that provides SOCD for different soil lay-ers, we simply calculated the topsoil (0–10 cm) organic carbondensity asSOCD 0/C010 cm¼SOCD 0/C05c mþ0:5SOCD 5/C015 cm : ð1ÞSecond, we used the World Inventory of Soil Property Estimates(WISE) dataset [13] which is an up-to-date global soil carbon data-set based on approximately 21,000 soil proﬁles and geographicaldata. The third dataset is the soil carbon map combining the Har-monized World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Northern Circumpo-lar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) [5,14] . Because both datasetsprovide SOCD with 1 m depth, we ﬁtted a relationship betweencumulative proportion of SOCD (equal to 0.0 at 0 cm depth, and1.0 at 100 cm depth) and soil depth to derive the topsoil organiccarbon density:y¼alnbxþ1 ðÞ ; ð2Þwhere xis the soil depth (cm), yis the cumulative proportion ofSOCD, and aand bare ﬁtted parameters. The data used for ﬁttingthe parameters are multi-site average cumulative proportion ofSOCD for different soil layers in TP grassland and Arctic tundra,respectively [15–17] . The ﬁtted functions are: y= 0.397ln(0.122 x+1 )( R2= 0.99, N= 7) for TP grassland; and y= 0.494ln(0.073 x+1 )( R2= 0.98, N= 6) for Arctic tundra ( Fig. S4 online).The calculated proportions of accumulated SOCD for 0–10 cmagainst 0–100 cm soil layers are estimated to be 0.316 for TP grass-land and 0.271 for Arctic tundra.2.3. Primary productivityWe used two gross primary productivity (GPP) datasets thatwere both extrapolated from site-level eddy ﬂux measurementsby a machine learning algorithm (model tree ensemble, MTE).The ﬁrst GPP dataset is from Jung et al. [18] which upscalededdy-covariance observations of CO 2ﬂuxes to the global scaleusing MTE. This dataset spans the period from 1982 to 2011 witha spatial resolution of 0.5 /C176/C20.5/C176. The second dataset is derivedfrom Yao et al. [19], and has improved estimates of GPP over Chinawith eddy ﬂux measurements from 40 sites, especially for the data-limited TP grassland. Here, we used GPP data from Jung et al. [18]for Arctic tundra and the GPP data from Yao et al. [19] for TP grass-land, which show high quality for representing the gross photosyn-thesis of the two regions ( Fig. S5 online).We used net primary productivity (NPP) as a proxy for potentialsoil carbon inputs, given that total litter production should beapproximately equal to NPP over herbaceous ecosystems underthe steady state assumption. To estimate the NPP, we multipliedMTE-derived GPP by a spatial explicit estimate of the carbon useefﬁciency at a spatial resolution of 1 /C176. The spatially variable carbonuse efﬁciency is produced by combing a diagnostic ecosystem car-bon balance model (DALEC2) with satellite observations and soilcarbon dataset [20] (Fig. S6 online). NPP was further separated intoaboveground NPP (ANPP) and belowground NPP (BNPP), whichconsisted of BNPP in the top 10 cm of soil and BNPP deeper than10 cm depth. First, we estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) fromnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) usingAGB = a/C2NDVIb[21]. In TP grassland, the relationship betweenNDVI and AGB is AGB (g C m/C02) = 65.987 /C2NDVI0.8841(R2= 0.61,N= 115) [22] (Fig. S7 online). In the Arctic tundra, we used the rela-tionship: AGB (g C m/C02) = 393.73 /C2NDVI1.3256(R2= 0.92, N= 11)[23] (Fig. S8 a online). The NDVI data for each ﬁeld observation ofAGB was extracted from a maximum annual NDVI dataset usingGIMMS NDVI at a spatial resolution of 1/12 /C176for the year duringwhich the biomass was collected [24]. Here, the AGB maps werecreated using multi-year mean annual maximum NDVI for the per-iod 1982–2011. We next estimated regional ANPP from AGB. In TPgrassland, ANPP is taken to be equal to AGB by assuming that thelongevity of the aboveground parts of the grassland is one year[21]. For Arctic tundra, we estimated ANPP from AGB based onthe equation ANPP (g C m/C02a/C01) = 0.0983 /C2AGB1.1425(R2= 0.85,N= 87) [25] (Fig. S8 b online). The BNPP was obtained by subtract-ing ANPP from NPP. Here, we calculated BNPP in the layers aboveand below a depth of 10 cm by using the vertical distributions ofroots. This distribution was characterized as Y=1/C0bd, where Yis cumulative percentage of root biomass from the soil surface tothe depth d(cm), and bis the ﬁtted parameter derived from ﬁeldobservations [26]. In the TP grassland, bis 0.937 for alpine steppeand 0.900 for alpine meadow [26], and bis 0.914 for Arctic tundra[27]. In this study, the sum of ANPP and BNPP in the 0–10 cm layeris used as a proxy for potential topsoil carbon inputs via litter fallto the surface layer ( Figs. S9 and S10 online).2.4. Environmental dataMean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation(MAP) and mean annual solar radiation (MAR) are taken from theWorldClim Version 2.0 dataset, which is averaged for the years1970–2000 at a spatial resolution of ~1k m( Figs. S11–S13 online)[28]. Altitude data (elevation above sea level, m) is from the World-Clim Version 1.4 dataset ( Fig. S11 online). The ultraviolet-B (UV-B)radiation dataset, which has a spatial resolution of 15 arc-minutesand covers the period 2004–2013, was used ( Fig. S13 online) [29].The SoilGrids database provides global soil texture at speciﬁc soildepths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) [12], and we thereforeuse the texture at the depth of 5 cm (middle of 0–10 cm layer)to represent the topsoil texture [12] (Fig. S14 online).2.5. Soil carbon turnover timeThe technique, based on the radioactive decay of14C originatingfrom atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons [30], provides infor-mation on the turnover times of C atoms in the soil reservoir. Here,we used 21 soil proﬁles with radiocarbon measurements (14C)from the TP grassland ( Fig. S1 online). 17 of the 21 proﬁles weresampled in 2012 and 2010, and fraction modern ( F)o f14C for top-soil (0–10 cm) was measured at the accelerator mass spectrometrylaboratory of Beta Analytic. The remaining 4 proﬁles were sampledin 2003 at Haibei Station, in the northeast TP, and were collatedfrom Tao et al. [31]. For Arctic tundra, we assembled 10 soil proﬁlesthat had14C measurements for the 0–10 cm layer from He et al.[32]. These proﬁles were sampled during 1986 and 2011. In addi-D. Wu et al. Science Bulletin 66 (2021) 1698–17041699tion, to compare the carbon turnover times from the two coldecosystems with those from other ecosystems, we compiled a glo-bal14C dataset, using 106 topsoil14C measurements from differentecosystems at the global scale [32,33] . These14C observations werethen converted into soil carbon turnover times for all sites, usingbox model forced with14C measurements and past atmospheric14C records under the assumption that the topsoil layer is a homo-geneous reservoir [34]. In a general form, this numerical approxi-mation is given byðF0CÞtþ1¼ðF0CÞtþ@ðF0CÞt; ð3Þwhere F0, the absolute fraction modern, refers to the absolute ratioof sample to standard, corrected for radioactive decay in the year ofmeasurement. ðF0CÞtrepresents the14C content at time tandðF0CÞtþ1represents the14C content at time t+1 . @ðF0CÞtrepresentsthe differential of14C content.

The carbon turnover time ofthe measured soil sample is given by 1/ k.3. Results and discussion3.1. Topsoil carbon densityGiven the large uncertainties in gridded SOC databases, we usedthe three different sources of datasets to estimate SOCD in the top10 cm for TP grassland and Arctic tundra ( Figs. 1 , S2, and S3online). The SOCD varies between 2.52 kg C m/C02from HWSD and3.43 kg C m/C02from SoilGrids. The SOCD discrepancy among data-sets is larger in Arctic tundra, with SOCD varying between 5.18 kgCm/C02from WISE and 8.88 kg C m/C02from SoilGrids. On grid scale,the SOCD generally increases from western to eastern TP. In Arctictundra, SOCD in Eurasia is larger than that in Northern America(Fig. S2 online). In spite of uncertainties in the gridded SOC dataset,the SOCD in the top 10 cm layer over TP grassland (3.12 ± 0.52 kg Cm/C02) is less than half of that in Arctic tundra (6.70 ± 1.94 kg C m/C02),and this result is found in all the three datasets.3.2. Topsoil carbon inputsThe annual MTE-based NPP (multi-year mean for the period1982–2011) is 149 g C m/C02a/C01over TP grassland and 164 g Cm/C02a/C01over Arctic tundra ( Figs. 1 , S9, and S10 online). The mag-nitude is also comparable to DALEC2 NPP (127 g C m/C02a/C01forTP grassland and 158 g C m/C02a/C01for Arctic tundra, Figs. S15 andS16online). At the spatial scale, higher NPP is observed in easternthan in western regions of TP grassland, and that in Eurasia than inNorthern America of Arctic tundra. After separating MTE-basedNPP into ANPP and BNPP for two soil layers (0–10 cmand > 10 cm; see Materials and methods), the sum of ANPP andBNPP in the 0–10 cm layer was then used as a proxy for potentialtopsoil carbon inputs via litter fall to the surface layer. Our resultsshow that sum of ANPP and BNPP in the 0–10 cm layer is similarbetween TP grassland (100 g C m/C02a/C01) and Arctic tundra (116 gCm/C02a/C01)(Figs. 1 , S9, and S10 online). In addition, we also sepa-rated the DALEC2 NPP using similar decomposition methods(Figs. S15 and S16 online), suggesting that the magnitude of poten-tial carbon input (sum of ANPP and BNPP in the 0–10 cm layer) isalso comparable between TP grassland (87 g C m/C02a/C01) and Arctictundra (112 g C m/C02a/C01). Therefore, the results imply that soil car-bon inputs alone could not explain the more than twofold differ-ence in SOCD between the two regions ( Fig. 1 ).Here we used the sum of ANPP and BNPP in the 0–10 cm layeras a proxy for litter fall to represent the topsoil carbon inputs. Nev-ertheless, it should be noted that litter fall only represents a poten-tial carbon source to soil carbon pool rather than the actual carboninﬂux, since a part of the litter fall is respired back to the atmo-sphere during litter fragmentation [37]. Recent review suggestedthat the carbon use efﬁciency from plant litter to SOC is about6.6% for aboveground inputs and 39% for belowground inputs inagricultural ﬁeld [37]. However, estimation of the actual soil car-bon inﬂux still needs more ﬁeld or laboratory experiments of iso-topically labelled little decomposition in the permafrost regionsin future work [38].3.3. Topsoil carbon turnover timeWe then quantiﬁed soil carbon turnover time with a box modelusing radiocarbon (14C) measurements in topsoil (see Materialsand methods). The results showed that the turnover times in theTP grassland and Arctic tundra (4031176113years, N= 31, for 90 percentconﬁdence interval) are signiﬁcantly higher than other ecosystemsin the world (12083550years, N= 106) ( Figs. S17 and S18 online), sug-gesting much slower SOC decomposition rates in these coldecosystems. Furthermore, the mean topsoil soil carbon turnovertimes across TP grassland and Arctic tundra sites are 338893112years(N= 21, where the subscripts and superscripts represent 90% con-ﬁdence intervals) and 6111696149years ( N= 10), respectively. Usingregression analysis, we found that the turnover time covaried sig-niﬁcantly ( R2= 0.44) with mean annual temperature (MAT) but rel-atively weaker relationship ( R2= 0.23) with mean annualprecipitation (MAP) in Arctic tundra. By contrast, there is a signif-icant spatial correlation between the turnover time and MAP(R2= 0.23) in TP grassland ( Fig. 2 ). Although the relationshipbetween turnover time and MAT is relatively weaker in TP grass-land ( R2= 0.13), the turnover time showed robust relationship withaltitude ( R2= 0.49) ( Fig. S19 online). Negative correlations betweenturnover time and temperature in both regions are linked to anexpected increase in microbial decomposition with temperature[39]. We observed that higher precipitation is strongly associatedwith a shorter turnover time in TP grassland, indicating that mois-ture effects also determined the decomposition process.To estimate the turnover time at the regional level, we upscaledthe soil carbon turnover time from sites to regions based on envi-ronmental controls of turnover time across sites. To do this, webuilt a predictive model of turnover time by linking the logarithmof the turnover time with environmental factors using multiple lin-ear regression. Optimum relationships were detected for the TPgrassland and Arctic tundra as follows, TP: ln(SOC-turnovertime) = 0.0006altitude /C00.0020MAP + 4.0813; Arctic: ln(SOC-turnover time) = /C00.1961MAT + 0.0026MAP + 4.3257. The result-ing model had a relatively high predictive power, with 57.4% of thetotal spatial variance of the turnover time explained by MAP andaltitude in TP grassland, and 56.6% by MAT and MAP in Arctic tun-dra. Our cross-validation approach also allows us to generate a spa-tially explicit understanding of model uncertainties in the tworegions. Across all pixels, we found that soil carbon turnover timesgradually become shorter from western to eastern regions in TPD. Wu et al. Science Bulletin 66 (2021) 1698–17041700grassland. For Arctic tundra, soil carbon turnover times are longerin Eurasia than in Northern America ( Fig. S20 online). On regionalscale, the mean soil carbon turnover time (160921811223 years) overArctic tundra is about threefold as long as that in TP grassland(547575520years) ( Figs. 3 , S21 and S22 online). Our results thus indi-cate that soil carbon turnover time primarily accounted for thelarge differences in topsoil organic carbon density between thetwo regions.3.4. Possible mechanisms for the different carbon turnover timesFirst, TP grassland (MAT = /C03.5/C176C) have a warmer climate thanArctic tundra (MAT = /C09.9/C176C) (Fig. S12 online). The relatively war-mer conditions would be expected to enhance SOC decompositionrates and reduce the soil carbon turnover time. To diagnosewhether such a difference in MAT could mainly explain the differ-ence in turnover times between the two regions, we compared theturnover times of TP grassland and Arctic tundra that fell into thesame MAT and MAP bins in a climate space. However, we stillobserved a shorter turnover time over TP grassland than Arctictundra in ~70% of the same MAT-MAP bins ( Figs. 4 and S23 online).These results suggest that the climatic difference between the tworegions cannot fully explain the turnover time difference betweenthe two regions.Second, there is clear evidence that nutrient availability is a keyfactor determining the SOC decomposition rate and therefore theturnover time [7,40] . To test this mechanism, we collated pub-lished soil organic matter C/N ratio data, a good indicator of soilnutrient status, and found that TP grassland has a lower value(9–12) [41] than does Arctic tundra (20–30) ( Fig. S24 online)[42]. The larger C/N ratio of soil organic matter in Arctic tundrathan in TP grassland may be related to the weaker biological nitro-gen ﬁxation [43] and lower nitrogen deposition [44]. Whenmicrobes feed on substrates that are poor in nutrients comparedto their demands, microbial decomposition rates would be greatlyFig. 1. Soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and net primary production (NPP) inTibetan Plateau (TP) grassland and Arctic tundra. Here, soil organic carbon densityin the top 10 cm was derived from three observation-based databases. The NPPrepresents the multi-year mean for the period 1982–2011. NPP was separated intoaboveground NPP (ANPP) and belowground NPP (BNPP), which consisted of BNPP inthe 0–10 cm layer and BNPP at depths >10 cm. The sum of ANPP and BNPP in the 0–10 cm layer is used as a proxy for potential topsoil carbon inputs via litter fall to thesurface layer based on the steady state assumption.Fig. 2. Relationships between topsoil organic carbon turnover time and climate variables. (a) Relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) in the TP gr assland (red)and Arctic tundra (blue). (b) Mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the TP grassland (red) and Arctic tundra (blue). Here, carbon turnover times for all t he sites were convertedfrom observed14C data in topsoil (0–10 cm) with box model for a supposedly homogeneous reservoir.Fig. 3. Histograms of gridded topsoil organic carbon turnover times in TP grasslandand Arctic tundra. The gridded turnover times (in years) in TP grassland and Arctictundra are extrapolated from their own relationships between soil organic carbon(SOC) turnover times and environmental variables. Values in parentheses areregional-mean carbon turnover times that are calculated by averaging griddedvalues over TP grassland and Arctic tundra, respectively.D. Wu et al. Science Bulletin 66 (2021) 1698–17041701restricted [45]. Such a nutrient limitation could occur in Arctic tun-dra due to a much higher C/N ratio in soil organic matter (20–30)than in microbes (7–13), and has a lower probability of occurringin TP grassland because the C/N ratios between microbes (10–15)and soil organic matter (9–12) are comparable there ( Fig. S24online). Such a limitation in the Arctic tundra would tend to slowthe soil carbon decomposition rates and lengthen the turnovertime, contributing to a longer turnover time in Arctic tundra thanin TP grassland. In addition, the turnover time also generallyincreased with clay content, since this would tend to increase thestabilization of organic matter [46,47] . However, this effect didnot constitute a possible explanation since clay content did notshow any signiﬁcant difference between the two regions(Fig. S14 online).Third, photodegradation, the direct photochemical mineraliza-tion and indirect photofacilitation of organic matter mediated bysunlight (solar irradiance, speciﬁcally ultraviolet-B radiation), hasbeen proposed as an important control of carbon turnover inwater-limited ecosystems [48,49] . To test this hypothesis, we com-pared the solar radiation and ultraviolet-B radiation, which areimportant for the photodegradation of organic matter [50,51] ,between TP grassland and Arctic tundra. We found that the meanannual solar radiation (184 W m/C02) and ultraviolet-B radiation(0.065 W m/C02) in TP grassland were signiﬁcantly higher than inArctic tundra (105 and 0.014 W m/C02)(Fig. S13 online). This sug-gests that a stronger photodegradation impact on the carbon turn-over occurs in TP grassland than in Arctic tundra, which maycontribute to their faster carbon turnover.Fourth, livestock grazing has a long history in TP grassland, andthe impact of such human-induced grazing on ecosystems is moreintense in TP grassland than in Arctic tundra. For example, humanappropriation of net primary productivity, as a measure of humanintervention into ecosystems [52], is much stronger in TP grassland(9.5%) than that in Arctic tundra (0.7%) ( Fig. S25 online). Suchintensiﬁed grazing might accelerate carbon decomposition ratesand shorten the turnover time by shifting soil microbial composi-tion from fungi-dominated to bacterial-dominated communities[53].Ad hoc herbivore enclosure experiments will be needed toascertain the importance of grazing on soil carbon turnover timein TP grassland [54].4. ConclusionIn conclusion, our compilation of soil radiocarbon measure-ments showed that the soil carbon turnover time in the topsoillayer over TP grassland was about one-third as long as that in Arc-tic tundra, which mainly explains the observation that soil carbondensity in TP grassland is less than a half of that in the Arctic tun-dra. The possible mechanisms behind the shorter turnover time inTP grassland proposed here are valid but qualitative, and requireadditional researches (e.g., ﬁeld experiments) to quantify the pro-cesses [55]. In particular, there is a need for ad hoc experimentsover TP grassland to elucidate the impact of grazing intensityand photodegradation on the turnover time. While the tempera-ture control of soil carbon turnover is implicit for the two regions,precipitation is also found to be a key control in TP grassland,pointing out the need for a better understanding of changes inthe monsoon-regulated hydrological cycle over TP grassland [56].Our results highlight the diverse possible formation and stabiliza-tion mechanisms of soil organic carbon between the two vulnera-ble regions. We thus emphasize the necessity of representingheterogeneous carbon turnover in different permafrost zones andincorporating regional-speciﬁc mechanisms controlling the turn-over in the land surface components of Earth System Models thatcan be used to understand the magnitude of carbon-climatefeedback.Conﬂict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conﬂict of interest.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Preliminary Research on ThreePoles Environment and Climate Change (2019YFC1509103), theNational Natural Science Foundation of China (41861134036 and41922004), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientiﬁc Expedition andResearch Program (2019QZKK0606), and the Strategic PriorityResearch Program (A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(XDA19070303 and XDA20050101).
