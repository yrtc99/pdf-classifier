CapriKeywords:Carbon sequestrationEnergy cropLoess PlateauMarginal landsMiscanthus lutarioripariusSoil organic carbonCarbon sequestration is an essential ecosystem service that second-generation energy crops can provide. Toevaluate the ability of carbon sequestration of Miscanthus energy crops in the Loess Plateau of China, the yieldand soil organic carbon (SOC) changes were measured for three Miscanthus species in the experimental ﬁeldin Qingyang of the Gansu Province (QG). With the highest yield of the three species, Miscanthus lutarioripariuscontributed to the largest increase of SOC, 0.57 t ha−1yr−1, comparing to the ﬁeld left unplanted. Throughmodeling M. lutarioriparius yield across the Loess Plateau, an average increase of SOC was estimated at0.46 t ha−1yr−1for the entire region. Based on the measurements o f SOC mineralization under various temperaturesand moistures for soil samples taken from QG, a model was d eveloped for estimating SOC mineralization rates acrossthe Loess Plateau and resulted in an average of 1.11 t ha−1yr−1. Combining the estimates from these models, theaverage of net carbon sequestratio n was calculated at a rate of 9.13 t ha−1yr−1in the Loess Plateau. These resultssuggested that the domestication and production of M. lutarioriparius hold a great potential for carbon sequestrationand soil restoration in this heavily eroded region.© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionBioenergy production holds a great potential for reducing green-house gas (GHG) emission and mitigating climate change ( Lemus andLal, 2005 ). The capability of removing carbon from the atmosphere, orcarbon sequestration, depends on not only energy crop yield but alsoorganic carbon accumulation in the agroecosystem ( Field et al., 2008 ).It has been increasingly realized that planting second-generation ener-gy crops on marginal land provides environmental bene ﬁts in bothcarbon sequestration and soil conservation ( Gelfand et al., 2013 ). Theprevious studies have shown that the domestication and productionofMiscanthus energy crops in the Loess Plateau of China, one of themost seriously eroded regions of the world, would be especially ef ﬁcientin these aspects ( Sang and Zhu, 2011 ).The Loess Plateau covering an area of approximately 62 million hectares(Mha) from central to northwestern China has lost most of its naturalvegetation due to constant human disturbance and the past climatechanges ( Chen et al., 2007 ). With loose-soil land overused for producingfood crops and raising livestock, about two thirds of the area suffersfrom severe erosion, which has created major ecological problemssuch as landscape degradation, soil nutrient depletion, intensifyingsandstorms, and excessive sedimentation in the Yellow River. In orderto restore the degraded environment, soil in particular, the “Grain forGreen Project ”(GGP) was launched in 1990s to convert low-yield crop-land to grassland and woodland, with the Loess Plateau as the key re-gion in this effort (Cao et al., 2009 ).Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an essential component of soil organicmatter, which plays important roles in preserving soil moisture, main-taining soil structure, and providing a long-term nutrient stock forplants ( Trumbore, 1997 ). It has been recognized that small changes inSOC could have enormous impact on the atmosphere CO2concentration(Cox et al., 2000 ). The cultivation of annual food crops inevitably causesthe loss of SOC due to frequent plowing, which has been a primary con-tributor to soil degradation in places like the Loess Plateau ( Wu et al.,2004 ). Growing perennial energy crops on eroded and degraded landshould facilitate soil carbon accumulation and consequently the im-provement of soil productivity ( Post and Kwon, 2000 ). It was previouslysuggested that the production of perennial energy crops for at least aperiod of time in the Loess Plateau would function as means of ecologi-cal restoration and create a sustainable agricultural system for the re-gion ( Liu and Sang, 2013 ). However, it remains unclear to what extentplanting Miscanthus energy crops in the Loess Plateau can improve soilfertility although some attempts of vegetation restoration increasedsoil carbon storage and carbon sequestration of the region.Carbon sequestration is an important part of ecosystem services,which is determined by primary productivity, SOC storage, and soilCO2emission ( Feng et al., 2013 ). The proportion of SOC stocks resultingfrom vegetation production and potential conversion of SOC intoCO2are essential measurements for ecosystem carbon sequestration(Lal, 2004 ). The Miscanthus planted in large areas of arable land inthe United States and Europe generated positive impact on carbonsequestration ( Clifton-Brown et al., 2004; Hillier et al., 2009; Mishraet al., 2013 ). In the Loess Plateau, it remains unclear to whether thelarge-scale production of Miscanthus energy crops would contributesubstantially to ecosystem carbon sequestration.To address these questions, two experimental ﬁelds were establishedin 2009, with one in Qingyang of the Gansu Province (QG) located in themiddle of the Loess Plateau as the energy crop domestication site andthe other located in Jiangxia of the Hubei Province (JH) as the controlsite. Our previous studies demonstrated that of three Miscanthus speciesplanted in the two sites, Miscanthus lutarioriparius had a reasonably highrate of establishment and the highest biomass yield ( Yan et al., 2012 ).Thus M. lutarioriparius was considered to be the most promising candi-date for energy crop domestication in the Loess Plateau ( Sang, 2011 ).In this study, carbon stock was measured for soils supporting thethree Miscanthus species in both ﬁeld sites. A model was developed tointegrate ﬁeld and laboratory data to estimate annual SOC accumulationand net carbon sequestration (NCS) in the case that the use of marginalland was changed from food to bioenergy production across the LoessPlateau.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study sites and samplingTwo experimental ﬁelds were established in QG and JH in 2009(Yan et al., 2012). QG is located in the Loess Plateau (34° –45°5′ N,101° –114°33 ′E) with the mean annual precipitation of ~500 mm andthe mean annual temperature ranging 7.0 –10.0 °C. JH is located incentral China with the mean annual precipitation of ~1200 mm andthe mean annual temperature ranging 15.8 –17.5 °C. In each site,more than one thousand individuals collected from 93 popula-tions of three Miscanthus species, M. lutarioriparius ,Miscanthussacchari ﬂorus and Miscanthus sinensis were planted in a completelyrandom design with an individual planted in a 1 m × 1 m quadrat.The control was a portion of the experimental ﬁeld left unplantedfor natural recovery after the initial plowing. For comparison withcrop ﬁeld, soil samples were taken from the nearby maize andwheat ﬁelds.In this study, ﬁve populations for each species and three individualsfor each population were sampled randomly in QG and JH in August,2012. In the 1 m × 1 m quadrat, three roots and three soil cores (5 cm indiameter) were taken close to the tillers from the depth of 0 –10cm,10–20 cm, and 20 –40 cm. The samples were brought back to thelaboratory for analyses. For root cores, soil from the three cores ateach depth was mixed in root bags with 0.3 mm meshes. After remov-ing soil and impurities such as plant residue and animal waste byrinsing and picking, roots were dried at 65 °C to constant weight. InOctober, the aboveground biomass of the sampled individuals washarvested and weighed after drying at 65 °C to constant weight.2.2. Measurement of soil properties and carbon compositionSoil samples taken from three soil cores were mixed for eachdepth beneath each individual plant. After rocks and plant fragmentswere removed, the soil samples were air-dried and sieved througha 2 mm screen. Fine roots were picked by electrostatic adhesion.For all measurements, three replicates representing three individ-uals of a population were taken. The gravimetric moisture content ofsieved soil was determined as the weight difference before andafter oven-drying at 105 °C for 24 h to constant weight. Soil bulkdensity and soil moisture at each depth were obtained by using acylindrical sampler (New Landmark XDB0303, Beijing, China). Soilwater ﬁlled pore space (WFPS) was calculated from bulk densityand volumetric soil moisture content and was used to representthe soil moisture condition in the process of soil incubation ( Linnand Doran, 1984). Soil total carbon (TC) was analyzed by CHONanalyzer (Elementar VARIO EL III, Hanau, Germany). Inorganiccarbon (IC) was evaluated using a Calcimeter (Eijkelkamp, Giesbeek,Netherlands). SOC was calculated as the difference between TCand IC.Differences in the SOC among soils supporting three species ofMiscanthus and control ﬁeld were tested using one-way ANOVA and aposteriori Duncan test when signi ﬁcant ( Pb0.05) with SPSS 17.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). The generalized linear mixed model(GLMM) of PROC MIXED SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA)was used to analyze the effects of site, species and population nestedwithin species on the change of SOC after planting three species ofMiscanthus and the effects of population and depth on the change ofSOC after planting M. lutarioriparius .374 J. Mi et al. / Science of the Total Environment 496 (2014) 373 –3802.3. Soil incubation for organic carbon mineralizationFive grams of air-dried soil samp l e so fe a c ho ft h et w ol a y e r s ,0 –10 cmand 10 –20 cm, were placed in a 60 mL ﬂask in triplicates and threeempty ﬂasks were set as controls. Distilled water was added until thesoil mass reached at 30%, 60%, and 90% WFPS. Samples were pre-incubated at 25 °C in the dark for seven days while a smooth airﬂow was maintained through a pump. Then the ﬂasks werecovered with waterproof breathable membrane and incubated atfour temperatures: 5 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C. Soil moisture waschecked by weighing each ﬂask every day and adjusted to the originalwater content by adding distilled water.CO2released from the soil was measured on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21,and 28, after incubation and the rate at which CO 2accumulated inthe headspace of the ﬂask was measured with a gas chromatograph(Agilent HP 7890 SERIES II, Santa Clara CA, USA). During each measure-ment, ﬂasks were sealed with rubber stoppers with two inlet and outletpinholes. Ambient atmospheric air was injected into the ﬂask until itwas completely ﬁlled in about 3 min. After 3-hour incubation, 5 mLgas was extracted from the headspace using gastight syringes with athree-way stopcock. After the measurement, the ﬂask was sealedby para ﬁlm and incubated for future measurement. The concentrationof CO2in each gas sample was immediately determined with N 2as acarrier gas.2.4. Calculation of SOC mineralizationThe measured CO 2concentration of each sample was converted tomass unit and corrected for incubation conditions through the applica-tion of the Ideal Gas Law ( Robertson et al., 1999 ), with Cmrepresentingthe calculated mass of C ( μgL−1):Cm¼CvMPRT; ð1Þwhere Cvwas the headspace concentration of CO 2(μLL−1)i nt h ed a yof measurement (8 times of the measured value from the 3-hourincubation time during the day of sampling), Mwas the molecularweight of carbon (12.01 μgμmol−1),Pwas the barometric pressure(in atmospheres, e.g., 1 atm), Rwas the universal gas constant(0.082 L atm mol−1K), and Twas the incubation temperature plus 273.15.The mass of C in daily CO 2ﬂux from unit dry soil ( μgg−1)w a scalculated as:CF¼CmVW; ð2Þwhere Cmwas obtained from Eq. (1),Vwas the headspace volume of theﬂask (L), and Wwas the dry mass equivalent of soil in the ﬂask (g).Because CO 2ﬂux was not measured every day, CFbetween samplingintervals was calculated as the average of CFfrom the two adjacent sam-pling points. The cumulative mass of C in CO 2ﬂux (mg kg−1) in a givenday ( t) during the 28-day incubation period was calculated as:Ct¼Xtn¼1CF;n; ð3Þwhere CF,nwas CFof day n(μgg−1).The potential of SOC mineralization ( C0)( m gk g−1) was estimatedbased on the kinetics of CO 2ﬂux (Alvarez and Alvarez, 2000 ):Ct¼C0tt0þt; ð4Þwhere Ctwas obtained from Eq. (3)andt0was the semi-decompositiontime (the number of days needed for reaching 50% of C0). Multivariatenon-linear regression analysis was done with SigmaPlot 10.0 (SYSTATSoftware Inc., San Jose CA, USA) to obtain C0andt0for each treatment.The relative contribution of factors in ﬂuencing Ct, including soildepth, SOC, temperature, and moisture, was analyzed using residualmaximum likelihood implemented in Generalized Linear Mixed Model(GLMM) of PROC MIXED SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA).The model contained ﬁxed effects (soil depth, temperature, and moisture)and random effects (SOC). Differences in the cumulative SOC minerali-zation among the treatments were tested with three-way ANOVAand a posteriori Duncan test when signi ﬁcant ( Pb0.05) with SPSS 17.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA).2.5.

Soil organic carbonFor soil samples taken from the ﬁeld sites in QG and JH, SOC wascalculated and compared between soils supporting the three Miscanthusspecies and soil left unplanted served as the control ( Fig. 1 ). In the threesoil layers examined in both QG and JH, the layer of 0 –10 cm had thehighest SOC. In QG, soils supporting M. lutarioriparius had signi ﬁcantly(Pb0.05) higher SOC than that of the control in the 0 –10 cm layer,and M. sinensis had signiﬁ cantly ( Pb0.05) higher SOC than that ofthe control in the 10 –20 cm layer. In JH, soils supporting the threeMiscanthus species had signi ﬁcantly ( Pb0.05) higher SOC than thatof the control in the layer of 0 –10 cm. In the layers of 10 –20 cmand 20 –40 cm, SOC increased signi ﬁcantly ( Pb0.05) after plantingM. sacchariﬂ orus.The increase of SOC between the soils supporting the three Miscanthusspecies and soils left unplanted allowed for the evaluation of effectsamong species and between sites. There was signi ﬁcant site effect onS O Ci nt h et h r e es o i ll a y e r s( Pb0.05), whereas there was no signi ﬁcantdifference among the three Miscanthus species. The effects of populationnested within the species were signi ﬁcant only for the soil layer of20–40 cm ( Pb0.05). While a signi ﬁcant site-species interaction wasfound in the soil layer of 0 –10 cm ( Table 1 ). For the soils supportingM. lutarioriparius , the effects of population, depth, and the interactionbetween them were signi ﬁcant in QG (P b0.05) ( Table 2 ).When compared with agricultural ﬁelds that planted major crops inQG, maize and winter wheat, the SOC of soil supporting M. lutarioripariuswere signi ﬁcantly higher in 0 –10 cm layer ( Pb0.05) ( Fig. 2 ). Therewere no signi ﬁcant differences of SOC between soils supporting threespecies of Miscanthus and those of major crops in the 10 –20 cm layer.In 20 –40 cm layer, the SOC of soil supporting Miscanthus were signi ﬁ-cantly lower than that of winter wheat ( Pb0.05). The SOC of soilssupporting M. sacchari ﬂorus and M. lutarioriparius were signi ﬁcantlylower than that of maize ( Pb0.05), while the SOC of soil supportingM. sinensis was not signi ﬁcantly different from that of maize.3.2. Soil organic carbon mineralization under laboratory incubationThe trends of CO 2release rates from incubated soils supportingM. lutarioriparius and the effects of temperature and moisture are shownin Fig. A.1. At 15 °C and 25 °C, the CO 2release rate decreased graduallyduring the incubation period. When the incubation temperature was atFig. 1. Comparison of SOC of between three Miscanthus species and control in the ﬁeld sites of QG and JH. SOC was measured for three soil layers, 0 –10, 10 –20 and 20 –40 cm in depth.Different letters indicate signi ﬁcant differences at P=0 . 0 5 .376 J. Mi et al. / Science of the Total Environment 496 (2014) 373 –380the lower and higher ends, 5 °C or 35 °C, the CO 2release rate ﬂuctuated.For soil from QG, the differences between CO 2release rates among threesoil moisture treatments were not signi ﬁcant at 5 °C. At 15 °C, 25 °C and35 °C, the CO 2release rates followed the pattern that the CO 2releaserate was positively correlated with soil moisture and the differencesbetween CO 2release rates among three soil temperature treatmentswere signi ﬁcant ( Pb0.05). For soil from JH, the differences betweenCO2release rates among three soil moisture treatments were not signi ﬁ-cant at 5 °C and 15 °C. The CO 2release rates at 60% WFPS were not signif-icantly different from that at 90% WFPS, while they were signi ﬁcantlyhigher than that at 30% WFPS at 25 °C and 35 °C ( Pb0.05).Temperature and moisture affected CO 2accumulation resulted fromSOC mineralization (Table A.1). Fig. 3 showed that the differences ofSOC mineralization in the responses to soil temperature and moisturebetween QG and JH. For soil samples from QG, with the temperatureincreasing from 5 °C to 35 °C, the cumulative CO 2release ﬁrst decreasedand then increased at all soil moisture treatments. The process of SOCmineralization appeared multi-threshold in QG. The lowest value ofcumulative CO2appeared at 15 °C and 30% WFPS, and the highest at35 °C and 90% WFPS among all treatments. For soil samples from JH,with the temperature increasing from 5 °C to 35 °C, the cumulativeCO2had no signi ﬁcant change at 30% WFPS. At 60% and 90% WFPS,cumulative CO 2was not signi ﬁcant different between 5 °C and 15 °Ctreatments, while the cumulative CO 2increased signi ﬁcantly from15 °C to 35 °C. The process of SOC mineralization appeared few thresh-olds in QG. The lowest value of cumulative CO 2appeared at 15 °C and30% WFPS, and the highest at 35 °C and 60% or 90% WFPS among alltreatments.3.3. Estimate of net carbon sequestrationThe standing aboveground biomass of M. lutarioriparius was up to2371.90 g m−2and 2667.35 g m−2in QG and JH ( PN0.05), respectively,which were the highest ( Pb0.05) among the three Miscanthus speciesstudied (Fig. A.2). The belowground biomass (0 –40 cm) of M. lutarioripariusin QG and JH was 526.82 g m−2and 646.51 g m−2,r e s p e c t i v e l y .Among the three species, there was only a signi ﬁcant differencein existing belowground biomass of M. sinensis between two sites(Pb0.05).By the rates of CO 2release measured in the laboratory (Fig. A.1),the average rates of SOC mineralization were predicted under varioussoil conditions of temperature and moisture (Fig. A.3, Table A.2). DailySOC mineralization was estimated by the ﬁeld conditions oftemperature and precipitation in the two ﬁeld sites (Table A.3). WhenSOC mineralization (0 –20 cm layer) extended to the whole region ofthe Loess Plateau, the average SOC mineralization was 1.11 t ha−1yr−1, and the total amount was 37.11 t yr−1in 33.3 Mha marginallands available ( Liu et al., 2012 ) of the Loess Plateau.The average of NCS was estimated at 12.40 t ha−1yr−1in QG, ofwhich 95.41% was ﬁxed in plants and 4.59% was as SOC (Table A.4).In the Loess Plateau, the distribution of NCS was gradually reducedfrom the southeast to the northwest ( Fig. 4 ). The average NCS was9.13 t ha−1yr−1, and the total NCS was 303.80 million t yr−1for33.3 Mha marginal lands available for growing Miscanthus energycrops in the Loess Plateau.4. Discussion4.1. Soil organic carbon and land use changeSOC carries out vital ecosystem functions, such as soil structure,water holding capacity, and nutrient storage ( Schmidt et al., 2011 ).Because the topsoil was more susceptible to erosion and nutrient deple-tion than subsoil, SOC from the topsoil can quickly respond to land usechange ( Salome et al., 2010 ). Compared to the control plots, SOC ofthe soil supporting Miscanthus species increased partly in topsoil afterthree growing seasons from 2009 to 2012 ( Fig. 1 ).M. lutarioripariushad the greatest impact on the increase of SOC among the threeMiscanthus species in QG, whereas the three species had similar in ﬂu-ences on SOC in JH. These patterns were derived from environmentalvariation between the experimental ﬁelds combined with differencesin biomass yield between the species ( Franzluebbers, 2002 ).Compared with the major food crops in QG, maize and winter wheat,Miscanthus had signi ﬁcantly increased SOC in topsoil during the threegrowing seasons ( Fig. 2 ) because the roots of Miscanthus mainly distrib-uted in relatively shallower soil (0 –20 cm) and Miscanthus had higherbiomass. Meanwhile, organic matter from plant parts moved graduallyfrom shallow to deep soil layers over time. SOC in deep soil inMiscanthus ﬁeld might increase in the future, which would effectivelylead to the improvement of soil nutrition. Thus the land-use changefrom food crops to Miscanthus energy crops should generate positiveenvironmental effects on the Loess Plateau.Adding on the previous studies ( Liu et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2012 ), thiswork strongly supported that M. lutarioriparius was the most suitableenergy crops for growing on the marginal land of the Loess Plateau,not only because it had the highest aboveground biomass, but alsobecause it had the greatest capability of improving underground accu-mulation of SOC among the three Miscanthus species. In addition,there were signi ﬁcant differences among the various populations ofM. lutarioriparius with regard to SOC accumulation ( Table 2 ). Thus, theselection for populations of M. lutarioriparius with the highest capabilityof both feedstock production and SOC accumulation would be the ef-forts of energy crop domestication that aims to generate maximalpositive environmental effects.4.2. Soil organic carbon mineralizationSOC was also regulated by carbon loss, of which the main pathwaywas the SOC mineralization by heterotrophic respiration ( Post andKwon, 2000 ). The most effective determination method of SOC mineral-ization was the soil incubation in the laboratory because SOC minerali-zation cannot be measured directly under ﬁeld conditions due to theinterference of the plant roots ( Werth and Kuzyakov, 2010 ). In thisstudy, we used the soil incubation to estimate the SOC mineralizationand found that higher SOC mineralization existed in QG than in JH inrelatively low temperature regardless of soil moisture. Meanwhile,SOC mineralization increased more quickly in QG than in JH with theincrease of temperature, especially in relatively high soil moisture(Fig.3).

It was consistent with the usual pattern that theprocess of SOC mineralization was dominated by soil temperaturein habitats with good soil moisture condition ( Knorr et al., 2005 ).These results indicated that SOC mineralization of plantingM. lutarioriparius in QG and JH had quite different performance. Theresponses of SOC mineralization to soil temperature and moisturewere more sensitive in drier habitats. Both temperature and precipita-tion were lower in QG than in JH, with the average temperature andtotal precipitation of 12 °C and 350 mm in QG, and 22 °C and 942 mmin JH, respectively. SOC mineralization was relatively stable in thewet habitat because stable environment formed a relatively simpleproperty, which would not quickly adjust with the changes of environ-mental conditions. In fact, SOC mineralization in QG was only a slightlyhigher than in JH.4.3. Link the laboratory to the ﬁeld estimates of SOC mineralizationAlthough the potential of SOC mineralization played an importantrole in the ecosystem carbon sink capacity ( Singh et al., 2010 ), themethod of estimating the potential of SOC mineralization was currentlylimited in the laboratory analysis ( Robertson et al., 1999 ), In this study,we attempted to estimate SOC mineralization of growing Miscanthusenergy crops in the Loess Plateau based on the ﬁeld and laboratory incu-bation data. Models were developed to convert from the experimentalconditions of temperature and moisture to the soil temperature andprecipitation in the ﬁeld (Eq. (5)). The soil temperature of 0 –20 cmlayer was assumed to be equal with the atmospheric temperature. Therelationship between soil moisture and interval of precipitation wasestablished by the water-holding capacity of the soil. The daily precipi-tation was used to simulate the soil moisture and the maximum effectwas taken when the multiple effects on the soil moisture appeareddue to continuous rainfall. The relationship between climatic conditionsand soil temperature and moisture was established according to theproperties of soil water retention, which determined the duration ofsoil moisture at 90% and 60% WFPS and the soil remained the watercontent of 30% WFPS until the next rainfall.The soil depth and types in different regions were also consideredin the entire Loess Plateau, because there were different rates of soilwater loss for various soil samples with different soil compositionsand structures. An exponential regression between the SOC mineraliza-tion and soil temperature was used to predict the value of SOC mineral-ization when daily average temperature was beyond the range ofmeasurements. Thus the rates of SOC mineralization in the 0 –20 cmlayer were established under different climatic conditions and soiltypes (Table A.3) and the landscape of SOC mineralization in the LoessPlateau was predicted by the climatic conditions and soil properties.Annual CO2emission was assessed through the sum of daily SOCmineralization.Generally, the measurements of soil respiration in the ﬁeld weretaken in bi-weekly to monthly interval to ensure the accuracy of annualscale data ( Bahn et al., 2010 ). Daily SOC mineralization was measuredand its relationship with the conditions of soil temperature and moisturewas established, which was considered to be the ﬂuctuations of theFig. 2. Comparison of SOC between different land uses in QG. Land use types include Miscanthus ﬁeld ( M. sacchari ﬂorus,M. sinensis ,M. lutarioriparius , and control) and two major crop ﬁelds(Triticum aestivum andZea mays ). Different letters indicate signi ﬁcant differences at P=0 . 0 5 .Fig. 3.

Mi et al. / Science of the Total Environment 496 (2014) 373 –380soil temperature and moisture. Apparently, annual SOC mineraliza-tion estimated by daily data had a higher accuracy than those esti-mated by weekly or monthly data. Thus, the model developmentrepresents an initial effort to bridge laboratory-based SOC minerali-zation to carbon emission in the natural landscape. There is still alarge room for the improvement and validation of the models,which can be partly ful ﬁlled with the accumulation of ﬁeld and labo-ratory data from additional ﬁeld locations in the Loess Plateau. Itcould also be tested and re ﬁned through the effort of linking labora-tory and ﬁeld estimated of SOC mineralization in other plant systemsand geographic regions.4.4. SOC improvement and net carbon sequestrationThe increase of SOC plays an important role in the improvement ofsoil fertility and quality. We estimated that planting Miscanthus energycrops would increase SOC at the rates of was 0.57 t ha−1yr−1and0.46 t ha−1yr−1in QG and in average for the entire region, respectively.In the experimental ﬁeld of Miscanthus giganteus located in Illinois ofthe United States, the increase in SOC for ﬁeld was estimated at0.16–0.81 t ha−1yr−1(Mishra et al., 2013 ). Two similar studies ofM. giganteus in Denmark and Ireland reported the increase of SOC of0.78–1.12 and 0.60 t ha−1yr−1,r e s p e c t i v e l y( Hansen et al., 2004;Clifton-Brown et al., 2007 ). Thus the annual SOC input calculated fortheM. lutarioriparius ﬁeld in the Loess Plateau was within the range inthe US and lower than those in the two European countries. Whenbiomass production of these ﬁelds are taken into consideration, thepercentage of SOC to the aboveground yield in carbon, 7.8 t ha−1yr−1(16.8 t ha−1yr−1biomass) ( Liu et al., 2012 ), was calculated at 5.9%.These percentages were 1.4% –6.9% in Illinois of the US given above-ground carbon of 11.8 t ha−1yr−1converted from the average biomassyield of 23.4 t ha−1yr−1; they were 7.1% in Ireland (abovegroundcarbon and biomass of 8.37 and 18 t ha−1yr−1,r e s p e c t i v e l y ) ,a n d7.6%–10.9% in Denmark (aboveground carbon and biomass of 10.2and 22.0 t ha−1yr−1, respectively). The higher rates of SOC increasesin the European ﬁelds could be due at least partly to slower SOC miner-alization under the climates in the higher latitudes ( Raich et al., 2002 ).Given that the higher biomass yield in the US and Europe must havecontributed to higher input of SOC resulted from better-quality ﬁeld,the rate of SOC increase estimated in the Loess Plateau should have ahigher ef ﬁciency of soil restoration of this severely eroded region.The GGP, an ecological restoration program launched in 1990s,aimed at converting the low-yield cropland to grassland and woodland(Cao, 2010; Cao et al., 2010 ). The Loess Plateau, central to northwesternChina, has been a high-priority region in this program due to severeerosion. This region locates in semiarid to semihumid transitionalzone with the mean annual precipitation of 300 –600 mm and themean annual temperature ranging 6.0 –10.0 °C ( Chen et al., 2007 ).And the climatic and soil conditions favored perennial grasses overtrees for restoration in the Loess Plateau ( Wang and Cao, 2011 ). It wasrecently estimated that after the cropland was converted into grasslandand shrubland in the Loess Plateau, SOC increased at rates of 0.39 and0.29 t ha−1yr−1, respectively ( Chang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2012 ). Incomparison, planting Miscanthus energy crops is likely to generate aslightly higher rate of SOC accumulation than the current practice ofvegetation recovery in the Loess Plateau.The ecological service of M. lutarioriparius production would alsobe reﬂected in its great potential of ecosystem carbon sequestration.With net primary production and SOC turnover taken into consider-ation, our model estimated that the NCS of Miscanthus ﬁeld would be9.13 t ha−1yr−1in average for the Loess Plateau. This is much higherthan 0.6 and 3.7 t ha−1yr−1estimated for grassland and shrublandrestored by the GGP in the Loess Plateau, respectively ( Lu et al.,2012; Feng et al., 2013 ). Given that a total of 33.3 Mha was foundto be potentially available for Miscanthus production in this region,the total NCS would reach 303.8 million t yr−1, which representsenormous potential carbon sequestration.Unlike grassland and shrubland, however, the aboveground biomassof energy crops is harvested every year to produce biofuels such asethanol. After biofuel consumption, carbon stored in this portion ofbiomass is released. In this regard, carbon sequestration in the above-ground portion of energy crops is quickly turned over and cannot stayin the local ecosystem ( Tonini and Astrup, 2012 ). Nevertheless, thebiofuel consumption would displace an equivalent amount of fossilfuel such as gasoline, which in turn reduces the emission of at leastthe equivalent amount of CO2ﬁxed in the aboveground portion ofbiomass. Therefore, although the carbon sequestration in not allretained locally, it functions to reduce GHG emission and mitigateclimate change globally. Taken together, growing Miscanthus energycrops on marginal land of the heavily eroded regions such as theLoess Plateau would contribute to regional ecological restorationespecially by preventing soil and water loss and improving soil fertility.Furthermore, the great potential in biofuel production along withcarbon sequestration makes this an economically and environmentallysustainable choice of regional development.5. ConclusionsIn this study, we evaluated the ability of carbon sequestration ofMiscanthus energy crops in the Loess Plateau of China. M. lutarioripariuswas the highest yield species among the three species of Miscanthusand it provided the largest increase of SOC on the topsoil comparingto the ﬁeld left unplanted. We developed a model for estimating SOCmineralization rates through linking the laboratory mineralizationrate of SOC and regional climatic factors across the Loess Plateau. Andwe could further model the rates of SOC accumulation, biomassand NCS for the entire region. Our research indicated that growingMiscanthus energy crops on the marginal land of the Loess Plateauholds a greater potential for carbon sequestration and soil restorationthan the vegetation recovery program initiated in the 1990s to convertlow-yield cropland to grassland and woodland. The study strengthenedthe notion that Miscanthus would be a promising perennial energy cropwith its ecosystem service taken into account.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Weixing Zhu and Yongfei Bai for their valuable commentson the earlier versions of the manuscript, and Manhong Li, Qian Wang,Qin Zhang, Ronghui Qin, and Yangyang Fan for their technical assistancewith the ﬁeld and laboratory work.
