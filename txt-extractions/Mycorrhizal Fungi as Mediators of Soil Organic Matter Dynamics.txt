MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI AND SOIL CARBON: AN OVERVIEWSoilorganicmatter(SOM)istheprimarysourceofplant-availablenutrientsinterrestrialecosys-tems,and maintenance of SOM levels is critical for ecosystem sustainability.In addition to beingan important nutrient reservoir, SOM represents a substantial store of carbon (C), containingtwice as much C as the atmosphere and terrestrial vegetation combined.Transfers of C betweensoils and theatmosphere areone of thelargest fluxes in the global terrestrialC budget,with soilsreleasing 60–75 Pg C to the atmosphere annually through microbial decomposition of organicmaterials (Schlesinger & Andrews 2000). This makes the study of SOM important not only tomanage soils for improved fertility and ecosystem productivity but also to understand its role inclimate–soil C feedbacks and its potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (Paustian et al.2016).SOMpoolsandfluxesaredrivenbydynamicformation,stabilization,anddestabilizationpro-cesses,ourunderstandingofwhichhasfundamentallychangedoverthepastfewdecades(Schmidtetal.2011).Historically,stableSOMwasthoughttoformviaselectivepreservationofrecalcitrantplant biopolymers coupled with abiotic synthesis of complex, highly aromatic humic substancesresistant to decay. This model of SOM formation and stabilization was upended with the obser-vation that plant components predicted to persist in soils (e.g., lignin) turn over rapidly, whilemore inherently labile compounds (e.g., sugars) can persist for decades (Grandy & Neff 2008,Schmidt et al. 2011). Additionally, compounds making the largest contributions to stable SOMpools are microbially derived,produced during the decomposition and assimilation of plant exu-dates, litter, and roots (Cotrufo et al. 2013, Simpson et al. 2007). SOM is now understood to bea continuum of organic biopolymers continuously processed by microorganisms and stabilizedthroughinteractionswithsoilmineralsandaggregates(Keiluweitetal.2015,Lehmann&Kleber2015).While saprotrophic (i.e., decomposer) microbes have received considerable attention in theemerging conceptual understanding of SOM dynamics,mycorrhizal fungi may play a unique butunderappreciatedrole( Figure1 ).Inhabitingtheinterfacebetweenplantrootsandsoil,theycon-trol a key entry point for plant C into the rhizosphere. The growth of mycorrhizal extraradi-cal hyphae provides an efficient mechanism for distributing plant-derived C throughout the soilmatrix, promoting its deposition onto mineral surfaces and within soil pores, where it can bechemically or physically protected from microbial decomposition. Given that mycorrhizal fungiaccount for a large proportion of the total soil microbial biomass in some systems (e.g., borealand temperate forests), the death and turnover of mycorrhizal tissues may also contribute sub-stantially to the pool of dead microbial biomass (necromass) thought to be a dominant factor inSOMformationandstabilization(Cotrufoetal.2013,Schmidtetal.2011).Newgenomicandbio-geochemical insights obtained during the past decade suggest that mycorrhizal fungi also likelycontributesubstantiallytoSOMdestabilizationthroughtheirnutrientminingactivities.Inotherwords, while most mycorrhizal fungi appear to lack the genetic capacity to act as saprotrophs,they use several strategies in their search for nutrients that,directly or indirectly,facilitate SOMdecay.In this review, I discuss the unique position that mycorrhizal fungi hold with respect to theformation,stabilization,anddestabilizationofSOM.IfirstdiscusshowplantCallocationtomy-corrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere contributes to SOM formation and stabilization through theproduction of mycorrhizal biomass, exudates, and necromass. I then explore the mechanisms bywhich mycorrhizal fungi alter SOM destabilization dynamics. I focus primarily on two mycor-rhizal groups, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF),which have received the most attention with regard to soil C cycling.238 FreyAnnu.

MYCORRHIZAL-ASSOCIATED PRODUCTION OF SOILORGANIC MATTERPlants allocate a substantial portion of their photosynthate belowground to support their rootsystems, with total belowground C flux representing 30–65% of gross primary production (Gill& Finzi 2016, Vicca et al. 2012). The fate of this C includes root structures, root symbionts,autotrophic (root and root symbiont) respiration, storage compounds, exudates, volatile organiccompounds,and the extraradical fungal hyphae associated with mycorrhizal roots.BelowgroundC allocation plays an important role in ecosystem C cycling; root-derived C,including that asso-ciated with mycorrhizal extraradical hyphae, is a dominant pathway through which C enters theSOMpool,contributingasmuchormoretolong-termsoilCstorageasabovegroundplantcom-ponents(Clemmensenetal.2015,Gale&Cambardella2000,Godboldetal.2006).Asanexample,www.annualreviews.org MycorrhizalFungiandSoilCarbon 239Annu.

Furthermore, much of the accumulated C originated mostly from root-associated fungalhyphae. Although mycorrhizal fungi are critical for plant nutrient acquisition and can receive alarge fraction of host net primary production (NPP), estimates of C allocation to mycorrhizalfungi are often not included in ecosystem C budgets (Ouimette et al. 2019), nor is this processwell described in current models of ecosystem and global C dynamics,limiting our ability to es-timate the relative contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to soil C storage and to predict ecosystemresponses to environmental change. Below, I summarize what is known about the proportion ofNPP allocated to mycorrhizal fungi, the factors that influence plant C allocation patterns, thefate of photosynthate C allocated to mycorrhizal fungi, and the potential implications for SOMformation and stabilization.2.1.

Results from field studies providemycorrhizal allocation estimates of 8–17% of NPP in arctic tussock tundra (Hobbie & Hobbie2006), 27–34% in a temperate mixed coniferous–deciduous forest (Allen & Kitajima 2014), and4–35% across conifer- and deciduous broadleaf–dominated temperate forest stands (Ouimetteetal.2019).PlantCallocationtomycorrhizalfungiispresumablycoupledtoplantCassimilationas influenced by climate,ecosystem type (Gill & Finzi 2016),successional stage (Wallander et al.2010),season (e.g.,Lekberg et al.2013),nutrient availability (Brzostek et al.2015,Lekberg et al.2013, Vicca et al. 2012), and global change drivers (e.g., Alberton et al. 2005, Drigo et al. 2010,Lilleskovetal.2019).Althoughtherelativelackofdata,particularlyunderfieldconditionsacrossa wide range of ecosystems, makes plant C transfer to mycorrhizal fungi difficult to generalize,the above estimates make clear that it is a significant and important conduit of C into the soil.2.2. Fate of Plant Carbon Allocated to Mycorrhizal Fungi and Implicationsfor Soil Organic Matter StoragePlant photosynthate allocated to mycorrhizal fungi can be partitioned into three primary pools:living fungal biomass and its associated metabolic processes (e.g., respiration), fungal exudates,and dead fungal tissues (necromass).Each of these components likely has different consequencesfor SOM formation and stabilization, the importance of which is only beginning to be assessedand quantified.2.2.1.

As they forage for nutrient-rich organic matter patches, they also grow and deposit Cintonutrient-deficientzones.Livinghyphaeproduceandsecretevariousextracellularcompounds(seeSection2.2.2)that,giventheirproximitytoclayparticles,maystabilizeCandnutrientsontomineral surfaces (Jilling et al.2018,Kleber et al.2015).The formation of mineral–organic asso-ciations has been identified as a main control on soil C storage because of the slow turnover ofmineral-associated organic matter (Kleber et al. 2015), though the relative contribution of myc-orrhizal fungi to this process is largely unknown.Most research related to mycorrhizal fungi and C storage has focused on aggregate forma-tion. Fungal hyphae adhere to and physically entangle and enmesh soil particles, facilitating theformation of stable aggregates within which SOM is protected from decomposition (Six et al.1998).Both AMF and EMF enhance soil aggregate formation and stabilization,and a direct linkhas been established between the amount of water-stable aggregates and the presence of myc-orrhizal mycelium, with the extent of aggregation depending on the species involved (Lehmannet al.2017).Mycorrhizal taxa vary widely in their production of extraradical hyphae (Weigt et al.2012),and the extent of hyphal proliferation depends on the host plant,soil nutrient availability,pH,and moisture status (Lehmann et al.2017).In order to estimate the contribution of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae to soil C dynamics, it isimportant to quantify the amount of standing biomass, production, and turnover rates, a non-trivial task given the challenges of distinguishing mycorrhizal from saprotrophic fungal hyphaein soil. Mycorrhizal hyphal extension can be up to 8 mm or more per day under lab conditions(seeCairney2012andreferencestherein).Fieldmeasurementsarelesscommon,butestimatesof0.7 mm/day have been documented (Cairney 2012). Fungal hyphal surface areas were estimatedto be 16 to 90 times greater than the surface area of fine roots (Hobbie & Hobbie 2008). An-nual production of EMF has been estimated to range from 2 to 200 g C/(m2·year) (Ekblad et al.2013,Hagenbo et al.2017,Ouimette et al.2019,Wallander et al.2001),representing up to 30%of NPP (Ouimette et al. 2019). Few comparable estimates are available for AMF or ericoid fun-gal hyphae. EMF production numbers suggest substantial C investment in extraradical hyphae,but in order to fully assess the role of mycorrhizal fungi in SOM dynamics,accurate estimates ofstanding biomass are needed,since standing biomass represents the balance between productionand turnover. Mycorrhizal hyphal biomass can represent up to a third or more of total micro-bial biomass in some systems (Högberg & Högberg 2002) and as much as half of the standingmycelialbiomass(Bååthetal.2004),dependingonmycorrhizaltype,ecosystem,andtimeofyear.However,fewactualbiomassestimatesexist,andthosethatareavailablerangefrom5to14g/m2for EMF in the organic horizon of a pine (Högberg & Högberg 2002) or boreal (Hagenbo et al.2017) forest and from 480 to 580 g/m2in the upper 70 cm of the soil profile in EMF-dominatedforests (Wallander et al.2004).Estimates of hyphal turnover are also limited,though it is likely akeymechanismforroot-derivedCtransfertoSOMpools.Availabledatasuggestthatthelifespanof extraradical hyphae can be short,with estimates on the order of days for AMF and up to a fewmonths for EMF, though EMF rhizomorphs may persist for several years (reviewed by Cairney2012, Hagenbo et al. 2017). Likewise, EMF-colonized root tips turn over on the order of a fewmonthstoseveralyears(Cairney2012).RecentresearchinEMF-dominatedconiferousforestsinChinasuggeststhatextraradicalhyphaeaccountforuptotwo-thirdsofnewrootCinputstosoil,withestimatesof ∼79–153g/m2ofmycelia-derivedCstoredinSOMpoolsannually(Zhangetal.2019).In summary,C flux through mycorrhizal extraradical hyphae is likely large and importantfor SOM formation.2.2.2.

Mycorrhizal necromass. The pool of living soil microbial biomass is small relative tothe total SOM pool,typically representing 1–3% of total soil C.However,due to rapid turnover,deadmicrobialbiomass(i.e.,necromass)canmakeadisproportionatelylargecontributiontototalSOM relative to the amount of standing microbial biomass (Grandy & Neff 2008),and turnoverof microbial residues is now considered a dominant factor in SOM formation and stabilization(Cotrufo et al. 2013, Kögel-Knabner 2002, Liang et al. 2011, Schmidt et al. 2011). Microbialnecromass can represent more than half of the soluble SOM fraction and account for more than80% of soil nitrogen (N) (Simpson et al. 2007). Since mycorrhizal biomass is generated directly242 FreyAnnu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2019.50:237-259.

Indeed, more than half of newly formed SOM has beenattributedtoextraradical hyphaeinEMF-dominated systems(Clemmensen etal.2013,Godboldet al. 2006), and more than half of EMF biomass added to a forest soil was converted to thenonliving SOM (i.e.,necromass) fraction over a few months (Schweigert et al.2015).Mycorrhizal necromass can influence SOM storage either by becoming stabilized within thesoilmatrixitselforbyservingasaCandnutrientsourceforheterotrophicmicroorganismswhoseown tissues subsequently become part of the necromass SOM pool. There is evidence for bothmechanisms.Likethoseofplants,thecellwallsoffungiarecomposedprimarilyofpolysaccharides,with chitin and β-glucans being the dominant materials (Kögel-Knabner 2002). Chitin is labilerelativetootherfungalnecromassconstituents(Fernandez&Koide2012);chitin-enrichedfungalcell wall material is readily utilized as a source of both C and N by the soil microbial community(Zeglin & Myrold 2013).Microbial degradation of labile C compounds results in the productionof chemically diverse SOM (Kallenbach et al. 2016) that may be physically and/or chemicallystabilized through interactions with mineral surfaces and soil aggregates (Kleber et al.2015).Inadditiontochitin,fungaltissuescontainsmallerquantitiesoflipids,melanins,proteins,andcarbohydrates and various types of phenolic, indolic, and quinone monomers (Kögel-Knabner2002).Melaninhasreceivedparticularattentionbecause,likelignin,itisalarge,complex,nonhy-drolyzablestructuredesignedtoprotectfungalcellwallsagainstmicrobialattack(Kögel-Knabner2002), and its decomposition also requires costly oxidative enzymes. Thus, impaired decompo-sition of mycorrhizally derived C is hypothesized to be a key driver of necromass accumulation(Clemmensenetal.2013).Mycorrhizalnecromassdecompositioniscontrolledbyitsbiochemicalcomposition,whichvariesacrossspecies(Fernandez&Kennedy2018,Fernandezetal.2016),withdecay rates negatively correlated with initial melanin concentrations ( Figure 2 )( F e r n a n d e z&Koide 2014,Fernandez et al.2019,Koide & Malcolm 2009).When melanin synthesis was inhib-ited, EMF tissues decomposed significantly faster (Fernandez & Kennedy 2018), and melanizedhyphaewereobservedtohaveahighersorptiontosoilmineralscomparedwithhyaline(i.e.,non-melanized)hyphae(Fomina&Gadd2003).Additionally,thepersistenceofstableEMFnecromasswas greater than that of either plant litter or bacterial biomass (Schweigert et al. 2015).

MYCORRHIZALLY INDUCED LOSSES OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTERWhile mycorrhizal fungi likely play a substantial role in influencing the C input side of theSOMstorageequation,theirpresenceandactivitiescanalsoleadtoitsdestabilization,facilitatingSOM loss. There is consensus that AMF and EMF are unlikely to act as saprotrophs by metab-olizing SOM to acquire C or energy (Lindahl & Tunlid 2015, Treseder et al. 2006, Zak et al.2019).Thus,itispresumedthattheprimarydriverofmycorrhizallyinducedSOMdestabilizationand loss is the mining of organic matter for nutrients, particularly N and P (i.e., the nutrient-mininghypothesis).AlargefractionofsoilNisimmobilizedinpolyphenoliccomplexes—N-andP-containing compounds (i.e.,proteins,inositol phosphates,phospholipids,nucleic acids) associ-ated with polyphenols and other degradation products of plant and microbial biopolymers—thatare resistant to enzymatic degradation.There is also a potentially large organic N pool stabilizedon mineral surfaces (Jilling et al. 2018). For this reason, mycorrhizal fungi would benefit fromhavingsomeabilitytofacilitateSOMdecay(seethesidebartitledDecayandDecompositionDe-fined) to release nutrients directly or indirectly,and indeed,this capacity has been speculated formore than a century (Read 1991).There are at least three mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi are thought to access nu-trients locked in SOM and thereby promote its decay ( Figure 3 ): direct enzymatic breakdown(Section 3.1), oxidation via Fenton chemistry (Section 3.2), and stimulation of microbial activ-ity and enzyme production by providing C subsidies to the rhizosphere (Section 3.3). A fourthmechanism, competition with free-living saprotrophs (Section 3.4), is hypothesized to suppressSOM decomposition,leading to its accumulation.There is differential support for each of thesemechanisms,andthedegreetowhichtheyoperateunderfieldconditionsisfarfromclear.Below,I describe each of these mechanisms in turn and discuss what is currently known about their rolein soil C loss (or accumulation).3.1.

The complete decay of plant and microbial residues involves a suite of extracellularenzymes. Saprotrophic fungi are generally considered the primary producers of these enzymes(Schneider et al. 2012), and the presence of enzyme-coding genes determines whether a partic-ular fungal species has the genetic machinery to enzymatically break down plant lignocelluloseor microbial necromass. In the case of plant materials, cellulose and hemicellulose are degradedby the synergistic activities of various cellulases ( Figure 3 a). Lignin decay involves two maingroupsoflignolyticenzymes:peroxidasesandphenoloxidases(Dashtbanetal.2010).Peroxidasesinitiate the depolymerization of lignin, while phenol oxidases catalyze the oxidation of pheno-lic monomers once the larger lignin structure has been broken apart.Individual fungal taxa varyconsiderablyintheirdecaycapacity.Somesaprotrophicspeciespossesscompletelignocellulolyticenzymecapabilities(e.g.,producecellulases,hemicellulases,peroxidases,andphenoloxidases)andcancompletelydecomposelignocellulose,whileothersonlypartiallydegradelignocellulose(e.g.,produce only cellulases,hemicellulases,and/or phenol oxidases).MycorrhizalfungiarelikewisehighlyvariableintheircapacitytoproduceextracellularSOM-degradingenzymes,although,asnotedabove,theseenzymesareusedfornutrientacquisition,notfor securing C and energy (i.e.,SOM decay,not decomposition; see the sidebar titled Decay andDecompositionDefined).NewgenomicinsightsoverthepastdecadehaveprovidedclearevidenceregardingwhichmycorrhizaltaxahavethegeneticcapacitytofacilitateSOMdecayenzymatically.AMFareamonophyleticclade(Glomeromycotina)ofearly-divergingfungiandrepresentoneofthe oldest fungal lineages.The inability of AMF to grow in vitro was taken as early evidence thatAMFareentirelydependentontheirplanthostforC.TherecentgenomicsequencingandanalysisofseveralAMFspecies(e.g., Rhizophagusirregularis ,Rhizophagusclarus ,Gigasporarosea ,andGigas-pora margarita ) have confirmed their status as obligate biotrophs (Kamel et al. 2017, Tang et al.2016,Tisserantetal.2013).OfgreatestrelevancetosoilCcyclingisthefindingthatAMFhaveadecreased repertoire of genes encoding for plant cell wall–degrading enzymes,with no genes en-coding cellobiohydrolases or β-1,4-glucosidase. Most gene families acting on hemicellulose andpectin are also missing (Tang et al. 2016), and no genes involved in lignin degradation, such asclassIIperoxidases,havebeenfound(Tisserantetal.2013).WhileAMFspeciesotherthanthosesequenced to date might have a greater genetic capacity for SOM decay, at present only limitedgenomicinformationisavailable,sinceAMFcannotbeculturedwithoutahostplant(Kameletal.2017).WhileAMFapparentlydonothavethecapacityfordirectenzymaticdecayofSOM,thereis increasing evidence that they play a significant role in the indirect mobilization of nutrientsfrom SOM by stimulating the activities of heterotrophic microorganisms (see Section 3.3).UnlikeAMF,EMFhaveevolvedmultipletimesfromadiversegroupofsaprotrophicancestors,including brown-rot, white-rot, and other saprotrophic fungi (Hibbett et al. 2000, Martin et al.2016). Thus, many EMF have the genetic potential to decay SOM to some degree (Zak et al.2019). However, their ability to enzymatically modify SOM is considerably lower than that ofsaprotrophic fungi (Martin et al.2016),and the degree to which individual taxa have retained orlost genes with SOM decay function is dependent on the ancestral precursor from which theyevolved. All EMF species sequenced have a much-reduced complement of genes encoding plantcell wall–degrading enzymes (cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases) and lignin-oxidizing class IIperoxidases compared with saprotrophic fungi (Martin et al. 2008, Strullu-Derrien et al. 2018,Treseder&Lennon2015).However,becausetheyevolvedfromfunctionallydiversesaprotrophicancestors,they have retained distinct suites of lignocellulolytic genes,indicating a diverse abilityto decay SOM enzymatically.

These species have lost the capacity to depolymerize SOMand grow saprotrophically on complex cellulosic substrates (Wolfe et al. 2012). However, thereis evidence that they can oxidize organic matter via a nonenzymatic pathway (see Section 3.2).Although many EMF have lost much of their capacity for efficient SOM decay in comparisonwith saprotrophs, genes mediating SOM decay have been observed in some lineages (Bödekeretal.2009,Kohleretal.2015).Inparticular,thosespeciesmorecloselyrelatedtowhite-rotfungihave multipleclass II peroxidasegenes (Kohler et al.2015) and thushave thegenetic potential tomodify lignocellulose. Several widespread and abundant EMF genera (e.g., Cortinarius ,Russula,Lactarius)possessperoxidasegenes,potentiallyallowingthemtoaccessNsequesteredincomplexpolyphenolic substrates (Bödeker et al.2009,Lindahl & Tunlid 2015).It is also well documentedthatEMFwithenzymaticgeneticcapacitycanproducehydrolyticandoxidativeenzymesandusethoseenzymestodecaySOMandmobilizeandassimilateorganicNinculture(Bending&Read1996,Nicolás et al.2018,Shah et al.2016,Talbot et al.2015).What is less clear is whether thesefungi elicit significant SOM modification under field conditions while in symbiosis, providingsignificant organic N resources to their host.Pellitier & Zak (2018) presented the minimum set of conditions necessary for EMF to enzy-matically access a significant amount of organic N from SOM while in symbiosis: ( a) Genes forlignocellulosedecaymusthavebeenretainedinthegenome,( b)thosegenesmustbeexpressedinroottipsandextraradicalhyphae,( c)transcribedgenesmustoperatetoliberateNfromSOM,and(d) organic N assimilation must be sufficient to significantly influence the nutrient budget of thefungusand/orhost.ThereisevidencethatatleastsomeEMFmeetmostoftheseconditions.Forexample, the genomes of Cortinarius species (e.g., C.glaucopus ) encode a comparable number ofperoxidasesasmanywhite-rotfungi,andtranscriptionof Cortinarius peroxidasegenesunderfieldconditions has been observed to correspond to high peroxidase enzyme activity (Bödeker et al.2014). Additionally, oxidative enzyme activity in this system was significantly reduced when soilwas amended with inorganic N.

Moreover, the extent to which this variablegenetic capacity is realized under field conditions is still unclear.Host and environmental factorslikely interact with taxon-specific genetic capacity to influence the degree to which direct (enzy-maticallycatalyzed)lignocelluloseand/ormicrobialnecromassdecayissignificantlyfacilitatedbymycorrhizal fungi.3.2. Soil Organic Matter Oxidation via Fenton ChemistryIt has been hypothesized that EMF that evolved from brown-rot ancestors have adapted thebrown-rot degradation system involving Fenton chemistry to degrade organic matter–proteincomplexes and mobilize N (Beeck et al.2018).In brown-rot fungi,lignocellulose depolymeriza-tionisinitiatedextracellularlybydestructivehydroxylradicals,producedwhenhydrogenperoxidereactswithferrousiron(Fe2+)(Arantes&Goodell2014).Afterthisinitialhydroxylradicalattack,hydrolytic enzymes further degrade cellulose ( Figure 3 b).Recent research has documented thatthe EMF taxon P. involutus is able to use this mechanism to liberate and assimilate organic Nfrom proteins (Beeck et al.2018; Nicolás et al.2018; Rineau et al.2012,2013; Wang et al.2017).Organic matter decay by P.involutus is a two-step process of oxidation and hydrolysis controlledby C and N availability, with at least four conditions required to elicit organic matter oxidationand organic N assimilation—inorganic N limitation and the presence of a labile C source (e.g.,glucose), a protein source, and iron in its reduced form (Fe2+) (Beeck et al. 2018, Nicolás et al.2018). Thus, it appears that the Fenton oxidation mechanism as employed by this fungus worksin concert with proteolysis, enhancing N liberation from proteins. Unlike saprotrophic fungi,P.involutus does not exhibit expression of genes encoding extracellular enzymes needed to me-tabolizereleasedC(Rineauetal.2013),supportingthehypothesisthatthismechanismisusedtomobilize organic N rather than C. Thus, P.involutus acts as a “coincidental decomposer” (sensuTalbotetal.2008),releasingCasaby-productoforganicNacquisition.Intheprocess, P.involutussecretes substantial amounts ( >10% of new biomass C) of aromatic metabolites that enhance or-ganic matter adsorption onto mineral surfaces (Wang et al.2017),contributing not only to SOMdegradationbutalsotoitsformationandpotentialstabilization(seeSection2.2.2).NotethatthisresearchhasbeendoneprimarilyinpurecultureinthelabwithoneEMFtaxon(i.e., P.involutus )and not while in symbiosis with a host plant. However, if this mechanism is employed by EMFduring symbiosis,it could have important ecosystem-scale implications for C and N cycling.3.3. Mycorrhizal Stimulation of Microbial Decomposition Through CarbonSubsidies to the RhizosphereAs discussed in Section 2.2.1, mycorrhizal extraradical hyphae are a primary sink for plant pho-tosynthatetransferredbelowground.SinceAMFandmanyEMFtaxalackthegeneticcapacitytoefficientlyenzymaticallymineorganicmaterialsfornutrients(seeSection3.1),analternatestrat-egy is to stimulate free-living saprotrophic microbes in the rhizosphere to carry out this function(Kuzyakov2002,2010;Phillipsetal.2012).Thismechanismacceleratesthemineralizationofna-tive SOM by priming the growth and extracellular enzyme production of rhizosphere microbeswith plant C subsidies (i.e., mycorrhizal exudates and necromass).

Priming as a mechanism for mycorrhizalacquisition of nutrients is likely particularly important in soils where N or P availability is low orin systems where these nutrients are bound primarily in complex organic compounds (Dijkstraet al.2013,Orwin et al.2011).TheprimingprocessseemstobeespeciallyimportantforAMF,sincetheseobligatebiotrophslackthegeneticcapacitytodirectlyliberateNandPfromorganicsources(Tisserantetal.2013).AMFhyphaepreferentiallygrowtowardorganicmatterpatcheswhere,onceinapatch,AMFhy-phal growth significantly increases, as does plant nutrient acquisition (Hodge et al. 2001). PlantC is rapidly transferred to AMF hyphae (Kaiser et al. 2015), followed by slower release to rhi-zosphere bacterial and fungal populations (Drigo et al. 2010). This process suggests that AMFhyphaegrowinginorganicmatterpatchesmaycontrolCreleasesimilarlytoaslow-releasefertil-izer, making labile C available to associated microbes in the rhizosphere as nutrients are neededbytheAMFfungusorplant.AMFcolonizationinduces changes inrhizospherebacterial popula-tions,promotes bacterial growth,and stimulates the activities of microbial extracellular enzymestargetingNandPacquisition(Bukovskáetal.2018,Toljanderetal.2007,Vázquezetal.2000).Inparticular,AMF-mediated C release stimulates the growth and activity of phosphate-solubilizingbacteriaintherhizosphere,enhancingthemineralizationoforganicPandincreasingitsavailabil-ity to the fungus (Zhang et al.2016,2018).TheevidencethatEMFhyphaeprimeSOMdecompositionismorecircumstantial.Inanarctictussocktundraecosystem, Cortinarius ,aC-demanding,rhizomorph-formingEMFtaxonthatde-velopsanextensivemycelialnetworkintherhizosphereofcolonizedplants,cantransferplantpho-tosynthate among host plants,and some of this C is accessed by rhizosphere microbes (Deslippeet al.2016).In several recent studies,nearly half of chitinolytic and lignolytic enzyme activity inthe rhizosphere (Brzostek et al.2015) and 80% of the stimulated N mineralization (Zhang et al.2019) were driven by the presence of EMF.However,the degree to which these observations aredue to priming versus direct enzymatic decay of SOM by EMF is unclear.Rhizosphere priming is often assumed to be due primarily to the release of labile exudates;however,primingmayalsoresultfromtheturnoverofmycorrhizalnecromass,stimulatingsapro-trophic microbes in a similar way (Fernandez & Kennedy 2016).A large proportion of C assim-ilated by the bacterial rhizosphere community can be derived from AMF hyphal turnover ratherthanexudates(Drigoetal.2010),suggestinganimportantroleforfungalnecromassintheprim-ingprocess.MicrobesaregenerallyN-rich,andacceleratedturnoverofmicrobialnecromassmayincrease N availability to a greater extent than decomposition of other SOM pools (Phillips et al.2012).Some mycorrhizal fungi also produce organic acids with strong metal-complexing ability.Forexample,oxalicacid,anabundantrhizospherecompound,canstimulateSOMmineralizationby liberating organic compounds from protective associations with soil minerals (Keiluweit et al.2015).Mineral-associated organic matter includes a range of N-rich molecules,and mycorrhizalexudation may influence the mobilization of mineral-associated organic matter by stimulatingmicrobial activity on or near mineral surfaces,stimulating the destabilization and degradation ofmineral-associated SOM while at the same time releasing N and other nutrients (Jilling et al.2018).3.4.

For example, mycorrhizal fungi may parasitize nutrient-rich saprotrophic fungi as analternate resource-acquisition strategy (Fernandez & Kennedy 2016).Although the Gadgil effect is invoked frequently in the literature,there is little direct empir-ical support for it due to methodological limitations. Manipulating root and mycorrhizal abun-dancethroughsoiltrenchingortreegirdlingproducesconfoundingeffects,includingalteredsoilmoisture dynamics and the introduction of a fresh pool of severed roots and fungal hyphae forheterotrophic microbes to utilize.There is also limited consensus on the magnitude or directionof the Gadgil effect across ecosystem types (Fernandez & Kennedy 2016). For example, resultsfrom several recent girdling experiments suggest that ( a) the Gadgil effect is limited to the plantlitter layer (Sterkenburg et al. 2018); ( b) saprotrophic fungi do not exploit the empty niche leftby mycorrhizal fungi after trenching (Sterkenburg et al. 2018); and ( c) the presence of roots andmycorrhizalfungiactuallyacceleratesratherthansuppressesSOMdecompositionviatheprimingmechanism (see Section 3.3),particularly at EMF-dominated sites (Brzostek et al.2015).4. IMPLICATIONS FOR SOIL CARBON DYNAMICSAT THE ECOSYSTEM SCALEThedifferentevolutionaryhistoriesofEMFversusAMFhaveresultedinasuiteofnutrientacqui-sitiontraitsandstrategiesthathaveimplicationsforsoilCcyclingattheecosystemscale,withnu-trient cycling rates and SOM storage differingsignificantly between EMF- and AMF-dominatedecosystems. For example, EMF-colonized trees are associated with leaf litters having higher ra-tios of C to N (Jo et al. 2019, Lin et al. 2017, Read 1991, Zhu et al. 2018) and slower rates ofdecomposition (Cornelissen et al. 2001, Hobbie et al. 2006, Keller & Phillips 2018) comparedwith AMF-associated trees. Plant roots, which are significant contributors to SOM formation,alsodecomposemoreslowlyforEMF-thanAMF-colonizedtrees(Jacobsetal.2018).Totalfun-gal and mycorrhizal extraradical hyphal biomass is higher in EMF-dominated forests (Cheekeet al. 2017), as is the total amount of C stored in mycorrhizal-associated pools (Soudzilovskaiaet al.2015).Nutrient cycles also vary by mycorrhizal type, with EMF-dominated sites typically havinghigherdissolvedorganicCconcentrations(Phillipsetal.2013)andorganicPavailability(Roslinget al. 2016), and lower inorganic N concentrations (Corrales et al. 2016, Lin et al. 2017) andrates of nitrate leaching (Midgley et al.2015).These observations have been synthesized into the250 FreyAnnu.

ES50CH11_Frey ARjats.cls October 21,2019 12:11mycorrhizal-associated nutrient economy (MANE) framework (Phillips et al. 2013), providingan integrated synopsis of how EMF- versus AMF-colonized trees differentially influence C andnutrientcycles.TheoverarchingMANEhypothesisisthatthesetwomycorrhizaltypeselicitfun-damentally different nutrient economies: the EMF organic nutrient economy, with slow C andnutrient cycling, resulting in a limited loss of inorganic nutrients compared with the AMF inor-ganicnutrienteconomy,characterizedbyfastdecompositionofhigh-qualityplantlitterandrapidC and nutrient cycling.While the above observations have been documented mostly for temper-ate forests,emerging evidence suggests that similar dynamics occur in other systems,including asubarctic alpine plant community (Soudzilovskaia et al.2015) and tropical forests (Corrales et al.2016,Waring et al.2016).How MANE dynamics influence SOM storage is less clear, with studies reporting highersoil C concentrations or stocks in EMF-dominated (Averill et al. 2014, Lin et al. 2017, Tayloret al.2016) or AMF-dominated (Craig et al.2018,Jo et al.2019) sites.Other studies have shownno correlation between relative EMF or AMF dominance and soil C (Jo et al. 2019, Zhu et al.2018). These conflicting results may be due to differences in soil depth analyzed. Surface soils(∼0–20cm)inEMF-dominatedsitestendtoexhibitenhancedsoilCrelativetoAMF-dominatedsites (Jo et al.2019,Lin et al.2017,Taylor et al.2016; but see Zhu et al.2018),whereas a recentanalysis of deeper soils showed that AMF-dominated sites store more C to a depth of 1 m (Craigetal.2018;butseeAverilletal.2014).Cross-biomeanalysesalsoyielddifferentresultscomparedwith more localized studies that control for climate and edaphic factors.For example,in a globalanalysis of soil C content to a depth of 1 m, Averill et al. (2014) reported greater C storage inEMF systems, whereas Craig et al. (2018) found a negative correlation between relative EMFdominance and soil C in an analysis of soil C stocks (also to a depth of 1 m) at three midlatitudebroadleaf forests with similar climate.An analysis of three million mycorrhizal trees showed thatthe consequences of differential mycorrhizal association on soil C stocks varies by ecoregion; therelationshipbetweenAMFtreedominanceandsoilCstockispositiveinmesictemperateregionsbut negative in dry regions (Jo et al.2019).As discussed above,AMF and EMF deploy different nutrient acquisition strategies as a resultof their evolutionary history and resultant genetic capacity. A general supposition is that AMF,because of their inability to produce extracellular SOM-degrading enzymes, scavenge mineralnutrients, as they are dependent on and even enhance SOM decomposition by free-living rhi-zosphere saprotrophs (i.e., rhizosphere priming; see Section 3.3). EMF, in contrast, mine nutri-ents from SOM either directly (i.e.,through enzymatic breakdown; see Section 3.1) or indirectly(i.e.,oxidation via Fenton chemistry),potentially leaving C-rich,nutrient-poor substrates behind(Lambers et al. 2008, Orwin et al. 2011). The effect of these two different nutrient-acquiringstrategies(i.e.,scavengingversusmining)onSOMstoragedependsonhowtheydifferentiallyaf-fectSOMstabilizationversusdestabilization.Onthesurface,theAMFscavengingstrategymightbe expected to drive soil C loss as the activities of heterotrophic microbes are stimulated. ThishypothesisissupportedbytheobservationthatAMF-associatedCinputsstimulatedhigherratesofdecomposeractivityandsoilCloss(Wurzburger&Brookshire2017).However,labileplantCinputs and microbial by-products are now known to be important precursors of stable SOM thatbecome protected within soil aggregates and through association with mineral surfaces (Cotrufoet al.2013).Thus,an alternative prediction is that a scavenging strategy promotes the formationof stable SOM,consistent with the observation that concentrations of amino sugars (an index ofmicrobiallyderivedSOM)andNinmineral-associatedorganicmatterwerepositivelycorrelatedwith AMF tree dominance (Craig et al. 2018). Additionally, some studies suggest that primingis more important in EMF- versus AMF-dominated systems (Brzostek et al. 2015, Sulman et al.2017) and that the activities of N- and P-acquiring enzymes are greater at EMF- compared withwww.annualreviews.org MycorrhizalFungiandSoilCarbon 251Annu.

However, reduced extracellular enzyme activities have also beenobserved when EMF are reduced or removed from the soil (Kaiser et al.2010,Kyaschenko et al.2017).Thus,the nutrient acquisition activities of EMF,like those of AMF,could either stimulatedecomposition and soil C loss (e.g.,Baskaran et al.2017) or facilitate the stabilization of more Con mineral surfaces and within soil aggregates.Mycorrhizalfungiareperhapsthebest-studiedgroupofsoilorganisms,yetourunderstandingis limited as to how their presence and activities ultimately affect soil C cycling.
