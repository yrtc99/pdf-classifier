Each of the above phenomena provide a sink for these surplus carbohy -drates, thereby preventing feedback inhibition of pho -tosynthesis, and perpetuating the influx of C. Because these processes incur little cost to the source plant, they need not provide a benefit beyond the removal of surplus carbohydrates.Keywords  Root exudates · Belowground carbon flux · Extra-floral nectaries · Living stumps · Alternative oxidase pathwayUnder common environmental conditions such as deficiencies of water, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), or low temperatures, aboveground plant growth is curtailed at an earlier stage of deficiency than is photosynthesis, and during this phase, leaves pro -duce more photo-assimilates than they are able to use for primary metabolism (Prescott et  al. 2020 ). This ‘surplus carbon’ phase occurs prior to the onset of severe or prolonged deficiencies which constrain photosynthesis (Körner 2013 ; Prescott et  al. 2020 , 2021 ). Nonstructural carbohydrates (soluble sugars and starch) also accumulate under high light intensity and elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, if growth is constrained by availability of water or nutrients (Sugiura et al.  2019 ; Prescott et al. 2020 ). Accumu -lation of carbohydrates is a key trigger for leaves to Abstract  Plants engag e in many processes and relationships that appear to be wasteful of the high-energy compounds that they produce through carbon fixation and photosynthesis. For example, living trees keep leafless tree stumps alive ( i.e. respiring) and support shaded understory trees by sharing carbohy -drates through root grafts or mycorrhizal fungal net -works. Plants exude a diverse array of organic com -pounds from their roots and leaves, which support abundant rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiomes. Some plants release substantial amounts of sugar via extra-floral nectaries, which enrich throughfall and alter lichen communities beneath the canopy. Large amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon are trans -ferred to root associates such as mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing micro-organisms. Plants also respire fixed C through an alternative pathway that does not generate ATP. Rates of each of these processes appear to be highest when plants are growing under mild-to-moderate deficiencies of nutrients or water.

This has been demonstrated by shading some of the leaves on a plant, which can prevent down-regulation of photo -synthesis (Pieters et  al. 2001 ) or may even increase photosynthetic rates in unshaded leaves (McCormick et  al. 2006 ). Therefore, the presence of active sinks for surplus carbohydrates can cause plants to main -tain rapid rates of photosynthesis when aboveground growth is restricted by resource supply. Several poten -tial sinks for surplus carbohydrates exist (in addition to growth), including organs, physiological processes, and other organisms (either internal or external to the plant) that take up the surplus plant metabolites. In essence, any process that draws surplus carbohy -drates away from sites of accumulation may serve as a sink under conditions of surplus C. Sinks for plant surplus carbohydrates may be behind several physi -ological and ecological phenomena that are difficult to explain, except through the lens of surplus C. Here, I discuss a few of these phenomena (alternative oxi -dase pathway, plant secondary metabolism, extra-flo -ral nectaries, living stumps, and root exudates) with special emphasis on forest ecosystems and a few of the many scientific contributions of Hans Lambers to our understanding of plant physiological and ecologi -cal processes.Alternative Oxidase Respiratory PathwayLambers ( 1980 ) investigated a non-phosphorylating respiratory pathway within plant mitochondria, which is not coupled to the production of ATP. Following analysis of experimental evidence, he concluded that the alternative pathway functions as an energy over -flow to oxidize excess sugars (and NADH) that are not required for growth, maintenance, osmoregula -tion or storage. This ‘Alternative Oxidase Pathway’ (AOX) prevents the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain which would otherwise damage proteins, lipids and DNA (Lambers and Oliveira 2019 ). Alternative oxi -dase activity increases when carbon (NADH) sup -plies are plentiful and electron flow is restricted, which occurs under conditions such as high light intensity, prolonged water deficit, low temperature, low P supply or high  CO2 concentration (Millenaar and Lambers 2003 ; Del-Saz et al. 2018 ; Selinski et al. 2018 ). These are also the conditions under which sur -plus fixed C is generated (Prescott et al. 2020 ), sup -porting the suggestion that under these environmen -tal conditions, plants produce more carbohydrates through photosynthesis than they require for their pri -mary metabolism at that time.Secondary Plant MetabolitesLambers ( 1993 ) explored the influence of plant ‘excess carbon’ in determining concentrations of sec -ondary plant metabolites, particularly phenolic com -pounds, in leaves. He noted that there was already a wealth of evidence that under nutrient- or water-limiting conditions, plants accumulate non-structural carbohydrates and produce more secondary metabo -lites of a phenolic nature. Two metabolic mechanisms explain this accumulation of secondary metabolites: sucrose levels increasing beyond those needed for protein synthesis, and insufficient N to convert phe -nylalanine into protein, causing more of the pheny -lalanine to be diverted into pathways that generate phenolic compounds. Based on this ‘excess carbon’ hypothesis, Lambers ( 1993 ) predicted that elevated  CO2 would only increase concentrations of second -ary metabolites in plants if the higher  CO2 concen -tration was not matched by increased uptake of nutri -ents or water. This prediction has been borne out in studies reporting negative correlations between levels of C-based secondary metabolites and N concentra -tions of plants exposed to high  CO2 (Wu et al. 2011 ; Ibrahim and Jaafar 2012 ), and heightened effects of elevated  CO2 on secondary metabolite levels in plants grown at low nutrient availability (Julkunen-Tiitto et al. 1993 ; Lavola and Julkunen-Tiitto 1994 ). The effect appears to be specific to a deficiency of N and limited to concentrations of phenylpropanoid-derived compounds (not hydrolyzable tannins or ter -penoids) (Koricheva  1998 ). Along a 2-million-year soil-development chronosequence in south-western Australia, phenolics accumulated in plants growing on young soils in which N was limiting for primary productivity, but not on old soils, where P was limit -ing and silica accumulated (de Tombeur et al. 2021 ). Secondary metabolism also produces excess reducing equivalents, which can be oxidized through the AOX Plant Soil (2022) 476:689–698 6911 3Vol.: (0123456789)pathway (Sakano 2001 ). These findings support sur -plus fixed C as a causative link between nutrient defi -ciency, secondary metabolism and the AOX pathway.Starch granulesYoung western hemlock trees on northern Vancouver Island are deficient in N and P, with chlorotic foliage and slow growth (Prescott et al. 2013 ). Transmission electron microscopy of their needles revealed that a single large starch grain occupied 80% of the cross-sectional area of the chloroplasts (Fig. S1). The thy -lakoid membranes appeared to be mechanically dis -torted and the number of thylakoid membranes per granum stack was reduced relative to that in trees that had been fertilized with N and P (White  2001 ). Starch accumulates in chloroplasts of P-deficient plants and, like sucrose production in the cytosol, is attributed to the production of fixed C in excess of that required by the plant, i.e. when adequate sinks are not avail -able (Hurewitz and Janes 1983 ; Fredeen et al. 1989 ). Accumulation of large, irregularly shaped starch grains that distorted grana stacks were also reported in response to elevated  CO2 (Cave et  al. 1981 ), fur -ther supporting a link to surplus fixed C. Starch is usually considered to function as an energy store for the plant, but C availability is unlikely to constrain production in nutrient-deficient trees. It is more likely that large accumulations of starch in leaves function as sinks where surplus carbohydrates can accumu -late without osmotic consequences (Prescott et  al. 2020 ). Cell-wall thickening as also been proposed as a mechanism by which plants consume surplus carbo -hydrates (Sugiura et al. 2020 ).Extra‑floral nectariesIn sub-boreal spruce forests in British Columbia, foliose lichens with cyanobacterial bionts are dis -proportionately abundant and species-rich on coni -fer saplings beneath Populus  trees (Campbell et al. 2010 ). The abundance of these lichens was linked to the fungal biont receiving sugars washed from poplar leaves (Campbell et  al. 2013 ). These exog -enous sugars allow the fungus to survive extended dry periods during which the cyanobacteria cannot produce sugars to support the symbiosis (Campbell et al. 2013 ). Populus  species are among the 1–2 % of vascular plant species that produce extra-floral nectaries (EFN) at the base of their leaves (Weber and Keeler 2013 ). Extrafloral nectaries are plant glands that secrete sugar, water and amino-acids (Weber and Keeler 2013 ). High concentrations of saccharides have been measured in leaf wash and throughfall in Populus  stands (Wildman and Parkin -son 1981 ; Sanborn and Pawluk 1983 ). The sugars released from EFNs and removed via leaf wash may be surplus carbohydrates from leaves. Several lines of evidence support this interpretation: 1) leach -ing of carbohydrates from leaves is greatest during periods of high light intensity (Tukey et  al.  1957 ; Bixenmann et al.  2010 ); 2) sugar is imported from older leaves into young leaves that generate EFNs (Radhika et  al. 2008 ); and 3) rainfall washes the existing accumulation of sugar from the leaf surface and stimulates further release from EFNs (Trelease 1881 , cited in Campbell et  al. 2013 ). The finding that sugar release from EFN increases at the begin -ning of the rainy season (Calixto et al. 2021 ) could also result from sugar removal via rain stimulating its release from EFN. Phylloplane bacteria may also be an important sink for sugars and other metabo -lites released from leaves (Rodger and Blakeman 1984 , Mercier and Lindow 2000 ) (Fig.  1).Extra-floral nectaries are usually interpreted as adaptations for plant defense in that they entice invertebrates such as ants or wasps to act as “pugna -cious bodyguards” (Bentley 1977 ) that protect the plants from herbivores (Koptur 1992 ). However, observations are not always consistent with this interpretation of the ‘purpose’ of EFNs. For exam -ple, in Populus tremuloides  trees, concentrations of phenolic glycosides, which deter insect feeding, were about 30% greater on leaves bearing EFNs than on leaves without EFNs (Young et  al. 2010 ). This observation required a rather convoluted expla -nation on the basis of plant defenses, but is not unexpected when viewed through a surplus C lens, as both sugar exudation and elevated concentra -tions of secondary metabolites are expected under plant growth-limiting conditions (Prescott et  al. 2020 ). The finding that nectar production by EFNs is stimulated by phloem-sucking insects but not by mechanical damage by other insects (Escalante-Perez et al.  2012 ) also indicates strong sink control of nectar production in EFNs.Plant Soil (2022) 476:689–698 6921 3Vol:. (1234567890)Belowground carbon fluxUp to half of the photosynthate produced by plants may be transported to belowground organs (Högberg and Högberg 2002 ; Pausch and Kuzyakov 2018 ), depending on environmental conditions. Much of it is used for root growth and maintenance or is stored, but 10-44% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is excreted by roots or transferred to mycorrhizal fungi (Bais et  al. 2006 ; Pausch and Kuzyakov 2018 ). The C exuded from roots or from associated mycorrhizal fungi supports a large component of the soil biota, including micro-organisms and invertebrates (Pol -lierer et  al. 2007 ; Drigo et  al. 2008 , Yarwood et  al. 2009 ). Half or more of the soil activity in forests may be driven by photosynthate that is transported to myc -orrhizal fungi and root-associated microbes within a few days of being fixed (Högberg et al. 2008 ). Why do trees export so much photosynthate to the below -ground ecosystem?The proportion of fixed C transported below -ground is related to the relative availabilities of C versus growth-limiting resources (N, P or water). In forests with high nutrient availability, a greater Fig. 1  Sink s for surplus plant carbon generated when growth is constrained by availability of N, P or water. In the leaves, surplus carbohydrates can be stored as starch granules in chloroplasts, transformed into secondary metabolites, respired via phosphorylat-ing or alternative oxidase pathways (AOP), or exuded via extra-floral nectaries. On leaf surfaces, com-pounds can be removed via precipitation, assimilated by bacteria or consumed by insects. Surplus carbohy-drates transported to roots can be stored, respired, exuded and assimilated by rhizosphere bacteria, or transferred to endobionts such as  N2-fixing micro-organisms or mycorrhizal fungiPlant Soil (2022) 476:689–698 6931 3Vol.: (0123456789)proportion of the photosynthates produced annually is used for plant biomass production, compared with forests with low nutrient availability (58% vs 42% in a synthesis of 49 forests; Vicca et al. 2012 ). Increasing availability of C but not nutrients (via  CO2 enrich -ment) often induces a C allocation shift towards belowground compartments (meta-analysis by Diele -man et al. 2010 ). In the sweetgum stand at the ORNL free-air  CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, the only increases in NPP in elevated  CO2 plots (after the first year) were in fine-root production (Iversen et  al.  2008 ; Norby et  al. 2021 ). They attributed this to progressive N limitation in the stand (Norby et al. 2010 ), which is consistent with the generation and belowground transport of surplus C under nutrient-deficient conditions. In a hardwood forest at the Swiss FACE experiment, elevated  CO2 did not increase aboveground growth or respiration, but did increase C transport to below-ground sinks, as indicated by C transfer to ectomycorrhiza and neighbouring trees and by increased C export to soil (Klein et al.  2016a ). In the loblolly pine stand at the Duke free-air  CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, elevated  CO2 con -ditions led to increases in total belowground C flux, root production, biomass and respiration, exudation and fungal allocation, microbial biomass, hetero -trophic respiration and soil  CO2 efflux (Drake et  al. 2011 ). Increasing soil N availability through N fertili -zation reduced the belowground C flux in both ambi -ent and elevated  CO2 plots (Drake et al. 2011 ).In boreal pine forests, aboveground productivity is strongly limited by N and about 50% of tree pho -tosynthate is transferred belowground and respired from the soil (Högberg and Högberg 2002 ). Nitrogen additions to a boreal pine forest reduced the flux of tree photosynthate to roots and soil biota, including ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, by as much as 60% (Högberg et al. 2010 ). Belowground C flux returned to pre-fertilization levels after N additions ceased, coincident with increased abundance of mycorrhizal fungi (Högberg et al. 2011 ). Belowground C flux (as a proportion of gross primary productivity, GPP) also increases under conditions of high light (Smith and Reynolds 2015 ), elevated  CO2 (Jackson et  al. 2009 ; Drake et al. 2011 ) or reduced availability of P (Keith et  al. 1997 ) or water (Stape et  al. 2008 ; Preece and Peñuelas 2016 ; Hasibeder et  al. 2015 ; Ledo et  al. 2018 ). These observations are consistent with the amount of plant C transported belowground being strongly influenced by the amount of surplus fixed C in plant leaves. Indeed, the rapid (1-day) link between GPP and respiration from roots and mycorrhizal fungi in forests prompted Heinemeyer et  al. ( 2007 ) to propose that the mycorrhizal  CO2 flux compo -nent represents an overflow ‘CO2 tap’ through which surplus plant carbon can be returned directly to the atmosphere.A strong seasonal pattern of photosynthate fluxes in boreal pine forests was also noted by Högberg et al. (2010 ). Belowground flux of photosynthate in August was 500% greater than that in June. They attributed this to developing leaves being a sink for fixed C early in the growing season (Horwath et al. 1994 ; Kagawa et al. 2006 ). Once leaves had fully expanded and no longer served as a sink, the fixed C was translocated belowground, much of it to mycorrhizal fungi. Sporo -carp production of ECM fungi was totally dependent on recent photosynthate in the late season. This late-summer flux of surplus photosynthate may underly the autumn peak in sporocarp production in boreal forests. Mycorrhizal fungi may therefore function as an alternate sink for surplus carbohydrates once leaf expansion is complete.Living stumps and carbon sharing among living treesLeafless tree stumps, which are nevertheless ‘alive’ in the sense that they respire, have been observed in many forests. These stumps have a living root sys -tem, which is connected to that of other trees through root grafts and/or mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. These connections give them access to carbohydrates from the root systems of living trees, which sustains the remaining tissues of the leafless tree (Bader and Leuzinger 2019 ). Evolutionary rationales for the liv -ing plants investing carbohydrates in non-photosyn -thesizing neighbors are challenging, but it has been suggested that the stumps provide an extended root system for mechanical stability and uptake of water and nutrients (Bormann 1966 , Keeley 1988 , but see Loehle and Jones  1990 ). Alternatively, living stumps may result from surplus carbohydrates from living trees traveling to them through the phloem of con -nected roots, driven by the difference in hydrostatic pressure provided by phloem unloading and respira -tion in the surviving tissues of the stump tree. Sharing Plant Soil (2022) 476:689–698 6941 3Vol:. (1234567890)of surplus carbon does not entail a cost to the source tree, so this explanation does not require there to be a benefit to the living trees of maintaining a non-living neighbor.Transfer of carbohydrates among living  trees through root grafts (Fraser et  al. 2006 ) or mycor -rhizal fungi (Simard et al. 1997 ; Klein et al., 2016b ) has received considerable attention. Carbon fluxes have been traced from source trees growing in full light to sink trees growing in low light conditions (Fraser et  al. 2006 ; Teste et  al. 2009 ). The adaptive ‘purpose’ of the transfers through common mycor -rhizal networks has been explained through kin selec -tion, as neighboring trees have a high probability of being related (Gorzelak et  al. 2015 ). Alternatively, these fluxes may represent the movement of plant sur -plus carbohydrates along pressure gradients through roots and fungal hyphae driven by phloem loading in source trees and phloem unloading in sink trees. Sharing surplus carbohydrates with sink trees is of little cost to the source tree (Corrêa et al. 2012 ), and may actually benefit the source tree by providing a sink for surplus photo-assimilates.Carboxylate exudationRoots of plants growing under conditions of low P availability often exude more carboxylates, especially organic anions such as citrate and malate (Lambers et  al. 2011 , 2013 ). In the rhizosphere, carboxylates compete with inorganic and organic P for binding sites which increases the availability of P for plant uptake (Lambers et al. 2011 ). Release of carboxylates is therefore widely considered to be part of a P-acqui -sition strategy that allows plants to survive in low-P environments (Lambers et al. 2006 , 2011 ). However, several observations are inconsistent with this inter -pretation, such as increased carboxylate exudation at low N availability (Zhu et al. 2016 ) and inconsistent relationships between rates of carboxylate release and both P uptake and plant growth (Huang et al. 2017 ; He et al.  2021 ; Wang and Lambers 2020 ). Carboxy -late exudation by roots of alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ) growing in an alkaline soil low in both N and P was studied by He et al. ( 2020 , 2021 ). Root exudation of carboxylates (particularly tartrate) decreased with increasing P availability but also increased exponen -tially with increasing shoot N concentration. The closer association of root carboxylate release with N than with P concentration prompted He et al. ( 2021 ) to suggest that N addition resulted in increased pro -duction of photosynthates, which could not be used for primary metabolism and growth due to the lack of P, and so were discharged as carboxylates.Metabolite profiling of root exudates (as well as of shoots and roots) of P-deficient and P-sufficient plants also supports the hypothesis that root exudates can be a means of removing surplus metabolites. Relative to P-sufficient soybean plants, root exudates of P-defi -cient plants had higher concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids, and lower concen -trations of phosphate esters (Tawaraya et  al. 2014 ). Shoot and root extracts of P-deficient plants also had low levels of P-containing metabolites such as aden -osine 5’-monophosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate and elevated concentrations of adenine, cytosine and adenosine, reflecting inhibition of nucleotide synthe -sis induced by P starvation. Remobilization of P from phosphate esters is common in P-deficient plants (Tawaraya et  al. 2014 ). The higher concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates such as organic acids in root exudates from P-deficient plants may be a con -sequence of their accumulation in root cells as sur -plus metabolites. Plants exposed to very low P supply have very low concentrations of Pi and ADP which restricts the cytochrome pathway and causes TCA-cycle intermediates such as organic acids – espe -cially citrate – to accumulate (Selinski et  al. 2018 ). Increased carbon supply for organic acid synthesis in the TCA cycle in P-deficient roots has been dem -onstrated through transcriptome (Wasaki et al. 2003 ; Li et  al. 2010 ) and proteome (Fukuda et  al. 2007 ) analysis; this would lead to higher concentrations of organic acids in P-deficient roots (Tawaraya et al. 2014 ). Therefore, a primary function of organic acid exudation may be the disposal of surplus metabolites. Particular morphological and physiological traits such as releasing carboxylates in exudative bursts from specialized structures such as cluster roots or dauci -form roots are more likely adaptations for P acquisi -tion (Lambers et al. 2006 ).The belowground ecosystemThe abundant microorganisms in the plant rhizos -phere provide a large and dynamic sink for surplus Plant Soil (2022) 476:689–698 6951 3Vol.: (0123456789)plant metabolites. The low-molecular-weight organic compounds exuded from roots are rapidly taken up and transformed by rhizosphere bacteria (Treonis et al. 2004 ; Ostle et al. 2003 ; Kaštovská and Santruck -ova 2007 ), which are grazed by rhizosphere protists (Gao et al. 2019 ; Ceja-Navarro et al. 2021 ) and fur -ther transformed through the soil food web (Pollierer et al. 2007 ). As a result, exudates in the soil solution have turnover times in the order of minutes or hours (Nguyen, 2009 ; Butler et  al. 2004 ). This maintains a steep concentration gradient immediately outside root tips, which promotes exudation (Canarini et  al. 2019 ) and generates a strong sink for plant C. Root microbionts can also stimulate photosynthesis, as evi -dent in the faster photosynthetic rates of plants inocu -lated with rhizobia and/or mycorrhizal fungi (Wright et al. 1998 ; Kaschuk et al. 2009 ) and the decline in photosynthesis rates following removal of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Gavito et al. 2019 ). These obser -vations are consistent with root microbionts serving as active carbohydrate sinks, which prevents the accu -mulation of surplus carbohydrates and attendant sup -pression of photosynthesis in source leaves.ConclusionsThe physiological and ecological phenomena dis -cussed in this paper are challenging to explain if fixed C is invariably viewed as a scarce resource that plants must use efficiently. However, under conditions such as mild-to-moderate deficiencies of N, P or water that reduce leaf growth more so than photosynthesis, plants tend to produce more fixed C than they can use at that time. Accumulation of surplus fixed C in the absence of the growth sink can generate photo-oxi -dative damage and induce end-product inhibition of photosynthesis, but these outcomes are prevented by the activities of multiple alternative sinks for fixed C such as the alternative oxidase pathway, starch syn -thesis, secondary metabolites, extra-floral nectaries, root exudation and mycorrhizal fungi. Activities of these sinks increase under the same conditions that result in generation of surplus C (mild-to-moderate deficiencies of N, P or water and high light and  CO2). Under these conditions, C ‘allocated’ to these sinks is not really an ‘investment’ as it does not entail a cost to the plant. Instead, these phenomena can be viewed as downstream consequences of C flow from sites of accumulation to sites of removal.Acknowledgements  The ar ticle celebrates the curiosity, ana -lytical rigor, and intellectual nimbleness to adapt one’s thinking when presented with new evidence that are hallmarks of Pro -fessor Hans Lambers.
