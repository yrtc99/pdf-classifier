Soil microbial community (SMC) play a major role in C cycling and their activity has been con-sidered as the main driver of differences in the potential to store C in soils. The composition of the SMC is crucial for themaintenance of soil ecosystem services, as the structure and activity of SMC also regulates the turnover and delivery ofnutrients, as well as the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Quantifying the impact of agriculturalpractices on both SMC and SCS is key to improve sustainability of soil management. Hence, we discuss the impactof farming practices improving SCS by altering SMC, SOM, and soil aggregates, unraveling their inter-and intra-relationships. Using quantitative and process driven insights from 197 peer-reviewed publications leads to the conclu-sion that the net bene ﬁts from agricultural management to improve SCS would not be sustainable if we overlook therole of soil microbial community. Reintroduction of the decayed microbial community to agricultural soils is crucial forenhancing long-term C storage potential of soils and stabilize them over time. The interactions among SMC, SOM, soilaggregates, and agricultural activities still require more knowledge and research to understand their full contributionto the SCS.Keywords:Soil organic matterOrganic carbonCarbon sequestrationSoil microbial communityAgricultural practicesMicrobial biomass carbonExtracellular polymeric substancesScience of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 152928Abbreviations: AMF, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; C, Carbon; CC, Cover cropping; CR, Crop rotation; CT, Conventional tillage; CUE, Carbon use ef ﬁciency; EEG, Easily extractable glomalin;EPS, Extracellular polymeric substances; FDA, Fluorescein diacetate; MBC, Microbial biomass carbon; MBN, Microbial biomass nitrogen; NT, No-til lage system; OM, Organic matter; PLFA,Phospholipid fatty acid; POC, Particulate organic carbon; RPE, Rhizosphere priming effect; RT, Reduced tillage; SCS, Soil carbon sequestration; S MC, Soil microbial community; SOC, Soil organiccarbon; SOM, Soil organic matter; ST, Strip tillage; TG, Total glomalin; WSA, Water stable aggregates.⁎Corresponding authors.E-mail addresses: haﬁz.iqbal@tec.mx (H.M.N.

IntroductionSoil carbon sequestration (SCS) has become one of the popular methodsfor capturing and storing atmospheric Carbon (C) into soils for a longertime ( Lal, 2004 ;Schlesinger and Amundson, 2019 ;De Stefano andJacobson, 2018 ;Liang et al., 2019a ). Different methods or improvised agri-cultural operations for increasing SCS have been proposed. For instance,grassland settlement in abandoned and deteriorated agricultural ﬁelds,no-tillage (NT) systems, crop rotation, fertilization and organic amend-ments, and cover cropping (CC) may lead to systems increasing soil C stocks(Yang et al., 2019a ;Francaviglia et al., 2017 ;Cha-un et al., 2017 ;Coonanet al., 2019 ;Tautges et al., 2019 ;Luan et al., 2021 ). However, the effective-ness of these practices highly rely on microbial activities ( Peigné et al.,2007 ), and hence the role of the soil microbial community (SMC) shouldbe understood to develop and adopt effective agronomic measures forSCS. Their key role in regulating C stocks and ﬂuxes, and their interactionwith soil particles, is however often overlooked. Needless to say, the micro-bial community is the most important regulator of soil C cycling, C biogeo-chemical cycles ( Beauregard et al., 2010 ;Hartmann et al., 2015 ;Khatoonet al., 2017 ;Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020 ). Microbial diversity and bio-mass alter rhizosphere processes and determine the long-term viability ofagricultural lands, in particular for carbon dynamics ( Hartmann et al.,2015 ). Intensi ﬁcation of agriculture has substantially impacted the sizeand composition of SMC thereby altering the processes driving C sequestra-tion ( Kallenbach et al., 2019 ;Wallenstein, 2017 ). Selecting appropriate ag-ronomic measures to increase C stocks require insights in the interplaybetween management, rhizosphere dynamics and the intermediating roleof SMC.Numerous studies have shown that cover cropping, organic amend-ments, tillage practices and crop diversi ﬁcation affects both soil functioningand microbial communities ( Beauregard et al., 2010 ;Kim et al., 2020 ).Combining diverse crop rotation schemes (corn-cotton) along with ma-nures (broiler litter) may yield in stable aggregates and higher microbialbiomass in silty clay loam soils ( Adeli et al., 2009 ). Reduced tillage (RT)and no tillage practices (NT) may increase arbuscular mycorrhizal spores(AMF) and dehydrogenase enzymatic activity ( Celik et al., 2011 )w h e r e a sLi et al. (2020) showed in a global meta-analysis that changing conven-tional to no till systems could increase total phospholipid fatty acid(PLFA) by 11%, fungal PLFA by 17%, and total microbial biomass by 4%.How these changes in soil microbial community affect the net C sequestra-tion however is still unclear.Earlier studies showed that microbial biomass, soil aggregate stabilityand SCS are interrelated ( Garcia-Franco et al., 2015 ). Stable soil aggregatesare needed to increase C stocks and their stability is enhanced by the plantleaf litter or root deposits with a phenolic and lignin composition ( Blanco-Canqui and Lal, 2004 ;Liu et al., 2019 ). Soils with higher levels of macro-aggregates have more potential to sequester carbon ( Luan et al., 2021 )since they protect C from decomposition by physical and chemicalprocesses ( Cantón et al., 2009 ;Murugan et al., 2019 ;Wilpiszeski et al.,2019 ), determine 80% of SCS in karst soils ( Liu et al., 2019 ) and areidenti ﬁed as the main factor controlling SCS in black soils of China(Zheng et al., 2018 ). Macroaggregate formation is coupled with SMC activ-ities and both regulate 82% of the variation in SOC storage ( Zhang et al.,2018 ). Agricultural operations often tend to decrease the persistence ofsoil aggregates, also mod i f y i n gt h eS M Cs t r u c t u r e( Kraut-Cohen et al.,2020 ). Since the microbial community structure also regulates nutrientturnover and supply, as well as SOM decomposition rates, the microbialcommunity has been identi ﬁed as critical driver for the conservation ofsoil ecosystem services ( Nsabimana et al., 2004 ). Likewise, microbialnecromass is gaining attention because of its high capability of produc-ing stabilized SOM and stable C ( Ma et al., 2018 ;Buckeridge et al.,2020 ).Kallenbach et al. (2016) concluded higher amounts of SOMmight be linked with fungal abundance and microbial biomass insteadof mineral composition of soil. This stabilization might be linked with“bacterial and fungal cell wall envelopes ”(Miltner et al., 2012 ). Allthese aforementioned studies demonstrate the irreplaceable role ofSMC in maintaining the optimum level of C in agricultural soils(Fig. 1 ), and hence a deeper understanding of the effects of agriculturalp r a c t i c e so nS M Ca n dt h e i ri m p a c t on SCS is needed to identify thosepractices that have a persistent effect on soil organic carbon dynamics(Frasier et al., 2016 ).This paper reviews existing knowledge on the role of soil microbialcommunity on the fate of soil carbon in response to agronomic measures.We hypothesize that optimizing soil and nutrient management for carbonsequestration (while stimulating co-bene ﬁts for agronomic and environ-ment) requires foremost insights in the role of the soil microbial communitystructure and their response to management practices applied. Manage-ment practices stimulating microb ial communities to form soil aggre-gates, to alter their feeding strat egies, and to reduce their accessto carbon and nutrients might enhance the carbon sequestrationpotential.The literatures used in this study were collected, synthesized andcollated from previous studies appeared in peer-reviewed journals.Search engines used for literature searching were “Web of Science,“Scopus ”,“Google scholar ”and search keywords include “soil organicmatter ”AND “soil microbial community ”or“agricultural soils and soilbiota ”or“Conventional tillage ”;“soil carbon*, SOM and MBC ”etc.Peer reviewed studies include i) long- and short- term ﬁeld researches,and ii) meta-analyses. Throughout the study, we used following de ﬁni-tions: climate (Köppen-Geiger classi ﬁcation), soil type (sand, clay,loam), crop type (arable and grasslands), and duration of effects(short-term and long-term).S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 15292822. Role of the soil microbial community in soil organic matterdynamics2.1. Microbial origin of SOMFor many years, soil organic matter (SOM) formation was thought to berelated to plant inputs and their composition. Stable SOM is derived from re-calcitrant complex plant polymers, such as lignin derivatives and long-chainlipids ( Berg and McClaugherty, 2020 ). This paradigm ignored the fact thatsoil microorganisms are capable of degrading a wide range of plant com-pounds as long as they accessible and abiotic factors are favorable for car-bon synthesis in their biomass ( Paul, 2016 ). With advances in moleculartechniques and a conceptual shift from plant-based concepts, the role ofsoil microbial communities (SMCs) in association with C accessibility hasgained widespread acceptance ( Lehmann and Kleber, 2015 ;Paul, 2016 ).SOM accumulation might even be more controlled by distinct microbialcommunities than by clay mineralogy ( Kallenbach et al., 2015 )a n dm i c r o -bial biomass residues (necromass) might even serve as a primer stabilizingSOM, leading to the conclusion that SOC storage is heavily in ﬂuenced by an-abolic activities of microorganisms, emphasizing that the most persistent or-ganic matter may not be composed of plant litter or their residues butcarbon that has ﬁrst passed through microbial biomass ( Liang et al., 2019b ).The viability of soil microorganisms depends largely on organic matterquality and availability ( Nguyen and Marschner, 2016 ). If substrates start torun out or their supply is interrupted, SMC may enter a dormant state bytaking up spore forms, or they die, thus reducing their biomass, as con-ﬁrmed by laboratory experiments ( Shahbaz et al., 2017 ). After cell death,organic compounds contribute to microbial necromass, and this necromasscan make up more than half of soil organic carbon ( Miltner et al., 2012 ;Liang et al., 2019a ;Fig. 2 ).Necromass formation strongly depends on the composition of the SMC.Microbial populations use one of three main life strategies indirectlycontrolling their potential to sequester carbon in soil: r-, K- and L-strategies,with the composition and size of the active fraction depending on environ-mental conditions ( Swift et al., 1979 ). The L-strategy is considered stresstolerant, the K-strategy is considered slow and ef ﬁcient growth in almostall environments, and the r-strategy is considered to grow rapidly in favor-able environments but to decline rapidly under any constraints. The abilityto rapidly increase growth rates enables microorganism with r-strategies tocompete with others and to rapidly rebuild populations when fresh substrateis introduced. But under unfavourable conditions, r-strategies do not main-tain their population but activate biom ass reduction mechanisms (autolysis)to producing necromass ( Miltner et al., 2012 ) ,w h i c hs e r v e sa ss u b s t r a t ef o rsurviving microorganisms ( Bradley et al., 2018 ;Shahbaz et al., 2017 ).Thus, r-strategies represent a microbial functional group with great potentialto accelerate SOM decomposition. The formation of necromass allowsmicroorganisms to survive when the energy supply to the environment isreduced, i.e. in a closed system where no fresh matter appears ( Shoemakeret al., 2021 ).Studies using molecular biomarkers (sugars, amino sugars, proteins andlipids) show that SMC is the source of organic compounds stabilized in SOMin the long term ( Schimel and Schaeffer, 2012 ;Derrien et al., 2006 ;Lianget al., 2019b ). Importantly, microbial metabolism of relatively simple Csubstrates (e.g. root exudates) can manifest SOM chemical heterogeneity,similar to that in soils under complex plant communities ( Castle et al.,2016 ). Using microbial biomarkers, such as amino sugars or phospholipidfatty acids ( Joergensen, 2018 ;Condron et al., 2010 ), some suggested thatit may be possible to manipulate some SMC groups to control SOM forma-tion ( Jastrow et al., 2007 ;Liang et al., 2019a ). Field research has shownthat higher plant diversity results in higher soil C levels, being explainedFig. 1. Conceptual schematic representation of soil microbial communities' relationship with different soil C pools.S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 1529283by rhizosphere induced changes in SMC. Above ground plant diversity wasindeed correlated with higher microbial necromass biomarkers andarbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomarkers ( Liang et al., 2016 ;Malik et al.,2016 ).The microbial growth strategies of SMC groups are in ﬂuenced by abi-otic factors and soil quality ( Maharjan et al., 2017 ) suggesting that climate,land use, and soil and nutrient management affect microbial growth andthe decomposition and stabilization rates of necromass. In a fertile soil, r-strategies predominate, in a medium soil K-strategies and in a poor soil L-strategies ( Panikov, 2010 ). Recently, Liang et al. (2019a) showed that theproportion of necromass in SOC varies with soil and land use with propor-tions over 50% for cropland, around 36% for grassland and about 22 to38% in temperate forest soils ( Liang et al., 2019b ;Ni et al., 2020 ). The bac-terial necromass contribution to SOM have been shown to increases withdepth in grassland and forest soils. However, this pattern might be alteredby soil management as opposite ﬁndings have been presented for croplandsoils ( Wang et al., 2021 ). In addition, formation and consumption ofnecromass are also in ﬂuenced by soil pH, bulk density, mean annual tem-perature and even historical precipitation ( Buckeridge et al., 2020 ;Zhanget al., 2021 ). This leads to the conclusion that the necromass contributionto SOM can be altered by management practices affecting the microbialcommunity structure and activity ( Buckeridge et al., 2020 ).Microbial remains are not resistant to degradation, so their persistencemust result from stabilization processes occurring in the soil ( Kästner andMiltner, 2018 ). This stabilization has been explained by pile formationfrom dead cell envelope fragments ( Miltner et al., 2012 ) where cellular de-bris is arranged in a stable agglomerates that limit their accessibility forother microorganisms. It is noteworthy that some microbial groups producespeciﬁc defensive compounds preventing them for microbial uptake such aspolyhydroxy-alkanoic acids, but how these contribute to SOM formationremains unknown ( Condron et al., 2010 ). Despite the high importance ofmicroorganisms in SOM formation, experimental evidence for SMC in-volvement in SOM formation is still limited by methods using speci ﬁcm i -crobial biomarkers ( Kallenbach et al., 2016 ), hampering a comprehensiveand quantitative analysis of the microbial contribution to SOM stabiliza-tion. Recently, Liang et al. (2019a) came up with a framework to developquantitative assessments of microbial necromass from amino sugar data,and new quantitative insights are still on the way.2.2. Biological processes controlling soil carbon storageDecomposition includes the physical breakdown and biochemicaltransformation of complex organic molecules of dead materials into simplerorganic and inorganic molecules. During the formation of SOM, decompo-sition products of plant and microbial origin enter the soil, being subjectedto further decomposition and humi ﬁcation, which also involves the partic-ipation of SMC that further oxidize and assimilate SOM ( Robertson andPaul, 2000 ). Also, the amount of SOM accumulated depends not only onthe quantity and quality of organic matter inputs, but also on the physico-chemical environment and soil food web available ( Torri et al., 2014 ).For example, acidic pH and dried conditions delay SOM degradation(Saviozzi et al., 2014 ;Torri et al., 2014 ). Considering the contribution ofmicrobial necromass to SOM, changes in the environment affecting thesize, growth rate and productivity of SMCs may affect the stableFig. 2. Simpli ﬁed model for the formation of SOM from bacterial necromass and relationship between SMC and decomposition: (1) plant residues introduced into the soi la r eused by microorganisms for growth; (2) when substrates become limited as a result of microbial growth, microorganisms begin to starve and then die, an d their biomass isbroken down into fragments; (3) the result of the breakdown is, among other things, ﬂat fragments of cell walls that remain in the soil as necromass, which is partiallyconverted into SOM, by surviving microorganisms; (4) some of the fragments are reused by bacteria as substrate for growth; (5) diversity, abundance a nd activity of SMCinﬂuences the type of decomposition processes and their rate; (6) the amount and type of C in the soil affects microbial abundance and activity (according toMiltneret al., 2012 andCondron et al., 2010 ).S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 1529284accumulation of SOM ( Kallenbach et al., 2015, 2016 ). Furthermore, bioticorganic C undergoes transformations upon exposure to SMC, resulting inchemical stabilization ( Schimel and Schaeffer, 2012 ;Christensen, 2001 ).Incorporation of SOM-derived C into microbial biomass corresponded to in-creased enzyme activity, which is indicative of SOM co-metabolism(Shahbaz et al., 2017 ).In more detail, decomposition is primarily driven by activities of bacte-ria, actinomycetes, fungi and protozoa ( Condron et al., 2010 ), where bacte-ria dominate in the long term ( Malik et al., 2016 ). Approximately 10 –15%of the C decomposition can be directly attributed to soil organism's activity(Hopkins and Gregorich, 2009 ). Heterotrophs derive energy and C forgrowth from organic compounds. They can be divided into microorganismsthat use labile organic matter (known as zymogenic biomass) and those thatdecompose more resistant, older forms of C (known as autochthonous bio-mass). Heterotrophs have been identi ﬁed as the organisms that control andregulate SOM decomposition, nutrient cycling and energy ﬂow (Schmidtet al., 2011 ;Han et al., 2016 ;Table 1 ).The microbial community can play multiple roles in SOM breakdownand C sequestration. Microorganisms play a key role in two critical, contrast-ing mechanisms: not only reducing SOC stocks through decomposition butalso increasing SOC stocks through the formation of microbial biomassand stabilization of its residues associated with minerals, within soil struc-tures, or by incrustation with Fe or Si precipitates ( Kästner and Miltner,2018 ;Liang et al., 2016 ;Kallenbach et al., 2015 ). In addition, abiotic and bi-otic factors affect the abundance, activity and composition of the SMC(Furtak and Ga łązka, 2019 ) and they on their turn affect the decompositionof SOM ( Ekschmitt et al., 2008 ;Fig. 1 ). For example, strong relationships be-tween SOM, clay content, bacterial biomass and hydrolytic enzyme activitieshave been found ( Wilkerson and Olapade, 2020 ) though a change in SOMonly has not necessarily huge impacts on microbial diversity ( Patersonet al., 2007 ;Webster et al., 2000 ). Others showed that carbon inputs varyingin composition altered the soil microbial diversity and that this diversity wasmore important in controlling C decomposition rates than their abundance(Jiang et al., 2008 ;Shahbaz et al., 2017 ;Table 1 ). Plant diversity also affectsthe composition of SMCs as well as their s patial distribution due their impacton soil porosity. This subsequently cha nges the spatial distribution of SMCsand their impact on carbon contents and bulk densities affecting C stocks(Kravchenko et al., 2019 ). Plant-soil-microbiome interactions are thereforeidenti ﬁed as responsible for SCS ( Kravchenko et al., 2019 ).The amount of C used for microbial growth relative to total C uptake,also called Carbon Use Ef ﬁciency (CUE), has an effect on microbial residueproduction ( Kallenbach et al., 2015 ). When CUE increases, more C is con-sumed for biomass synthesis, which increases carbon stabilization(Kallenbach et al., 2016 ). It is assumed that C storage is possible whenthe metabolic energy required to decompose organic matter introducedinto the soil is greater than the energy gained from catabolism occurringin microbial cells ( Torri et al., 2014 ). The CUE of the microbial communityis affected by the quality of the organic residues applied ( Roller andSchmidt, 2015 ). For example, highly reduced C substrates are usually asso-ciated with high CUE but it can also be used by copiotrophs that have a nat-urally low CUE ( Geyer et al., 2016 ). Sugars, starch and simple proteins aredegraded most rapidly, followed by proteins, hemicelluloses and cellulosewhereas lignins and fats are broken down the slowest. For the most easilydegradable substrates the highest CUE values are observed (~70 –75%),while for less degradable substrates of lower quality, e.g., oxalic acid, theCUE is lower (~3 –4,5%) ( Frey et al., 2013 ).Much of the C in soils comes from labile compounds processed by SMCand stabilized as residues in so called organomineral complexes ( Miltneret al., 2012 ). Increases in C stocks are largely dependent on the fate ofnewly added C rather than the degradation of native SOM ( Lange et al.,2015 ). High SMC activity triggered by organic matter inputs might triggermineralization of this native SOM ( Soriano-Disla et al., 2010 ), a processoften referred as the “priming effect ”(Dalenberg and Jager, 1989 ), in par-ticular in soil with low clay content. Microbial necromass and other micro-bial by-products can be selectively preserved through interactions with soilminerals like clay and incorporation into soil aggregates ( Kallenbach et al.,2016 ;Heckman et al., 2013 ). Through the formation of organo-mineralcomplexes or the compression of substances in small soil pores, the organicmatter becomes inaccessible to microorganisms and their enzymes ( Sixet al., 2002 ).2.3. Physical processes affected by SMC controlling soil carbon storageSoil structure and soil organic matter are interlinked and sensitive tocrop and soil management. Soil structure is formed by soil aggregates andthese are the secondary particles (structural units) formed through the com-bination of mineral particles with organic and/or inorganic binding agents.Microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)- containing polysaccha-rides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids - can enrich and boost up the aggre-gate stability ( Costa et al., 2018 ). The heterogeneous composition of EPSenables the SMC for being dehydrated and provides the necessary resistanceagainst different agricultural operations. Due to its chemical nature EPSmight serve as an adhesive compound, adhering to clay and ions andthereby binding ﬁne particles tightly together ( Shanmugam and Abirami,2019 ), while acting as a growth medium fo r other soil microorganisms too(Wang et al., 2015 ). Biological aggregating age nts such as extracellular poly-saccharides, fungal mycelia, hyphae and glycoproteins produced by micro-organisms stimulate the formation of stable aggregates ( Tang et al., 2011 ;Barbosa et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, the aggregate size distributionalso controls the colony development of bacterial and fungal communities(Ai et al., 2018 ;Bai et al., 2020 ;Fig. 3 ), thereby affecting the C decomposi-tion and stabilization ( Pathan et al., 2021 ). Hence, the SMC in ﬂuences soilaggregation by i) building a bridge and c hanging surfaces to facilitate aggre-gate formation, ii) separating organo-mineral complexes to inhibit furtherentrance into aggregates, and iii) binding of soil particles via releasedextra- and intracellular single-stranded DNA ( Pathan et al., 2021 ).Bacterial and fungal communities are spatially distributed in soils fol-lowing aggregate size (Tong et al., 2019) thereby affecting their potentialto alter C stabilization. Recently, Zheng et al. (2021) revealed thatmicroaggregates contain more bacteria than macroaggregates, with nomajor interaction between the bacterial and fungal communities. Soil ag-gregates fractions have often separate microenvironments subjugated bydistinct microbiota, and the con ﬁgurations of these microbial groups mayvary ( Ruamps et al., 2011 ) due to resource availability and speciesTable 1Selected SOM elements and SMC-derived enzymes involved in their transformation.SOM component Enzyme involved in transformation Source of enzyme ReferencesCelluloseHemicellulosesCellulases cellobiohydrolasesglucosidaseshemicellulasesFungi (eg.

Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 1529285requirements. Large macro-aggregates contain greater number of gram-positive bacteria and Eukaryotes compared to other aggregates ( Briaret al., 2011 ), and small macroaggregates may favor fungal populations(Tong et al., 2019) affecting SOC accumulation in soils ( Zhang et al.,2018 ). Not all microbial populations have the same capacity to form steadyaggregates ( Liang et al., 2019a ;Lehmann et al., 2020 ;Table 3 ) due to var-iation in biopolymer production and necromass growth. Likewise, Fokomet al. (2012) found SCS is highly correlated with glomalin (glycoprotein)and stable aggregates content in soil (r2=0 . 7 6 , P<0.01). Glomalin asso-ciated with AMF has a huge potential to promote macroaggregates forma-tion through concurrently binding of microaggregates ( Wilson et al.,2009 ). Soils that contain higher glomalin content may have more water sta-ble aggregates ( Table 2 ). High levels of microaggregates however may limitthe necromass induced SCS ( Luan et al., 2021 ). Large macro-aggregates arealso less stable and can be easily broken down into small macro-aggregatesand then into micro-aggregates.Aggregate turnover, being de ﬁned as the destruction and production ofaggregates, is very important for SCS si nce it determines the C stabilizationon the long term. Aggregate turnover is inextricably linked with rhizospherepriming effect (RPE) and soils can be managed in such a way that both arestimulated to increase C sequestration ( Wang et al., 2020a ;Murugan et al.,2019 ).Huo et al. (2017) stated RPE might augment SOC mineralizationrate by 59%. The reasons behind such a higher rate might be higher micro-bial activity, biomass turnover and accelerated evapotranspiration ( Cheng,2009 ;He et al., 2020 ). As mentioned, the SMC controls aggregate turnoverand hence affects the C sequestration rate ( Fig. 3 ).Wilson et al. (2009) dis-covered an 85% increase in water stable macroaggregates along with im-proved SCS as a result of improved AMF hyphal abundance during a 24-year experiment in prairie soils. Changes in SCS can be attributed to AMF'sincreased weathering capabilities ( Verbruggen et al., 2021 ). Raising theprevalence of the Basidiomycota fungal division and the Mortierellomycotaphylum in aggregates has been proposed as a possible C sink (Tong et al.,2019). Taskin et al. (2021) demonstrated that microbial species diversity(Bradyrhizobium spp.) correlates with s tabilized C within macroaggregates,whereas Chen et al. (2017) showed that improved macroaggregation is thecentral nexus for increasing total organic C ( Chen et al., 2017 ).3. Inﬂuence of agricultural practices on SMC and associated CsequestrationAgricultural practices change the soil microbiome and also modi ﬁes theassociated microenvironment conducive to the composition, abundanceand activity of SMC and associated SCS. Agricultural land use affects soilC content and cycling either positively or inhibitively. Additionally, astudy by Tscharntke et al. (2012) showed that there are about 1000 speciesof microorganisms in natural soil not cultivated for agriculture, and about140 –150 species in 1 g of agricultural soil. Studies show that in agriculturalsoils the number of functioning taxonomic units (OTUs) can be up to 30%lower than in uncultivated soils ( Woli ńska et al., 2017 ). In this section theﬁve most relevant agronomic practices affecting soil quality, SMC andSCS are evaluated.3.1. Conventional versus organic farmingPonge et al. (2013) demonstrated conventional agricultural activitieshave extensive impact on SMC i.e., increasing intensity (i.e., increased useFig. 3.

Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 1529286of fertilizers and plant protection products, deep ploughing, use of high-performance machinery) caused decreasing species richness and diversityof soil biota ( Table 4 ). In addition, taxonomic and phylogenetic richness, di-versity and heterogeneity may decrease in conventional farming systems(Lupatini et al., 2017 ). It is evident that row-crop systems with covercrops can accumulate C even under very intensive cultivation ( Kallenbachet al., 2015 ;Syswerda et al., 2011 ), while some vigorous cropping systemsmay increase C very slowly despite large additions of organic substancesand no disturbance ( Sprunger and Philip Robertson, 2018 ;Chimentoet al., 2016 ). Organic manure addition is helpful for the proliferation ofSMC, it substantially changes the SMC composition ( Ponge et al., 2013 ), ul-timately, improves SCS. In research by Pulleman et al. (2006) the total SOMcontent was 15, 24 and 46 g kg−1in conventional, organic and grasslandﬁelds, respectively.According to the European Commission, 2022 ,t h et e r m “organic farm-ing”is used to de ﬁne agriculture which aims to minimize human impact onthe environment while maintaining the natural functionality of the agricul-tural system ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming- ﬁsheries/farming/organic-farming/organics-glance_en ). Practices used in organic farming in-clude crop rotation, use of crop diversity, animal and plant combinations,organic fertilizers and biopreparations ( Abdelrahman et al., 2020 ). It is hy-pothesized that these practices in the long term can result in an increase oforganic C and N in soil. The area of organic crops in the world is increasingyear by year. In organic farming, production aims to close nutrient cycleswhere plant and animal residues are returned to the soils. This improvessoil quality through the accumulation of organic matter in the soil. Severalresearches have reported positive effects of organic farming on soil quality,including SMC abundance and activity ( Lori et al., 2017 ).Santos et al.(2012) showed that organic farming increased by 100 –300% the contentof the soil microbial biomass. The use of organic fertilizers, including ma-nure, increases the number of bacteria that break down organic matter(Hartmann et al., 2015 ). Organic system can increase the abundance of mi-croorganisms in soil, especially fungi including Cladosporium sp. and Mucorsp., which can inhibit pathogen growth in the soil ( Tautges et al., 2016 ). Or-ganic farming system has the potential to increase the taxonomic, phyloge-netic and heterogeneous richness of soil microbes compared to theconventional system ( Lupatini et al., 2017 ;Hartmann et al., 2015 ).Bonanomi et al. (2016) even concluded that organic farming can improvethe soil microbial balance previously damaged by conventional farming.Summarizing, this type of farming is bene ﬁcial to improve SMC structure,composition and diversity in soils owing to the decreased or even no useof chemical compounds. However, increases in SOM or fractional C as a re-sult of organic practices are usually evident after long-term application(Yang et al., 2019b ). After 21 years of organic farming in Switzerland, itwas found to reduce SOM losses over time, and biomass and SMC activityincreased ( Fließbach et al., 2007 ). A long-term study in eastern Nebraskaon rainfed soils found the greatest changes in N and organic C (SOC) levelsin the soil pro ﬁle in soils with low initial SOM content ( Varvel and Wilhelm,2011 ). This is related to the sudden introduction of additional fresh organicmatter. Organic farming which is known for utilizing less or even nochemical inputs during crop production show favorable condition to SMCby augmenting the abundance and diversity of SMC because of higherSOM, SOC and TN contents ( Düring et al., 2002 ;L e i t ee ta l . ,2 0 1 0 ;Santoset al., 2012 ).3.2. TillageTillage is the age-old practice of cultivating soils. Different tillagepractices are advocated globally since tillage practices may exert stronginﬂuence on SMC ( Zhang et al., 2012 ;Wang et al., 2020b ;Mbuthia et al.,2015 ) and associated C sequestration ( Li et al., 2019 ); even, non-signiﬁcant impact has been reported ( Schlatter et al., 2017 ). Tillage mainlydisrupts soil aggregates ( Jiang et al., 2011 ) and aggregates are the habitatsof soil microbial communities. As for example, conventionally tilled (CT)soils may have 32% less MBC content and 40 –60% less AMF compared toNT soils ( Helgason et al., 2010 ). Again, copiotrophs are an important ele-ment of soil C cycles and also contribute to the higher microbial C use ef ﬁ-ciency ( Yaghoubi Khanghahi et al., 2020 ).Pulleman et al. (2006) showedthat after 70 years, SOM content and mineralization decreased as a resultof tillage and arable cropping compared to pasture, but were signi ﬁcantlyhigher in organic than in conventional farming. Liu et al. (2016) reportedin Australian calcisol, chisel tillage, which using a heavy duty cultivatorwith special spring or ﬁxed tines (reduced tillage), has a greater effect ontopsoil than NT (without disturbing the soil) because it raises MBC by34%, abundance of copiotrophic bacterial group e.g., Firmicutes sp., disac-charides, and sugar alcohol by 75%, 114%, 37%, 178%, and 167%, respec-tively. Schmidt et al. (2018) concluded that NT may increase bacterial andarchaeal populations and diversity across the whole soil pro ﬁle over CT.Also, the microbial communities remain tillage stress-resistant. Zhanget al. (2018) reported NT soils may contain 30% higher gram-positive bac-teria, 12% higher gram-negative bacteria, 72% higher fungi, and 45%lower actinobacteria over CT. Contrarily, CT may favor copiotrophic bacte-ria whereas NT favors oligotrophic bacteria ( Degrune et al., 2017 ).Kabiriet al. (2016) indicate that reduced tillage has a positive effect on soil micro-bial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) compared to CT. Thesestudies indicate that NT shows more obvious input to the abundance,Table 3Some selected soil microbial genus, species and associated strains involved in aggregation process.Genus Strain(s) Nature Species Role Reference(s)Rhizobium KYGT207 Bacterial R. sullae Water stable aggregates formation Kaci et al.

NT remains more preferable for SMC, though it maydepend on speci ﬁc pedo-climatic conditions. NT equipped with organicamendments may improve microbial community diversity and stability(Wang et al., 2017 ). Additionally, as compared to CT, strip tillage (ST) is as-sociated with higher bacteria by 49%, effective bacteria by 27%, active andtotal fungi by 37%, and nematodes by 275% ( Leskovar et al., 2016 ). A studybyBailey et al. (2002) showed that tilled soils had lower fungal activity andlower C content than soils managed to native or no-till systems. In addition,the C content correlated with fungal activity in all tested samples.3.3. Crop rotationCrop rotation (CR) alters the soil microbial parameters and thereby themicrobes associated C sequestration. Venter et al. (2016) reported CR canenhance microbial richness and diversity by 15 and 3.4%, respectively.Wheat-soybean rotation may improve AMF, zoosporic fungi and sac fungi(Guo et al., 2020 ;Ai et al., 2018 ). Soybean-wheat rotation may reduce mi-crobial richness and diversity as opposed to wheat-wheat rotation ( Yinet al., 2010 ). Rice-maize-mungbean rotation may enhance soil bacteria(e.g., Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloro ﬂexi, Verrucomicrobia) compo-sition, abundance and diversity compared to rice-rice-rice rotation ( Xuanet al., 2012 ). This type of variation under different crop rotation practicesmight cause ﬂuctuations in soil C storage and its varied utilization bySMC. Venter et al. (2016) stated that inclusion of legumes in CR, particu-larly, may not in ﬂuence SMC diversity or richness ( Venter et al., 2016 ).ButBorase et al. (2020) found after a long-term CR practice including le-gumes that it increased SOC stock, MBC and soil enzymatic activities(acid/alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and arylsulfatase). Similarly,the legume-AMF and rhizobia symbiosis acts as a barrier, decreasing the ef-fect of agricultural operations on SMC ( Schmidt et al., 2017 ). Therefore, in-clusion of legumes in CR might be helpful to conserve the SMC. Differentcrops and weeds exhibit allelopathic impacts on SMC. As a result, SMC inthe rhizosphere varies ( Costa et al., 2006 ). But this is not widely investi-gated. In a study with alligator weed widely grown in Brazil, Ge et al.(2018) indicated allelochemicals secretion from this species could decreasethe soil enzymatic activity also, the relative abundance of SMC. These secre-tions may also inhibit the germination of crop species. Contrarily, Meinerset al. (2017) found suf ﬁcient abundance of SMC could avert the allelopathicpotential of plants, speci ﬁcally, by increasing germination around 25 –54%.3.4. Cover cropsCover cropping (CC) is a proven means for optimized SCS. Poeplau andDon (2015) estimated CC can contribute to 0.12 Pg C year−1. Since SMCregulates crop residue breakdown and CC can add more residue C in soil(Sainju et al., 2007 ). For this season CC can exert signi ﬁcant contributionin the soil microbial parameters i.e., colony structure, MBC, MBN, PLFA,abundance, diversity and activity of soil organisms ( Kim et al., 2020 ). Effectof some selected CC on the abundance of different soil microbes are pre-sented in Fig. 4 . CC may increase total PLFA. MBC, MBN contents by 24,40 and 54%, respectively while soil total bacteria and fungi may rise7–31% ( Muhammad et al., 2021 ). CC's actual impact on MBC, MBN andPLFA contents may vary according to the climatic conditions, e.g., meta-analysis performed by Kim et al. (2020) revealed MBC, MBN was highestunder tropical conditions while greater PLFA contents observed in temper-ate zones, but, continental climate produced lower MBC, MBN and PLFAunder CC. Inclusion of CC under temperate and tropical climatic conditionsmay induce 18.7% and 7.2% SOC stock changes, respectively ( Jian et al.,2020 ).Hallama et al. (2019) suggested combining CC establishment withother management activities such as tillage to optimize the CC's effect onsoil microbiological attributes. However, bene ﬁts from CC on soilmicrobiome may be hindered in case of continental climate, NT systemsor after chemical elimination from the ﬁeld. ( Kim et al., 2020 ).3.5. Fertilization &manure additionFertilization is an important aspect of agriculture. Different fertilizationmodes (synthetic fertilizers or organic addition) may cause variations in soilnutrients, pH, and soil microorganisms over the long term, ultimately, in ﬂu-ence the production and decomposition of SOC by microbial communities(Neumann et al., 2013 ;Lupatini et al., 2013 ;Williams et al., 2013 ;Beauregard et al., 2010 ). Fertilization and manure incorporation are morelikely to affect the microbial community composition. In rice ﬁelds, for ex-ample, it was found that both mineral and organic fertilization led to in-creases in MBC content of 29 and 61% sequentially over the unfertilisedcontrol. ( Geisseler et al., 2017 ). Across all studies, mineral fertilizer doesnot seem to have lasting negative effects on soil microorganisms. In along-term experiment in an alpine pasture by Yuan et al. (2020) and col-leagues revealed P addition could avert the decomposition rate of SOM,also, can increase particulate organic carbon (POC 9.1%) because ofFig. 4. Effect of cover crops on abundance of different soil microbes (Data from Finney et al., 2017 ).S.S. Bhattacharyya et al. Science of the Total Environment 815 (2022) 1529288lower fungal biomass. They also found N &P addition can substantiallyalter the soil microbial parameters e.g., decreased MBC, MBN and PLFAs.Similar results were previously reported by Li et al. (2018) . P fertilizationinhibits the soil microbial (bacteria, fungi, AMF) activity, but, no effect ondiversity and richness ( Beauregard et al., 2010 ). N fertilization in sub-alpine meadow may inhibit species richness, increase MBC, augment SOCdecomposition, and decrease SCS ( Li et al., 2016 ). SOC breakdown derivedfrom N fertilization might be linked with the action of extracellularenzymes. Jian et al. (2016) observed that N fertilization would change com-bined hydrolase enzyme activities, potentially reducing MBC. Microorgan-isms' susceptibility to long-term fertilization might be reduced with clayfractions because of high buffering ability, shielding microbial cells from al-terations even after a century ( Neumann et al., 2013 ).The in ﬂuence of organic matter supply on the contribution of SMC tosoil C regulation can be explained in several ways:(1) Higher organic matter additions may increase decomposition and re-duce C storage through reduced microbial C use ef ﬁciency ( Manzoniet al., 2012 );(2) Higher organic matter additions, inputs of labile C or nutrients result-ing in either enhanced mineralization of SOM in soil, which is calledapositive priming effect (Fontaine et al., 2007 ;Hicks et al., 2019 );(3) Higher additions of organic matter can increase C skimming throughincreased accumulation of microbial necromass over time ( Lianget al., 2011 ).Organic fertilization may reduce the relative abundance of bacterialcommunities in all aggregates, while increasing the fungal population inmacroaggregates Again, organic fertilization can decrease bacterial com-munity abundances while increasing fungal populations, resulting in SCSin soil aggregates ( Tong et al., 2020 ). Manure and slurry can improveMBC both quantitatively and qualitatively e.g., Grunwald et al. (2016)found presence of average 356 mg MBC kg−1of soil. Since MBC ensureshigher stability of aggregates, such presence of MBC con ﬁrms their impor-tance in SCS. However, after a 33-year trial, Guo et al. (2020) found thatadding compost or manure, or combining compost with chemical fertil-izers, would increase the presence of Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroideteswhile also reducing agricultural management-related pressures on them.Bai et al. (2020) suggested after a 6 years experiment straw derived biocharmay favor diversity and richness of bacterial communities in topsoil andevenness in the whole soil pro ﬁle. Combination of biochar with chemicalfertilizer may induce fungal dominated microbial communities in tropicalsoils although it may result in increased MBC and MBN contents ( Oladeleet al., 2019 ). These studies suggest that SCS is highly dependent on fertili-zation, manure addition and also on SMC. In addition, the C content corre-lated with fungal activity in all tested samples ( Fig. 5 ).4. Conclusions and perspectivesWe conclude that optimizing soil and nutrient management for carbonsequestration while stimulating co-bene ﬁts for agronomy and environmentrequires a key role for the soil microbial community structure for severalreasons i.e., i) SMC is controlling the rate of C decomposition, ii) SMC iscontrolling formation of soil aggregates, thereby creating protected envi-ronments for C breakdown and altering the physical accessibility of organiccompounds for uptake within the root zone and iii) impact of agronomicmeasures is largely mediated by short and long-term dynamics of SMC.SOM is produced in soil from humus which is formed by the relentlessdecomposing activities of SMC on plant derived litters or other alike sub-stances. Agricultural operations tend to disrupt this incessant cycling ofSOM, consequently, pose a threat to other soil microbiological parameterscrucial for long-term C storage and SCS. We showed that SOM and SOC de-position, decomposition, transformation and stabilization are fully relianton SMC structure, abundance, composition, living and dead biomass pro-duction and associated EPS. Although the decomposition of SOM is mainlydependent on SMC, its rate is in ﬂuenced by numerous environmental fac-tors. These include natural factors such as temperature, humidity, oxygen,nutrient availability, as well as anthropogenic factors caused by soil man-agement - interference with the structure, fertilization, planting density.There are a number of interactions between all these factors and the micro-bial community, many of which have not been investigated to date. Forthese reasons, determining the unambiguous in ﬂuence of SMC on SOM dis-tribution is very dif ﬁcult, as it would require controlling/eliminating otherparameters ( Reed and Martiny, 2007 ).SOM SOC, soil aggregates act as themajor pathways of SCS and long-term C storage under diverse agriculturalpractices and this C storage potential of soils is determined by the SMC.Moreover, soil enzymes, EPS, and MBC (both live and dead) are the keycontributors in i) stabilizing C reservoirs and ii) creating stable aggregation,and all of these factors are closely connected with SMC. Wilson et al. (2009)found decrease in abundance of AMF because of agricultural activitiescaused poor soil aggregation, no alternative process could avert it. Again,approximately 5 Gt of anthropogenic C emission could be abated per yearthrough AMF ( Parihar et al., 2020 ). Role of such fungi or bacteria can't beunderestimated to mitigate the hazardous impact of climate change. Wesuggest reintroducing the decayed SMC, which can sustainably promotethe emergence of new species and their ﬂourishing establishment inagroecosystems. Since SOC is the most dominant component of SOM, wecan only expect long-term soil C storage if we have a strong SOM content,and this radical change could be real if we take care of the soil microbialcommunities. However, the following research questions should be takeninto consideration in future researches:1. how does spatial distribution of microbial biomass in soil affects soilstructure, porosity, effective turnover and C sequestration in soil?2. how can SMC attain resistance against various agricultural operations ifsufﬁcient amount of EPS degrading enzymes are present in soil?Fig. 5. Relationships between plant, microorganisms and C storage in soil(according to Lange et al., 2015 ): (1) Plant →C inputs: plant diversity increases theamount of C entering the soil ( Ravenek et al., 2014 ;Jiang et al., 2008 );(2) Plant →SMC activity: plant cover affects SMC (its activity, diversity)(Kravchenko et al., 2019 ;Torri et al., 2014 ); (3) C inputs →SMC activity: more Caffects SMC activity ( Manzoni et al., 2012 ;Fontaine et al., 2007 ); (4) C inputs →Cstorage: higher C input from biomass results in increased C storage ( Sollins et al.,1996 ); (5) SMC activity →C storage: SMC affects C storage through a variety ofprocess ( Kallenbach et al., 2015, 2016 ;Miltner et al., 2012 ;Schimel andSchaeffer, 2012 ;Liang and Balser, 2011 ); (6) C storage →SMC activity: higher soilC content increases SMC activity ( Nguyen and Marschner, 2016 ;Fontaine et al.,2007 ;Paterson et al., 2007 ).S.S.
